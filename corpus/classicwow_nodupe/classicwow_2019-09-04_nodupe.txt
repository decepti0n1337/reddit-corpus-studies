Ah okay, thanks for the info!
---
My long term goal is to get all the alliance classes to 60.  So I'm trying to get to a point of just playing the one with the most rested xp.  I'm not interested in the raiding scene though.
---
Big fan of the world of crogge animated series?
---
This has big creepypasta vibes
---
&gt; barring maybe dwarf priests
---
Even then it's only relevant for raids. In the few encounters where fear is a factor outside of raids, it's just a nice-to-have.
---
I'm level 29
---
While this is awesome - is there actually any reason to bring a level 1 character to Stormwind?  Alt bank?
---
I think the biggest gate to AQ40 and Naxx this time is going to be finding people to do it. Obviously this is anecdotal, but it really seems like a lot of the people coming back for classic are like me: people with jobs and kids and limited playtime. Yeah, I'll pug some MC and ZG, probably even get into BWL and AQ20. But I don't have the time to commit to a guild to run Naxx.
---
The best way to change somebody's attitude is some kindness. :))
---
You're just making me think of all my soul shards :(
---
People are just morons for lack of a better word. They want what they think will get the job done easiest. Just like gear score in retail.
---
So they have to loot the bodies that the other people have already looted, the quest item drops for everyone still but it won't show up for those that already have completed it.
---
Is this the barrens cat that only spawns at two specific times a day?
---
Arrows for hunters
---
I have lvled a priest to 28 just to come to the conclusion I want to play a rogue now 18. 
---
Hopefully i'm not rerolling again at 28.
---
More to the point: yes it's hard.
---
Bring in the class area's from legion!!
---
BLizzard has basically abandoned guild perks though, so they realized that is in a bad place at least.
---
Jeezus that guild name. Lmao
---
I thought he was joking about how you can never find him when you need him
---
OSRS voting system doesn't even work in OSRS. 25% of the playerbase basically hold the remaining 75% hostage and decide what content gets put in.
---
Easy to not care how shit drop rates are when you realize you have to grind a shit load of mobs after you finish the quests in the area just to be high enough for the next area.
---
That's true hey. But I hope they wouldn't turn my xp off for a whole month for it :p
---
\&gt;pictures people as literally *sitting* in queue watching it tick down
---
Or a paladin. This is my first time ever playing a pally and I'm loving it.
---
I have that whole run. It's pretty good. I really liked the Ashbringer series though.
---
Towards the end of vanilla they did.
---
looks like I triggered a bunch of circle jerkers due to downvotes lul
---
Twinks hate him!
---
But seriously, what an odd bug. Are you positive it's not a display glitch with an addon or something? Is the XP message appearing in the chat?
---
Haven’t played since wotlk. Bought WoW Classic after seeing all the hype and figured 15 bucks is more than worth a shot. 
---
In less than a week I had over 30 hours logged. I know that’s nothing compared to some
---
Hardcore players but it’s a lot for me. I stayed up way too late on more than one occasion and well yeah... the addiction is back.
---
I don't retail. The game is boring to me.
---
As an Orc Hunter, aka'magosh!
---
Wow. That's fucking sweet dude.
---
I’ve been using 2H weapons but axes specifically. So I just received a 2H sword from a quest but I cannot wield it because I lack proficiency.. I’m level 9 and as far as orgrimmar. Not sure what I need to do to be able to wield it. I’ve tried going to the warrior trainer in orgrimmar but can’t find the trait to train.
---
What a douche.
---
There's also a global Looking for group channel called LookingForGroup that can be joined by typing /join lookingforgroup
---
I agree with you, I'd say, 90%. There is 10% of me, though, that acknowledges that because ownership does pass around randomly that it's a widely used channel just waiting to get fucked over.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Essentially, people are given ownership of the channel in ways that are not good for a channel that's meant to be as big as a world chat. I had no part in creating the channel
---
There's a wagon too.
---
Meanwhile got 3 stacks of light leather and ready to level my leather working from 65 - 85
---
The vanilla leveling experience is a major part of what I miss in retail. I know some people only like the endgame...but I can't relate.
---
It should have ended with a screenshot in the camera app.
---
\*punts\*
---
If you vendor leather and ore, you're pulling silver into your server's economy.
---
I would buy cheap mats off the AH but I have no capital. It's hard enough affording skills as I level! Double gathering would have been wiser...
---
Horde or alliance, I'm casually leveling an undead warlock and would be up for some quests.
---
Doing good work man. Thanks.
---
That would make sense. Can definitely mitigate a lot of damage in a 1v1 with hamstring kiting.
---
 Nice strawman. 99.9% of people are not the face of classic wow and parading about classic purism for weeks on end
---
The death runs.
---
And what if they make versions for TBC, WotLK, etc.? Do they each get their own tabs?
---
No. Just no.
---
I’m doin the same with a warrior and hunter, no quests only mobs! 
---
So far my warrior is 42 and my hunter is 23
---
Grind hard!
---
Yeah would be great if I was level 19!
---
Yeah no purple floating XP number is coming from any creatures or in the combat logs.
---
The number 51277 is now etched in my brain as that's my current XP.
---
YEAH BFA IS SHIT

Elvui works for me - AND the weakaura for nameplate debuffs works as well. I had 2 going at once last night had to disable the weakaura.
---
It was scummy of Blizzard to take people's money and deliver a nearly unusable product.
---
Here is the big dirty secret about Reddit's Blizzard hate: they all they want is good Blizzard content to play.
---
Classic is a massive chunk of good content. When Reddit burns through that, it will be back to shit-talking Blizzard until they get another pacifier. Remember, everyone loved BFA for the first week of launch when they were going through the quests.
---
You do you and I'll do me
---
Yes!
---
as a lvl 28 mage i  have a headpiece with no stats should i buy a hat on the AH with +10int +6spirit for 1g or is that a waste?
---
Taking pictures of your monitor with your phone in 2019 LUL
---
Honestly this is a more reasonable scenario than GI Joe dps going ham and sniping mobs. You could try holding off on bigger dots at the start of the pull, though.
---
I mean, humans start off by genociding another local sentient species, killing criminal humans without due process, etc.
---
I went from hardly playing games for years to playing 14 hours on launch day.
---
poor af too
---
22 is doable since then u have all ur talents but 26 is optimal.
---
It used to sell for quite a large amount. I would hold onto it and any under 20 blues to sell in a few months when the economy stabilizes
---
2h swords are in undercity. There’s a zeppelin outside of the gates of orgrimmar due east that will take you there.
---
255 tailor. Can confirm.
---
It does if it influences blizzard. If enough people just smash their way to 60 then complain that the game sucks and quit, then blizz is less likely to undertake projects like this in the future. It's in everybody's interest to make sure the most people possible have a pleasant experience, and we're well aware that people are perfectly willing to be miserable and then complain later if it means being "efficient" or mimicking streamers.
---
Are you using TukUI? How’d you get your bars like that? I got the add on working but couldn’t find controls for changing the size/ scale of each action bar independently...
---
Using the unstuck feature and even killing yourself to ress at spirit healer is a great tool to skip some distances. You can go from the Barrens to Westfall if you kill yourself in "nowhere", if you climb up a mountain and get outside the zone
---
I'm playing horde on Skullflame EU, if your on EU servers we could quest.
---
O my christ, an epic! 
---
Fucking noice
---
Minor class tweaks to let certain classes be viable...though more specifically greater yank variety.
---
And mog, but that’s *solely* because I’m on a RP server. 
---
Frankly however none of these are deal breakers, just idle fantasizing.
---
They traded them with the dwarves for corn. They then shot them and took the corn.
---
Limited mobility. Having to talk everywhere (and seemingly further for every quest) was a major downside for me choosing warlock, but I really like the pacing it sets for the world. It's impractical to rush anywhere, which helps to keep me in my nostalgia mindset instead of the hyper-efficiency retail has bred into me
---
I haven’t had any issues playing. Anyone mad at queues is shouting themselves in the foot and need to get over it. I’m sorry you had such a bad experience in the very first few days of this new game that tens of thousands of people were trying to play at the same time.
---
:(
---
Sell it quick before the suckers move back to retail.

Refreshing to see someone who actually knows what they're talking about

You need to go to a weapons trainer, not your class trainer. If I remember correctly, city guards can tell you where to find them and which ones (meaning which cities) to go to for specific weapons
---
Isn't Karma useless as long as you aren't a troll?
---
Saw a "you need 75 karma to post here" message when I first joined Reddit, then never came up again.
---
the worst part is we don't get a free mount!
---
It was bad. Badass. Duh dun tis.
---
Meeeeeee.
---
You have to go to a weapon master, not your class trainer. See [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-weapon-skills#weapon-master-locations) for a list of all of their locations and which weapons they train.

Hhahah funny thing. I started Vanilla back in the day to enjoy a hobby my now husbands enjoys. Ever since we have been gaming with each other =3
---
could wait if thats the case. 5 levels doesnt sound like alot but it is for me :D
---
No shit, right? I couldn't play much of anything for more than a couple hours except for the occasional single-player like Witcher 3. I expect I'll be dumping time into Cyberpunk 2077, too.
---
Probably a large number of people not returning due to queues rather than just rerolling someplace else

Is this the beta wow client?
---
Playing a human mage named Jaina has been a goal of mine ever since I first arrived in Theramore after a long night of gaming back when I first played the game during the closed beta. I only once managed to grab the name on a retail realm when it was released back in TBC, but soon after stopped playing the game.   
---
I so far was unsuccessful on Classic, but last week when the EU realm Bloodfang was released I got lucky and managed to reserve the name. Looking forward to many adventures.
---
I had a good start taking Wed-Friday off last week and got my warrior to 30. Now things are going to start slowing down a lot more and I ain't mad. The next 30 levels are going to be a wonderful slog.
---
Yes, he is my pet in Classic and he’s flamboyant.
---
Not to mention its a full on world. Like FFXIV is retails main contender rn but its nothing like WoW on map scope. You have loading screens going into each new area, WoW you can run from one tip of the continent to the other without a single screen.

Shared quest items would be a mistake, it would ruin the balance between solo/duo leveling.
---
I just have to say, for those of us who have been advocating for this game for years, played it originally in 2004-2006 and lost interest in WoW soon after, and subsequently discovered private servers at some point, *can we please not do this.*
---
This is how it starts... first you make quests a little easier by sharing quest item drops on all quests, then you make travel a little easier by allowing mount purchase at level 30, and then a few years pass and more changes and sooner or later you have retail.
---
The whole point of "no changes" is to not start down that slippery slope.
---
Blizzard nailed the spirit of no changes. They did great. Can those of you who just joined this community please respect that and not start advocating for changes to Classic.
---
My biggest gripe  is paladins who are specced Holy or Prot needing on gear in dungeons for their off-spec that could be used by the people in the dungeon.  Example, I'm leveling an arms warrior and I'm constantly getting Paladins that are actually specced Holy or Prot needing on gear in SM Armory. Had a prot paladin need on ravager so he could use it in 5 levels when he decides to respect to Ret. I've played since early BC and this was ALWAYS seen as rude behavior. What changed?
---
What if people CoD'd him/her?
---
It isn't as easy as adding another confirmation box there.
---
Believe me or not but World of Warcraft is really a complex game. Even adding a single spell to the game has so many effects to hundred things, you can't think of every possibility at this stage.
---
But yes lol they should make us be able to delete our characters even if we have mails. I just wanted to point out the programmers gonna have a huge pain in their ass making these *little changes*
---
Yeah I have a couple blues in my bank that I bought because the market is over saturated right now. I would say in a month or two when people start clearing MC and Onyxia regularly. They will get bored and switch to twinks
---
Dont Even complain little one !
---
Yeah, baffled me as well.
---
I’m fully aware people have different opinions. I’m talking about the dominating voice on the sub going from “fuck Blizz” to “give Blizz some credit”.
---
You think you want it but you don't.
---
You can't see players in other layers, only the ones in the same as you.
---
You sure love to pretend like you are some psuedo intellectual in all ways Classic wow but you didn't even know the most popular website that parses for it are submitted to, which was literally the highest google result if you just search classic wow leaderboards. 2k parses is again nothing, but you have never parsed yourself before and looked into it so you assume 2k is alot. I mean you thought warcraft logs was a specifically chinese fucking website for fucks sake, obviously you have never looked into this shit before. 
---
Optimizing on retail has depth whether you like to admit it or not, there are real mechanics happening and getting the best rotation possible during those mechanics is a fun way to track player skill improvement. Classic is spamming 100 strings of frostbolts and hoping your gear drops so you get better dps next week. You talk about it like it is all so easy, I would love to see what parses you have ever done in any of these games, but I'm sure you have none. 
---
Now you are randomly bringing up twitch viewership which is completely unrelated and heavily influenced by many other factors. But your dick is too hard for your 1 button PVE to match each bosses 1 mechanic that you can finally take part in, that it is all you can think about. 
---
&gt; You don't know shit about this game, literally nothing, you wouldn't looked up mage dps post BWL if you did since their damage accumulates on their ignite, so whats your deal mate? Whats your agenda?
---
You are just so heavily invested in this entire debate it is hilarious to see how quick you break down and scream insults to try to drown out any discussion. You pretend to be some expert in classic and at the same time have never taken a look into any stats that you talk about for even 2 seconds. I'm sorry this game has so much emotional control over you, hope you get some help you need and find some people who you can pretend to be a big deal with :)
---
anyone with 15 minutes can set it up to queue with their phone from work.

Separate from craptivision

One of the worst thing is when someone does take aggro they run AWAY from you. How am I supposed to help you now?
---
I'll be doing this when I get around to leveling alts.  Rotating between 3-4 of them and keeping them all on rested XP.  But for my main, it's balls-to-the-wall leveling.
---
I mean, there was
---
But there were also really good multi tree specs, stuff like elemental mage (pyro/blast wave + shatter) and prot healer paladin
---
Stuff that's simply not possible to do these days in retail
---
When bgs release demand will skyrocket
---
Clunky addons maybe?
---
I did this and it’s taken up a good amount of time to get mining and skinning up. Not really making any money off either at the moment but am saving up some mats to do engineering later
---
I bought her an account and gametime years ago and then we broke up. So I have an extra account
---
I'd also add that its way less crowded now in the starting zones than on day 1-4. Helps on issue #3- at least you're not competing to tag the mob.
---
You can definitely skip zones, but usually you only do that if you do a lot of grinding or dungeon running.
---
Or reduce the hour-long queues for those of us who arranged for our entire guilds to get on the servers they initially put up and are now stuck on.
---
LOL
---
I live in New Zealand and play est server so don’t need to worry about queues usually once the kid is asleep. Maybe check out Remote Desktop so you can queue a bit earlier and have it rdy for 8
---
The thing is, your first ability that functions off weapon damage is at level 12, and your first one that really matters is at level 20. HE's level 24. 
---
Overpower not only is less likely to proc when it's on cooldown when you are swinging a 3.5 speed weapon, but you can also "fish" for overpowers using sunder armor, hamstring, and rend, and in those cases, those fishes are just way more impactful when you have a big slow 2 hander. Parry haste is also 24% of a weapon swing whenever you parry... so having a really slow weapon is obviously more damage.
---
Cleave is 20 rage, plus the rage from an auto, but it gives you like 10 damage plus your autoattack damage.  It's much stronger with a slower weapon.
---
THe big one is at 30 though. Sweeping strikes gives you 5 autos for 6 rage each, every 30 seconds. That's just hugely important. It's by MILES the best dps ability you have. It beats everything, indcluding whirlwind. But "how much damage it does" scales very hard with "how much do you auto for". 
---
There is merit to having a very fast weapon at extremely low levels, as it makes heroic strike more efficient, but also lets you do more burst damage against hard pulls by dumping your entire rage pool in a few seconds to heroic strike. 
---
But by about 22, you just stop heroic striking.
---
I leveled a %%%%% 1-60 in vanilla and it was awful.
---
As an enhancement shaman where 95% of my damage is auto attack. I don't know how I could do less.

It doesn't seem to be working for me atm

yeah I bought a $1200 Lenovo gaming laptop for $350. The guy listed it for 600 too. just try to make deals, you'll find something suitable. just make sure if you buy used to check the "this PC" properties to make sure the hardware advertised is installed. good luck!!

Dying...

Dying so fkin much and then having to run forever to get back and then waiting on a timer to be able to rez.

Dying in wotlk was rare and no big deal, flying mounted ghost...
---
I feed my Succubus fresh Gnome, cuz she is such a good girl.
---
Oh yeah. My wife is currently back to school, so after the kids are asleep (currently listening to my wife read them a story), I get to game while she studies. Been nothing but WoW Classic since release. I am on Old Blanchy (Prefer PVE no queue). Love my current situation though, I even show my babes (6 year old girl, 3 year old boy) my toons and they love it, but I keep game time to when they are asleep or out of the house.
---
Elite village in Silverpine. Forces you to group with people. Great times have been had.
---
Fairly sure in vanilla there was XP during BGs.
---
But they haven’t opened up BGs for play yet so hard to confirm. 
---
the point people are making about turning off XP bar is moot, because that feature didn’t come till wayyyy later. 
---
Heirlooms aren’t a thing neither.

Aliasing is a concept within signal processing that basically refers to measuring a cyclic signal (e.g. waveform or in this case the run animation that loops continuously) at an insufficient rate. In the video, it appears the character isn’t making any motion and yet he’s clearly running - that’s because we’re seeing (‘measuring’) only 1 frame of each animation. 
---
For a signal processing example, say you have a basic sine wave and want to graph its value at a rate of 1 point per wavelength (let’s say the peak of the wave). Your graph would look like a straight line! If you instead graphed its value an at each infinitely small x intervals of the sine wave, your new graph would be the sine wave perfectly copied over.

Why are you in Mulgore? More importantly, how did you manage to get to a Zep without getting murdered?

I built a freakin computer...to play a 15 year old game. Not because I needed a new computer, but so I can finally live my 14 yr old selfs dream of playing WoW on a beast machine with a 37” led monitor... Yeaaa I’m relapsing slowly lol

“Nothing much, what’s up with you?!”

I have to work this weekend, and I'm excited that Hurricane Dorian is hitting on Friday, so that if I lose power I'll be at work instead of missing out on playing WoW in my free time.

Receiving end as in Anonymizes's realm would have incoming players.

Ragin kiddo
---
I go back to work on Thursday after two weeks off almost and I'm in serious denial about having to continue my mundane routine in life. Help.
---
Come on it’s getting out of hand on this subreddit , use print screen
---
Why are you super disappointed. Battlegroup-wide BG queues were a thing in Vanilla.
---
And since gaming gear provided macro functions are supported and endorsed by game - every Razer, Corsair, Roccat or Logitech made macros are as, or even more, legit as this.  
---
Before you go crying a river ask yourselves: are macros, made in Razer Synapse, for Razer Naga, legal in game?
---
I think he meant the guys in voice chat.
---
Are you sure you were here? There was no end of comments on threads saying layering would destroy Classic, or Blizz are idiots for not opening more servers for launch. Just because you didn’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not there.
---
didn’t read the sub name and thought this was really weirdly about retirement
---
Dude... Keep it as a twink and roll a new toon lol.
---
From the link above:
---
&gt;As of patch 1.9, each capital city has its own Auction House.
---
There was only 1 AH per faction, and the 2 neutral Gadgetzon and BB when the game launched.  I actually only played Vanilla for a few months and then quit when I got to max level.  When I came back for BC it was so weird that Stormwind was considered the main city when everyone was always in IF when I had left.
---
Just gotta make sure they don’t create major imbalances by already imbalanced factions leaving servers. They should limit it to the heavier faction on these servers if the difference is more then say 10%
---
Agree 100% with all of this. I loved BC, but it was a completely different feeling game and I want more content with the feeling of vanilla. And yeah, flying in Azeroth killed that big world feel.
---
I used to do this in Wrath all the time, I can't remember exactly how it was done but it was something like jumping to one side and then hitting the opposite direction at exactly the moment you land.  
---
Thinking about it now, that may have been client side only, but it looked it funny enough and I had it down to an art that I did it everywhere.
---
I meant in the context of Classic.
---
We have done the end game before. Just relax and enjoy some classic!

Idk man, I've been looking at a few guides, both the drain tank guid and the one made by the warloc discord, and both say that talent is basically useless. Drain soul rank 1 and only for soil shards.
---
I used to do this with this lower level player, help him run dungeons just because he seemed like a cool dude, his dad also played wow (also a rogue) and gave me enough gold for a mount when I hit 40, it was pretty cool :D (this was multiple playtimes helping this kid though, across multiple weeks)
---
ive made that run for fun... more than once.
---
depends what the macro does. if your macro jumps twice you're botting
---
A number 47...
---
no you're just kind of being a complete ass-hat about it.  how about you just let people do what they want while you worry about yourself.  You can always ignore that kind of behavior if it makes you so salty that you have tome come off as some kind of self righteous jerk about it.  Its their 15 bucks, they can do what they want.  Will it get them anywhere?  I doubt it.  But they arent doing anything wrong.   So verbally vomiting all over them about something you have no control over just makes you look really bad.

Huntard -&gt; gnome mage

Lol sry
---
One of my close guildmates in vanilla had tailoring and enchanting. He was perpetually broke... like, copper poor. Dude was a level 60 mage with a 60% mount until BC because leveling enchanting is so expensive.
---
Not gonna lie, as someone that started playing in Cata, a lot of the zones questlines makes so much more sense than the cata ones.
---
Gotcha
---
Bagnon?
---
Not if you’re on different layers. You will see other people on the same layer.
---
if you havent hit 60 in 3 years like this thread is talking about than you should just quit.
---
Mods are always unbearably narcissistic, it’s insane and I wonder why that is.
---
Leveling a ret with little will of changing it on 60
---
Pen and paper
---
It takes forever to get that axe, by the time you get it it's almost not worth the trouble
---
That's the best way they could do expansions, I would love to play BC and WotLK again.
---
It gets better at 40 with mortal strike and deep wounds. Warrior is a tough level but stick at it. 20 deaths is small on the scale of things.
---
Was about time
---
Also back in the day bosses had 8 debuff slots, it wasnt until later on in classic that they changed it to 16. That made everything a lot easier
---
I saw a guide awhile back detailing a Shaman tank build for dungeons which apparently actually works.

Yeah OP, you'll be missing out on something if you choose Druid. That something is pets. You wouldn't want to miss out, would you? It might be fine in a lot of ways but there would be a whole aspect of the game you'd never see. That would be a shame. You could level a Druid to 15 or 20 and see how it goes. But you'd be missing pets.
---
Maybe try warlock.
---
Or hunter.
---
Only a fool would meet the goretusks on an open field.

I've never played WoW before, nor do I intend to play the normal WoW, but seeing this has brought my hopes up a bit to try and become part of a MMO community, one that isn't just an anime pretty girl/boy style. Would it be worth trying out this game? I'd be playing as a healer to start as I find those most enjoyable.
---
~~Also should I get a job just to afford to continuously pay the fee? Currently in high school :p~~
---
I accidentally met up with a random Druid I was questing with prior and we remembered each other. I miss stuff like this from Vanilla. Cross realm takes that away but I always thought cross PvP and cross LFG dungeons was fine since there is a larger pool of players that way.
---
nah theyre free lol
---
Do you know how long it takes to earn 1,000 gold for an epic mount when the auction house is selling just above vendor prices?  A very, very long time.  No one will be spending 200g+ for a twink weapon in a year.  That's insane.
---
Well thanks for being that guy

New to the class, but great guide here by Dive: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmAPvVda-340ryYPuhdQ9rBTlHsh2WkMPm84F7TMEsg/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmAPvVda-340ryYPuhdQ9rBTlHsh2WkMPm84F7TMEsg/edit)

I've been mapping the pet attack / follow to mouse wheel up / down. Feeling like you're in total control of your pet is a great thing. I'm going to tweak it to a mouseover attack macro. Should let me quickly send void off to the next mob while I'm finishing off the current one without worrying about tab targeting to the wrong mob.
---
Best one I've used from that guide above is the wand macro, stops me from accidentally not casting when changing targets:
---
    /castsequence !Shoot,!Shoot
---
Not that I'm immediately aware of. Maybe it's possible with an addon? I'm not sure.
---
Ikr.  They’re so pathetic.
---
This should be upvoted

🙄 Seriously?

Congrats on coming up with such a dumb comment :)

It's not the legs that make it look like a skirt, it's the chest. I dunno of any cloth gear that isn't a robe tbh

We get the kids to bed at 8pm and play til 11-midnight every night. 
---
It's just what we have to do to enjoy the game. When we played classic before we had no kids, no jobs, had just gotten married. Was great lol.
---
I loved the layering bitching. Imagine no layers. Ha.
---
They still get rage for damage dealt, but not taken.
---
Pls no, we're very comfy at "High" pop but no queue times.

How does Elemental leveling feel like?

No

I've had wow dreams 3 out of the past 5 nights. Oh and I've actually been sleeping through the night instead of waking up at 2am and falling back asleep at 4am. I'm sleeping like a baby, thanks WoW!

Ha, I read a guys post on the official wow forums about average time to 60. He said since some people never reached 60 there would be a potential time of infinite and throwing infinite into your mean equation would make the average time to 60 infinite lol.

If only we had the internet in 2019.

Pay for guides seems so 1990.  Anyone remember Nintendo Power? Or 900 numbers for game tips?
---
That's what I did. My first run dropped the hammer and even by level 22 I haven't had better legs.
---
&gt; I tried to sinister strike out of stealth once and missed then got my ass kicked.
---
well, at least your target didn't dodge a stealth attack from behind.
---
That's the real "wtf" moment right there :D
---
Blizzard is like a virtual Heisenberg
---
Right? People have made it into a fence, and those committed to one side wont let anyone stand on it either.
---
Have you leveled a warrior? I die as one more than any other class.
---
Isn't that was "need before greed" loot system means? If mail drops then only the mail wearers roll. If a shield drops only people who can equip it roll. And only if they are of level to use it now. You were maybe expecting the "Group Loot" mechanic where a person can decide to roll "need" or "greed".
---
Everyone is missing the point. Iv used the name ErwinRommel for a few years and have never been banned. You had trouble because some care bare reported you name, but it wasn’t banned because it was Donald trump it was banned because you have a funny character in it. Those characters are against tos not the actual name.
---
Why don't you just go play retail where this addon and it's current functionality was born.
---
If retail was good we wouldn't be here.
---
Not really forgotten, but one thing is being dismounted not jumping all the way across a tiny river. I missed and hated this.
---
Make it a "zug zug" amd you got a deal!
---
This is on wow classic release.
---
Definitely. The Vanilla community is one of the best. Give it a try!
---
Well I don't *need* to I guess, but I told my girlfriend &amp; bestfriend that I would help them fund their mounts cause they both suck with money

I think this is what the Chinese version of the game does to dead player skeletons.

Similar to this:  reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1apbpj/on_chinese_game_clients_dead_players_are/

2h fury till 41, swap to arms.

That's just simply not true. Let's say your playerbase is 1mil to keep it simple. They had what? 8 servers at name res launch? That's 125k per server if its evenly spread. Say they double that to 16 servers. Now it's only 67.5k per server. Those day 1 login queues wouldn't be as fucked because you would have split your initial base over double the amount of servers. Rather than waiting 8 hours in queue on day one people could've waited 4. Not sure what's so confusing about that.
---
Will check it out, thanks!
---
Blizzard cares more about subscriptions than servers. And if you consider smooth being 8+ ques, including newly launched servers for 3 days, tons and tons of disconnects, then I'd hate to see what you consider not smooth. Smooth is legion launching to me. They are doing free xfers now. What if they launched 20 servers from the get go, maintained their subscriptions for people trying to play, and merged servers or offered free xfers for dead ones and took them back offline? It really doesn't cost that much money then they are already spending. I can run down a cost analysis if you'd like for what a typical servers operating costs are. Most of it is labor they are already spending on their staff.
---
I listened to Blizzard not once, but twice, and I'm STILL dealing with 2 and a half hour queues. Stop blaming us.
---
It's almost always horde heavy. Few times does it away the other way. It's weird.
---
Time is money, friend.
---
Thanks, I was unaware there was a difference
---
I get that this is a joke, but just in case you didn’t know using your wand a lot can speed up your leveling! Even if you kill things slower you use less mana and allow for mana regeneration during your wand attacks.
---
just slap it twice
---
Anything but a chrome book, you need a windows comp to keep it simple

is robe of power any good? i have a lvl 42 shadow priest with gnomer quest robes but i was wondering if +spell dmg/heal would be better
---
Did you guys sing the CAMPFIRE Song?
---
Push the button, don't push the tray. It will break. What a zoomer.
---
Down ranking is useful for all classes: I have three different versions of Life tap on my bars, depending on the situation and how much mana I need and how much life I'm on. 
---
It can be the difference between dying to the opener of that rogue that ganked you or him putting him in the dirt.
---
well as a mage, it feels bad that you have to literally do nothing for 5-10 sec each pull with more than 1 mob cuz mage aoe dps is so broken that you overaggro everything with 2 arcane explosions, that why a lot of people do just as you said, 4-3mages/+warlock and healer can clear everything with just novas and aoe
---
Someone got it
---
The onyl real way to level either
---
Yeah getting old sucks.  I played WoW back in vanilla and now I'm married and have children.  So basically I get an hour or 2 a night to play when the kids are in bed.  Usually that means ignoring the wife to play so its hit or miss.  It's fun this time around even though I know I wont raid.  The friends that are playing again are all on different servers and ones with high queues so I'm on a server with no queue
---
I played for years then I quit because I had kids. A decade later WoW returns and I realize...  I just bred by 5 Man Group!
---
Yo STVietnam is a war field as well
---
Damn, it doesn’t sound like PvE -&gt; PvP realm transfer will be supported. As someone who was peer pressured by a group of friends to roll with them on PvE, but now they’ve mostly fallen off playing, I wish I could go back to a PvP realm.
---
How do you hop layers? I would love to try and get to different layers to snag this guy.
---
Those weren't respecs, those were overhaul expansions
---
I leveled an alchemist rogue to 15 just to give my newer paladin potions and elixirs to help level, now my paladin is making weapons for the rogue to use

you trolling?  yes this is literally the rule in place.
---
I really want them to just add to classic in the future.  
---
New profession recipes.  New skill ranks.  New dungeons.  New mats.  New alternate gear sets for off builds/ hybrids/ build specialization.  
---
There are spell ranks that drop in raids.  More of that.  Material drops for high level recipes that drop in raids.  
---
Gear pieces that are under the highest raid gear that drops in a raid, with low drop rates, that are BoE so they can be farmed and sold to non raiders.  
---
Crafting recipes that would be equivalent to a 1.7 gear gear, dropped BoE that would be 1.8 and raid 2.0 is basically what I’m thinking.  
---
It doesn’t need to be more levels and gear that obsoletes previous gear.  Just small improvements to what is already here.  
---
And instead of repeatable quests you do daily, collection/ turn in quests for both pve and world PvP that you turn in at your leisure.  “Bring me x heads of so and so and I’ll pay you y money in exchange”.  Go farm, and turn in whenever.
---
Correct: it is not a big deal. Thanks for the share!

This server is pretty fucking legit. I feel like I'm on Illidan again.

This is my first time ever playing druid, what are the abilities I should be using most as a bear tank?
---
I was just using maul for single target swipe for multi target, but I read that I should be using my rage for demo shouts instead and only swipe if I'm full on rage? Is this correct and is there anything more to it?
---
Is it strong blood from a troll or blood from a strong troll?

Dude. You are a hero. I can’t tell you the pain it was at level 20! To do the standard walk. This looks so much easier.

Looks good shall give it a try thanks

&gt;PvP was always able to transfer to PvE, but not vice versa
---
Black Dragonflight was a PvP server that 4 PvE realms could transfer to during Vanilla. It was actually controversial at the time because it was the first time that PvE-&gt;PvP transfers happened and one of the big guilds on the PvE server (Hyjal) was known for having Blizzard employees.
---
Imo there should be a dedicated streaming server and streaming from any other server is bannable.
---
So it's actually not just me that hates reddit mods? thank god, they sure made me feel like it was just me.
---
You’re trynna say this is toxic? This is justice

You can have all 4 totems on one button but you have to click it 4 times to summon all since are on gcd. You can check castsequence macros and do one for yourself easily.

I'm a level 27 Alliance Warrior on Whiterun and I'm planning on doing the Whirlwind weapon quest at 30, but I heard that the last boss is level 39. Does anyone mind adding me and helping me through this quest once I hit 30? I probably won't be able to  reach it for a couple days though but I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me get the whirlwind axe.
---
Wouldn't character transfers be an option at that point? Meaning you would have more time playing now for the price of a transfer later.
---
This also goes for Bears.
---
Man if this situation was vice versa we still would have a dumb fuck post.
---
Not quite, OSRS has unique updates and has diverged from the main game, RS3. It's now got more players than RS3 does and is constantly growing. The dev team basically took everything from Rs3 that was done correctly, and then put it into OSRS, without the bad stuff. Granted, there are issues with OSRS that was created by it's own playerbase, but it's definitely not even close to the same as it's retail version of the game.
---
It would be like if in WoW classic, they added a new expansion that didn't increase level cap, but offered brand new, never been done before raid content, exclusive to classic. It keeps the game fresh while also retaining it's core values and difficulty.
---
You can fill up a bag and place it in one of the bag slots (that you pay to unlock) at the bottom of your bank.

This is how I’ve traded my whole WoW career
---
No, I do
---
Well it's nostalgia
---
Does it hurt to be wrong? Like are you use to being wrong? Or is this a new sensation for you?
---
int isn't a very good stat in classic.  it gives mana and crit.  Like you'll get like .25 crit once you get some decent gear and like a couple hundred mana maybe?  super negligible stuff
---
&gt;The polls wouldn't be about the new-player experience, though.
---
And you know this how?
---
The polls are as hypothetical as everything else in this discussion. They can be about anything we want.
---
If classic were to fork from retail WoW and take a new path forward, à la OSRS, then updates could address a variety of things beyond just more endgame content. They could offer other things, like new 1-60 zones or QoL improvements, that directly affect the new-player experience (and therefore new-player retention).
---
Obligatory I played classic back in the day comment. 
---
Anyway, I have a career and a 2 year old. Wow happens when the tot goes down and the wife's not needy.
---
I've made it to two level 12s, one to play with my friend who we used to play in school back in the day, and the other is my toon I play when he isnt on! 
---
I'm having the time of my life enjoying the game that I fell in love with 15 years ago. I know I'm not alone, and hope there are many more leveling at this pace.
---
Gnomes are the fucking best alliance race. Gnome all the way!!!!...Downvotes incoming
---
My reason for doing so, and probably most others who do, is that it seems like a better idea in the long run. The medium population is fine now, but we are worried about a year from now, etc. We don't know what blizz is planning to do with low pop servers, so we are playing on the annoyingly packed servers to be safe. 
---
Now, that doesn't mean you shouldn't play on the lower pop servers. You totally should, everyone should. If we could balance things out better this wouldn't be a problem, but unfortunately unless most people change this, the minority doesn't really change anything. 
---
But, you asked the reason, and that's the reason. For good or for bad :p
---
Insert Thanos meme: I used the Boar to FEED the Boar!
---
Exotic beasts for BM hunters! These puny classic beasts simply cannot compare to a giant enraged kodo body-slamming my opponents into dust.
---
&gt;All in all, I'd say BFA is a pretty decent expac now, certainly far, far better than Warlords of Draenor.
---
That's really up to what you value. I refuse to let myself login to bfa because i know i would immediately start grinding for flying and kultiran humans as they weren't available when i quit. 
---
The thing is i know myself and i'd do it by any means possible as fast as possible, and i'd just quit after getting them due to burnout since those grinds are very tedious and insanely boring.
---
Modern WoW just feels like daily chore simulator and it really hurts to say that because overall i feel like gameplay-wise it's still fairly decent. 
---
As much as i want to play a kul'tiran druid i just can't bring myself to do the allied race grind again. Dark irons and LF draenei/void elves broke me.
---
This macro is shit if you don't use a soul shard bag because shoul shards don't automatically get placed in your left-most bag.
---
Seriously, people were simultaneously mad while Blizzard was doing everything the community wanted exactly.
---
How does that affect you?
---
There was a good jay z parody called M.A.G.E. As well
---
You can't. Just gotta be careful with exp gain.
---
As you are an Alliance player, I hate you. 
---
As you are another Druid, I respect you.
---
As you are a meme lord, I worship you.
---
There's a pretty obvious difference between a ranged squishy class which have single threat gen skills (usually for pulling/CC) and a class that wears heavier armor, uses shields, and specifically gets bonuses to blocking/defensive traits/threat generation.
---
I don't know how anyone thinks that it wasn't obviously meant to be a clear comparison to Paladin, where all 3 roles are roughly possible.
---
Not 15y old graphics, they updated many things
---
Pretty sure there's add-ons for detailed character sheet
---
idk i saw a gnome mage named Spells and I'd be annoyed to lose that one! lucky them
---
cant afford your fucking abilities bullshit star learning how to save gold
---
Love how crappy your action bars look.
---
If you want to play. Just play. You eill get to 60 eventually
---
But it Depents. How many hours can you put a day? It usualy takes 12-20 days in played(as far as i know. I migth be wrong). But a mage just made it in 2-3days played or somethig
---
Skills also factors in
---
How do you die in barrens and end up in westfall? Where is the mountain?
---
Thats amazing! Awesome you gave it to him too. Ive been passing out all my green drops to associated classes to help out anyone who needs it.

Grats dude, you deserve it
---
The thing I love most about wow is mindlessly farming raw gold for hours. It just so happens I get a lot of xp for it don’t judge me.
---
I don't think you know what multiboxing means.
---
Barely. Most of it was designed with flying *not* in mind since you can't get flying until level cap. All you would have to do is make the flying-only parts accessible by ground.
---
TL;DR add ramps because ADA says so.
---
\+healing always worth most, followed by intellect. Spell crit % is good too. Anything else is poopoo.
---
You get ghost wolf early on, which I imagine is a big help at least.
---
Dancing on the mailbox as we speak
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
It still blows my mind that they decided to make the first, (and  presumably only) rppvp realm Pacific.
---
epic i like it
---
&gt; But if they only allowed transfers from the higher pop faction it would naturally balance somewhat.
---
Great idea, just destroy the balance on the target realm, but at least you get more balance on the transfer off realm.  
---
 
---
Pretty much all the pvp servers are horde heavy and all the pve servers are alliance heavy so there's literally no solution to this problem if people keep playing the characters they've started.
---
&gt;I don't care to be honest,
---
/thread.
---
Now shoo.
---
2 hours ago a priest in my random dungeon group opened a trade window, put 2 stacks of water in it and whispered me "I can stand that life tapping anymore, my heart"... I never experienced something like that in retail. Its just one of many funny anecdotes I had in only 2 days of playing.
---
Ya managing agro and threat and classic is it’s whole thing. I’m not supper used to it yet either lol.
---
look for auto unstuck feature in help
---
Ugh ally scum
---
Understood, thanks
---
Corpsemaker from RFK is very competitive in that bracket.
---
Do not move your streams and your boxing accounts to my server! We are having a good time!
---
I quit for a year in classic, almost 3 years between Wrath and cata, 5 years between panda and legion, then a year after BFA until last week. Pretty sure i'll keep coming back every once in a while.
---
You will come across mobs that have frost resist, so yeah probably a good move to get em
---
Myself, I was in a spellcleave group and woulda hit 55 before sleep to get guild level lead for the first time since launch. I did not like this :D
---
The only thing that can stop a bad guy with mail is a good guy with mail.
---
A friend of mine spent 12 hours camping this mob only to have it taken when he went to the bathroom for 2 minutes.
---
You can click Classic in the system settings to downgrade it to 2006ish settings.
---
More to the point, Classic really just isn't a good game for rushing. It's an RPG. You wouldn't speedrun your D&amp;D campaign to 20 , so why do it on WoW?

I've found this is variable from game to game. In some games(e.g. Enter the Gungeon), frame limiting gives me horrible stuttering. In some games, the in-game limiter is smoothest(e.g. WoW), and in others, RTSS limiting gives me smoother results(e.g. Diablo 3).
---
Kinda.
---
Though really talent changes/mechanics are really what made some off-specs viable.
---
I don’t think the $25 is indicative of the “labor”  that goes into the transfer like a shipping fee would go to the labor to shop that package. The cost of the transfer might be more of a deterrent of people frequently changing realms.
---
I was using recount until i discovered Details. It's vastly superior.
---
Your only choice is Gnome, or Human.
---
Gnomes get +5% int, +15 Engineering, Escape Artist and a little arcane resistance which is all great if you are a Gnome Mage engineer.
---
Humans get +10% rep gains (Amazing if you plan on rep grinding), Mace specialization (Useless on mages), Perception (Great for PvP, meh for PvE), Sword Specialization (Useful, but you really won't be chopping anything with a sword), and +5% spirit. The rep gains, perception and +5% spirit are all good options, but as a mage you typically want to prioritize Stam/Int rather than spirit. 
---
So it really depends, if you plan on grinding rep the +10% bonus is one of the absolute best racial abilities because it can save you long hours of tedious grinding. If you have no plans to level up your reputation, then it's mostly useless.
---
Level 35 Hunter.
---
Everyone told me about this rare cat, Broken Tooth, and that having it in your Hunter catalogue is a badge of honor and super prestigious.
---
I don't get why, he went down rather easy. My pet boar tanked him like a champ.
---
Any other recommended addons? I currently have Classic Cast Bar, OmniCC, Bartender4, Bagnon, Questie, Titanbar.
---
I think if we saw heroic versions of raids of classic raids that would be cool
---
&gt; its probably worth a pretty penny  
---
It's like 15s or something.
---
The Popcap devs used to maintain Peggle and Bejeweled but they got the addons got canned when EA bought out Popcap. Some guy got them working again, but only Peggle seems to work in vanilla.
---
Triviabot is also good, but I'm not sure if there's a vanilla version yet.
---
Hey sorry to bother you, and thank you again -- it was very easy this time to just go tame a Greater Fleshripper. It popped up that I learned screech in like 5 mins. So I learned screech on my owl, rank 1. I don't see any higher than rank 1 in the list. Is the highest rank 1? Or do I have to level up that stupid Fleshripper to get a higher Screech rank?
---
yeah i raided and pvp'ed in vanilla there was only 1 at most for each class
---
I do agree you have no idea what viable means 
---
ROFL Skill in vanilla?  for raiding?  OMFG   as a warrior tank raiding all you ever needed to do was spam heroic strike and sunder armor.  That's it.
---
there's a tab on the friends list page
---
VC*
---
Game only been out 15 years and people still unable to understand level minimums for dungeons.  
---
Classic is alive and well
---
Played in some form of the original beta, middle of 2004? Got one copy of regular WoW and had two copies of the Collector's Edition because they were easy to get. Quit in Classic because running around everywhere pissed me off. 
---
Came back just before.. TBC? Rolled a rogue on an RP/PVP server (out of paranoia). Was just big enough to get through the portal (stealthed through PILES of skeletons) to try questing. Had much more fun RPing with the occasional PVP, it made the world feel more.. real. Never could go back to PVE.
---
Quit again after... WotLK? Came back a few times up until Warlords of Draenor but it just wasn't the same. Seems like the game got too easy. And empty. Never came back in spite of people trying to drag me back in.
---
Thinking about this but not sure if I have the time since I'm old now. I do work much fewer hours at work...
---
Don't forget, there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, brand new players that all jumped in at once. Absolutely nothing is common knowledge.
---
Someone's been reading BFA max DPS guides.
---
This will probably go unnoticed but I had looted a rabbits foot and I saw in my bag it had an orange pulsing border around it for like 30 seconds then it just stopped glowing. 
---
What was that?
---
How to roll for loot in dungeons...need vs greed. Need if you can actually use it (example, needing a piece of cloth as a mage; greed if you want it but don’t need it, (example,greed a green/blue shield as a mage to sell or send to an alt).
---
I'm only 12. 12! I play warrior on retail, and I love it, but holy hell is it hard to level in classic. This better be worth it, lol.
---
Sorry for bad english, Bro!

bro 😎💪
---
I hate when my clock clips through my cape.
---
I wonder what they have in plans for german realms specifically - considering at evening times ALL Servers - ALL OF THEM - are HIGH at a minimum :P
---
That's what I'm wondering as well. I've never heard of anyone not liking BC or WotLK why not just add those then build from there OSRS style?
---
For me that's the appeal of classic.  Gaining 2 levels shouldn't automatically invalidate every previously equipped piece of gear.
---
Mounts at 40, no easy dungeon matchmaking que, pally is strictly alliance and shaman is strictly horde.
---
That as well.  But Heirlooms raised everyone up in gear level.  You weren't destroying that guy in gray's anymore.  It was a que filled with like geared players so it killed the thrill of destroying people were weaker than you.
---
oh really? lol. how often does it drop?
---
&gt;  It was a que filled with like geared players so it killed the thrill of destroying people were weaker than you.
---
¿Qué?
---
I feel you.
---
Thank you.
---
Nahh they changed it later on. PvE to PvP wasn't possible in Classic and BC.
---
50 DKP MINUS!
---
Not even then.  Give it the same % just higher base stats.
---
Go to a different server. I'm on BB and can login immediately
---
I hit renew and leave em ... if they die I make them run back
---
I really worry about his sanity.
---
Isn't it pretty damn awesome?
---
I just wish they would keep BG's server specific and not have cross realm battle grounds, really bummed about that.
---
&gt;oh ok, so someone who only played for the last... 4 months before the vote and is taking it slow shouldnt get a say. got it.
---
I like the customization for sure, and even if there are superior specs I like the illusion of choice. I actually wish there were even more choices. Maybe one for tree and 5 more points etc.
---
It would be so impossible to balance that it would kind of be the point to try random stuff for fun.
---
Yeah, you aren't alone in your Classic circlejerk subreddit, shocker lol. Buh bye.
---
And Im the tank lmao
---
Oh he wanted to do SM Armory for the armor and XP. We were grinding it earlier on and I had just woken up and wanted to do the Whirlwind quest.
---
Just...he sounded weird when he came back like he was overly focused on armory. And then he just went crazy. But what's weird is it's out of character for him to ask someone else to play for him.
---
Even then all he did was literally run around as a ghost. It's very very strange.
---
Well yes, note the words "expressly authorized", that would be software developer that has not previously discussed this with blizzard, for example botting software developers who would like to keep their product hidden from game developer.   
---
But every and all gaming gear developers has their software authorized, that's why game has timer between inputs, so it wouldn't be abused, not forbidden.   
---
Sorry to burst you bubble, fella, but ever since the release of Razer Naga this was an objective, not an obstacle.
---
by that logic, in OSRS if yo uarent max level you shouldnt be allowed to vote, either, right?
---
I will keep it updated.
---
I don't think parry haste is explained anywhere in game?
---
farming deviate hides outside takes an eternity
---
Loot and sell everything, hit every mining node you can, play the AH (though it may be too early to do this)
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
You can heal somewhat sufficiently early on but you will have a very hard time keeping threat if you are tanking as ret. So yes to heal, no to tank.

All my irl friends are on Whitemane, and my character is 35 so it’s hard to switch now. 😭
---
These players could be just as miserable about doing it the normal Classic way and still complain loudly. I encourage everyone to play how they want to. I also discourage everyone, on every sub not just classic, to stop reposting the same thing over and over (like this topic)
---
You could still make it but it's going to require saving 100% of everything from here on out.
---
Stop leveling your professions, just mine and sell it on AH. Don't buy anything from AH or even vendors. And start strongly limiting the skills you level up. Be selective and only buy the things you absolutely need.
---
You have to remember that your quest rewards should be ramping up quite a bit as well in the 30-40 range (not to mention it's going to take a while to make it through that whole 10 levels). So you can still make it.
---
And then theres my friend. Who slamed a deviate delight, then as a himan did the /train "choochoo" emote into the tits of a troll hunter the entire time she was waitin for the boat. Even when she move, he repositions and did it till she sprinted away once the ship ride was over.

I'm not sure I've seen anybody asking for new expansions for classic. Most of the time players want extra level 60 content, not to go to the Dragon Isles or a redesigned Outland in full expansions (although I've definitely seen some people ask for it). 
---
However, Blizzard has been adding zones in content patches for retail for a while now. MoP got the Timeless Isle, WoD had Tanaan Jungle, Legion had Broken Shore and Argus, BfA recently got a couple too. So basically, even if Classic goes for a content patch approach, we could definitely see new zones like Hyjal or the Dragon Isles.
---
I am currently at level 22 with my hunter and my armour is all black / grey, except for my gloves and cape which are red. Everytime i trained new abilites, i go to the AH and check for cheap, fashionable and good armour, because i simply never find anything good while leveling.
---
Some may say that i am going to regret it at the time i ding 40, but i am not going to have enough money for the mount anyway, so i rather invest a bit of money to look good an make leveling a bit easier. Although i do try to not get totaly broke.
---
Have you been buying the demon training tomes for higher levels of your void walkers spells?
---
Either way, void walkers aren't great at holding aggro, last time I leveled a lock I just switched to imp, succubus or fel hound a lot and relied on the fear spell to control my enemies.
---
😅
---
Lol, the game cost ~100$ for 6 months, they better add what the community wants !
---
I like auctionator as a better way to search the AH

They were added in 1.12, the majority of vanilla they weren't and when they were added some of those who played before weren't all that happy to see their rivals much less frequently in BGs.
---
I was disappointed at first, BGs before you got to know everyone and you'd see them out in the world too where you could straight wreck them without a team to back them up, etc.
---
But then I realised I don't have time to be sitting in 4-8 hour AV queues and 30mins WSG/AB queues nowadays so meh.
---
ahh sorry misread, makes sense now.
---
Weapon skill doesn't do anything in shapeshift forms. Shapeshifting basically causes the game to treat you as if your weapon skill is maxed for your level. Hit chance after that is based on your level vs the mob's level.
---
There's really nothing you can do about party/block/dodge as a feral druid, because +weapon skill doesn't do anything for you and expertise didn't exist until TBC. You can add +hit (cap for bosses at level 60 is 9%), but there isn't really a lot of leveling gear with hit and your primary stats are more important anyway.
---
So long story short, there's not a lot you can do about your hit chance right now. Hit things from behind whenever possible to avoid block/parry.

Sometime during WotLK I’m pretty sure.

Why would you make a macro just to cast cat form, when the ability itself does this, and can be keybinded on your bar? Lol

Why are you advertising them

I thought all of the chat channels were across all layers

Nah, it's about people having a balanced lifestyle. Spending 31 out of 48 hours playing isn't "having time for your hobbies". It's having an unhealthy obsession with a singular one-dimensional hobby.

Running out of content is a meme, people who only know about 5 zones say this. You can literally get 1-60 with quests only and still have lots of quests leftover...

[In the words of the Bare Naked Ladies...](https://youtu.be/Zs3xXlXSOKk)

Imagine going to the dungeon to find a group instead of asking in City trade chat
---
Play a warlock, you'll have a blast. They aren't very tanky themselves but they are able to drain tank around level 30, absorbing the life force of other enemies to keep them selves topped up.
---
They have the ability to chip away at their opponents health with dots, or out right destroy them with powerful spells. They can summon party members with a little help from anywhere in Azeroth. 
---
As well as that, you can choose one of 4 permenant pets and 2 temporary ones, eventually, have a range of utility spells and a unique ability to save a group from a wipe with the soul stone.
---
Combining your control over your pet and fearing and mobs away from you, being able to send your pet in to occupy mobs while you loot quest items. Utilizing your pets abilities to taunt, seduce, interrupt and even remove harmful magical debuffs from you or a party member. 
---
Being a good warlock is a blessing to any group, being a great one will make you a legend!
---
You called?
---
But then I'd have to live with the shame of installing retail
---
Plus so many hunters these days don't even use pets, I remember warlocks asking for a solo talent like hunters. I remember a lot of people complaining mostly about the pathing issue (which i dont get for warlocks since imps can shoot from far away, warlock problem is their pets are mostly useless and you only ever use like 2 or three until they changed how Demonology worked).
---
Broken tooth ? Lol
---
Honestly, I'm not enjoying it as much as I had hoped. I started playing osrs when mobile released and I've been playing it since. I played both RuneScape and wow as a kid, so I thought I'd be really into another old school nostalgia trip. I love the sense of community in classic wow so far, but the game itself just isn't doing it for me just yet. I'm only level 11 so I'm gonna stick it out for a while longer, but I'm getting my ass whooped and I'm progressing incredibly slowly, and I'm not really sure what I'm even progressing towards that will feel rewarding. Last week I finally earned my fire cape in RuneScape, and it was literally the most rewarding accomplishment I've ever done in any game ever. And there's still so much more for me to accomplish in that game! But in wow I'm busy dying multiple times to kobolds and shit (because I'm bad, I'm not blaming the game). But I don't really know what I'm working towards. To hit 60 and "finally play the game"?
---
It might be worth something when battlegrounds comes around for lvl 29 warrior/paladin twinks.
---
&gt; you just need to manually join.
---
and that is why it is useless. If it is not a default channel you have to assume most people (surprise most ppl don't use Reddit) don't know about it or use it.
---
Yep. Warlocks are a welcome utility usually due to being able to summon. Druid healers are also welcome. Hunters can sometimed have a harder time finding a spot.
---
Hopefully Whitemane dies down just a little bit.
---
Good luck. While the game is 10x easier so far I've yet to run a dungeon where the dps wasn't nuking the second the mobb. Thanks to 1.13 I've yet to have a dungeon run fail, but I'm hoping shitty play isn't viable in the higher dungeons. 
---
I've had to suffer shit dps before too due to similar circumstances. In general i don't put up with that shit.
---
That's what he should of said.
---
What do you think about pvp as prot?
---
It should definitely show your ingame friendslist above the battle net friends.
---
They did for two expansions. Then gold farming bots became an issue and then the Cataclysm class system happened.
---
Mainly because mmo genre has become more casual. With casual focus, easy, quick and rewarding is the name of the game.
---
Of course all of that makes being powerful less unique and kills the feelings one gets from those accomplishments, but it catered to so many more people, that they found it worth it.
---
Don't ever use renew, its a garbage spell.
---
They are this person is just confused on how lfg works in classic
---
Yeah i've been upgrading my VW with the tomes.  I too have been managing multimobs with fear.  Gonna spec into Improved VW as mentioned by previous poster to see if that helps
---
No, the worst kind of warlocks are the ones who just dot and maybe wand sometimes, but mostly just cast a dot.  At the end of a dungeon run, I looked at Details and he had cast Curse of Agony 1 time.  Once.  So basically just Corruption and wand.
---
Mana never went below 80%.  I don't know if he even had Life Tap, but he certainly didn't need it since he didn't actually seem to know how to cast spells.
---
Fun fact, I just learned this the other day, but threat meters in classic are just estimates gathered from the combat log. There's no perfectly accurate way to measure threat because of changes Blizzard removed from the API.
---
You can unlearn professions and roll new ones but you will lose all skill points in them.
---
With DX 12 pipeline...
---
Just looked up South Shore. This is how new I am. Thanks for the tip!
---
&gt; You sure love to pretend like you are some psuedo intellectual in all ways Classic wow but you didn't even know the most popular website that parses for it are submitted to.
---
I've never PVE'd for anything other than the items, I detest it, I made it abundantly clear throughout the thread. But I spent enough time around obsessed parsers and way to many hours on minimum prep. Its what I used for reference.
---
&gt; I mean you thought warcraft logs was a specifically chinese fucking website for fucks sake.
---
What the fuck mate, I said its nice to have the chinese numbers.
---
&gt; Optimizing on retail has depth whether you like to admit it or not
---
Juggling three balls has depth as-well. But its a retarded mini-game, that's literally the point, you want effort and mastery to revolve around your ability to juggle 2-3 timers, what bankrupt design.
---
&gt; Classic is spamming 100 strings of frostbolts and hoping your gear drops so you get better dps next week.
---
Thankfully, id rather chill and spam than juggle timers to impress myself or my neckbeard friends.
---
&gt; You talk about it like it is all so easy
---
It is easy. 3%+ on every content released. The numbers speak for themselves. 
---
&gt; Now you are randomly bringing up twitch viewership which is completely unrelated and heavily influenced by many other factors.
---
You appealed to the player and viewers interest when you said nobody cares. You're the one bringing it up retard. 
---
&gt; But your dick is too hard for your 1 button PVE to match each bosses 1 mechanic that you can finally take part in, that it is all you can think about. 
---
A paradise where I don't have to put effort into a retarded mini-games that serve no other purpose than being a filler for your ego to obsess over. Enjoy retail mate.
---
&gt; You are just so heavily invested in this entire debate it is hilarious to see how quick you break down and scream insults to try to drown out any discussion. 
---
I was screaming insults from the get-go mate, and quite intentionally so. Retards like you, feeling insecure about the declining interest in your petty juggling mini-games have no other place to vent your frustration other than on this subreddit. The whole context of this thread is jab at the lack of a game-play mechanics that quite a lot of people enjoy missing. 
---
&gt; I'm sorry this game has so much emotional control over you, hope you get the help you need and find some people who you can pretend to be a big deal with :)
---
Ohh why thank you, I hope you find much fulfillment in your rotations.
---
Have you tried, restarting/updating/repairing the game?
---
I'll see you on the battlefield!
---
MY MAN! hope to see you out there on the grind.
---
I don't play OSRS so I wouldn't know.  I also wouldn't be a good candidate for how to vote how OSRS changes their game.
---
True but it still helps a lot! I use it as a hunter and I never pull aggro now
---
Will it allow a race change?
---
I’m at 9k atm
---
Can you explain that one? How does 25% of the player base away a vote accessible to 100% of the players?
---
Going on the adventure is the spirit of Classic. Get lost, do some dumb stuff and see the world while doing it.

Oooof, i didn't even think about that D:
---
But trade pops up in all Capitol cities. And everyone knows about it.
---
Besides, it's traditional!
---
Angry capslock in languages that that majority of the server doesn't speak. Still gives me grief but it wouldn't be classic without it.
---
For anyone messing with with, the 1e4 sets it to "1000,"  with the number to the right of the 'e' being the number of zeroes.  So if you don't want it super huge you can do like 5e1 for 50.  The default for the game is 20
---
They tried to. People hated it because it wasn't easy. Don't you remember the outcry when you had to actually (gasp) CC in cata heroics? (OH MY GOD THINK OF THE CHILDREN) "Bring the player not the class?" then you stack 6 rogues for end tier bosses. All classes have to have everything because people will always copy the "best" way to do something because its the "easiest" and then people who play off-meta specs get left looking for groups for hours on end not doing anything because they're a survival hunter or feral druid
---
In my realm, Zandalar Tribe, there are more people that using LFG channel than the Trade Chat.(LFG-wise)
---
I ask once, 1 ultimatum (stop it I'm out) then it's boot the retard or I'm out.
---
PLZ INV FOR LAYER
---
You can switch professions whenever you want, but you lose everything when you switch. So in your example, you start Eng and Alch at level 1, and lose mining and herb. If you ever want to switch back, you start them at 1 again. If you switch out of something with learned recipes like Eng or Blacksmith, all those recipes/patterns/schematics etc are gone and you'd have to relearn them.
---
Yeah. Think about the spells you are buying and if you are really going to need them. When you start hitting 38-39 some good grinding spots open up that will grant you nice gold / hour.

Unfortunately from what we see now in Classic, your friend is absolutely right... a raid of majority 57-58s can one-shot bosses with no understanding of boss mechanics beforehand... a raid of 60s with some idea of mechanics would be exponentially stronger and easily one-shot everything.
---
Nah man, I'm pretty sure I could get one just for the cost of an epic mount
---
That's what druid inervate is for!
---
When you get a new rank of torment it’s alright for a min but doesn’t last long tbh
---
They increased server capacity.
---
Sorry if I’m wrong, but isn’t that kinda the way we got retail?
---
Not with that system ofc but yes?
---
I mean, it kinda looks like it yea
---
Getting around takes time, especially before you get your mount. But it makes the game world feel huge, even going from undercity to thunder bluff to train 1 of my weapon skills felt like an adventure
---
thanks guys, im going to play a hunter instead
---
That was my initial plan. But then things got out of hand.
---
The fact that they caved and had to add more layers than they ever originally intended speaks volumes about the amount of people that stayed.  The fact that there are still queues after the additional layers were introduced, and that they will be providing transfers soon should be more than telling about the current population problems.  People may have quit (or have returned to their current obligations in the meantime), but a lot less have quit than was projected.
---
I mean that kind of chat tends to dominate when it shows up and often put people off. I just tend to leave the affected channel, at least for a while or until going to a different zone. It's like a blackhole of toxicity when it persists.
---
You truly are Voldemrt
---
New Streamer Camera Meta for sure
---
I’d say it depends on how you’re leveling. Spirit based health regeneration only occurs out of combat, so if you’re duo leveling and chain pulling then spirit won’t be all that useful. 
---
I wouldn’t particularly advise carrying a spirit set and swapping armor out of combat just due to limited inventory space. But as warriors have such high health regen scaling from spirit compared to other classes I’d say it’s worth considering when deciding on quest rewards, etc.
---

As a paladin, I want no changes. But it would be a dramatic fix if there was a Libram that makes Judgement to act as a taunt

---
Hello darkness my old friend

Agree, as a matter of fact once they roll out character transfers I'm probably moving to thunderfury, just seems like a more chill leveling environment next to the pvp server I am currently on.

Lmao i got 4 lvl 8s I haven't even seen the talent tree yet
---
Currently got another one in the oven at lvl 3 undead warlock
---
Warlock was my only max lvl char back in the day so we'll see maybe this is the one.

Disenchant or sell to a vendor on livestream so you can become the ultimate shitstreamer
---
Wet dreams, yet still dreams
---
I think it’s just the news servers that helped reduce queue
---
How do you stop it from capturing both monitors though? I always end up having to crop manually in Paint.
---
Damn I Love tanking in classic too
---
With auctioneer I did a quick scan for prices of any products already on the auction, and just noticed some of my mats had a 10c vendor price and a 9c auction price. Skipped over to auction when low and behold, auctioneer buy tab shows orders for 9c each.
---
Hmm, not sure what the pop is, but that’s bogus. Maybe it’s just a problem with his pc or internet?
---
The problem isnt dying its threat generation
---
You don't have to do less damage overall, just let the tank build threat before going ham.
---
Is the Bloodvine set that good? As soma81 said, till i get 300 tailoring, wouldn't have I found a better armor set?
---
So were you checking in every 5-10 minutes before you got disconnected, or did you actual AFK for 1 hour before you got disconnected?
---
&gt;For priests leveling, anyway. All I do is literally press one button, then press another button, then wait 20 seconds.
---
News flash, this is WoW in general. WoW is easily one of the worst MMORPGs on the market period. The only thing going for it, is that its idiot proof enough to convince people to play it with their friends. If you want a more enthralling experience you'd get it from any MMO released prior to WoW or EVE online. Every other MMO on the market is a shoddy clone of WoW including FFXIV whoose only redeeming quality is that its art aesthetic and graphics are arguably more appealing with the same gameplay sans addons.
---
If you want a highly involved leveling system, play Final Fantasy XI which is IMO the best MMORPG to have ever been created. Its also one of the least popular because it doesn't have instant gratification. 
---
Vanilla is easily the most rewarding iteration of WoW because it requires more than 3 brain cells to play. Every subsequent expansion discourages interacting with other players incrementally and reduces statistics to superfluous number splat that has little value or any player input. 
---
I started playing during TBC and have never subbed to the game for more than a month because its so mind numbingly boring. Classic has me doing/managing so many things its hard not to be at least a little entertained managing just buffs alone.
---
g/l getting alli to run SFK
---
Wish this were higher up, I didn't realize this until just a couple days ago. I had made two groups wait every 10 minutes or so for me to stop and buff everyone with thorns. /facepalm
---
Only realized my mistake when I was looking at a healer guide that said thorns is "good for casting on tanks" and it suddenly clicked.
---
Votes need a 75% threshold to pass. OSRS has many max level players that will always vote no for a new skill to be implemented, so they don't have to max again.
---
You know solo questing as a healer sucks almost as much as a warrior and 3/8 classes on both sides can heal, right? It should be pretty easy to find a partner to duo with. You could also just /join lookingforgroup, say "Warrior tank LF" and get 4 group invites before you can hit "G".
---
Is there a discord server for the netherwind server? When I try to look it up google keeps showing me netherwing
---
Same
---
Yeah, i've thought about this many times with this game and others. Some I have walked away from.   Its really just about getting my brain away from work or other crap going on in life for a few hours. Kind of a stress relief type of thing, for me anyways.
---
No add-on can ever get you banned. Blizzard would simply have to close down sections of the API to close down the add-on functioning. Yes it's op, but whatever advantage I can take against rogues I am gonna take.
---
Physically? Sure. Mentally? Not so sure.
---
Also locked to transfers only for the first day to guarantee your names and guilds.
---
wait..that exists?
---
Try the change realm button
---
Yup, and that player, bails. Then anyone else, bails. And the only folks left are salty elitists who think they know whats best. So on the slow grind to 60, the new players are left with no attention at all, struggling to get to 60 where all the old guard sit around with their fresh content and updates. 
---
That sounds like the kind of community I want to be a part of!
---
F12
---
This is the first time I have seen a queue since a couple days after launch. Just saying that the server has been full so I'm not worried at all of it dying anytime soon.
---
&gt;I'm running off a Macbook Pro Retina Late 2013
---
I found the issue. 
---
But in all seriousness this is a questions thread for WoW Classic, not the Apple support website.
---
They also changed the building mechanics and that pissed a lot of people off.
---
&gt; Garrosh is the most badly written character I've ever seen in any work of fiction.
---
I think the only character that can even come close is, sadly, another recent blizzard character: literally every character in Diablo 3. At least the evil villains in He-Man and Thundercats were cheesy on purpose. Blizzard tried to make legitimate villains and made Skeletor by mistake (albeit Skeletor with no charm or likeability, so even worse).
---
Blizzard's writing team is in the gutter and they keep getting away with it on brand-name alone.
---
Imagine being this dumb. Sorry dude
---
MoP was an amazing expansion, new class, new race, great lore, awesome raids and dungeons, it's so unappreciated
---
Upvoted for racing line, the other video I saw on the sub was some shrieking fool who took possibly the longest route possible to the boat and made it purely by spamming an ability.
---
Historically I've played alliance, and doing horde, I think that's what's slowing me down. I don't know where shit is lol
---
Postmates and select 7/11s order
---
I've never been less productive around the house... Constantly going back to my computer to keep myself from afking so I don't get dced and end up in a 4k queue

Its cool but not as cool as Gutrot on Aerie Peak
---
Vanilla legends never die
---
ugh. Just came home from work, hoping to relax after a long day. 5k people and \~2hr estimate. Great.
---
Not as bad as you though. Herod I'm guessing.

You’re logic is flawed and you’re extremely ignorant to a level that is embarrassing just because you desperately want to defend a corporations mistakes.

Every 5-10 minutes i'd run back and move jump and type a message for a minute before heading back.

---
Also locked to transfers only for the first day to guarantee names and guild names. Queues should be eliminated.
---
You have to put a talent point into the two hand specialization talent in the enhancement tree.
---
You may have had “only show available” turned on at the trainer and because you can’t use two hands it won’t show up for you.
---
If you talent that it should show up for you at the weapons trainer. FYI you need level 20.
---
Holy shit I thought it was just be who felt this way. My main since 2007 is a Warrior and I don’t recall it ever being this difficult to level. I’m level 12 and have died at least 2 dozen times.
---
Running for my life from Dust Devils in Westfall
---
Good man. I was also handing out bags and wands this weekend. If you want a good community, you have to build it. The right help at the right time can make a world of difference to someone.
---
It was a medium pop when I joined it last week, and has started showing as high this week. Never had queue problems until now.
---
[laughs in retail on a dead server that I had to pay $25 to get off of because cross realm wasn’t a thing]
---
In all seriousness I hope they’ve thought a head and plan to do free migration and close down servers after the hype is over.
---
Yes you will
---
I agree a lot of the times. And in most times that's completely right. And maybe it's hindsight? But I was saying for the 2 weeks when oce's only server hit high pop on day 2 of name reservations. Feedback is yeah this launch was cocked up but here's what I think (what I said before) could improve the process for the next time.
---
But yeah there is a lot that goes into it, and a lot of things that we don't see
---
I just don't like a lot of the design choices. I tried playing my old main on retail when I bought gametime for classic and it felt.. shallow. It didn't grab me at all. Maybe going hard to farm the tough dungeons is when it feels right, but I don't want to be bored up until that. Classic feels good from start to finish for me, I have over 70 hours played and I'm still engaged.
---
Cowboys you say?
---
https://youtu.be/MADvxFXWvwE
---
how useless!, Incendius an eastern PVP server (why i chose it because im in EST)... moving to a pacific time server..   say what not.
---
not to mention, this wont solve anything. it'll just cause High Pop servers to go to Full.. and the Full servers will be back at Full in no time at all.  
---
they need a couple more PVP servers -_-
---
Can only guess that it’s either just because Blizzard is located on the west coast, or because retail numbers told them that most people on RP-PvP servers are located there.
---
Remote desktop homie!
---
Yup it had AFK until i moved and walked then it went away.
---
I don't really care about efficiency, but I also don't want to handicap myself too much because of already limited time to play and how long its already going to take to get to 60. 
---
Is spamming a dungeon to get all (or most) of the items available to me (which I enjoy) a lot slower exp then spending the equivalent amount of time questing? This would be with PUGs and not overpowered/AoE compositions.
---
EU streamers acting like they stormed the beaches of Normandy and won all the world wars after last week.

Just... go kill something else?

Add-ons don't modify game data. I'm talking about manually modifying MPQ files. Add-ons simply extend the game with an approved API released by Blizzard. Modifying MPQ files is strictly prohibited. 
---
You're comparing apples to oranges.
---
No, absolutely not.  WTF is wrong with you idiots??  JFC....
---
yikes
---
How was not sleeping?
---
Good goy
---

---
seems like a lot of this could be solved by blizzard not polling convenience changes
---
I mean it makes sense to me tbh and I’ve been using combat log ever since I found about how useful it is so I’m inclined to go ahead and download.
---
Yep, you can't just jiggle around every couple minutes or it'll eventually figure out your game and kick you.
---
Happened to me as well.
---
keep this kinda shit in a gossip magazine where it belongs
---
If the mob is surrounded and you only want to pull one than use a curse that doesn’t cause damage and run back some....I would keybind your voidwalkers attack button so it’s easier to use (I did attack to mouse wheel up and follow to mouse wheel down) send your void walker in and he will torment and attack which should pull aggro immediately than you will throw your normal dots on and just wand...I wouldn’t do so many shadow bolts or anything....life drain after mana taps and use soul drain to keep shards....Theresa nifty macro you can use for drain soul where it auto deletes the shard I the last slot and replaces it with a new one if the bags full
---
Hes not really wrong tho
---
Stop it i am offline
---
I don't think this would surprise anyone that's spend any amount of time watching Esfand or Staysafe.
---
Sorry that some of us have RL shit come up that means we can't play very actively for an hour and don't want to wait in line for 5 hours to get back in cause of it.
---
Hope you never have something come up in your actual life that requires you to step away and help others.
---
I know. I petitioned blizz ticket to make lfg a default chanel
---
Oh no. I'm glad it's a thing. Don't get me wrong, just trying to explain what it is.
---
Well the race has been over and we all lost
---
Yeah! And free action pots!
---
Maybe there are other things that can put you on the "priority list", I only know about having a char doing that.
---
As war/pal slow to level?
---
I do only have limited time (I imagine I will take a long time to get anywhere).
---
I do like that line of thinking.
---
QQ’ers:  we want free transfers!
---
Blizzard:  ok.
---
QQ’ers:  this isn’t what we meant!
---
Let the drama..... Begin...
---
I mean, it's not disingenuous, that suggests that I'm not saying it in good faith. I don't know. That's why I asked.
---
Wailing Caverns has a higher drop rate for alli players.  Source: Am horde looking for baddies.
---
its called Dracarys!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yeah just do play for fun dude. I initially was like I need to grind it out but after a few days of that i realized there’s no point in rushing. Even if I want to raid classic raids arent that complex and MC is basically always going to be ran so I’m not far behind at all. Now I’m just slowly chipping away at it by slowly I mean fucking slowly cause I’m a warrior.
---
Thank you for the advice. Was the warrior too slow to level?
---
&gt;Streamers calling out streamers for being streamers
---
?????
---
&gt; Just came back after an hour and I was disconnected
---
What do you mean by this then? Was your 5-10 min intervals over the course of the 1 hour, or did you actually go AFK for 1 hour?
---
The fact that you can only wave to people of the opposing faction (on PVE) was enough to make me roll RP/PVP and troll the PVPers for giggles.
---
Personally, I'm loving [this classic walk](https://streamable.com/79a8v).
---
Back in the day it was trial and error on what fish mostly live where but now you can search fishing profession and you'll get some hints, other than that you have schools of fish spawn so think like a herb node just in the water and different types of fish.
---
DON'T join SM speedfarm groups as those are good xp but shit money. Most of my friends got maybe 80% of their 34-40 xp in sm groups and none of them could afford mount at 40.
---
Yeah but because it didnt happen, its impossible to say isnt it? The community was perfectly healthy with no huge deficit at all. Tens of thousands of people played on 1.12 private servers ever since BC released. And that's just the amount of people that both knew it existed, and had the wherewithal to install it.
---
Gets way easier at 20, I was double pulling quillboars for the tusks for days, cleave was doing some work
---
Well, I also just clicked on the shoulders to see what the stats were, so who's the real dummy....

---
Level 60 transferring to a fresh server?
---
Sounds like a Gankers wet dream.
---
People will come to you!
---
I still fail to see the difference between changing the UI of the loading screen vs the UI of the actual game
---
You know you play too much when you're cooking with the microwave, and it goes "DING!" and you scream "GZ"
---
100% its pain scrolling through tons of bnet friends to see my classic friends.
---
You can bring 40 people into your BRD instance to make short work of any mobs and anyway there is a shortcut run to the MC entrance which requires only a bit of lava swimming. It doesn't take long at all.
---
knows how to install addons, doesnt know how to print screen
---
The serpentbloom also respawns during the run, so if you stay in the dungeon after the final boss you can run back through and get them. Just be sure the group leader doesn't leave, or they transfer lead.
---
I lol'd.
---
I'm not even sure what you're trying to argue.  if you make a macro that jumps twice you're botting and it's against the tos.  bye
---
What is the song
---
Too slow to level is an understatement if you’re new to the game. If you’re new yes it’ll take longer with a warrior.
---
lol!
---
"I'm gonna be a shitty driver cause everyone else is too"
---
Right? Back then I deleted my hearthstone on accident, and didn’t even know I could get a new one. So I remade my character. Lol...
---
Life tap and hellfire do that.
---
That's a huge sticking point to me going back to retail since all my characters are on a dead realm. My husband and I play together, so it's $50 up front to start playing again, then at least another $50 to $100 if we want to keep our alts.
---
If they offered a package deal for server transfers, I'd consider it.
---
I had to have a hard talk with my son last week. We were on Whitemane and he kept saying just wait til Wednesday for the new servers. Didn’t make an difference. I finally convinced him to shift to Thunderfury, where we insta queue. We’re good, but I think he’s still pissed. Left behind a 25 rogue. Ah well.
---
Some people have leveled to 60 a dozen times on private servers and aren't interested in questing again. Others are streamers and don't want to be constantly camped in pvp.
---
Then bring pots, we have to go out and farm for our shit so you don’t have to run to the raid or dungeon. I’m not going to wast soulshards and run to a raid while your ass sits in iron forge. Bring water if you want a summons because your gonna be healing me back up. And we all know you will.
---
Fart Patrol
---
They opened up brand new servers for transfers only for the people with the larges populations. Those servers with 15-20k queues and bigger. The servers with constant but smaller queues are able to transfer to medium servers that already exist. They did it this way to prevent the issue you are talking about.
---
Google it
---
Its like leveling a warrior except you die a lot less because of heals and bubbles. Pally leveling gets a lot better around lvl 32 when you can spec into reckoning and pull multiple mobs.
---
Like Deadmines? That’s the dungeon I did when I first hit level 17 back when I tried WoW with the free trial.
---
Ty! Such a goofy thing but I love it
---
Even on classic the shaders aren't accurate to the original version. The lighting wouldn't look anything like that in vanilla.
---
And that's what's we appreciates bout you.
---
Yea and when you assume the server has 10,000 players on it during full times, thats only 166 mobs per player for one to drop. Really not all that rare from a server standpoint. 
---
Im only saying this because some people I know always talk about farming the mob with the highest chance and I try to tell them it literally doesnt matter from a statistics point of view. As long as the item has it in its loot table, thats all you need.
---
 Dude have you seen the army of millennials that follow these guys around?

*INTEREST YE INA PINT?*

Search 'druid macros' in the search bar. I literally just did this and found a lot of useful info.
---
boyfriend went warrior,had never played classic before (started in wrath). i tried to warn him but he ignored me, after a few hours i had to go priest to support him lol worth it tho!
---
Thanks for the response. I thought people were playing/grouping up with a guild or friends.
---
I know enough about myself that I'll never be able to quit wow completely.  I could never give up my favorite drug completely.  She's always there whispering to come back.
---
Even though wotlk was the last real expansion I did, I have still bought and played each following xpac just to level and see if the game improved.  It hasn't and retail is absolute garage.
---
Now with classic out I get the game I loved.  Luckily between what I did in vanilla and the dinking around  I did over the years I've achieved every "og" wow goal i had.  The only wow goal i never achieved that I'd still like to get is the black temple attunement.  That one eluded me.
---
I'm 2 days 10 hours and level 27 lol.  I've had to stay logged in cause I'm on Faerlina though so idk how much of that time is me moving around from my phone so I don't disconnect.
---
Lol wow well props for sticking with it that long! You're a true grinder
---
But what about the mushrooms?!
---
Interesting. I have tried to level alliance characters a few times, always ends the same way - I lose interest quickly. I do not enjoy playing Alliance.  Org will always be home. I have many many horde toons.
---
Targeting macros, pet call macros, starting rotation addons.
---
A lot of auto attacks and time can be saved to output more damage. But it's not THAT much more. It helps though
---
No weapon warrior.
---
It really depends on what you want. If you want to ultimately have all your characters support each other then yes they should be on the same server. Want to experience different server communities? You will have to have characters be split up obviously.
---
Someone who's not quitting complaining about others not quitting either.
---
It helps if you want to gun for late-game mounts. Also, at least on my server most Alliance players seem to be congregating in Stormwind or Ironforge (either doesn't matter so much because of the free tram), also talking about public chat trades, enchantments, most especially making bags with provided materials, and so on. 75% of alliance races start very close to each other, with the elves being the isolationists. Also as far as I can tell The Deadmines (also near Stormwind) is insanely popular. The lead-in zone was crawling with enemy corpses and I probably easily saw 10 or 20 different groups going in.
---
That was my guild lol I wasn’t in attendance. Or at least some of my guildies organized it.
---
What about when she decides to rule a Paladin? Then you are just one step away from getting refused bj's cause you needed that plate gear with +3 intellect. I mean, it had strength and stamina too! Stamina... its something she could probably use more of tbh.
---
An add-on adds onto the game via a Blizzard API. You place the add-on into a folder. 
---
Editing an MPQ means getting a third party program and hacking away at Blizzards game files. 
---
Very different and very bannable. The reason is editing MPQ you could alter models. Imagine turning a shamans totem into a giant pink statue giving you a clear advantage of killing it as you'd never miss it.
---
Not a mistake unless you don't like the server.   Your characters can help each other out with the different professions.  And you can trade through the mail.
---
Need everything and let RNGesus sort it out.
---
Our armor restores health over 5, we have cookies and drain life. 
---
Locks can be last to get heals and even a HoT is enough to keep us going.
---
Ah yes, doing it "wrong" by playing the game normally. If only they did it "right" by... spamming dungeon instances over and over again.
---
Did you ever stop to consider that if you have to go out of your way to level one specific way that none of the other classes need to do, maybe you're making up for a problem in the class design? Like... the fact that it's slow.
---
Had the same issue. You need to update battle net.

Its true. Right before BC I xfered from Ursin PvP to a new realm Shuehalo PvE as a free transer  The option to give up your "pvp rights" happened a few times before paid transfers were ever a thing.
---
Bartender. I just put 2 full length bars on top of each other and a scaled-up one above them, and 2 bars along the side. Takes about a minute to set up.
---
People racing track via the /who command and I've heard there's addons for it on [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com)
---
Nice! Nabbed him today on my night elf hunter after an 8 hour camp. He resisted the first tame and killed me and I thought someone would steal him before I could get back.
---
But... MC was pugged regular on pservers. I don’t know why people insists there is this challenge when there isn’t any, we are not talking about Naxx here this is MC and it is easy it’s very easy actually.
---
And then after everyone resubs, they drop $20 off BFA....
---
Other people asked in this thread and I posted some.
---
Alright dude. I'ma stop responding about the topic, considering you're putting words in my mouth. 
---
If I was agressive in my past comments I apologize, but this is a pretty stupid thing to actually get heated over.
---
I am just a passionate warrior player who knows leveling a warrior doesn't have to be slow. At level 41 I've done dungeons and questing.
---
do you not have phones?
---
The gold gain will increase a lot as you hit like mid level 30:s. Also like others have said, don't buy every skill. You can also check up on guides for grinding mobs for gold. It works and is reliable. 
---
 There are a lot of good grind spots. Cats in swamp of sorrows, basilisk cave stv etc. I haven't done it but I guess layering can be abused to use it more effectively. Have someone invite you to layer hop if the spot is taken or you are getting ganked for example.
---
 Can add that the best way to make gold is by playing the AH. Grinding mobs is pocket change in comparison to what you can earn by AH manipulation. It requires you to be a nerd about the game though. Have to know a lot about mats and items. What items are worth buying and reselling, how their value might go up and down depending on what phase etc.
---
 If you are not a veteran coming form private servers just stick to doing the reliable method of grinding. You can try and get into it of course and learn but avoid doing risky buys and resells. Sometimes it just doesn't pan out.
---
Many people took vacation time. Here in Germany it is normal for people to have about 28 days of vacation per year. And when you add people who work overtime it becomes even more. My sister is a paramedic. She has about 80 free days per year.
---
Thalnos? I feel you bro
---
I think hold control and drag them in a circle? Or maybe its shift? Try control first.
---
Dual wield is terrible when you have zero hit rating. Your mainhand hits for less than a 2h and your offhand won’t hit anything ever.
---
2h fury or 2h arms.
---
You sound like the exact type of person who would humiliate themselves in Barrens chat by taking the bait. "Being garbage people." Jesus.
---
I agree with the pets on that one, after a hellacious gnomer run! I only life tap like that when it time for everyone else to eat and drink, followed by eating (so long as the mage made food 😘) can’t say I’ve ever tapped out in a fight only here and there when it’s safe
---
It's a safe to use, old private server. However as an old private server, much of it's data is incorrect. I'd recommend classic.wowhead.com
---
Garr is not gonna break a single guild lol, please be real.
---
It’s like have rough toilet paper vs soft toilet paper. I agree with OP saying it should have its own section if there is room next to activisions releases. I personally prefer quality soft toilet paper. Just cause rough stuff works, doesn’t mean we can’t strive for a minor change.
---
Lol. Every aoe grinder I know. Every. Last. One. Gets immense pleasure when 5-7 of their mobs spawn at the same time, trapping and killing some poor sod.
---
Same with horde side Rattlegore. Lfg in trade chat is pretty sporadic
---
Starcarft has undergone this treatment too. With the noteable exception of Alarak, all characters are generally really boring.
---
How did you hear about it?
---
When i played vanilla i barrely spoke any english, and went at it at a slow pace, just doing random stuff. I ended up raiding, and managed somehow to get into mid aq40. Took me months to get to 60 back then. Now im level 58, still feels kinda slow as theres several 60s in my guild.. But i am getting there, its slow leveling a warrior
---
I got more sleep than most new parents, ate a healthy balanced diet, and feel good about it mostly.
---
The requirement for RFC is only your level. Gear is not important for most of the early dungeons. You get your gear by doing them.
---
As a frost mage you want Intellect and +Frost damage.
---
Damn I’m so jelous !
---
IMO as long as it is equipped immediately, and not for poor reasons (such as an int ring on warrior), then it should be allowed.
---
Look at it this way, if someone is naive enough to end a relationship over reddit advice, it's doing the other person a favor.
---
Why was this removed?

Saw a level 50 in the Wetlands yesterday.

I'm playing as a tauren warrior with my friend who's an undead priest. I'm trying to tank most of the damage, but as soon as my friend starts attacking a mob, it switches targets to him. I try to use Heroic Strike to keep my threat up, but usually the mob will go back to attacking my friend right after. What else can I do to keep my threat up? We're level 15 if that helps.
---
This is how it worked back in the day. Free transfers were to SPECIFIC realms only.
---
Diabetic?
---
You roll need on anything you need, be it healing DPS or tanking.
---
Lmao
---
I did. Sometimes you end up having to fight frost resistant mobs and it helps to have it leveled, but its not completely necessary. The real choice is up to you.
---
Squall!
---
Really? Is this confirmed? I would love to join capital cities trade chat to find dungeon groups.
---
Not OP but I’m doing the series since day1 of Classic if you want more content. I do quests but otherwise no trade, no ah, no party and no alts. Channel is CrystalF2P.
---
Also funny how I posted a similar thing a few days ago and I got attacked for “destroying the spirit of Classic” by playing solo...
---
My wife wants to come back but she has a baby to take care of. (Note, I've offered to help so she could play but she said she will wait to play when he is older)
---
Yes. You will come across mobs that have frost resistance or that can dispel your frostbolt or something like that
---
does your gear get damaged as well if you unstuck?
---
I'm deep feral and I've tanked plenty. Am I going to have perfect aggro every second of every pull? Of course not. The trick is to drop that expectation. 
---
Are people going to get one shotted and die and instawipe if they take a few hits on trash? Nope. 
---
Christ I wish I could get a group with two mages. I could just play in cat while everything gets kited and rooted.
---
Tell that to this guy's friends that don't want to play with him if he picks what he wants.  One side has to make a sacrifice.
---
Would work well if Northern Kalimdor had literally any end game Vanilla dungeons or raids. I think the only thing is the world raid Emerald Nightmare dragon boss.
---
Gotta start reserving names on the other servers I might transfer to just in case.

I think he set himself up. He had planned to play the whole week, starting Day 1. And we know how that went. We didn’t even get on til Tuesday. He recognizes this is better, for life/work/play balance. He was just idealistic. He works and there’s no one at his house to pre-queue for him. I’m retired at home, so I like being able to log on and off throughout the day. But yeah, we’ll see how things are in a month or so.
---
We're just the meme spec, so bad it's funny so why respec?
---
I think it’s merely most low level warlocks forget. You don’t need water or food while leveling so you don’t think of it, and your poor so you try to not buy things.
---
I played a Shaman my first go with Classic, and this time I’m a Warlock. I only remember because I was a healer before.
---
I think the removal would be balanced and extremely welcome, if for no reason than never being stuck only 1 energy away from doing something useful. If you really care, they could slightly lower opener costs to compensate.
---
That's a healthy population. If you open transfers from there you will kill the server. 30-60 minutes during prime time of launch week is high pop and healthy 99% of the rest of the day and stable after the first week or two.
---
If you genuinely think that, there are a lot of ways to become better. Learning how to utilize their toolkit and mitigate their weaknesses easily puts them more on par with most classes.
---
&gt; That won't work 40+
---
It does. I've tanked Maraudon as a Rogue. As long as you group does great DPS you can just cleave everything down before your healer goes oom.
---
Poor allies will never know the greatness of barrens chat
---
Yeah, I haven't touched retail since release.  
---
Playing the same character, Gnome Rogue, enjoying the pace, the difficulty and the fact that mistakes mean something.
---
I apologize if I've caused any offense either. I'm just saying Warrior absolutely takes longer to level if you want to level doing the same things other classes do. You can absolutely level it faster than that, it's just going to be slow to anyone trying to do the "default" experience.
---
Tough call sometimes. Yeah I always wanna okay with a friend but if they are too stubborn to join you or you reallllly just wanna play the other faction, that’s a tough choice.
---
Its cool, but the stats on the whirlwind axe are too juicy

Could not agree more. The old world redesign completely fucked with the pacing of the leveling, because suddenly, every questhub needed a flying point for some reason. I was literally questioning why blizz wasn't moving  slow riding back zu 40 again, moving on foot was so pointless.
---
If there are legit ghost town realms, they'll probably merge them with other ghost towns of the same type.
---
I run 200% + MSAA 2x. This way I get effectively 8x on polygon edges that MSAA catches and 4x on everything else.
---
why would that not be ok? that’s the best reason possible for rolling need of you actually need it and equip it straight away
---
You are going to be sorely disappointed then.
---
Nah, if you roll need and equip then it's not ninja looting.
---
Nope
---
Hi ClassicWow - I’m wondering if my husband will be able to start a free trial of the game and play WoW Classic for free up to 20, like you can in retail. Is there any sort of free trial for the game? He wants to try it but isn’t sold on the subscription.
---
What do you do if you run across a water elemental? Water elementals are immune to frost damage.
---
Traitor!
---
Well thats the thing. Ffxi didnt have end be all best in slots. There were different situations that made certain gear best in slot and you could change gear in combat. So players had these insane macros that utilized every situation to the fullest. 
---
So while one piece may be best for this situation, you would get upgrades for another.
---
Mages are the best example. They basically change gear sets for almost every spell.
---
Sorry I have encountered multiple people already. No reason to be offended over it.
---
Close, but no.
---
Did you need it?
---
If so yeah you’re fine IMO. Unless you’ve established otherwise beforehand
---
It would be gay if it were homosexually
---
Just do it off stream.
---
Epic
---
Exactly. The people doing this are younger. OG WoW players know all about that alt+z &gt; prt scrn action.
---
It's so odd how the people responsible for building out the tech behind the internet and our smartphones are somehow considered to be bad at tech. 
---
I'm not even a Boomer and this shit is getting old. I and older generations troubleshot and fixed PCs at home successfully without the world's knowledge at our fingertips via a dedicated internet connection or service.
---
It was the only way for a pally. Second TBC came out I made a BE.
---
God among men to resist while being tempted on that kinda level.
---
If it is too high to equip and someone else can use it now, you should ask if it is OK to roll. Otherwise, this is what the loot system is for.
---
it was like that 15 years ago.
---
people just started doing less because automatically it made and joined channels for you.
---
like when wow first came out you had to join some of the channels manually.
---
It's missing the mandatory "from Chuck Norris" bit
---
And added a couple more servers.
---
I don't disagree with you but I think Blizzard is caught on the backfoot of the success of Vanilla. It comes down to expectations really. When I saw Blizzard only released 2 original PvP servers for EU English I knew they had no idea how to handle a launch event and therefore I expected things to be a shitshow for the first weeks.
---
Yea, 5460 days long
---
You have to be standing to do that.
---
For heavens sake, People said since LICH KING they wanted classic back, now it is back, and you people start to complain about Classics annoying quirks?   
---
God, someone understand this community. This is exactly what you wanted. Nothing else.
---
Nice binds, lmao.
---
Terribly long week.
---
Repost?  Saw this a few days ago.  Get deleted for some reason?
---
Lol he sounds bitter
---
Did you run back and physically loot the boss to get the mace?
---
Indeed. It makes me sick to my stomach how many people want to see classic advance through the expansions again. We fought so hard and so long for vanilla wow and these idiots want to throw it away again. If the classic servers go to TBC I will cancel again. I wanted vanilla. Not burning crusade. Not wrath. Not Cataclysm. Just Azeroth forever.
---
Word, gone is the sense of seclusion and greed in Azeroth.  I have 3 bags equipped that people who I grouped with gave me.  That is pretty awesome.  I even had the casual chat with a rando while fishing in the barrens.  I don't need another expansion, I don't need another mmo, I am home.
---
Yassss! I agree !
---
&gt;Early on in the meta.
---
Sorry man, but unless you have a time machine you're about 15yrs too late. The meta was established over a decade ago.
---
If you don't move now there's a very big chance you will sit in infinite queues on phase 2 when layering is removed.
---
Feel free! :) And good luck
---
&gt; It's not just 1.12, it's 1.13
---
Imagine my shock when the loudest people are the dumbest.
---
The realm won’t die if all the people who are waiting 3 hours to play move to the new realm.
---
Would have given it up.  Slightly shady to keep it.
---
I would meet him on the battlefield
---
I’ve gained a few guildies by running into the same person over and over for dungeons and group quests it’s nice!
---
I like when the warlock will stop me from topping them off to save my mana. I'm one of those OCD healers as someone else said. However, I don't mind throwing heals their way in between fights and typically use downranked spells to conserve
---
So you want a #1?
---
You really don't get it, no one is saying that they are bad and i don't need help playing this game since I started playing when the game came out and warrior was my first 60, still does not changed the fact that warrior is slow to level and the slowest class.
---
I agree, having leveled many mages as fire, frost and hybrids.  Rank 1 frost bolt is always there as a fast snare.  If you team up with a frost mage too, you will truly rule.
---
&gt;Unless you live under a rock and have no idea how groups/raids work in WoW you have no excuse for not knowing something was wrong.
---
There still was a penalty for having large groups. It's not like the XP was the same for 10 mans vs 5 mans. The issue is that there was supposed to be a bigger penalty than there was, which nobody who didn't play vanilla would know.
---
You act like this is common knowledge, but I bet you didn't know something was wrong, either. If not, why did everyone who supposedly knew there was an issue stay quiet until after Blizzard pointed it out?
---
Your tone makes you sound bitter, and your timing suggests you were oblivious to the issue at the time. Both of them together suggest sour grapes because you missed out on some xp.
---
Alliance. As I said a lot of the time it's fine. Most game-related chat I've run into is stuff like trades for rares, mats for bags/enchants, newbie questions for quests and stuff in low level zones, and LFGs for group quests and dungeons. Fairly standard stuff. But that remaining sliver of the time it's often Blizzard/BfA hate, political spam, a surprising amount of chat that's like "you think LGBTs are people lol", and so on. I'm not sure if Atiesh is heavier on Alliance or not but the areas around Stormwind and Ironforge are insanely dense with people even with layering, I was shocked at how the Deadmines area looked in particular just being camped hardcore.
---
Fuck that
---
there was no loot
---
As long as you aren’t in /1 chat you can type out a sentence and click “shift and then click on the item in your bag” it will then put the item in to chat
---
It won't end well. They'll end up losing players because, believe it or not, being on a low pop/dead server often causes people to get bored. They need social interaction or at the very least to not feel like they're playing a singleplayer game. Especially with how group heavy classic is.
---
And I'm not saying they should be offered 24/7. I don't know why straw manning seems to be popular in these replies so far, but you're completely misconstruing what I'm saying. 
---
If we get a confirmation that Blizzard will reactive server transfers to specific servers down the line so that if the servers we're changing die, we have a fall back plan...we'll be more comfortable with changing. I'm not saying anything about 24/7 transfers. I'm saying when the statistics point to something needing to be done, they do it. 
---
As it stands right now, I will not be surprised one bit if most server queues don't change that dramatically. Just remember this post when that happens.
---
Im having such a struggle finding where to go with my shaman, i can't find any help and i haven't been able to find a "good" guide that doesn't cost money... help pls
---
Why and even how would you have both clients up at the same time though. Retail WoW is so extremely broken on the technical level that i find it pretty much unacceptable at this point.
---
You can accept it at lvl 30 but I think it’s like level 35 or 36.
---
Yep.
---
Rank 1 Frostbolt&gt;Frostbolt&gt;Frostbolt&gt;Frostbolt&gt;Frost Nova&gt;Blink&gt;Frostbolt.
---
Toss in the occasional odd spell.
---
It's slightly different in dungeons. You can be put into combat by proximity so you need to stand away from the pull, unlike in open world (also in raids, the entire raid enters combat on pull).
---
you think you do but you dont.
---
Did you try google? It’s the first thing that pops up if you type in “enable num lock MacBook Pro.”
---
On cast. Otherwise you could AoE mobs with blizzard and have infinite mana.
---
If he enjoys playing that way who are you to stop him.  Let him enjoy it the way he wants.
---
WoW quests are (mostly) just slayer, you've been HAD.
---
This is not a horde exclusive trait.
---
Source: Troll Priest.
---
You're going way too much into this. All im saying is that its not a huge deal if another class tanks for a few seconds in the lower level dungeons because he pulled aggro.
---
If i would wait to not pull aggro on every single mob with some tanks i would need to wait like 5-10 seconds on each mob before i start dpsing. 
---
That will make a 20 min dungeon run into a 40min dungeon run.
---
Why do NE do this? Their area is cool.
---
I love how this guy is impossible to find when you want to tame him, but when you want to survive a walk through the barrens at lvl 10 he's always right behind you
---
Nah bro your playing with greedy pricks if its an upgrade need if its for wealth then its greed so as a mage if boe cloth drops and its an upgrade i dont even ask but im always my groups leader and i roll with 2 friends most the time so we normal just get free rain
---
I love Classic WoW so much for reasons like this. So many wholesome people have rejoined the game. It's amazing seeing how the community is coming together
---
The default experience, sure. 
---
But utilizing your classes strengths is what wow is about.  I do several runs of dungeons until I get some updated gear. I knock out several quests that are green to the same level as me. While killing mobs you pool rage on one and kill two mobs at once with sweeping strikes, cleave, and ww.

As a whole class classic warlock and mage are more different than shaman and rogue in retail. Rotations are not what define classes in retail or classic, it's everything else.
---
This was my answer too, I was then surprised to find out they also played in vanilla and were planning to play classic soon.
---
depends, what’s your class? I’m assuming you needed the phantom blade, if they’re of that opinion then they’d all roll need like I’ve seen when something really valuable drops
---
And the 5 years ago doesn’t reset? Stupid
---
This is Bagnon. I wasn't aware of Bartender having a one bag option, I'll have to check it out.
---
Alliance too, guild Icon. I saw some trumpster nonsense, but he was quickly shunned by the rest of /1. I'd have freaked the fuck out of that lgbt remark. Sorry you saw that
---
Those queue times are bearable to most. The rest of these realms are experiencing queues 4+ hours for half of the day.
---
This is me.
---
That could be the cursor snapping to center. I think it's a DirectX issue. Been a problem for some people in retail since at least Legion.
---
Or one called Kuppid.
---
In dungeons you want to do the opposite of this. Combat can be entered by proximity, so if you are dropping a renew before combat you want to be standing far away so as not to enter combat.
---
You don't have a wand? Also most casters have a very simple repetitive rotation of spells. Truly you can throw in whatever extra damaging spells you want, but one rotation will always be more efficient whether it's in damage or mana preservation.
---
Spamming frostbolt is just efficient. Maybe get into more engaging fights that force you to be more creative with your spell use? If fighting is boring and simple to you, you might not be challenging yourself enough.
---
Eh. That doesnt seem far off in my experience. An 8000 queue is typically like 2-3 hours.
---
Why are you texting though. One of you playing at work?
---
Yeah they don't drop the quest item I need from them, fuck em.
---
Amazing how one wisp can convey desperation without a sound.
---
Congrats! I was able to play with you a tad on launch but it appears you far exceeded my level! Congrats! 
---
-Shwae on Stalagg
---
Start with a frostbolt for slow, then fireball. You can always toss in a quick fire blast after one of those as well.
---
- He's been around a long time, having built up his viewer-base in MoP/WoD prior to twitch exploding in popularity the way it did in 2015~2017
---
- He exaggerates and plays into his neckbeardy traits for humor (which people either laugh with him or at him)
---
- A lot of people find those traits easy to relate to (or feel smugly superior to)
---
- He's basically always online, so he's very convenient for watching on a whim.
---
- He's *very* interactive with his viewers during the moment to moment
---
- He generally hosts a lot of community events for his stream
---
- He's very high affect (which compensates for WoW being horribly ill-suited for the moment-to-moment excitement/activity that streaming thrives on)
---
- He tolerates a degree of shit-talking levied toward him (Biggest example being bald jokes) which is one of the few things that Twitch Chat can actually be used for when there's so many viewers that messages scroll faster than it's humanly possible to read 3 words.
---
Beyond that he also got a massive boost of both fame and infamy through third parties taking his streams, chopping them into clips, and spamming them on youtube (which coupled with his existing youtube popularity, the near-complete lack of comparable competition on youtube for warcraft content, the sheer volume of videos and their long lengths resulted in Youtube's algorithms basically going haywire and recommending all those videos to anyone who ever once searched for anything related to warcraft)
---
To make the youtube matters he has apparently stated on many occasions that he has no intention or desire to crack down on people editing &amp; reuploading his streams as he has no desire to upload them himself.
---
So although he has very often made jokes like "If I don't watch [the video his donor asked him to watch] then the people on youtube won't be able to steal it and upload it so that the other people on youtube can steal *that* and upload it as clips? I'm responsible for a whole content ecosystem here!" it doesn't really solve things for the people (myself included) who find it absolutely infuriating when it becomes seemingly impossible to avoid hearing about something
---
It's also worth noting that he was nowhere near as hated back in late MoP to early WoD before the youtube spam kicked into overdrive sometime in early legion.
---
Sorry if this is kinda over-long or over-rambly I've got the headache from hell and it is not making it easy to keep a clear train of thought.
---
Mages can decurse, aura is worthless compared to replacement value of literally any ranged DPS, and resto offers rebirth + innervate
---
back in MoP I transfered my characters who had always been alliance, to horde to play with some friends, and stopped caring about factions then.  
---
But now here I am dunking on folks just because they're horde x.x
---
Was it something worth ticketing for help?  If not, it’s probably not worth wasting time over.  Weird shit happens sometimes.  Have seen plenty of loot hiccups over the years where somehow the entire bosses loot drop becomes unlootable or just plain disappeared.
---
They just never needed to add those instant dungeon group finders and stuff. It makes things more convenient for sure, but it also hinders the need to communicate with others by a huge margin. Especially by the first or second expansion when they made dungeons your #1 way of gaining exp. I would much prefer a more social community over an easier time grouping any day of the week. Completely unneeded sacrifice.
---
Whitemane is the 4chan server, so it's most definitely not the best server in the game lmao
---
Does not seem to work. However i am using other addons so guess that could be why
---
Looks like domino's and x-perl maybe
---
I might have some old trial codes around. I'll see if I can find them.
---
Some tracking ones can be particularly helpful, like beast tracking if you are a skinner. For the most part though you can skip any of them as long as you don’t skip too many (more than 6 or 7) you’ll be fine. You won’t be world first power leveler, but you’ll still enjoy the game
---
I'm striking a balance between nostalgia and making concessions on certain things. On retail I'm an elv UI user with various other addons to supplement.
---
On wow classic I'm simply using a one bag, a bag sorter, some texture reskins for the unit frame health bars and portraits, and then a few other things that fit very appropriately with the "classic" UI theme and are things I feel kinda dumb not having, like classic aura durations, classic cast bars.
---
This is not a personal experience. And I believe the person in question rolled need after others had clicked greed.
---
Top quality shit post right here guys
---
Yep you should reroll immediately because mage on PvE is mind numbingly boring. PvP they are quite fun tho.
---
How? They have literally the best cleave in the game. Tanking dungeons while doing the highest damage easily. You come out of the dungeons with decent gear and do lower level quests which give the same experience. 
---
Anyway. This is putting me in a shit mood. Peace.
---
How are diminishing returns calculated in classic? (1.12)
---
I keep finding different answers, basically want to know for my mace rogue stuns
---
I'm one who cares about his name. I saved the name on all PvP servers when I could. Then Bigglesworth came out and GUESS WHICH SERVER ALL MY FRIENDS DECIDED TO PLAY ON? *cries* ^^(It was taken)
---
I wish they would be more open about explaining  the layering though.
---
The amount of times I have to explain to people that I can't seem them crafting outside of org bank unless they're in party has been a little too much
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-leveling-classic-wow
---
&gt; People would spend hundreds of dollars for the name "Lung" on other games
---
wat
---
&gt; it's nice to see them finally get some credit.
---
The problem is that a lot of developers do shitty stuff like all the time. When things go right, people **are** praising the companies. It's just that it seems so rare nowadays.
---
Hopefully Blizzard considers this moving forward - all the whining about what they're doing isn't from eternally ungrateful people. It's from people who really want to have fun with their products but feel like Blizzard doesn't "get it."
---
Playing in separate rooms + sleeping baby
---
We had some good ones on Kromcrush
---
What time zone? I play after work every day but I’m on a different server. Usually about 9pm pst login
---
Hey, I need that bit of extra help leveling up my combat skills.
---
The queues have made me play a lot more than I wanted to, once you're in you feel compelled to keep going.
---
"be the first to type /roll" this I remember very well, a lot of players have the same reaction,, just tune into that and have fun take care good luck:) I enjoyed your post chief , very much:)ty.
---
That's a weird picture of Stitches.
---
My first time around I went for skinning/leather working and I liked it a lot. Especially when you are in barrens because you solo grind tons of quests where you can farm leather.
---
This time around I'm going for Mining/Engineering. It's not as fun to level up early on but I'm feeling the long-term payoff will be great for a hunter who focuses on beast mastery.
---
Still. That's a sixfold difference
---
I'm alliance and I ran both multiple times so...I dunno, make a group or something?
---
At least you can take the damage. It took me several tries to kill [Krethis Shadowspinner](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12433/krethis-shadowspinner) in Silverpine Forest on my 13 mage. His stupid Shadow Shield was too much for me to handle. I was able to zerg him down finally.
---
Nahhh you good.  But if you're interested try making one that completes a pair of actions with one button and see where it takes you :)
---
After struggling to hit level 16 during the work week I dedicated my entire long weekend to grinding some levels and managed to hit level 30 on Monday just by questing. I play on Faerlina where the queues can get like 5 hours long, so my solution to avoiding the queues was to basically just play the entire day lol. It has been a long time since I've nolifed a game like that, and it was such a fun time.
---
Now I'm slowing it down a bit and leveling up my professions. Sitting at work right now and all I can think about is getting back in there!
---
I think ravager is your best bet, seeing as you play horde. It can carry you until 43/44 then you can spam Uldaman to get either stoneslayer or the two hand mace which are better than ww axe.   Goodluck fellow warrior.
---
I have submitted a ticket. Damn. Was hoping for some miracle.
---
Throw in some arcane missiles after the first frost bolt. Also the instant fire spell(can’t think of the name). Wand at 20%
---
Only if you listen to the masses, and are rushing to 60. U have many more spells than frostbolt. I dont care what everyone says and play a deep fire mage and I have a great time.
---
One frostbolt to slow, two firebolt, frostnova and back up, fire blast (I believe its called) and most enemies are dead.
---
Gets even better at higher lvls with pyroblast!
---
Glhf, hope you find your groove
---
:')
---
They’re more likely to just merge or connect low pop realms down the line than just straight up giving away more free transfers BACK onto higher pop realms.  Stay where you are and deal with the overpopulation now, hoping it dies down over the next few weeks, or accept the potentially permanent consequences of moving to these new realms free of charge so you can spend more time playing than in a queue.
---
Could we also get out straight into the character selection screen while we're at it.  Changing to to the Oceanic Tab then selecting my server becomes old ... fast.
---
I’ve had no queue entire launch :)
---
Can use  /castsequence  and type a chain of spells that with each click to move onto the next spell.
---
Example 
---
/castsequence Faerie Fire, Moonfire, Bearform, Maul, Catform.
---
Idk if cancel form fits in it but could try.
---
*That's why it's the best server.*
---
\/e has reported you AFK. Type /afk to avoid removal from the group.
---
*10 people leave AV*
---
Im super happy in the game right now, only at level 11 because I have a really short amount of time to play everyday. But I've already made 1 random new friend, better than the entirety of the last expansion. 
---
It's great to experience the levelling process as a process again, and with the social aspect I remember enjoying back in vanilla. It might not last forever but I sure as hell think my money resubbing for Classic is well spent.
---
Because of this post I ended up going to Goldshire and did the same. Felt good!!
---
There's a mortal strike tanking spec.
---
You miss out on some damage abilities and some tanking talents, it's not bad for an offtank.
---
Dope
---
Tired to grab him last night, fought another hunter for the tame after he appeared after me.
---
After sabotaging each others' tames for a bit, I let him have it because I had to work early. :z
---
I understand that blizzard disallows it and places it as part of unchangable files. I'm just wondering why they would do it for an image rather than textures or things of that nature.
---
Oh I did which is why I gave up on trying for Stalagg(server I name reserved on) for a week
---
That is what I've been trying for 2 days
---
Enjoy the journey. It’s worth it
---
good tip to basically get a full tame without even getting hit, place a frozen trap in the line the mob will run, Concuss shot it, begin tame. Beast runs into freeze trap while taming (now it's frozen). Should get you 80% of the tame each time :)
---
Only real viable one would be pet call. Lmao
---
Hard, yes, worth it hell yes. You basically have to do a lot of dungeons, or just be 2 levels over whatever zone/quest area, or find a buddy to leave with.
---
No that's fine but I'm not sure if it cost coin to send to your own players. I think "postage" 30c 
---
I usually sell stacks of 1. Often ppl just buy what they need to lvl their crafting and it moves really quickly. It is a pain to do it  unless you have an addon like auctionator.
---
I did this back in vanilla, I was constantly succumbing to class envy which is why I never ended up raiding. I'd level up a guy close to max and reroll another toon because I wanted what the other classes had. This time around I'm determined to hit 60 and at least attempt end game content.
---
I plan on going for a max out for beast mastery as well, at least while I level to max.
---
The loot is not my big concern. It's the mechanics that puzzles me.
---
It is the first time I play Vanilla WoW. I just dont know if the dice result still counts after you temporally left the instance, and counld someone intentionally exploit it.
---
are you wearing mail? warriors are the easiest to level but slowest imo, you should be able to withstand plenty
---
Warriors are very gear dependent and just struggle in combat while leveling. Sometimes you're going to get crushed by anything that is your level and especially above. You'll spend a lot of time grinding lower level mobs just to level up so you can do lower level quests. It's truly a painful journey that only some truly find worth it
---
Worry about resto later.
---
Level as enhancement. You can heal just fine without resto spec for all 5 mans
---
Shaman. 
---
It's versatile and world pvp is a blast. You can tank early dungeons,heal or dps. Solo is great but above all you have so much fun utility! Screw optimized raid builds (resto only i guess). Shamans are just fun!
---
This is the only funny meme I’ve seen about long queues.
---
Afaik just your brain
---
It's a lot better, even on Shazrah. I'm logging in with no queue around 11am these days which wasn't possible a few days ago. The free transfers will only help things.
---
They wanted your action bar to be A E S T H E T I C
---
sorry, I meant P A T H E T I C
---
What kind of self-congratulating bullshit is this fucking post? And it’s a guild advert. What the fuck
---
Server transfer's were in vanilla and Blizzard has said they will think about server transfers for classic.
---
It is an extra income source from classic, so it will almost certainly happen, probably after phase 2.
---
If battlefield has one we fucking deserve one.
---
What do you mean?
---
Let me copy a classic character over to WoW 2.0 so I can play both and they can take all my money.
---
Sunder armor if aggro is your priority, heroic strike if aggro is less important than damage.
---
last night i had 5 hunters there each of us were too stubborn to leave (i was already there 8 hours) so we all just killed him as soon as he spawned lol.
---
Things pick up for warrior around level 40, it’s a hard hill to climb. A few tips is to always carry food on you and level first aid. Any time you see someone doing a quest near you invite them to group and ALWAYS be looking for a weapon upgrade. Sometimes in the early levels a 1 handed weapon can be better than a 2 hander if your 2 hander is out dated
---
I would say it depends on play style. I plan to pull multiple mobs when possible and use SoL + reckoning. When facing a single mob I will go SoR + reckoning. I dont plan on it being the fastest spec but if I remember correctly, the mix of survivability and damage felt really good.
---
This is gold, please let us know if you make more content like this! Loved it!  
---
The fps alligning with the slomo run was priceless, I couldn't stop looking!
---
Engineering.
---
many people think that because that is the only 100% fair way. 
---
It can be used by anybody. The hundreds of gold might get someone their mount that they otherwise may never have time to farm and obtain. That's an upgrade too. Or a rare recipe from the AH to finally craft his BiS tailoring chest piece. You can argue that the guy who needs it for an upgrade is being a dick for depriving the other people of all that gold which can be used to buy themselves upgrades.
---
Horde Stalagg
---
I don’t understand why people don’t learn spells.   It’s not that much gold. Gold making is not hard people.
---
Oh OK. I missed that some how
---
From what I understand this would not be possible.  In classic (and I assume in original Vanilla) when one person enters combat with Mag, then entire raid is flagged for combat. Unless Mag is a special case and doesn't count as a raid boss for some reason.
---
Thanks! This got the ball rolling and I eventually figured out the root cause.
---
It took me awhile to figure out how to update from 11378 to 11379 because the solution isn't totally obvious.
---
I had to go to settings (top left drop down), and then select the 'Beta' tab. There I found a button named 'Switch to Beta' which bumped my launcher up to 11379. 
---
Also as a side note, uninstalling and then reinstalling the launcher still put me at version 11378. The only way that I could get to 11379 was manually through settings.
---
However, updating didn't solve everything. The drop down menu appeared after the update, but the only option in the drop down was retail. Instead, the real reason why classic didn't appear as an option is because I made a dumb assumption about the free WoW trial.
---
Somebody told me that "if you're able to play retail, you can play Classic," and I naively took that a step further and assumed that since the WoW trial would let me play retail, it would also let me play Classic.
---
Sorry for the troubles!
---
Yes 100%. As someone previously stated, some MoBs are resistant/immune to certain element damage types. So you'll need another element to damage them... I guess you could use arcane instead of fire.
---
I just dish out ignores hardcore and it fixes the chat temporarily
---
Sounds like your files are being deleted
---
Just an awesome looking kitty that's hell to get. Also cat's have great attack speed so if you pvp it screws on casters hard
---
Well, speaking from experience I can't say I'd do it again since I rolled a druid this time XD. But I do miss my warrior a lot.
---
I played a warrior during stress tests.  Found it difficult until the second one where I grouped with a couple of others early in the test to get a quest done.  The group broke up except for myself and a priest.  We pretty much played the rest of the test together.  Was a godsend.
---
So Tina, if you are reading this, thankyou!
---
What do you mean? People are transferring out of full realms, but less full realms are "unlikely" to get more people? Where do you think people will transfer to?
---
Same here, but I'm the est version. Log in like 6 pm est done by 10 or 11 usually.
---

The strong level a warrior to 60, and reap the rewards. Keep going!
---
There was a person afk on the duskwood road , and i stayed to watch as stitches killed them, thinking i was safe on the side of the road, but as soon as he was done he went after me
---
I've got my Tauren hunter up to lvl 12, but I have no idea what to do with my talent points,  and advice?
---
That I'm not sure of. I was able to find a source on the wow forums (a forum MVP, not a Blizzard employee) that said the LUA Engine doesn't bootup until after the loading is complete thus not allowing access to it via add-ons since it's still being bootstrapped. I'm not sure why it was decided it couldn't be changed, I just wanted to make sure you were aware before you found an MPQ editor and started hacking away.
---
I'm certainly not saying not to do it, but I am letting you know the possible ramifications so that you can make an informed decision.
---
Druids are great healers, good ranged or melee dps, and ok tanks. Super mobile, good for pve and pvp.
---

How on earth did you not die!

---
Is auctioneer better than auctionator?
---
ugh those hallways, and pet pathing... ugh!
---
I love it &gt;:)
---
To be fair, dungeon runs were still really popular back in the day and everyone loved mages for water and great CC. It may be dungeon spell cleave groups now, but the love of mages is still all the same.
---
Also weirdly enough I very rarely see spell cleave groups forming, I'm on the Westfall realm which is definitely more casual friendly though. We only just recently got our first 60 on the server.
---
At least dailies in BC weren't required in the way they made them requirements in Legion
---
Vanilla, my friend
---
Totally fine, for the most part. But don't get too discouraged by macros just because they look hard to program, or because you don't understand what they do right now. A lot of people have already written them, and you can just play it out and if you see the advantage later you can pick them up.
---
For instance, look at warlocks. They have improved life drain, which lets them recover mana after getting the killing blow on a mob. There are two problems: one, your void walker can get the killing blow, meaning you don't get the extra mana, and two, if you doing it all the time (which you should be doing solo) then you will fill up your bags with soul shards. You can write a macro so that when you cast drain soul, your VW stops attacking, and you delete the last shard out of your soul bag automatically so that you don't fill past your soul bag limit.
---
Its by no means a necessity, but it's a decent quality of life improvement when you're talking about killing thousands of mobs across your 1-60 journey.
---
The only macro I 100% recommend everyone makes is also the easiest, a /target macro. When there's a hard to find mob, you can make a macro that just says /target [insert name of mob you want to find here]. Spam it around, and you'll know when one is nearby even if you don't see it.
---
Layering doesn’t change the amount of concurrent players a realm can have logged in.
---
When you find a tank why don't you offer some assistance post dungeon, help with quests, offer bags, provide health pots etc. As in become his friend. I found two tanks and get asked to their groups all the time now to the point where I no longer need to LF1M tank.
---
That’s exactly what I chose for mine lol. Ty for the advice
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
This isn't totally true, there were some PvE -&gt; PvP free transfers back in Vanilla. They were done specifically to entice players off of high pop PvE realms.
---
They're not doing it this time, but mixing realm types was a (infrequent) thing.
---
Only 2 hours!?

Healers all having a resurrects isn't a bad thing. And shamans have been able to hex for over 10 years now, so it's not like its a new addition or anything. Also hunters don't have a pally bubble either.

Hey man, this is the kind of emergent gameplay that Classic is good at bringing out.  Have fun whatever way it presents itself, and good on you for helping people.
---
As long as you join the clearly superior Alliance.
---
Nope.
---
Yeah, this sub is not very honest about classic vs retail. They tend to ignore any flaws that classic has
---
Great points. Thank you!
---
That's what you get for cutting corners. 😛
---
It's not hillsbrad, it's Arathi. Cyclonian is harder than the elementals that drop the charms, sure. But you still aren't even contributing meaningful dps in a group to farm burning charms, and you need to kill a lot of high level elementals to even get the essence of the exile. 
---
Sure, this is doable at level 30. You can buy the liferoot, solo the bloodscalp tusks in stranglethron at 30 using sunder spam, and then buy the charms on the auction house and beg someone to kill cyclonian for you. But I felt that was needleessly complex, when the real answer is 
---
"if you have to ask what corpsemaker is, you want it". Even if you intend to get whirlwind early, it's a LOT easier to farm bloodcalp tusks in stranglethorn with a corpse maker.
---
nah that sounds boring mate sorry
---
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not 😂 Silverhand wasn't bad but the population imbalance was pretty terrible in favor of Alliance. It was also one of the original servers so there is a lot of history.
---
Smashing!
---
I've been doing this alot with anything I come across that I can't use. Also if I'm mass producing Leatherworking gear I'll inspect a player to see if it's better and just open a trade window if they want it. It feels better than selling to vendors and I don't want to worry about AH till later.
---
I've tanked enough to do it pretty well, yet I still say noob tank (cause I dont need to get all sweaty) when I lfg and I'm flooded with tells.  I think the tank/healer to dps imbalance that is ever present in mmos is probably worse without a system to find the groups automatically.
---
I agree Sulfuras is fine. I either get right in, or have a small queue (40 mins has been the longest so far).

---
When the original 3 PvP east servers were announced it was decided Faerlina would be the streamer server, Thanols the South American server and Herod for everyone else. So it was just an unlucky roll for you it would probably be in your best interest to transfer because the South American players went to the server they decided they all wanted to play on before launch.
---
Are u food?
---
But it is better tho? I’ve logged in at 2-4pm with low to zero queue times
---
Thanks
---
Im a bit surprised so many people think you only need on your role your filling. No hybrid levels in a healing spec. As a shaman I would absolutely rather roll on enh gear for leveling rather than resto gear that I only use briefly in dungeons.
---
Meanwhile, some guy I see in general chat is advertising his crappy Chinese restaurant in New Jersey. I loot a chest that I killed all the gnolls for and he comes up and spits on me...

There is definitely a following for challenges like this but it is a niche following. Best of luck to you if you try it out!

You don't have to apologize for the low quality photo ever again. WoW has a screenshot feature built right in where it automatically saves it just by pressing printscreen. And since you are on your computer already, you can add it to a reddit post with no need to upload it anywhere else. Reddit has a built in photo uploading tool which you know since you used it on your phone. Now just use it on the computer. I'm amazed that more people don't know about PrntScreen in WoW. Not trying to be a dick. Just helping.
---
Damn really? I’m definitely making one. I’ve always loved the class fantasy but always played warrior for some reason
---
Can you left click drag on your desktop, basically is it just in wow
---
As a mage you gotta do aoe mob grinding. No frostbolt
---
But it seems different layers have different chat channels? Earlier a guildie was recruiting. (Sending out a recruitment macro every 5 or so minutes into general) We were in the same zone but I couldn't see these messages. I posted some messages out, he couldn't see mine and neither could two other guilides. But the two other guildies could see his.
---
Left and rejoined general. No difference. Two guilides invited me and into a group. Now they could see my messages but before that, myself and those 3 other guildies were not reading the same general.
---
I definitely have the impression that something is wrong with you.  Let it go, man.
---

---
Friends on your server should be on the top of the list. Its annoying I have to scroll down to see them. I really dont care if someone is playing hearthstone but I would like to see who I can maybe oarty up with.
---
OR could have wait for the free transfer to new realm. Whitemane will get its transfer to the new, Aracanite Reaper

fortnite is the most popular game in the world, doesn’t have multiple realms and cut relates to combat
---
lung is an organ and there will be tens of others with the same name
---
I think people are severely over estimating how dead these servers are gonna be in a month.  I don’t see any signs of wow slowing down as quickly as you all think.
---
Sap for rogues. im only lvl 21 at the moment so i dont know if it gets better as you rank it up but i started playing just before wotlk. i had no idea sap was such a terrible spell.  65 energy, melee range, brings you out of stealth. ?!?!?!?  thats horrid.
---
In the next day. So my guess is tomorrow since its already late. And it will be available for a whole day to transfers only before being opened to the general population to assure you get your names and whatnot.
---
Any good FD + trap macro? Mine is a little wonky but I don't know if it's the macro or how hunters work in classic.
---
Google should have pointed you directly to a forum post from Blizzard covering this very topic. Should not have been that hard to find it.
---
Yeah, poor people don't deserve to have hobbies, how dare they decompress.
---
The night after I posted that I had nearly 20g and then it all got decimated by the skill and profession trainers :(
---
I'm back to consistently hovering around 15g, but barely.
---
I feel like the current low/medium pop servers with no transfers into them might end up dying. The best hope for them was overflow from current full servers, but it looks like there will be brand new servers to take the excess. 
---
I also don't think it will drop the populations of the full by that much. Most people will stay put as long as the queue becomes tolerable. Full servers have been full since launch when anyone could have rerolled on a smaller server (less time invested at that point). They remained full despite the crazy queues because people didn't want to switch even though they would have only lost a couple days /played by that point.
---
Yeah this is what I thought. I think its a retail mindset to roll need on only your role you're filling in the dungeon. Leveling gear is way more desirable for a hybrid.
---
Fire is a lot more interesting (opinion) and completely viable (fact) for leveling. Also has 70% pushback protection.  Pyro is fun for an opener or pound 1.5 sec Improved Scorches into their face. Very hard to interrupt.  As fire, you can also just use r1 Frostbolt (1 sec cast) as your snare.  Or CoC.  Mage is fun as hell.
---
I can almost guarantee that will be the mindset of many and hardly anyone will leave off Herod. We have held out this long and today there were no queues at 2pm for the first time. We are slowly winning this war of attrition, I’m not moving.
---
Did someone approach you like you did with her?
---
I got banned for BigDaddyCum
---
This is why I don't play a mage. Also because 50% of the dps players are a mage right now for some reason.
---
Bro, everyone knows:
---
DM=Dire Maul
---
VC=Deadmines
---
It makes... imperfectly perfect sense.
---
Meanwhile mine rolled on a pve server :(
---
For the most part, I played Vanilla so I knew what I was getting into.
---
I would be shocked if there weren't organised groups of people doing exactly that for any streamer who was even thinking about moving
---
I wouldn’t watch any stream regardless of content.  My IQ is above 100, and I’m not a millennial.
---
I just finished with stone talon last night and hit 26. Fuck that god damn Fire elemental quest. But I did it god damnit. i gritted my teeth through it as a warrior and I'm happy I came out alive. On the plus side Ashenvale is ripe with quests and I'm much higher than the mobs. Easy exp till 1k needles 👍

Yes, It's literally ONLY WoW.

Upgrade is an upgrade. If you’re going to wear it, need it.

These are super limited, though. You only have one choice of server to move to from whatever full server you're on. I'd pay to move my guy to my friends server at this point.

---
Would have been a lot more fun for you with a nice group.
---
I love the idea of ironman ever since I got into it with runescape. Im interested how it'll end up with wow
---
If its better than yours and you use it, no problems!! It's a good question tho! I Mean when people get money together in a few months maybe say to the group "Hey this is worth x amount, do you guys want to split the profit if we sell it"? I know some people are dishonest but you only have your rep to ruin on your server.. And it's a quick way to find out who not to group or interact with.
---
I think they were camping Nesingwarys before that. There was a group of 5 ??s that would not let me do my quests. One of them made the mistake of fomingat me 1 on 1 and I killed him, but nothing can he done about the 5... Every zone I went to was like that. Guess I'll be leveling out my 30s in SM.
---
The PLAYER in the party was a lvl 26 rogue. Doesn't matter what dungeon you run when someone is 4 levels above you.
---
&gt; Do you even play warrior? 
---
3, 1 was vanilla, 1 was lvled during TBC, 1 was PS, none of them reached 60, 2 were lvl 49, 1 around 40's on PS.
---
&gt; is good enough for 90% of the **dungeon** 
---
Did you even ~~play a warrior~~ read replies?
---
I guess I could have specified that I didn't mean a warrior in a 5 man with a commited healer, but I thought that was clear when I was referencing the TTK for a warrior grinding. I also am a little skeptical that you are asking warriors their talent builds before each dungeon, but let's go on good faith and say you are doing that.

---
By level 25 taking all of the mitigation talents doesn't really add up to much..
---
10 defense is tiny, you couldn't cast fewer heals because of this
---
10% armor, this is less than 5-10% mitigation, you maybe casted 1 or 2 fewer heals per dungeon run
---
5% more block chance, it's cool, you can call it 1-4% dmg reduction, it doesn't block all damage like an evasion would.
---
2 blocks with shield block instead of 1, this is probably the most influential talent.
---
None of those things adds up mathematically to what you describe as a completely different experience as a healer, you probably had good players enjoying the novelty of protection spec, but it lowers their performance overall at lower levels.
---
&gt;Give it a few months until the tourists have left and the serious boys are geared and the same elitist attitude is going to emerge and people are going to be ditching pugs like the plague.
---
Considering that's not at all what happens on private servers I don't see this happening here either
---
&gt;in classic it's not necessarily hard to find a group
---
In comparison to retail it absolutely is and always will be, barring the introduction of LFD/LFR
---
Chuck Norris's tears can cure cancer. Unfortunately, Chuck Norris has never cried.  
---
Every night the Boogieman looks under his bed for Chuck Norris.
---
not very traditional if you ask me
---
Why would you use /LFG if you can use /2 though.
---
Well if you group with the same ppl spamming the same dungeon y'all will end up with the same gear lol
---
Wow on the laptop. AFK grind osrs on the iPad. Peak efficiency boys.
---
First of all, always need blue BoEs unless someone says they actually want to equip the item and you believe them. If someone rolls greed and you roll need to sell it, offer to have them /roll and if they beat your roll then give it to them. As long as you aren't a dick, and everyone else is doing that too, it's impossible for someone to ninja loot.
---
Second, no, if you win a BoE and equip it immediately there's no hard feelings. It's their prerogative if they want to flush 100g for a twink item by equipping it on their character that they are going to level. No one in the group is entitled to gear they are going to sell, just because it's valuable.
---
Thanks for the help! I've heard that the WoW classic community has a good reputation for being welcoming and helpful, and you definitely helped confirm that!
---
Cut is an entirely different story than Lung.
---
Scam that precious wool.
---
Why be a jerk?
---
Yeah, Benediction's Westfall chat is this. Not much political stuff Alliance side that I have seen.
---
Ouch!  Worst I've seen on Pagle is 3 hours, but I take classes from home lately so I just log in when I get up and keep myself logged in.  The only queues I've hit are when my internet shit the bed.  My guildies though see them every time in the afternoon/evening.
---
A lot of old school MMOs (aka the ones that WoW copied but not the ones that copied WoW) were designed with PvP and PvE as complementary and mutually interacting.
---
Resources &amp; mobs were scarce to force people to PvP over control of the best farming spots.
---
PvE servers were exempt from that as the only way to exert control over an area was to farm faster than them and hope they give up and leave.
---
This also frequently extended to dungeon and raid entrances since many players/guilds had longstanding rivalries with players/guilds on the other faction, so on top of a desire to ensure your whole raid gets in safely there was also a desire to ensure that other guild's raiders *can't*
---
So the added time spent defending your area, corpse-running back after getting kicked out, gathering people to take it back, etc meant that players on PvP servers were able to spend less time actually grinding, farming, raiding, etc than those on PvE servers.
---
And since server-first bragging rights were often a big issue it would be highly disruptive to the server's community if someone could farm &amp; gear in complete safety on one server and then transfer their kitted out character to another server where it would have taken much more time and effort to do the same thing.
---
Sold those shoulders at the AH for 12s couple days ago. Almost vendored them, then remembered the old days as a warrior waiting for my first pair of shoulders to wear...
---
Thing is, we're playing a 15 year-old game with mechanics and dps requirements so loose compared to reatil... Going all "I ain't bringing this class / race to my group because it's *sub-optimal* " is 100% unjustified. Bringing 5 players who know what they're doing, will always clear your dungeon faster than bringing *only* "The most optimal group" where only 2 or 3 players give a damn.  
---
A guild cleared MC with ***almost half the raid not even level 60*** for crying out loud !
---
You have to play the game within the game and go for the high DPS.
---
And it will still be really high pop thus more fun
---
What!! Then where would all that nail go? Do you know how important it is for the mail to get to someone? The US Postal service employs more assassins than any other government agency for a reason, if the mail didn't get to where it's going this country would fall apart faster than toilet paper tower made of tornadoes. What you're suggesting is akin to asking them to give players the option to destroy the codebase itself.
---
i still havnt found one
---
5.5k was 2 hr 45 min for me yesterday on skarem.
---
The picture quality is bad but you don't have to be a dick lmao Jesus
---
I am making a new char. Night elf hunter or gnome rogue? Tips?
---
No problem! Most of us are helpful and welcoming but unfortunately you'll always come across a jerk no matter the game you play.
---
this doesnt seem to do anything except some sort of trinket switch?
---
Wait they rolled on a different server from you? oof boi
---
Fucking same man i feel bad neglecting my farm runs though... But im hooked
---
I had a pissy competitor on my realm's AH back in MoP. I was listing between 1500-2000 items every 48 hours or so. They wanted to fuck with me, so they sent me WoTLK herbs to flood my mailbox. Single after single. Over a hundred of them easily. It took me so long to loot all my stock to repost. I can't fault them too much, definitely a good business strategy.
---
Maybe they've done it a few times and are bored with it? Or maybe they plan to level with friends who all rolled Human/Gnome/Dwarf?
---
Ironman in WoW has been around for years.
---
Queue's were 25k+ last week, down to below 10k this week. Part of that is the fact that they expanded the servers, which brought it down to about 15k. Still big drop off in 1 week.
---
Hi, /u/Hitler_wuz_socialist

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czf8te/are_poisons_worth_using_while_questing_grinding/). 
---
man I'm so glad I rolled on Krom'Krush, I dont think I'll be movi g, the pvp Is so good
---
You probably dont care but i see this argument all the time..
---
The real answer is, the final Defias Brotherhood quest in original vanilla just told you to kill VanCleef, it never specified he was in deadmines
---
So people would just type LFG VC, some people knew it was deadmines so they did DM, it varied person to person, and server to server
---
Now its just a big argument and people seem to get super mad about it
---
If my friend wants to play filthy Alliance he's friend no more.
---
Thorns is ok,  3 dmg Thorns might as well not be there
---
Purple shield still cool though
---
Is there.... is there something wrong with you?
---
I'd say it takes around 30-40 minutes per 1800 people during the afternoon and more or less 5hrs per 8000 people in the evening
---
Unfortunately that didn't do anything
---
Wow, thanks Shitty_Human_Being!
---
I do believe they get the food buffs as well, which can be helpful.
---
BFA BAD UPVOTES TO THE LEFT
---
hat
---
You can watch Staysafe's guild fail to kill Rag for a full two hours literally right now, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
no chicks full stop with a guild name like that
---
CoA is trash in dungeons.  Honestly before you complain about this at least understand what you’re complaining about.
---
But u use a mage for the meme...
---
You are greatly overthinking. Just open a ticket and they can tell you what happened 100%
---
he obviously expected a name change, he’s just an attention whore. most people with names like this are. which is why he posted it on reddit. for the attention
---
Would be amazing to the option to put character friends on top
---
Racing to 60? Psh. This past week, all I've done is race-change. As well as class-change. As well as faction-change. As well as server-change. Because I'm indecisive.
---
Sure u could just not heal them but dont complain when they dont give out healthstones or soulstone
---
OH wow, ok.  That's huge then.  Sounds like it makes the downtime within those 5 seconds after casting a regen window as well.  I'll definitely have to pick that up then.
---
It's just so confusing how the talent is worded because "while casting" should really be worded to "immediately after a spell is cast" with the way that works based on the explanation.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Okay, sorry that didn't help. Sometimes my Warcraft game does something similar, and if I press the end he on my keyboard, everything goes back to normal. Very strange. I hope someone can help.
---
But the attunement is a quest.
---
Yeah this. My friends and I play on Grob bc it was the only rp server at the time and we're all eastern. We'd move to DD in a heartbeat.
---
You won't be seeing me on the game that you prefer because I'm not going to be on the disaster known as retail. Please keep your bullshit there.
---
It’s definitely triggered by pressing left ctrl, just assumed it was last item.
---
People took vacation time to play wow though. People are back to work but still going to be actively playing for sure
---
I've been having a similar issue. It doesn't appear to be affecting my MS though. I see my FPS visibly go from 252 fps to 0 then shoot back up. I don't know what's going on but it's killing me. I know it's not my PC as it only occurs in WoW.
---
Intentionally? I doubt it or it would already be known about and abused. You just got unlucky.
---
I appreciate the attempt, I'm really at a loss here!
---
Deterrence is close enough to a pally bubble, shamans hexing wasn't part of vanilla, and druids being able to rez takes away the uniqueness of the class (druids can literally already do pretty much everything). I don't see your point since it doesn't address my point even a little bit.
---
Truth
---
It's a different kind of ironman. Not the white gear no deaths one.
---
oh thank you.
---
No, Corpsemaker is a great weapon and will easily last you until you can solo the ww axe quest.
---
3k took me less than an hour on stalagg. Its much better now
---
Get yourself a remote login app. I'm on whitemane and check the server to see how bad the queues are. I generally login a couple hours before work ends and have little to no wait time when I get home.
---
Randomly happens to me. Close wow and relaunch
---
If you leave the instance before the dice result it sometimes bugs out. It also has done this in retail for a long time. 
---
Rule if thumb, never leave or release spirit before the dice result is finished. The dungeon is an own game instance and I'm pretty sure the world server wont track instance dice results, which is the reason why you did not get it.
---
Yes that's the right way to do it
---
Clicking spells is usually what leads people to keyboard turning because they can’t use their mouse to move and hit abilities at the same time.
---
Attempted multiple times.
---
I love this aspect also, though I'm sad it's not being kept with battlegrounds, for the same reasons.
---
I went to Darkshore and it it was pretty great.
---
Are you allowed to take a shit? 4head just go to the restroom.
---
You're right. Didn't even know that was a feature in retail.
---
I wanted to go horde too :) How are you finding it, getting into alliance?
---
&gt; strength and stamina 
---
You misspelt “weapon dps” :P
---
Well soon we all can, and we can bring out characters with us
---
Hear me out: what the best server is varies person to person and is what we call ‘subjective’.
---
Having 4chan kiddos not on my server is appealing to me
---
For the average person/guild MC will still (probably, I have 0 evidence) be a challenge, the people downing it now are way more practiced than most people out there and it shouldn't be seen as easy content.
---
Spaz our on the keys (mash). That’s my cure all
---
Wtf? Why did they do all this? Incremental whiners in PVP so they are basically merging all classes into one; essentially creating 3v3 mirror matches?
---
Millennials have actual careers to go to.  Don't know why you felt the need to insult us.
---
Oh it’s happening sweetheart
---
Mor’ladim, an undead elite warrior in duskwood. Hoooly shit ive asked the same question about him. He’s literally just sauntering around with a 2 handed sword, in a big ass circle, and yet he will constantly come from behind the camera and just destroy you.
---
Worse than the son of arugal!
---
Talk with your isp first. Any sort of interuption in connection even if brief can disconnect you
---
Attempted multiple times, lol
---
This. I’m legit having anxiety about about not playing wow. I need my daily fix.
---
As a new priest who plans on healing many dungeons,  I thank you for this information
---
I’m doing my best not to give in but my middle finger is already on W
---
Can we move from Eu to Na?
---
To lvl 18-20 yes, then I had quests way above me so I rerolled. Now getting close to 20 with my second guy and feel the same :/
---
did you know there is a guild &lt;hat&gt;? You should join it!
---
No, no, you need to realise that is not what you did. With one simple trick - then **he's** an asshole, you can fix English for all of us.
---
Im out of the loop. iI haven't played since BC/sunwell?then for loke 3 months of Lynch. 
---
I dare not get back in it because I was consumed. 
---
But on my launcher I got an invite to auto 100 in wow, but what's this about y'all grinding classicwow? Did they do a reset or is this an expansion to strip? Lol im out of the loop.
---
You gotta give it atleast a month before making any judgements. 
---
Spending the sub money will make some people play more this month than any other.
---
Taking into account the server pop increases there has been a queue reduction on my server (Arugal-OCE)
---
A new generation of people?  Have you heard of sports?
---
May he drown in the darkest depths hopefully infested with the most vile murlocs Azeroth has seen.
---
People, stop trying to convince yourselves 15 year old game mechanics are somehow harder than modern technology lol
---
Try when I take people through an area with red enemies and the respawns suddenly kick in all around us. Elites it's more "Whelp... assume the position."
---
The biggest thing that seems to be missed in all the comments is that.. you don't need to. You don't need to pre hot or pre shield. There is no content where it is important to do this. PWS slows rage generation, slows building threat and not just on loose mobs. I disagree with other people claiming that tanks don't have aoe threat ability - they do, especially at the start of a pull for a few renew ticks. PWS stops them generating rage - for sure. You could argue that it gives them \~900 extra hit points - also correct. However all their rage generation needs to come from them hitting the target, which slows down building initial aggro. That is fine if people are happy to wait around. But why? No reason really.
---
It is one or two casts if you do it in order to drink up, which is why you would do it. You are effectively gaining one spell. There were very few fights where a healer would be that close to the wire that it would ever end up mattering. If any. There are many other places where you can improve efficiency rather than precast+drink.
---
For something like patchwerk that hits like a truck a shield might make sense as it is obliterated quickly and does not extend the initial engagement period very much - in fact most of the raid bosses will completely remove the shield on their first hit and still damage the target, granting rage. This brings up another downside to pre-shielding: weakened soul. If you happen to preshield and it is then used and there is large spike you cannot reshield until the debuff is gone. Early fights are where you may want to go easy on healing if possible to allow the tank to build aggro on all mobs. You may let their health dip further than you usually would in order to let this happen. You cannot reshield them with weakened soul. This isn't to say this is a good way to play, more to point out that it limits potential options.
---
Like? Coz um about to hit 38:)
---
They have always done high to low pop realm transfers. That's what makes sense. If you had the freedom to transfer to whatever realm you wanted people could transfer to a high pop realm and make the problem worse
---
You used to call me every year and remind me of the time I lost my virginity jumping on a grenade for one of the guys in the pic.
---
I think this may be related to layering. I've tried everything. It definitely is not my hardware. It'll drop my fps to 0 from 252 then back to 252.
---
I guess I don't know yet, my brother even was thinking going horde but his friend was alliance, and we played together at my house last weekend, but since then I have not played with him much at all and it is possible we won't meet up often. 
---
Playing on another server would be nuts wouldn't?
---
Already had a huge 4 vs 5.5 raid battle there, each faction led by a streamer. It went back and forth for 6 hours and was the best thing ever.
---
Get skinning and farm beasts. Raptors in stv are great. So are cats. For earlier, basilisks in shimmering flats.
---
Looks constipated tbh
---
But wouldn't you need two servers?
---
&gt;Warriors have basically no way to grab more than one mob at a time.
---
Thunderclap, battleshout, cleave, etc. There are plenty of ways to get hate on multiple mobs. The question is will the warrior do it? Now obviously there is a lot more information available today compared to early 60s in 2004. A lot of people straight up did not know how to tank. This is still probably the case today for casuals. It was still a problem even for warriors in raid guilds towards the end of classic.
---
As a healer the onus is on you to work out the level of ability of your tank and plan your healing around it and err on the side of them being a retard until you establish the level of their ability. 
---
&gt;Edit: people seem to misunderstand the modified "basically". My meaning is unlike retail, a classic warriors threat on multiple mobs is tenuous at best just after pulling.
---
This is a meme. They can get threat on multiple mobs easily after pulling. Blood rage (10+1/sec)-&gt; Charge  (15) is 25 to work with off the bat and close to 30 after the initial GCD for the abilities listed next are over.
---
Thunderclap costs 20 - this is sufficient to out threat a tick of renew. Battleshout costs 10. Cleave costs 20. 
---
This is plenty to keep threat from 3-5 mobs at the opening of a fight. This toolkit is retard proof as you can use it without changing targets. Select what you want to DPS and then use clap after charging. Drop battleshout, then if you have taken damage and have threat hit cleave. This is plenty to keep aggro off healers.
---
But how do you have time for two servers?
---
After spending 10+ years on the wow forums and a bit of time on the wow and classicwow subreddits, absolutely not. So many things in wow seemed great at first or in theory and were requested by players. Remember how excited everyone was for flying and dungeon finder?
---
Most recent thing I can think of is Legion introduced pvp stat templates meaning in pvp your stats were just your ilvl nothing else mattered on any of your gear. 1% increase in stats per ilvl. Many top pvpers asked for this for years and when we got it we saw how bad it felt. I specifically remember cdew saying how he had wanted stat templates for years and then actually playing with it for an expansion felt awful.
---
This conversation brought a tear to my nostalgic eyes.
---
5min if you continue questing or killing mob.. you are not gaining xp by being afk lol
---
Is this all BiS?
---
Sunken Temple quests are fun.  Lots of chains involved leading up to them though.  Class quests?  I feel like Azshara comes to mind.  Maybe that's just a specific class though, but I think one starts there.  Just northeast of horde camp in azshara.  Don't take that as fact though.
---
Do you hate every moment of it?
---
Its literally the definition of exploiting. Blizz has reverted shit like this before. Unfortunately due to the scale of this exploit i doubt they can do that this time. Oh well.
---
If you rewatch the gif, you can kind of zoom in and see that his health bar actually stays above 0
---
My comment was 100% satirical.
---
Yo, I explained about the reason for the phone picture in the comments, I'm sure y'all haters can read. 
---
You're just jealous I had a wholesome experience :)
---
For me, what I really disliked was specs effectively dictating the spells you use
---
What I mean is, you don't even have access to Frostbolt in fire spec
---
I liked the fantasy of having (almost) everything, and your spec dictated how effective you were at certain things
---
You couldn't do things like put a dot on a rogue with fireball to ensure his vanish stopped working, then use a rank 1 frostbolt for a quick slow. Those tiny details and flexibility is what made the game great, and in an effort to make it easier for everyone they removed them
---
Anyway, it all boils down to preference. I'm just glad I get to play the game i loved again
---
Tank don’t give a fuck if I die drinking
---
The community isn’t smart enough to understand that if everyone spread out evenly, all realms would probably be “High” during peak times with little to no queues. 
---
Instead they want to sit tight and bitch.  Smart.
---
If you play and level enough in retail this shield drops but it's most likely your first epic but it's absolutely useless as there is more blue and high quality gear available. In classic this is an upgrade for at least 10 levels which would sometimes be a week. I tried to do a play on one man's trash and another ones treasure!
---
You're ignoring the fact that one of the situations presented is a 15 year old raid that is perfected, and one is brand new content.
---
I'd damn well hope that brand new content takes at least 360 pulls to have a clear.
---
Why can they only do one pull?
---
No, this is how it was and how it should be. This lets them balance server populations.
---
Omnicc paired with ClassicAuraDuration
---
After the first couple of days I haven’t had a queue
---
Is there a way to get shoot to auto resume after i cast a spell? 
---
I'll cast a spell and i stop wanding but i have trouble getting started wanding again.
---
Ya I don’t understand the obsession with this, change one letter or something, fuck!
---
1. Not like Classic
---
2. See 1. 
---
3. If I add someone in-game, they’re way below BNet friends playing casual games.
---
I just spent over 6 hours (2x3 hour sessions) in a group with my level 26-29 friends doing the whirlwind axe quest for our warrior friend.    Were not exactly going slow. But man was that an epic journey.
---
I think they did a great job on the graphics for classic.  Using technological advancement of retail but keeping the aesthetic intact and sharpened.
---
Yeah, your point is sound. Perhaps it could be saved until the economy matures. I definitely still feel that the potential current or future monetary value outweighs the stat gain, but I suppose it's a matter of perspective.
---
If anyone is good to handle a random ass 1-2 mobs coming into the pull it's gonna be a Warlock. Mages will just get wrecked by adds coming from the side while a Warlock should generally be okay.
---
No idea why people are raving about a sense of community and posting pictures like this as though it's never been seen until WoW Classic. Literally did this every single night on retail in Goldshire all the way up until I stopped playing 2 weeks ago approximately.
---
i’ve been right around 90 min- 120 min in 5k on skeram all weekend logging in around 10:00 server time though so i guess that’s why.
---
That game could've been great. Epic have put all their eggs in one basket with Fortnite. It's making them a TONNE of money at the moment though so I'm sure it's not a big deal but dang. No Paragon, no Unreal Tournament progress, EGS struggling. Not great, but they're doing just fine thanks to Fortnite.
---
similar thing happened to my friend in chinese server. shortly after we realized it was done on purpose cuz he got a random chinese ID for registration and it turns out the ID was -18. so the default parent protection block the progression of the account after 3 hours like reducing the xp gain and not giving any loot from the monsters etc.. there is even a notification like \`go take a rest\` lol
---
maybe it is the same thing?
---
sorry for hating on your post bro, ill let you know as soon as i get the calibrations right on my time machine

Ah, OK.
---
Yes, they should totally let you transfer to a server that will end up with queues, so you can then complain even more.
---
Nice work. This guy was one of my first thoughts when I first heard about classic WoW becoming a real thing.
---
So you’re fine with playing a game that requires 10000% more effort than the retail version, but can’t deal with having to scroll a feel extra clicks to see your in game friends? Gotcha.
---
They’ve evolved to Keanu jokes last I saw
---
how did you go about getting the gold? I'm still 15 levels away, but no where near enough gold.
---
Netherwind is EST. I'm in game right now and staring at the realm time.
---
Tauren can't get in there and it make me sad.
---
It is system put in place to make sure that the influx of new players does not overwhelm leveling zones. Imagine on the first week if every player was logging into the same leveling zones. There would be 1000s of people in all of the lowbie zones and getting your quests done would be impossible. Layering essentially takes those people and splits them up among different layers in the same zone. They plan on taking it out once players spread more evenly to different zones.
---
MC with 30-50% character buffs is extremely easy. 
---
When MC came out. There was no base line innervate, no Winter's chill (10% crit) and many other things lol.
---
He's right, you know. Even if it's an adapted meme or whatever, the "author" makes a good point. The social aspect IS deftly woven into the game design - you're gonna progress at a glacial pace without a group or at least a bevy of resources and a good soloing class. I don't really get the allegory of the cave, I think it's honestly more like Beatrice and Virgil ie. pain and suffering. Typical Horde player, though. While it does basically take the formula from the original pasta post from post, I think the changes are on point and really paint a picture of the people that deify Classic to an ungodly degree. They really do think they're more intelligent.
---
It's a myth :)
---
Hmm, it isn't a fresh account for one. I am not an avid poster on reddit. Also dont you think it would be more productive to have an actual debate on this instead of saying "man I hate crybabies on my community" and insulting me. I would actually think that people like you who are immediately toxic instead of being productive and adding to a conversation with a counterargument shouldn't be apart of the community.
---
😳🙄
---
Chris Metzen playing a Dwarf Paladin? Does that mean we can put to rest the dumb memes of Metzen being a raging Horde fanboy who hated the Alliance?
---
All they need to do is devolve into the anal \[ability\] and you've got the hat trick
---
Free xfer to netherwind for us on Thalnos. I know my friend group is gonna take it regardless cuz none of speak Spanish
---
The leatrix addon allows for a greater camera zoom out.
---
Attaboy. Paladin is slow at times but moments like this feel really great.
---
There's a solution you're not seeing here... Just don't have friends! It's so easy!
---
I can only assume that you are trolling... 
---
If not, I ask that you please go play another game.
---
Druid was my first class. It can do anything.
---
Good look up the same thing that happens with elephants lost from their herds.
---
What did you expect? Servers are supposed to feel permanent. Flying around between servers is retail mentality
---
I'm lvl 43, eat my ass.
---
I’m able to run this on my OLDDDDDD computer like 2008 pc is running this game fine, I’m so happy I don’t need an expensive rig to play again.
---
Correct.
---
It's almost a little jarring to see it everytime I open it
---
I've died more trying to greed for herbs than anything else. I've also caused a BFD wipe over some stranglekelp. Don't fucking tell me I can't farm my herbs.
---
Buff reminder is done with weskauras. Dmg/healing looks like Skada.
---
I usually reply with something simple like “no”. This gives me the option to right click there name in chat and report.
---
You are weak! Be gone!
---
But also enjoy your much more productive life :)
---
Azkin is kind of a shy one
---
you just hot them. thats it, even if you dont thats still fine. dont let your OCD fool you lol
---
I have an existential crises every time i get a new sword as a rogue because im too stupid to remember what I need on each hand. Which should be fast, which should be slow.
---
The correct player name is: “puffs”
---
Just saw they are sending us to Netherwind. Sounds good to me.
---
They want to remove layering by phase 2. They have to thin out the servers in order to accomplish this.
---
Where you get zperl at?
---
Your time will come. Persevere. Store all that rage. You will soon one shot everyone in AV.
---
Your post was deleted because it's obvious bait. Fuck off.
---
25 in a week, drop in the bucket if you planning sticking around for any length of time.
---
In combat if it’s a life tap, sure.  Out of combat you can go fuck yourself
---
OP are you okay?
---
Imaging having a bad ass name like Humar the Pridelord and then a random orc pull some bizarre voodoo on you, enthralling you, and renaming you Coco.
---
I guess the free meat snacks is worth it?
---
Reroll Warrior
---
Cry at how painful it is to kill 2 mobs at once until level 30. Definitely fun for the difficulty aspect tho
---
Well we shall see how many people decide to stay
---
Fuckin stitches...
---
You may be right but 1) I play to enjoy the adventure that I did back in 05 not just high lvl content (never even got to raid in vanilla nor will i have Time to this go around most likely) 2) I never had issues in BWL as fire and 3) I can respec for MC when that time comes then go back to fire afterwards 4) I dont have much time to play these days so it will be a long while before I even get to that point so I'm not gonna run frost and be miserable till i get there
---
No worries man. Just be sure and keep your pet upgraded with new abilities. Which you'll need to go out and tame other pets to learn abilities to teach your pet (the more annoying part of hunters). And don't be that hunter that runs out of ammo half way through a dungeon lol. The rest of it comes with playing the game. Also I recommend key binding follow and attack for your pet as well as taunt for starters. Get use to using those early on. Pet management sets hunters apart.
---
It takes much less work to balance the classes when they're all basically the same.
---
I never understood this mindset, if you enjoy something, it isn't a waste of time.
---
"omg dad pls just let me throw my degree down the drain and play wow"
---
- me
---
Yeah look it could possibly be the same feature? But I'm on the OCE server which I'd be very surprised if the feature existed.
---
More, by a lot. Haven’t touched BFA since raid last Thursday.
---
How is trying to voice my opinion on something obvious bait? Just because I want to voice my opinion doesn't make me some terrible person
---
I solo leveled a dwarf warrior in Vanilla. My advice is to max first aid every chance you get. My old maneuver when things got rough, was hamstring -&gt; zerker stance -&gt; fear -&gt; bandage. 
---
The fear would buy me enough time to get a full bandage off, and the hamstring meant my target *usually* didn’t run far enough to aggro friends.
---
Obviously a pocket healer helps, but you may not have that luxury.
---
Warriors are still my favorite class, but Vanilla leveling was rough. Later, before BC launched, I leveled a warlock alt to 60, and it felt like I was playing with cheat codes enabled by comparison.
---
Is this the one that drops your pants? Drops your pants? Drops your pants? I got a ring in there last night.
---
Rip Flex. Some say he's still wandering the Barrens searching for zerker stance.
---
Except when it is.
---
Priest has the most "complete" healing kit in Classic, but all are viable and have their strengths - particularly in the form of utility that Priest's don't have much of. I was a Druid healer 15 years ago, but this time I went with Paladin.
---
I am PVE carebear now because I like to watch a stream or TV while I play and don't feel like being ganked. I totally understand why some people like the danger and thrill of possibly turning around a gank, but I had enough of it 15 years ago. To each their own. 
---
Good luck and once you make your choice, I suggest you resist thoughts of the grass being greener for the other healing classes as you level because you may end up in alt purgatory if you don't push through the dull times.
---
Mine is IRL mates and warriors for tanks :D
---
And a kitty druid
---
It's super easy...for example if you see a rare mob or a rare spawn you can have people invite you to a group to switch layers in order to get multiple copies of those spawns. Also, you can avoid world pvp by switching layers in a similar fashion.
---
Don't get me started on these dumb guild names... One on my server called "Clappin Hordie Cheeks"
---
Even if we lose half of the users along the way the low pops are still going to be fine. There will be enough people that are sick if the que on Herod and whitemane that will swap to the low servers for free too.
---
It's the job of healers to keep people alive. That DOESN'T mean you have to keep everyone at 100% health all the time. If there's no aggro on the lock, as there shouldn't be if everyone is doing their jobs, then the lock never needs to be at 100% health, but the lock DOES need mana to do their job. Life tap is a big part of the way the class works. A warlock with 1% health and 100% mana is ten times better than a lock with full health and less than full mana. Also, a lock doesn't need full health before a pull, but they will need mana. If you're so OCD that you get mad when health bars aren't all at 100%, that's your problem.
---
You can run there manually without the quest. The attunement is just for the tele in
---
I don't think people are asking for freedom to transfer to willy nilly. If you had the option for a one time transfer to an existing server that was low/medium more people would be willing to do it but I don't think a lot of people will want to gamble on a brand new server with 0 players right now.
---
And i'm saying had they looked at it they would've known even with a modest count that their initial server count of 8 was wayyyyy too low. Since me, some dumbass on the internet, figured that out from a quick look at the classicwow sub count.
---
Because everyone wants to do the scarlet monastery farm strategy that lasts like a whole 10-15 levels that suggests 3 mages
---
We also told about this problem...
---
Well now realm xfers are coming. Give him his char back!
---
I already know this fact but each time I read it or hear it I cry.
---
Need a CRT monitor for that true Vanilla feel.
---
I am rlly struggling with my warrior. I am lvl 23 and arms specced and do zero dmg and take a lot of dmg. Don’t know if i do something wrong or the class is just trashy to lvl up.
---
Nobody cares bro but ok gratz

Get a GM, delete quest log and hit your class trainer
---
Stupid question but am I forced to buy the expansion every time?
---
thanks for the response. i've been in alt purgatory since bc :/
---
In all honesty, i just want to heal. I feel like druid/shamman will be doing more things like healing/buffing/attacking/cc/interrupts/dispels at the same time
---
I'm starting to think the AH *is* the actual game.
---
I bet you’re wrong, good game design is good game design no matter the era and no matter what companies think we want.
---
It helps that mages alone get a bonus 10% crit just from a single 1.12 talent... That's more crit than an entire set of gear.
---
Ctrl + Alt + Prtscr screenshots only the active window.
---
Now get my breastplate stretcher.
---
Gratz!
---
try leveling in a quieter zone?
---
People are garbage. Keep trying to find a guild that suits you. You will. And then disable general chat. You'll do fine
---
That’s completely broken guess I’ll be using it.
---
Nah, I’m of average to above average intellect. I suck at the game and am having a ball.
---
Classic wow is such an addiction that even an idiot can understand why it’s appealing.
---
Depending on your level there are talents that help with this.
---
Warriors are tough.
---
Guano Gang moon2PH

See you in a month

Pic relevant.
---
Back to retail
---
Worst kind? I life tap to almost full mana, use bandages, cannibalize or let demon armor work. No, they are not the worst kind. The worst kind are the ones tapping to 1% hp then expecting to get healed.
---
Kul'Tiras was in WC2
---
Zandalar was pre established as existing.
---
Northrends in WC3
---
Outland is in WC3
---
Pandaria was unknown.
---
The Broken Isles were never as large as Legion has them but they did exist.
---
I mean, an addon for this would just be a frame that runs this when PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD fires.
---
Bring back Guano Gang moon2A
---
One thing I absolutely love about passerbyers doing the same quest as you is once they finish the quest, they actually *stay* and help you finish it instead of just leaving as soon as they finish.
---
I fucking love that.. like.. so much.
---
Feels horde heavy on blaumeux for sure.  Could be wrong of course and just luck of what time you're in that zone but always feel outnumbered.
---
im enjoying my ride i just hate that im always broke
---
What the fuck is this a picture of man god damn
---
Oh hey you're on grob! I've seen you and a couple of these people several times
---
The setup for my laptop is really jank. I don’t have a desk, so I pulled out a dresser drawer and layed a folded up compact bookshelf over the dresser drawer and the bed.
---
I just want to play the game lmao so I have this shitty setup
---
You just join a layering chat and spam "invite for layer". Whammy, all your quest mobs are back.
---
Zug zug lolz, I went undead female cuz the flipping animation
---
I'd be curious to see how packed each zone would actually be... While my server had a 2 hour queue I ran from Org to Thunderbluff, primarily offroad, only passing 5 people total. (Gave them all healthstones though!) 
---
Day 2 Trisfal Glades was an awesome amount of packed server to me, I don't mind the mob tagging competition much.
---
look for the zipped file, extract it, then move it into ClassicWow&gt;World of Warcraft&gt;_classic_&gt;interface&gt;AddOns
---
start up wow and you is good
---
Well this seems worthless, who would want to transfer to a fresh server? We already have servers that are low pop no matter what time of day.
---
He should give himself to wow.
---
I don’t understand. 
---
A PvE server is not an option, because you want to play with your friends.  But the option you instead took was...to not play with your friends (by quitting).
---
I told my friends they were fucking morons for choosing a PvP server, and I’ll enjoy my time on a PvE server.
---
Speedybois mind their fuckin business. The slowbros actually have time to tell you how slow they're going
---
great pasta, the fact that people don't get it makes it better.
---
This sub has too many people telling everyone how to play the game I tell you.
---
Can't you just untick the box?
---
Your weapon is huge as a warrior.  If you see any weapon that has higher DPS than what you currently have, whether it's a staff, or sword or whatever, use it.  Warrior pre mortal strike is a struggle though, but know it gets way better at 60.
---
Hey man, 9 years clean.  
---
Only taste a little bit everynight before blacking out to grind out pan-handling til I get my next fix... Sure as hell doesn't feel like a relapse to me.
---
which class has the least amount of cc/interrupts/dispels during dungeons/raids
---
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell no. I haven't played bfa, and do not plan to.
---
Lol I noticed that but wasn’t sure if that was the inspiration for the post or not. All the same 10/10 for improvisation!
---
watching b0aty learn wow is so incredibly heartwarming and fun.
---
Any addon that'll just remind my stupid warrior ass to reapply battleshout?
---
Wash yer back!
---
Definitely not. I'm not that stuck on it. Too many other good games coming out soon.
---
Same here. Skinning priest, collecting leather as I go.
---
When should I be using faerie fire?
---
Lol
---
All pvp servers are horde dominant.
---
I usually start arms and go straight to anger management.
---
So how is the first day on the internet so far
---
Yeah, although even on weekends morning is fine.
---
Is there a easy ti use macro was a warrior to switch from  2h to a sword/board cast shield bash to interrupt a spell caster... Then switch back to 2h?
---
Yeah, Blizzard would never learn from their mistakes and fix their policy later.  That is why we still don't have Vanilla WoW.
---
LOL dps at gnomer. Anyone who complains about someone not going full hardcore at mid tier boss is a knoll. I’m over here happy if someone even remembers to buff me
---
Lenovo ThinkPad t450s here. i7 model with Intel hd 5500 integrated graphics. 720p classic graphics setting and a solid 60 fps. Got mine for 300 on eBay and kicked it up to the 20gb ram mark (has 4gb soldered so added a 16gb stick) and it already had a ssd. Super solid build and seeing as how the only things I'll play on it are Magic Online and Classic I'm stoked.
---
I don't have the pop-list in front of me, but probably the lowest ones?
---
Your friends are not morons. Theyre alphas. Pve pansies are the morons. See? I can call people names too.
---
And hunchbacked.
---
Had to sing that to make sure it was referenced correctly lol
---
im level 23 with 1 gold lol so broke rn
---
please make this a reality
---
I've actually found the time estimate to be pretty damn accurate for me, after the first couple days. It's been accurate a few days in a row, give or take ~5 minutes.
---
I still play retail so i figured Classic would be a fun distraction.
---
Nope i am in on classic all the time. It's better than i remembered and everytime someone said it won't be the same as back then seems like a complete liar who never played then. Because it is the same as back then. Maybe even better with Oceanic servers existing now so i don't have 200 ping all the time. 
---
I have an enthusiasm to log on and play retail has not been able to cause in me since Wrath or very early Cata. I am not getting on to do chores im getting on to have fun.
---
Well, tried Arathi, Alterac, STV, Desolace, 1000 Needles, Swamp of Sorrows, all been a bust for me. Would rather call it quits while I'm ahead.
---
I use my pinky for q a and my index for s w.  It isn't bad.
---
Ongo Gablogian is that you?
---
Why not? If memory serves, there's a dungeon in Zangermarsh where there's a boss fight with a hunter and his pet bear. Said pet after the fight thanks you for freeing him and shifts back to a Tauren, admitting that he's embarrassed at getting caught by the hunter while in bear form.
---

Rogue human lvl 20 who only cares about pvp.
---
YSK you can get a fully legit key for windows off ebay for less than 5 quid, they hand them out to companies en masse and if they have a defective PC they just sell the key for next to nothing
---
God damn I’m glad there was layering, dwarf starting zone was a shit fest even with it.
---
Tf was your played? To get level 20 for me was like 20 hours
---
You got a shit bucket?
---
&gt;which reforge of the remaining options gives me the highest dps?
---
IIRC that is why they removed it but like... so what?  It's not hurting anything.  They moved further and further away from character customization over the years for that same reason.  No more reforging.  No more 70 point talent trees or what have you.  And so on.  And what did we get in return?  Azerite?  It's the same exact shit, people just sim the highest parsing trait and take it.
---
thanks! i think i'll research the druid/shaman/priest healing more.
---
Would you be able to answer the second question based on your own opinion though? like, why did you choose pve or pvp and why?
---
Ok, I am not acting like a victim about the post at all. I'm not even acting like a victim. Just because I wasn't aware that was how server transfers normally worked when they offer them for free doesn't mean you can just curse me out call me a troll and then tell me to leave the community. I think a way to go about that could of just been "that's how they have always worked" or something along the lines of that without calling me a troll bait poster. I don't post on reddit because I have never really cared to share my opinion on most things or really share. I get where you are coming from though.
---
you cant aoe elites really. so solo grind imo

USA alliance

Human rogue lvl 20
---
I just want to have fun with pvp. I've never played wow before last week and would prefer a guild that could help me learn the pvp ropes.
---
Sounds like you need to make more informed and intelligent friends. Youll find them playing at PvE realms
---
No need to check all pvp servers are filled with more horde.  No pvp server is 50/50 or alliance favored. At least in NA
---
7-8 food giants become little girls when they see my lock with aff/drain life/succ build.

---
Druid? Runs away
---
Priest? Fel pupper
---
Shaman? Already dead
---
Warlock? Mutual understanding not to start a fight that will last 30 minutes
---
Right i realize u care but why, im saying nobody else cares.
---
Hillsbrad, Desolace, Ashenvale, Arathi Highlands
---
I wasn't meaning to come off as some troll and I didn't think that my post count really would matter.
---
Meh, nothing I say is going to get them to switch it up. I'd rather save myself the headache. I don't really care if other ppl call me names at this point.
---
IMO, if you are the one that is 5-7-10-however many levels higher and doubling back on quest hubs to gank the other faction - YOU are the real pussy, not the ones complaining about it. Just my 2 cents though.
---
People suck. What you gonna do... /shrug
---
There are definitely people like this playing Classic, but overwhelmingly I've ran into chill people. The closest I've gotten to this is the occasional group disintegrating after 3 wipes when all the trash respawns.
---
What's nice about classic is that you don't really have to be that good at it until like AQ40, most people you play with will not give a shit unless you're pulling a bunch of shit on accident.
---
Oh hey, Windseeker is my server. Guess we're going to have a lot more alliance soon. I wish server stats were easier to find, I've been wondering about Windseeker's population distribution for a while now
---
Yes!! I had this happen on my priest too. Felt so lucky!!
---
I believe staff is 2-handed weapon. You can use off-hand with 1 handed weapons. If you equip 1 handed weapon and off-hand, you can use off-hand ability in action bar.
---
Yeah but if you say dick you’re sure they read it!
---
A layer is an instance of the game world. People on different layers can't see each other, but they can still talk to each other. If you invite a player to a party, they are transported to your layer.
---
Having a blast.
---
Started playing my same old Shaman, then decided to play my first purr caster. Made a Troll priest.
---
Loving it.
---
As a druid i most definitely run away.
---
I did that in Vanilla. I fell off of Teldrassil on my Night Elf and landed on one of the branches. Tried to fall off and land on it in Wisp form and fell right past it into the ocean, just deleted the character and started anew.
---
They're true Edgelords.
---
i have everything to make a gnomish death ray except an essence of undeath lmao im level 35 and theres no way to get one
---
He's on a pvp server and phase 2 will be the golden age of world pvp. No battlegrounds but the pvp rank system.  Every 60 will be out pvping in the world.  Also pvp gear will be at its most powerful since only tier 1 pve gear will be available.   Phase 3 will bring battlegrounds, and the golden age will come to an end.  If you like world pvp you shouldn't miss it.
---
I know my server will be getting free transfers. And I'm sure af not going to transfer to some dead realm.
---
&gt; You won't be able to move from PVE to PVP.
---
I haven't transferred in awhile, bit you used to be able to do this, just not from pvp to pve
---
I'm glad you got their names and reported them to the server discord. Please also always remember to screenshot the chat with this kind of stuff! Name and shame them. If they're going to berate you and kick you out purposely before the final boss, then they deserve to get ignored by other players.
---
Ah maybe 3000 people will leave my server and join a streamers so I dint get a queue.
---
I've waited in 7 hr queues, but I join the queue during my lunch break, and then it's ready to play after dinner.
---
I'm not playing on a streamer server, but my guild of 200 people rolled on one of the original 2 PST PvP servers. If we moved, we'd lose a lot of people, so we've decided to just tough it out. The queues have already gone down a lot. They'll go away eventually, either though people rerolling or quitting or server transfers. We're planning to play for 2+ years, so a losing a week or two isn't the end of the world compared to losing guildmates.
---
Fuck me up this is so annoying. I played right before BC and I never remembered this being an issue, but I constantly having to stand up to cast spells.
---
Gaaaaaaay!
---
I wrote about that in a guide for wowhead, you can read it here:

What excitement? Corpse running 5 times because the rogue 15 levels higher gangbanged you with his buddies? 🙄
---
Thorium, not mithril haha! May the RNG gods smile upon you. Hope you get plenty of arcane crystals! They'll be in high demand, and with an epic mount  you should have a good head start on the market.
---
Dude I just wanna mindlessly grind mobs and fishing spots.
---
Recommend waiting to lvl 20. Tank needs plenty of armor unless you have dope heals. Deadmines is a long instance, wiping takes a toll.
---
South Park kill only boars
---
Im currently leveling 1-60 naked and havent got many viewers except a few. It has been more about the fun for me though and its nice from a money standpoint since you sell everything. I made a guild on Mankrik called &lt;Naked and Afraid&gt;
---
As we previously announced, free character moves will become available in this region very soon. When these free character moves open, player-characters at any level will be able to move:
---
From -&gt; To
---
Arugal -&gt; Felstriker
---
Faerlina -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)
---
Stalagg -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)
---
Herod -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)
---
Skeram -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)
---
Incendius -&gt; Netherwind
---
Thalnos -&gt; Netherwind
---
Fairbanks -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)
---
Whitemane -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)
---
Bigglesworth -&gt; Anathema
---
Pagle -&gt; Windseeker
---
Grobbulus -&gt; Deviate Delight
---
For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.
---
We will let you know when the new realms open and free character moves are enabled.
---
Thank you!
---
Idk  bout that ,my lil brother enjoys grindy games way more than me

Last time I played retail wa early wod, to play some arenas, but ok.

I mean shit don’t listen to me on telling you what to play. I’m just sayin as far as fire goes it has its setbacks for sure. (And fire might be good in bwl I don’t know) I don’t pay your $15 who am I to tell you what to do. 
---
Shit i plan on raiding as a shadow priest so if anything I should be getting hell.
---
it's a reference to an Oldschool Runescape video series called Swampletics
---
Because these things were a pain in the ass sorry people XD. It's a nice cool feature now and I agree in player a hunter recently in classic and all that stuff is super unique. Give it 2-3 years and we shall see if your still have a blast feeding that pet every bloody day.

Why did you pick a PvP realm then lol that’s your own fault
---
My wife is also playing for the first time and she sends me similar messages while I'm at work. Its the best :-D
---
These are the best RP comments i've ever read in WoW. Please continue posting updates on your future adventures!
---
That’s not how it works, at all.
---
Day 1 is ONLY open for people to transfer to, not open to create new characters.  People can still transfer over after that, at the risk of losing their super cool unique usernames.
---
No, it is how it works, because the frame is pushing 2 frames with one refresh.  So the first half of the refresh half a frame is drawn, then updated again for the second frame on the last half.
---
I know right.  I'm level 22, taking my sweet ass time, but it's a straight up circle jerk with people wanting everybody to take their time.  Speed leveling is a way to enjoy the game, plain and simple.
---
I play a paladin, so my personal thought process is that the horde and alliance aren't in open hostilities, not until phase 2, that's when it all kicks off
---
&gt;Yeah... How the fuck did we get to this point again??
---
It's actually incredible how often the situation happens where a developer openly states that they want to do something in their game, and then somehow end up doing the exact opposite, either directly through their own actions or indirectly through the actions of the player base.
---
Oh man I can finally farm STV for my Whirlwind Ace quest without getting ganked to hell! I better time it right.
---
Thanks mate, I'll wait for your message
---
Alternatively, download the twitch app and you can easily pick and choose addons through search or from the list
---
Which server is it?
---
$25 has never been a significant amount of money for me yet I cannot fathom the people acting like OP and not even capable of considering it could be a lot for some people and rightfully so. 
---
Also I’d rather spend it on something else if I can avoid it.
---
Aye, tamed Timber the moment I hit 10 and got the ability. Had to tame one of the regular wolves to fight his guards while I tamed him, died once and prayed someone wouldn't have already killed him by the time I ran back. Good times.
---
You're right, my dude, you're right, but I love the race. I'll take it easy with an alt.
---
Everyone, just do what's fun. Don't let your lvl ruin your experience.
---
Lol, meanwhile I'm just building weird af groups. Tanks are hard to find, a rogue can tank wonderfully well.
---
Thunderfury server?
---
Just quest. They higher you get, the more gold they give. Around 40 they'll start giving close to a gold per quest. And the items they give you vendor from 50s to 1g. It all adds up.
---
Recommend Googling priest build for your role (heals, dps, pvp, etc) and following that guide. Respec gets more expensive every time you do it and gets out of hand quickly
---
Hi, /u/WPG_BigAL
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czfwtk/tip_how_to_get_a_free_name_change_with_your_free/).
---
for layering to be removed there would need to be around 5k players or less on a server. I dont know if that would happen to most servers.
---
using the Twitch Desktop app detects your games, there is a PLETHORA of add-ons in the database too
---
Depends on the amount of data.
---
Free leather
---
&gt; Between getting ganked literally nonstop, not being able to opt-out of wpvp, questing areas being completely farmed out for hours at a time, ganked by 5-7 ppl at a time when I'm clearly alone minding my own business, nonstop boat gankings, being antagonized by my fellow players by expressing my malcontent, etc... it's just not good for my mental health.
---
Play PvE on a server in a different timezone and 100% of these problems go away.
---
With the gametime you have left, maybe try making a new character that's easy to level (hunter/mage/lock) and doing it at a slow pace.  You'll probably make new friends along the way.
---
I wasn't complaining or crying. OP asked what could be done, and I made a suggest. Not everyone who suggests a potential change to something is crying like baby, you know.
---
Use Twitch desktop app for mods / addons
---
I get the impression that some of you PvP-server players spend a little too much time thinking about how other people feel.
---
Nailed it.
---
RIP Fistweaver
---
Sounds like you all are confusing layer jumping with a whole camp of mobs spawning at once.
---
Imagine being so completely unoriginal that you prefer using that over just clicking the name randomize button until finding something halfway decent.
---
Literally addressed that in the post. If I'm not playing with my long time gaming friends, I'm not playing. Wouldn't play any games without my friends tbh.
---
Unlikely that OP thinks about people moving to his server
---
And what about the thousands who haven’t quit after rolling on a pvp server? Oh, and I’m and curious what data would prove such an absurd statement or if data to you is just your opinion.
---
Maybe you get too close to the mob
---
Lol idk why you got downvoted. Someone must be killing slow and is jealous
---
Fail bot. Not even close.
---
Shimmering flats has like 5 quests you can do
---
I believe this should be the new copy pasta
---
- On my own, i am not hat. But together, we are hat.
---
Boring itemization is why they had to do that, there are other ways to make items more interesting and powerful than just adding 10 to the number.
---
He’s been arrested 9 times the last few years, lol
---
I remember him raging at me back a lot in 2005 in molten core, I thought this was normal for me raiding groups.
---
Exaggeration is a thing you know, I bet it’s within 30seconds to a minute
---
Yay, another complaint we didn’t know we needed.  Thank you.
---
Unless you want big armor-piercing nature damage through poisons, then you can use a really fast main hand too.
---
2500 was 40-60 mins (when my server had queues)
---
I was very excited to begin with, and I've enjoyed the game even more than I thought. Very excited to experience even more!
---
individually i am no hat, but together, we can be.
---
Pffft join his safe space
---
Awesome community too imo
---
Theres literally zero chance of what you suggested ever being implemented, just like there was zero chance of it ever happening back in vanilla. The game isnt changing.
---
Where are people finding all these close-knit guilds, ive joined 2 or 3 now and all have fairly dead chat with no one grouping up
---
No, this is no joke - this can easily be coordinated.. was spirit tapped entirely through deadmimes!
---
That's just a really strong 2h at that level
---
Queue times are dependent on how many people are logging out of the game too.
---
A 2k queue at 6pm on a weeknight is going to take a lot longer than a 2k queue at 11pm because more people are likely to be logging off after 11pm.
---
Lol. Thought so! I saw that in game and got a good chuckle.
---
It probably will be - the population by then will become spread out across the levels instead of this one big lump thats rolling along. Layering is meant to diffuse that massive lump because at the start the entire population is concentrated into 6 odd zones. A few months down the line and it will be spread across the whole map.
---
I had a 71 min wait for Sulfuras the other day
---
There would literally be nothing wrong with players choosing to use an item from a previous expansion because of it's stats. That's interesting itemization rather than it being boring because every BiS items is from [current tier] raid and offers 20 more [x rating] than the previous tier.
---
People would eventually come around when they can hit cap and get enough crit while getting a huge amount more primary attributes but if some random BWL item is BiS until then that isn't a bad thing.
---
Damn I don't think I'll get to 60 on my pvp alt by then
---
I'm worried about blameux pop now
---
&gt;everything is taken
---
Compete and take it back
---
&gt;Keep being ganked
---
That's pvp servers. Get a guild that will level with you or help counter
---
I was in Hillsbrad fields at the town hall and they came inside from behind the North side of the wall. When I died I watched them reset to the North side of the wall. I don't know why this keeps happening but it's very common. Pretty much every time I'm in a crowded area it happens
---
I'd really like to see their first go at new content being buffing up the storylines already available in game. Adding more questlines to existing zones are various levels encouraging people to try new characters and get them up to 60, which adds more to do and reasons to try different raid comps. It'd be safer to add leveling content then potentially end game content that pushes things too far or sets the wrong tone for the future.
---
Nice good to hear
---
To be fair, that's kinda anecdotal. If you're L45+ at this point, your experience is extremely atypical since you're way ahead of the curve.
---
Me too :(
---
Welcome to a PvP server. It would happen at 60 to noob
---
Some people have 30+ on those full servers, that's a lot of time spent
---
Layers are for reducing the number of people in a single area.
---
Queues are maximum capacity of the server.
---
Layers going off doesn't affect queues, it will affect mob respawns and crowding of zones.
---
They are damage and healing meters, they can all show other things like how many debuffs have been cleansed during a fight.
---
So many doomsayers saying the game was gonna die.  Boy we all wanted classic for a reason, it's got a very addicting gameplay.  Someone rolls a warrior and finds out about Ravager?  I'm living in Scarlet Monastery til I get that.  And then you might as well get to 60.
---
No...you're wrong. For one day only players can transfer, during which making a new character is locked.
---
Random af.
---
The difference between a PvP and a PvE server is choice.
---
15 years ago a friend of mine went PvP and I went PvE. He wanted good PvP, I wanted to experience everything. After about a year I would be talking about day long battles near Southshore or Sentinel Hill, he would be talking about getting ganked on the way to dungeons and being unable to get content completed.
---
He ended up stopping playing rather than re-rolling because he was annoyed that I seemed to get better PvP battles, because I could do it when I wanted, and skip it when I didn't want to. It was glorious.
---
Of course, the servers were high population and there were always people doing PvP even on PvE realms; who knows what will happen here.
---
Razorgore has queues as well!
---
... What!? I mean why are we out here, in this canyon?
---
I'm 35
---
With alt+z you can hide the UI so you can get better screenshots.
---
And I agree. Classic feels much more like a real rpg
---
Buncha memers this crowd is.
---
If SM took forever your group are doing it wrong. 5 man SM GY can get you 30-35k exp/hour if you know what you are doing.
---
Indeed
---
They were in MC all day
---
Not much it seems really high drop. Probably because of everyone spam running sm.
---
I’ll make a decision for ya: pvp servers are super fun, but there’s the possibility of being camped (killed over and over by same high level horde/opposite faction) but since pvp isn’t really a thing yet in classic, higher level players are itching to find and attack the other faction, revenge makes it even more fun. If you report camping, people come and save you. The best part is that once you’re a higher level you can attack whatever opposite faction you want and things can get pretty dramatic (in a good way). I recommend it.
---
Private servers didn't have layering.
---
As a healer, how often do you have to stop to regen mana? I really don't know if I'm doing fine and healing efficiently or going oom too fast. If the tank pulls more than 3~4 mobs I usually go close to being oom and have to drink water or even use potions.
---
I see all those AoE group runs being advertised and I'm not really interested in doing that but makes me wonder how the healers keep up?
---
That is literally the fun of a PvP server. Ganking people and getting ganked. If you really hate it that much then maybe you did choose wrong.
---
Karazhan isn’t out yet

Remote access (using google) your comp fron work before driving home. 
---
Setting up on the pc:
---
1) open web browser on the computer you want to remote access (the wow one)
---
2) go to remotedesktop.google.com/access/ 
---
3) follow the onscreen instructions to setup pc. (There are two tabs at the top, remote access and remote support, make sure to have Remote Access selected)
---
4) the final step will ask to create a unique pin. Make it easy for you to remember.
---
4.5) Name your pc (MAIN RIG or something)  
---
5) once the above is done. Minimize all windows and open battle.net launcher with wow selected.
---
6) go to work
---
Setting up on phone (android):
---
1) open the play store. If apple, i think itll probs be in the app store.
---
2) download and install " Chrome Remote Desktop ". (There are imitators, make sure to get the google one)
---
3) open the app
---
4) login to app using the same google account as on pc
---
5) select the appropriate desktop
---
6) swiping moves the mouse around, tapping the screen is a click.
---
That's not BRD.
---
There's nothing I want more than OSRS-esque content updates (Coming from someone whos only knowledge of OSRS is the fact that they (I think) add new content to the game)
---
Then get in a queue you tosspot.
---
I've been noticing very strange aggro circumstances as well. Seems like it needs tweaking but I haven't seen enough of it to really pin down exactly what's happening. But sometimes I'll be in a crowded area and someone else's mobs that they are running away from will just randomly decide to gangbang me instead
---
Holy shit you’re joking ? I got mine in 1 level I banked it though and didn’t equip because I want I sell it
---
😳
---
It does. Skyrim is a poor example of this... In 2011 when it came out, the graphics were absolutely mesmerizing, I never thought anything can top it as far as realistic graphics goes, and now, booting up skyrim to play another sneak archer to high hrothgar and quitting, I realize just how bad it aged... everything is so compressed, rough edges on everything, really bad npc faces, skin and animations. Mods help, but only so much.  
---
A really, really good example of graphics done right is Portal 2. You can boot the game up today and it *feels* like it came out last month, even though it release in 2011 as well. Gta V is another good example, game looks and plays like a brand new one (except Online)
---
My last dungeons my group disintegrated almost instantly. I got so annoyed. Like half of WC cleared, tank dies on the one tough spot. Everyone runs back. Tank decides to rez at spirit healer. We are like "wtf?" he is like "chill in 10 minutes it is over and I need to sell stuff". Mage suddenly says he does not have time to wait 10 minutes and needs to leave (he was also party leader) I'm like "dude, you know the dungeons would be going for another 40 minutes?" (in my mind, not in chat). 
---
So then the tank says something came up and he needs to leave. Meanwhile I'm telling the mage to give me group lead, so I can invite some people I saw. One of the two rogues is like "fuck this" and also leaves. Then the mage after like 3 minutes just standing there finally leaves the group and gives the other rogue group lead. (he gave the rogue group lead before he left, it wasn't automatic).
---
Anyway, it all went well in the end, I got lead from the rogue, searched for DD's and specified a prefferance of Warlocks and Rogues. The rogue that just left got in again, a warlock came and a hunter. Then we did the dungeon like that. It actually went better than with the tank from before, because there was more damage and mobs fell super fast. 
---
All in all, it lead me to install an ignore list addon and to add two new people to my friendslist.
---
trusting a rogue or a party with a rogue in it was your first mistake
---
LOL 😂
---
I have a female named  omgmyudders.
---
I did them
---
You don’t have many friends do you?
---
Hillsbrad or stonetalon mountain my dude
---
Yeah - Cenarion Circle don't like their tranquility ruffled.
---
Sorry about that, wasnt trying to spread false info. Just a fucking idiot.
---
I don't need it on my desktop.  That's what the ignore list is for!  If you're an asshat in my group? You never group with me again.  Irritating channel troll?  Good luck finding a tank.
---
And I'm imagining this will be a lot like private servers where people hire tanks.  Which means the opposite is true as well.  Are you a good player? Are you fun to chat with?  You'll never have to pay for a tank.  Save your 20g, I gotchu.
---
That is not dungeon, it’s a raid.
---
God speed Questless....god speed.
---
What’s your race / class?
---
It would be cool to open each of those woolen bags to reveal more woolen bags
---
Also /world.
---
Same until I read your comment
---
I hate current wow and anything pretty much cataclysm+. I originally played in vanilla and dabbled in some of the more recent expansions. Classic is the shit. It's just like it was back in the day.
---
Happens to me all the time. If people are running away from mobs and you heal (whether the are your tagged mobs or not...) they turn and chase you. It’s as if healing and attacking carry the same value in vanilla.
---
retail bad upvotes to the left
---
The best way is to buy weapons for your level range every 2 levels. Most of them right now sell just barely more than on the vendor. So you don't lose much money by buying them.
---
OFF WITH YE
---
I will rip the secrets from your flash.
---
Yeah was happy after 3 days of questing to finally get a new weapon. Had my weapon since lvl 15 or so. Yesterday a new one dropped for me. But ty for the advice, cause i normally go for swords or maces because of those racials of humans
---
You should have everything on your bars
---
There’s a nifty addon on Curseforge called Server Friends Only that I’ve been using since Classic came out. It adds an extra tab that only shows friends on your current server just like vanilla! It’s amazing!
---
Lmfao. Rolls on a PvP server then complains about PvP.
---
This is why I rolled the RP server
---
😂😂 the fact that you did the math speaks about your curiousity, at least. Most people, my self included, would just wonder and move on.
---
You can be combat sword and just run around face rolling like a warrior once you're geared. You're not gonna be the best but you can get some nice crits. Just be sure to carry a dagger so you can ambush as well.
---
Went to loh on Stalagg this afternoon with a 3 hour wait. Didnt get to play but I am okay with it.
---
bottom right
---
Blizz is offering free character transfers coming up and will likely allow pvp to pve but not pve to PVP. So, you should be able to transfer off.
---
Yesterday being level 14 in Barrens I had a grey leather shoulders drop. Nearly vendored it but then I realized...
---
I don't think I ever said it wasn't subjective lol, and anyways I've yet to encounter a single 4chan user on Whitemane. But hey, keep being patronizing and making assumptions about a server you've never played on!
---
thinking about starting a warrior or rogue. Why’d you choose warrior?
---
What is his attack speed?
---
Well shot you got good eyes.
---
Remote access your computer before leaving so you can be in que while your in traffic or on your way home! 
---
Quick adventure, 2 mins in and out, promise:
---
4.5) Name your pc (WoW Rig or something)  
---
1) open the play store. If apple, i think itll probs? be in the app store.
---
2) download and install the app " Chrome Remote Desktop ". (There are imitators, make sure to get the google one)
---
5) select the appropriate desktop (WoW Rig)
---
6) swiping moves the mouse around, tapping the screen is a click. 
---
Enjoy WoW my friend!
---
Wait wtf kind of server do you play on? On mine I see nothing but SM calls. Well 50% RFK and 40% SM.
---
First time?
---
I don't want to be that guy but remember how apex legends did the same in its honeymoon phase of the first month of release? 
---
I love classic but it is still in that phase. It may be that the right now is the most players the game will see with some level of drop off from now. 
---
It will be interesting to see how it performs from this point going forward. I love it whatever the case and can't wait to get home to slowly level my priest :).
---
I’d be very happy if I didn’t have to worry about upgrading a piece of gear
---
It does unless there’s already a GCD occurring. IE, standing still doing nothing and swapping weapons, you will get new GCD. However if you use something like Hamstring, you can swap weapons during the incurred GCD from Hamstring without incurring another.
---
Ye u need fireball in case your frost gets interrupted
---
Southern Barrens
---
No No! Farm gorillas by booty bay. The hairs sell for 6s each
---
I could try that. As i know the ah is filled with low priced stuff, so i could maybe shop there a little bit
---
I wasn’t the guy you were talking to above. I never made an assumptions.
---
Nice!
---
What are you doing in grandmas room?
---
priest main here, just seeing that pattern gets my hopes up
---
So wholesome, so very very wholesome. Hold me!
---
I agree removing it and simplifying the game even more wasn't the right direction. It should have just been reworked like I said so that there are some kind of meaningful choices to be made with the system. Things that actually alter gameplay instead of just serving as a min-max tool.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/classic-discussion
---
How? I have an occulus rift (old version), can I do this?
---
Being on this subreddit is a slippery slope my friend.. there’s only so many hours of reading about WoW classic before it makes more sense just to play it.
---
Give it a try and let us know.
---
no it was me :)
---
So they need to heal you out of combat and use more of their water because you are a cheap-ass player that can't even be bothered to stock on food? Got it.
---
See this is making me want to quit this game.  I'm giving wow a try for the first time.  Coming from runescape osrs as my only real point of reference to mmorpg's. I'm used to being able to look generally how I want and having real lasting skills beyond combat needs.
---
What? You're copying what other people did before you. Have are discovering 0 things, and you are struggling precisely 0% of the time, unless you're bad.  There is no glory in googling "Onyxia 40 man strat".
---
But like I said, streamers will take all the raid world first, and Blizzard did nothing about it.
---
Thanks man, worth a shot. Sent a pm
---
lame
---
I knew that something was weird when I did those quests on a naughty server.
---
If you do it this way you run the risk of overpopulating or under populating a single server.
---
Their level 15, it’s definitely worth 8 silver.
---
I thought people were calling the classic hardcore people (no changers) "boomers" as a joke because of the whole classic vs retail player thing.

Alchemist here. Thanks, I couldn't remember where that dropped from. 
---
Never really liked LiveStrat though.
---
Anyway, solid drops.
---
Why is ESO on this list? That was DOA, no?
---
Honestly, so long as he's still in NA, it really won't matter. I played for years on a NA-East server while on the west coast. Honestly, it's hardly noticeable -- if it makes any difference at all.
---
In my work I have to pretty often ask our clients to send us various screenshots and man it is hard sometimes.
---
The mats are a huge grind and youd basically need someone to do it for you at lvl 30. You could buy them off AH but its expensive and youd still need someone high lvl to help you finish it off. Better to wait till late 30s honestly.
---
What tho
---
great, everyone then goes to heartseeker because it has a cool name and that gets full to the brim
---
they’re doing this solely because of full realms, letting anyone switch to any gives the chance of more full realms, their way makes the distribution way more even
---
man i feel you, i was a tauren hunter and never played alliance.  I did roll another hunter but went night elf and its a whole new experience.
---
I mean, I get it, but this is the lowest form of petty.
---
Stonetalon. Get ready for Harpies.
---
Just gotta suck it up. I have friends on Arugal and Yojamba but had to go to Felstriker because of the queues.
---
Which is the same as LFG... why would you be needing the same channel 2 times?
---
Oh
---
True.
---
Back in Vanilla my brother didn't know there was an actual tram and walked all the way down the tram's path.

No one gives a shit.
---
This has such an osrs vibe
---
And yet, you’re using Questie..
---
Level 21 warrior here.  I hear you. ;)
---
Yeah it must be quick and easy when you can run that fast!
---
I’m sorry but could you stop jumping to conclusions and accusing me of anything?  Where did I say anything about all those things you’re riding up my ass about?
---
I see what you’re saying, but in classic you can almost immediately replace this shield with the superior aegis of the scarlet commander
---
We do this in classic because there is a reason to do so. The guild I joined, I joined because I've been talking with one of them in the barrens chat for the past 3 days.
---
I give warriors bufffood, because warriors get shit on in classic and they can use every bit of help.
---
I help people defeat a monster or get a gathering quest done, because they get murdered when they are alone.
---
The reason I travel through the world and fish is because I get an advantage out of it.
---
Classic WoW does not have socialising because this is what people want. It has it, because it is incentiviced by mutual suffering.
---
Kalimdor has always been a pvp hotspot for alliance. Anecdotally Ive seen a lot of allies attacking barrens so they seem active as well.
---
Man you really need to get off the internet and seek help
---
Ok thank you!
---
And what lvl? :)
---
Highly considering taking the offer to move to Earthfury, only because it's tied to Herod and I know a fuckton of people went there
---
I'm only 37 and already sick of Skeram as Alliance because Horde own the server. Any time I join a few players so I stop getting gibbed by random mages or duo levelers, a group of Horde twice as big steamroll us and cause our group to disband. I imagine Herod isn't too different and maybe Earthfury will be a refuge where Alliance will have a chance if not majority
---
Doubtful.  Not many people are going to take free server transfers.  Would you transfer if your friend didn't?  And your friend doesnt want to transfer because one of his friends wont transfer.
---
Some people will use this but realistically I'm going to bet its minimal until layering is totally removed.  If layer removal makes queues seriously bad, people might consider it then.
---
Booty Bay Bank
---
Like I've been playing UHDK since WotLK.
---
I could argue it's currently 3 buttons with a lot of CD's and a DoT to maintain. Like it wouldn't be true imho, but it's there.
---
Honestly it, like a lot of classes, is less a rotation and more an active priority system where you're constantly lining up timings and trying not to waste GCDs while maintaining 3 resources and not letting certain things drop off.
---
At the same time, in any fight where you can just stand still in Vanilla I'm pretty sure I could play two classes with one hand on a  Razer Naga and it'd still be easier than UHDK.
---
Thank you for this
---
Then you have a choice to play with your friends and/or guild or move. Blizzard can't fix your guild not agreeing or having clear communication channels.
---
RP'ing a video game doesn't really give license to be an ass, but hey it's the internet, people suck, and don't think about the fact that it's other human beings on the end of that avatar they're steamrolling... so what you going to do.
---
I'm not trying to say wpvp shouldn't happen on a pvp server, I'm just saying it's not for me that's all. I can appreciate enemy factions being KoS, I just typically prefer being treated the way I'm treating others.
---
Doesn't really work in video games sometimes.
---
Technically it should be spelled 'like-geared' - I feel like I recall this in BGs, but it was also retail and around WotLK - but everyone would queue in with the same higher/highest tier PvP gear, which killed the thrill of frequent BG players who specifically most relish demolishing people who are lower geared (worse equipment) than them.
---
I see, aimed shot feels a bit weird in the rotation though.
---
This makes me so thorny.
---
Yeah dude it was a joke
---
Wich Addon is this? looks great
---
On herod aswell. No problems.
---
Theres a secret trick to tanking this boss.  All he does is cast spells.  Tank gets a good chunk of aggro at the start, then jumps off the platform to lose line of sight.  Arugal stops casting, runs down the stairs to cast again, tank runs back up, taunt him on the way, lose line of sight again.  Drop down again, repeat.  If he teleports you can do it on the other set of stairs too.  
---
Me and a group wiped a bunch on him til we figured this out and then it was a breeze.
---
:^)
---
I made an Orc Warlock named Ongo in reference to this. Looking forward to leveling him
---
I also wouldn't be shocked if those players received suspensions and temporary bans if they griefed another player like that.
---
Or unlock completely
---
Gl in finding someone :D
---
The "low pop" servers still have multiple layers full of full vanilla servers. Those "low pop" servers will be high or full come phase 2 while Herod and the like are gonna have 50k queues.
---
Glad I’m not the only one who noticed that
---
Play Horde. Never seen a Shammy roll on Warrior gear.
---
Cool thanks.
---
Didn't expect wowcirclejerk's ''sense of community'' meme to be this accurate
---
Tradeskill master
---
I like him. All those compairison and bfa hates is like a big circle jerk. Its ok to complain but do we also need that on classic subreddit ? People go here to not have to read about retail...
---
What is dead may never die!
---
And their merging process avoids name collision problems. So it's don't understand why they don't merge more again. Unless there's something behind the scenes that makes it not worth doing, but I can't imagine what it would be.
---
36
---
I’ve been doing dungeons since 13. Would storm wind stockades be the better starting point than deadmines?
---
He was making a reference to iasip
---
I'd invite him. I hear he's got lots of great +Str +AP Plate ;)
---
Nah, I heard that was the next patch, this one is definitely transmogging.
---
Lol man you make me want to start
---
Transmog would ruin pvp, you depend on looking at your opponent's gear a lot of the time.
---
At lvl 32 you are still above average in speed.  Stop focusing on max speed and find a nice leveling buddy and explore the world
---
I also see a lot of new people who have never played the game!
---
Only buy spells you actually use. Guides on places like Icy Veins or Wowhead will tell you which one are worthwhile to use while leveling.
---
If anyone can go anywhere, then it just runs the risk of making a mega server all over again.
---
"you think you do, but... you dont"
---
Unless you only use reddit on mobile, then it's just way easier to take a picture and upload it....
---
If it’s a talent doesn’t it automatically get put in your spellbook?
---
Ya know, besides layering making places empty, this could happen on retail too.
---
Yeah no kidding, it's quite  the reach.
---
How do you see what players are targeting?  I need that.
---
Census addon on today the 3rd, shows level 20 to be the highest number of players.
---
The "medium/low" pop servers now still have multiple layers of full vanilla servers. Once phase 2 comes out even those servers will have queues at peak times. Herod/Stalagg/etc are gonna be in for a surprise when they're realm that's "full" with 15k queues now ends up being a "full" realm with 50k queues come the end of layering.
---
&gt;You likely miss upwards of 20% of your autos, between miss/dodge/parry. Factor in a 20% miss rate and you need nearly 21% crit
---
That's not how [attack table](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) works. Please don't spread misinformation.
---
Undead is the best horde race for mage, but if you would rather play a gnome go fir it.
---
Lol. I've already had similar experiences. It's great to finally have our game back.
---
That looks like x-pearl my friend
---
Oh look another cow/corpse/alien/slim elf thinks he's being menacing.  
---
&gt;It must be tough being the beta faction, huh?
---
Must be tough to:  
---
- Have your leader die to murlocs  
---
- Be defeated while roided on demon blood and pushed back to the world you destroyed  
---
- Centaurs hunting you to near extinction  
---
- Hide in the sewers of the city you died in  
---
Truly the alpha faction, lmao
---
Wait a month for subscriptions to run out.
---
i’d say priest so he can put shields on you and themself, anything else and you’ll just get piled
---
Same here man. Today wasn't so bad. I think it might be getting better.
---
Untapped market for people to get serverly addicted, yeah player cap is not going down!
---
Whats the Kromcrush Discord link?
---
Time is more expensive than money.
---
Realms in vanilla belonged to battleground of around 4-5 (I think) realms that shared battlegrounds.
---
I'm not sure if that will be making a return.
---
why is it that people rush to get their phones out to take pictures when the "print screen" button is on the keyboard?
---
Is it worth not balancing pops as well on the off chance (which is realistically a very low chance) the servers end up cycling pops? Even then, that's a problem that you stop early on.
---
Renew is fine, you can leave that one on.
---
Druid WL wrecked the pvp scene for so long... That life steal, life link spec SL/SL wl...
---
But you actually give a lot of arguments for how retail discourages communication and similar.
---
Zones being too spread out, buffs removed or only for in groups, etc.
---
Almost everyone just runs a staff over a 1h/off-hand just for stats/actives(if applicable). Really a staff and a 1h/held in offhand are interchangeable for whichever benefits your build the most.
---
well its looks better than vanilla  at least
---
I chose PvP because it adds an extra layer to every interaction you have with a member of the opposite faction, and that's more meaningful and provides emergent gameplay.
---
Even the choice not to attack someone made mutually can be interesting. 
---
But you also have to be ready to deal with the frustration of world PvP. 9/10 members of the opposite faction are nice but if 1/10 decide to spend an evening ganking lowbies then that makes questing in the area just about impossible. Luckily Classic WoW is structured in a way where there's always meaningful things to do besides leveling in a zone, whereas in retail WoW if you're not max level almost anything you can do is meaningless and inefficient.
---
Teamviewer :
---
Install teamviewer on pc and phone
---
Start it on your phone
---
Put the ID and pw in
---
Done
---
This exact solution has been parroted a thousand times here and on the forums. Blitz didn’t come up with it
---
Because people dont understand that these are for unhealthy high pop severs and not for servers in a good spot
---
I wish i had such issues to not transfer. 
---
*Cries in common*
---
My main driving force when leveling a warrior in vanilla was seeing the green iron helm on a dwarf pally. Still one of my favorite helmet models to this day
---
I do, I just don’t whine at the thought of having to scroll through them ^_^
---
Lol fair fights
---
Holy pally is very nice for lock.
---
They changed to rating because a 2% crit item in vanilla should not give 2% in max level TBC.
---
Are the tarren mill/southshore battles going on in Classic?! I haven't went to see.
---
and that's with layering right?
---
Idk how Phase 2 is even going to function
---
#6 is the key for why I'm going fast
---
Mograinne eu, 300 minutes que after 6
---
Horde have always have better racials though. Literally every xpac until and the only alliance racial that was better was EMFH and all the horde cried about it
---
Try Desolace or Arathi Highlands. Failing that, do some dungeons. Danger is simply in the nature of PvP servers.
---
Cats can also learn both claw and bite so you dont have to choose just 1
---
You think I’d be able to play on a 2017 MacBook Air that has 8 GB of ram?
---
I’m in Utah and play on Kirtonos, 35-60 ms and no problems at all.
---
All you had to do was to follow the damn order Omki
---
i like 30-40. lot of great instances to get a couple levels easy.
---
20-30 is a slog of running around the entire planet and getting ganked.
---
The problem is you rolled gnome... I can speak for myself that when I see a gnome, I go out of my way to frost shock them to death. /s  
---
Anyway, I  would try to go to desolace and grind mobs there.  It tends to be pretty... well... desolate...
---
You can get BONEBITER in that range and it’s superior.
---
But why would anyone use Reddit phone app while sitting at a PC.
---
That’s an even lower iq move
---
Give him your butt too
---
They nerfed it tho?
---
When you lvl up. It will all be Worth :) wpvp is the absolutte fun
---
Dwarf priests are everywhere. Priests in general seem overplayed. Surprisingly lot of druids. Very little mage /warlock
---
This is definitely happening and I don't remember it from vanilla. It even happens with opposite faction members. Horde player overpulled, died and suddenly I saw several mobs coming at me from a fairly long distance (tagged).
---
Well, if you want balance, then you don't make it a free-for-all.
---
Shams &gt; Paladins
---
Is this Northwatch Hold or whatever where you have to escort the elf back to Ratchet?
---
I just did that quest tonight, haha.
---
What a chad
---
Mirage Raceway feels really Nice!
---
Hit me up if u Alliance, Abb or Supakin
---
I mean extra mitigation means more mobs at once as well. 3 mobs with damage reductions is a lot more useful than 3 with 1 extra hit on them
---
At level 16 you'll have a quest from the rogue trainer in Orgrimmar that will send you to a boat just outside of Ratchet. You can continuously pick the boxes to level your lockpicking up.
---
warriors and mages are the most common I find but that’s not surprising, the amount of shamans is a bit surprising however, they’re everywhere
---
Omg, I need to make a hunter named Karold and get this pet so we can be Karold and Humar
---
How does a staff attack? Does it “shoot” anything like a wand or is it melee?
---
Fucking thanks!!!
---
It is also because people had lost trust in the company. I had, and wouldn't ever trust what they say (as they have said stuff and done differently many times before) until they follow it up with actions.
---
Yeah lol
---
Do you understand how layering works? It splits the server up. There are dozens of layers. Add more layers and remove the cap. So they have to give a specific realm more resources, big deal. Speed has quadrupled and storage has octupled. There is no excuse with layering active. This game doesn't require much resources. I have seen private servers ran on potato setups. There is no excuse with the banks of blades (or whatever they use they are pretty secretive about what hardware they use) at their disposal.
---
If the mob is already engaged, their aggro range shouldn't matter to anyone else. There's definitely an issue with this.
---
Ne hunter is dime a dozen. Good for wsg aimed shot from a bush. But otherwise id pick dwarf hunter imo.
---
Gnome rogue is tiny so harder to see and catch.
---
Staff of Jordan is a very valuable weapon. If you have it I would suggest saving it until more gold is in the economy and bgs are available. This staff   will  go a long way if you are leveling from 35 -50 but will be replaced before you step foot in a raid.
---
Just Incendius things.
---
yeah, killing quest givers and flight masters will start soon
---
I ask myself the same thing.
---
As someone who thought classic was stupid and was going to bomb, I'm now so happy to have tried it and to see that people are enjoying it as much as I am
---
Go back to retail bich
---
Because they went Horde. That would be perfecly valid reason to drop them.
---
Yeah but 2h fury war doesn't pick up til high 20s and at 30 you will have ww axe. It's faster to run as arms or fury 1h until then. Same method you just don't crit as hard and take less dmg from hits. More sustainable and helps with  warrior solo dilemma at low lvl
---
I honestly even prefer the classic graphic setting so far. It just seems more fitting with the textured water and less grass etc.
---
Please stop replying to me until you can do so with a little more respect.  I didn’t take any unwarranted personal shots at you, you should at least show me the same respect.  You came in here accusing me of things I didn’t say, and continue to attack me now after trying to be civil about it.  You should try being less angry, it’s not a really good look for you.
---
It’s like a tiny edge over other players. Skill would brag this advantage hands down
---
Still SOME charm? Classic wow is one of the most charming games I've ever played and the graphic style plays a huge part of it.
---
Yeah, fair fights. Fights where you can actually deal damage to the opponents and your abilities actually work on them. Not numerically exactly balanced.
---
Every class is a rogue now. There are ability builders and then spenders, eg. lock and pala have a combo point interface. Lmao.
---
Its a good ass name! Namechange pls
---
Reported for speedfacking. Nice editing skills.
---
Cause mobile is easier to use while playing? IDK dude. I'm just saying its stupid easy as an average person to just take a picture instead of a screenshot. Moat people don't have software like shareX or whatever to host images easily. It's like solving a problem with the tools you know are available.
---
If your friends are split up across multiple servers and they are really your friends then someone will have to bite the bullet and join each other on the other's server. I never understood this. If you've been playing a lot you are in your 30s. Keep a level 30 something and don't play with your friends or play with your friends but have to start over. Unless you are one of those people that are already level 60 (then you played solo anyways) there's no reason for this. They can't just open transfers between all servers because some servers will end up fucked again.  
---
The other option is to wait for realm-wide paid server transfers which will come eventually because those won't trigger mass movements that completely destroy the amazing work Blizz put into balancing the servers and making sure they are all about the same HIGH population after todays transfers. We had  server transfers during vanilla despite people complaining that people would transfer to avoid their reputation so I can't see why they wouldn't implement them now since the system is already in place.   
---
But honestly, I would rather play with my friend than wait and say fuck it, I'll move. Especially after all the server queues open up following these transfers.
---
If the grievance is non-stop, and they can see that you're waiting for said NPC, report them.
---
I would. One time I tried Horde and that feeled like betryal to your Homeland
---
Ole Morgan Ladimore!
---
Never invite him? Haven't you learnt anything, mate? Invite him, have him come to you. Bonus points if you make him wait. Then kick him. Optionally kick him before a boss fight if he kept advertising he needs a special item.
---
I do hold grudges. It's a source of joy, remember that.
---
For those who don't know ffxiv at a jihj level and think 2.5 sec gcd sounds dumb. 
---
At a high level the gcd is kinda shorter than wows because of the off gcd abilities, for many glasses you try to fit 2 abilities in between the gcd, this means that for parts of your rotation your actually using 3 abilities in under 2.5sec
---
I played to cap recently and was surprised by how fun the class gameplay is in ffxiv. That said this current expansion seems to be moving down the homogenization path which makes me sad. Hopefully they don't go much further because all of the tanks and healers are basically very similar now.
---
Players will always optimize the fun out of a game if given the chance. Give people on a server an item that doubles the entire groups damage output, doubles their healing and halves their damage taken and they will always use it while running mythic. Then they go and complain it being too easy.
---
A game has to encourage the players to do what it wants. Because players will always search for the most optimal way to play, even if it leads to them having less fun. The developer instead has to take said optimal styles out of the game or encourage more fun ways to play optimally.
---
I’m level 46 and get ganked constantly, it’s called being on a PvP server.
---
I remote in and queue up an hour before I get off work everyday. I get home at 4:30 and still have to wait about 20 minutes. 
---
If not then there’s no chance of me playing that day.
---
No they didn't. You're thinking of raids xp. 5 man's are still amazing.
---
Does anyone have links to some info on the level 29 twink bracket? I was wondering what classes are strong and what BiS gear looks like.
---
That’s not a political or social statement: thats a pun.
---
We’re less intelligent and mature because you’re cheeks at PvP? Lol aight big guy.
---
Imagine thinking that max level in osrs is anywhere near close to max level in wow.
---
Also OSRS has a total level and membership requirement to vote.
---
He’s higher level than you, he deserves the name more.
---
Druid tanks don't get a mention?? The same applies to us.
---
Classic is not trial based.  Only retail is accessible on a trial account. (I tried to get a trial for now.)
---
This. There's a reason questing gets easier when you get Mortal Strike and it's not because MS is super powerful. It's basically an instant cast version of slam but it doesn't reset your swing timer or suffer from spell pushback.
---
And believe it or not but it seems like they added some new afk Kicks if you are standing still
---
We keep on getting dced like ever 30 or so whenever we are just afk jumping but there's no dc if we are actually playing
---
Meanwhile I only experience everything in the dark. Thanks, work.
---
Very little mage? 
---
Our guild population is 88 and we have 20 mages in guild. Mages everywhere.
---
&gt; Yeah... How the fuck did we get to this point again??
---
If you look at Ions carreer, and especially what he did before he worked for Blizzard, it is only logical that the game developed to the fast-paced, chore liststyle, streamlined gameplay it is. Ever since he joined with WotlK, the game moved forward in this exact direction.
---
What is it you don't understand about "everything is relative"? I can only explain it in so many ways.
---
Luna
---
&gt;Get it, because i can turn into a tree.
---
Not until TBC
---
I'm amazed they aren't in Westfall tbh
---
Been seeing alot of mages, rogues, and warlocks on my end.
---
So you can only transfer to a specific server based on the server you're already on? So much for joining my friends.
---
RIP
---
updooted because it's not a phone pic.
---
Nah Herod
---
Considering most, if not all of the big name streamers are against things like LFG, faster leveling, and multiple raid difficulties, I wouldn't even mind.
---
Ahhh bummer. Do you know how to check the faction numbers of the servers? I prefer to make a character on a balanced lvl realm
---
Warlock. Notable points:
---
 - You will probably be stuck with your Imp out on passive in the MT group.
---
 - You will have to farm soul shards like crazy to hand healthstones out to your fellow raiders.
---
I do, skinning is vendoring for laughable little. Full stack of medium leather is 10 silver. What the fuck
---
To be fair we were discussing this while playing :) now I'm in bed and I can't sleep because my brain is thinking classic wow.
---
Same situation, I killed Hogger with a Night Elf hunter, few hours and some 5-ish levels later we somehow bumped into each other on one of the islands in the middle of loch modan. I remember stuff like this happening alllll the time in vanilla during long sesh’s. I’m glad it’s the same here ☺️
---
Duskwood chat has been pretty great ngl.
---
Seriously... he didn't need that by any stretch of the imagination |:
---
After the treacherous alliance dogs launched an unprovoked attack on horde questers south of Tarren Mill, a counter raid formed. Despite the presence of [high level](https://i.imgur.com/bJqXcoi.jpg) alliance, we persevered in our push along the [main road](https://i.imgur.com/M502Ozw.jpg). The cowards fled before our might as we pushed into the [outskirts](https://i.imgur.com/nFyIuye.jpg) of southshore, incurring the wrath of guards. Some cowards hid behind them but it [brought them no respite](https://i.imgur.com/Pq2MvCT.jpg) from our vengeance.   We lost many brave souls pushing as deep into southshore as we dared. though we had to retreat eventually, the alliance learned their lesson and there haven't been any problems in Hillsbrad since. 
---
tl,dr some great world pvp happened, totally organic. dozens of players involved on both sides, horde won through sheer weight of numbers after a couple of hours of alliance masscring us across hillsbrad.
---
And you got the macaw, too :)
---
I mean sure, but when these things launched it had to be simmed too.
---
and before the era of internet being the common way to spread knowledge, the system had to be simpler. 
---
the modern complexity is a response to all of that work and proliferation, since players have gotten better at recognizing BiS, and consuming content, blizzard needed a way to make their work last. and here comes in the bull shit rng.
---
I agree that modern wow RNG is bullshit, but not for the reason pointed out here. It is predatory to the max, and is meant to keep people at the slot machine to so speak. But the complexity it adds is imo a side issue at best.
---
Hemo sword build around level 35+ on a pvp server if you know how to use it will let you destroy people, dont mess with daggers at all until you get perdition's blade from MC at 60, and even then dagger rogues lose to other hemo rogues 1v1, combat does highest dps for pve but will lose to most competent players
---
I just ignore those people, problem solved.
---
We were passing through Elwynn Forest wondering lost when he said “hat.” My goodness what a revelation it was! We stayed in Elwynn for an hour or so just to soak in his wisdom. He really does have a way with words. I look forward to his next care package of bandages and some grub.
---
I'm in a 2 man guild with my brother and we have all the perks. They're easy to get. Ok, not all, like the Cata feasts or whatever, but the mobile guild bank and mount speed all the heirlooms and whatnot.
---
You are doing it wrong, aoe farm bro!
---
If you utilize Frost Nova, you should rarely have to deal with push back. Sure, you can just sit there and spam frost bolt, but there are many ways to make it more interesting while also making it more efficient.
---
This was my first epic world drop in vanilla. 14 years ago. I can remember the exact place. In Tanaris, at the place with the pirates, behind a hut. (With my paladin). Seccond one was the skull shield, that dropped in the AV Bg. On a monstrosity.
---
Those where the only two in my long vanilla playtime.
---
Can't remember even one epic or legendary item from retail....
---
Look up /equip: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro
---
I have no problems levelling up multiple characters, and have in fact changed realms to lower pops several times.
---
Not only that, but the suggestion isn't a free transfer to anywhere.
---
So I don't know why you think this is about me. This is just about what the best decision would be for actually getting people to move off of high population servers onto the lower population servers.
---
Everyone says leveling a warrior is hard. They just don't know how to grind mobs that are close to the graveyard imo.
---
People don't take too kindly to streamers around here, especially when all you do is spam the subreddit looking for followers. At least make an honest effort to be a part of the community first.
---
I'm lucky for you. My gf of almost 4 years said she's fine with me playing 24/7 on WoW launch (she's not into games), now a week after launch I can feel that she didn't really mean it. She's mostly rather annoyed. 
---
As I play more and more, I'm actually thinking about breaking up in the coming weeks. I haven't been this happy in probably 10 years. It's not just because of WoW though, it's always been this way that she didn't care at all when I was talking about *any* nerdy stuff or stuff that I like, and the more I think about it, the less I can think that that's a good sign for a lengthy relationship, even though we share a lot of same opinions and humor when it comes to other normie-things. 
---
If anyone has advice please let me hear it, I'm in a tough situation right now. Mid 20s and no kids in sight yet, I'm really torn between staying with her and having kids one day (I'd like to be a dad I think), or being able to be who I really am without her making me feel shitty all the time because of it. Man this is tough.
---
He's just in a que
---
Still considered a meme spec that won't get many invites
---
I think you could do this:
---
#showtooltip
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast [modifier:ctrl] Blizzard (Rank 1); Blizzard (Rank 2)
---
But I i think /stopcasting is meant for spells like Counterspell or Iceblock.
---
Ahahaha
---
Anything above 100 fps/hertz in wow is impossible to feel, while I can tell you if my csgo runs on 165fps/hz (my monitors refresh rate) or on 165hz/300fps.
---
It does depend on the game engine, for 99% of games there is ZERO benefit. WoW is one of those games. Literally no point to ever put your fps limit over 100.
---
This isn't just because of the game engine, but also how you play MMOs: there's simply no need for quick camera movements. Don't buy a high refresh rate monitor for wow guys. 100 Hz max is totally fine, there's no way you'll ever move your camera that fast. If you play other games than WoW, like fast-paced shooters, only then it makes sense to get a high refresh rate monitor.
---
But limit your fps to 100 regardless of your monitor refresh rate, otherwise you're just wasting energy, creating heat and noise.
---
OPs post is plain wrong.
---
Osrs approach
---
Same, 3 years I've been sitting Reddit and YouTube. Not finding any fun to play. Boom wow drops and I play like 8 hours day and want to more.
---
same for thunderfury

What's the name? If you don't mind me asking.

---
Yeah there’s no way to JUST install classic and not retail right? Literally leaving on a work trip tomorrow and was about to install all of retail on my laptop just to get a crack at classic.
---
I understand how layering works but more layers and increasing the server pop caps would make the already existing latency spikes in the high population servers more more apparent. These servers are already running a fuck load more players than any of the private servers. The private servers usually have a cap of around 3k-5k and we have already gone to 10k and still have at peak hours most of the NA servers full.
---
Yessir

My barrens chat has been mostly your usual barrens chat and funny trolls but for some reason during the evening you get a hint of

I missed you barrens chat and now you’re here to stay :)

so they dont have to tab out and waste exp, duh.

Destiny 2 Shadowkeep, Borderlands 3.

---
It's the classic tradeoff: If you invite a hunter, you can blame him for everything, and he can need on everything.
---
what's the point of auto swing timer addons? i'm just not totally sure how that info helps me.
---
Positive is great and all, but stop acting like this could never occur before the release of WoW Classic. It happens in a multitude of games, including retail WoW.
---
Would you rather:
---
Play an immersive mmo with pretty low skill required for PvE content. Lot's of inconvenient shit but it just adds to the exploration and immersion. Some skill in PvP but very unbalanced
---
Play high skill PvE encounters but the "world" is pretty watered down and nobody cares about it. Less inconvenient annoying tasks and the ability to choose whatever difficulty you want (from braindead easy I just want to look at the bosses and press whatever abilities I feel like, to mindnumbingly hard that will take a month of playing vs the same boss to get it down.
---
A is Classic, B is retail. Really depends what you're looking for in a game. I'm guessing you're looking for A since you're in an MMO subreddit. Retail has really intense high skill PvE content that Vanilla can never match, but it's an absolute dogshit "MMO"
---
People are still selling in the auction house for less than vendor price... they don’t think of the auction house commission before setting the price
---
Completely new to WoW. I'm level 18, a gnome Warlock, playing with my friend a dwarf Paladin. I've noticed that despite being a dps class, as we level I feel pretty useless. He seems to be doing as much damage to quest mobs as I do despite being a healer. I feel like we kill the mobs before my DoTs do any real damage. My rotation is Pet attack &gt; Immolate &gt; Corruption &gt; Curse of Agony &gt; Shadowbolt. Also, I keep reading guides saying I should be using all my mana and lifetapping often, but I never even get close to using like a 5th of my mana despite the above rotation.
---
Can someone please help and tell me what im doing wrong?
---
Found it, thank you :)
---
No shame in copying something that is working so well.
---
Racials are nice but aren’t game breaking.
---
How is druid healing while leveling? I notice a LOT of druids don't  seem to want to heal dungeons, even when they are fairly high level.
---
Is it really hard or gear dependent? or are the druids I see just being nervous over nothing?
---
TMI bro
---
And what's DS stand for?
---
Why were you flagged for PvP? Just came from Ashenvale ?
---
Not having any friends helps a lot with this.
---
I'm going to guess you're not the only one.

---
Yep, and they can't even use the excuse of "Well I've been playing private servers for years" because even private servers had changes, like over-tuning raid encounters.
---
...
---
You want to change it to the FFVII victory fanfare don't you?
---
There is a boat just south of Ratchet, inside on the lower deck towards the front of the ship is a small room with many lockboxes. They have nothing in them, but can be used to level lockpicking up.
---
Someone here was saying it’s against the ToS to use remote access. It’s in there somewhere.
---
Why is there a massive garbage pillar in your room?
---
Oh yeah at 60 haha
---
Silly question: Did Blizzard give away any free game-time during the release of classic? I've been wanting to try out Classic WoW but I can't afford to pay for the sub right now due to financial reasons.
---
Had a wild journey through Northwatch on my server, and every time I see one of the crew I cracked skulls with I toss a /cheer and a heal.
---
This is better than the 4 hour queues I had to deal with the last week
---
I'm having this same experience on a Warlock. Following for revelations of fast leveling schemes.
---
That better be a Shaman or Pally complaining. A Warrior has no need for that weapon when they can get Whirlwind Axe.
---
same with most neutral zones, most horde meet thier first alliance at ratchet, proceed to attack and get wasted by the bruisers. Druids get the experience a little earlier, but since you are in Nelf territory you don't tend to go in guns blazing, Nelfs though may think they are safe to hit you since everyone around them is green.
---
And this will be the case always. You rolled on a pvp server, people are gonna pvp you. You just grit and bare until you're 60, then do the same again on an alt.
---
"Tf you want us to do about it?"
---
Or balance changes, or the addition of arenas, or more solo content.
---
kill lvl 35-37s
---
People didn't want to lose their names and guild names. Full servers are not the issue. Some queue is okay. It's the overly full servers that have like 15-30k people on them are the issue and enough of those will leave to create new high pop realms and lower that queue enough to be tolerable.  
---
Also there are no low pop realms truly in 2019. Even low pop realms  have several times more people on them then a full retail realm. Also there aren't even any low pop realms literally either. At least not during peak hours. There are some medium pop realms that are low pop in the middle of the night or early morning and many of those got server transfers today. The ones that didn't are usually RP servers that have more stable communities or were ones that actually teetered between medium and high, not medium and low. And remember, like I said, even when they drop down to low in the middle of the night, they still have several times more people than a full server use to be able to handle, They pretty much perfectly managed the population on each realm. That's why they were so slow opening new realms. They made sure so many people joined that the long term health was assured before opening the next one. I actually really applaud them for this because they were getting a lot of shit to go faster.   
---
Lastly, don't scare monger about server populations if you haven't read any of the Blizzard explanations about server populations.
---
How...what are you spending your money on?
---
I've healed up to RFK and Gnomeregan in a levelling spec, so it's fine so far. Just need a set of int gear.
---
90% of your damage are auto attacks.
---
Phase 2 doesn’t happen until layering is gone.
---
I see this as only way to go. I would hate them just starting to make new things with assumption what players want. We have seen how that have ended up in retail. 
---
"Oh we have this really cool Azerite system which is combination of legendary and artifacts, you're gonna love it!"
---
And literally everyone just hated it. If they want to make content for Classic they need to have tight communication and connection with players. It has already been proven what we really do know what we want.
---
Yes, this happens often to me as well. I've also missed entire ticks but this is not as often as the +/-1 and the 40 tick.
---
Are you on Blaumeux?
---
So do I basically need to just be mob grinding?
---
lol i do the same. I have 2 lists, one for alliances that kill lowbies or piss me off in some way and then one for hordes, assholes, betrayers etc.
---
Have you played vanilla Wow before? Getting to 38 in a week is incredible man. I wouldn’t feel so bad. Sometimes it is tough jumping between areas trying to get the right level quests. I usually just grind out a little bit to fill the gaps.
---
This is backwards. A tank for Stockades should be at least 25. Deadmines is doable at 18 as long as you have a decent group but better around 19-20.
---
Haha that's a great idea. Definitely going to have to remember to do that
---
Col. is that YOU!?
---
Ah okay, I just assumed healing had a prox aggro or some shit that was way off but that makes it sound even worse than I had thought. I can't imagine this is intended but who knows.
---
Only the worlds strongest are allowed in this raid group
---
I can't say for certain. I usually play on PVE, but for Classic I'm focusing on PVP right now.
---
PVP is open world, but I'm sure there's rules against camping quest and vendor-related NPCs if you have no other practical reason to be there.
---
Fps limit is not vsync or any kind of sync, it works with gsync. You can have 100 fps limit and gsync works just fine. I have a 165hz monitor with gsync and the default was limited to 100 fps, no tearing. Honestly can't imagine how wow looks nowadays, I only vaguely remember getting annoyed at tearing before I had gsync...
---
To clarify my situation in particular, I have 2 friend groups that I convinced to both roll Whitemane. That was before everything went to shit with name reservations and Bliz not opening new realms early enough. One group gave up on Whitemane and diverted to Rattlegore on launch day. We’re adults, we have limited free time. I just want paid transfers available so we can have the choice to not start all over.
---
Improved blizzard probably
---
The minimum level to enter Stocks is 15 but a tank shouldn't even consider it until probably 25 at least.
---
Australian here, waited 3 and a half hours for my que to lower 1/4th of the total. I ended up re rolling on Felstriker.
---
When did WotlK end? That long i managed, now I am laying in bed. 7:40 a.m. browsing this sub trying to reason why or why not I should resub to play classic.
---
So just quit. 
---
Do it.
---
i never claimed i created it, actually i found it on a forum and it wasn't taken so i got it.
---
As far as the ant hill goes...and changing the world or what ever. A- i feel bad for the ants they gotta live too and B-im not trying to change a thing but reasonable health care would be nice.
---
Before I learned how to manually control his abilities, my Imp Zoryap was affectionately named "God damnit".
---
Ok, thanks for that piece of information. Have a downvote.
---
Hopefully you didn't reroll another warlock

Tax Bot:

$10x $3 = 30

21.8% applicable tax rate

$30 x 0.782 = $23.46

$25 - $23.46 = ($1.54)

Tbt, those fkrs are dangerous as f. A lot of dmg, selfheal, always as duo AND an aggro range of doom.

Thanks.  
---
First time playing wow as well. 
---
Im currently level 33, farming Dungeons gives some good gear and I’ve been really luck with rolls.  
---
I‘m really excited to get to 60 and do some endgame tanking.
---
I'd see if you can talk to a GM or something. Your name isn't offensive and it doesn't break any rules. Can we start a petition to let this guy keep his name? Sonofabirch is an awesome name XD
---
oh sweet thanks!
---
"Who the fuck is going to buy a grey for a silver?"   
---
you can always spot someone that's never played vanilla.
---
Cause they will burn themselves out and wow will consume their life. People will miss out on their kids, friends and family for this game.
---
Before I learned how to manually control his abilities, and his propensity to aggro everything he could find, my Imp Zoryap was affectionately named "God Damnit".
---
Nah, Herod's fine if u start at 6am.
---
Did anyone actually watch any streams of this? I'm pretty sure 30+ of the raiders were learning the fights for their first time. This was a straight up PUG. There were a shit load of non-60s as well.
---
I chose a streamer realm just because I felt it would have the most longevity
---
There is no other 'fix' they can do, this is it, either you queue or you take the transfer.
---
Windowed mode is bugged at the moment. It has been since launch.
---
I really hope they take the OSRS approach.
---
It should be noted that you don't buy WoW Classic. If you already own World of WarCraft, you just need to renew your subscription to play.
---
Instant friends or mortal enemies? I’m thinking the latter. Slay him and reclaim your name! Make him feel so utterly defeated that he deletes his toon in shame and allows you to have the original.
---
This is vanilla where every weapon is a hunter weapon..
---
Yup.  A good tank with vanilla experience knows exactly what he can handle.  Especially after the first 2 or 3 pulls where he can evaluate the rest of the group.  He'll probably be a lot MORE comfortable with you as a healer if you let him get down to 30-40% before healing him. Why?  Because it means you're not wasting mana on overheals and you're spending as much time as possible outside of the 5 second rule to passively regen mana, meaning more pulls between mana breaks.  That tells the tank that you know what you're doing and won't shit the bed if he (or more realistically, one of the DPS) does make a mistake.
---
we chose a server to avoid streamers (stalagg). we chose to move off the most popular (herod). i sat through a 3.5-4 hour queue on labor day, queues are regularly 6000-9000+
---
That drowning was quite terrifying to watch on my phone in the middle of the night
---
As a warrior I know this man shouldn't be listened too. Slow for both hands. Focus on physical damage, not poison. It is the warrior way.
---
Thanks. It’s really has just been the last few levels that’s worn me down. 35-38, you know? The zones get bigger and I know I’m close to a mount and I guess that’s wearing me down!
---
The big issue I’m running into with dungeons isn’t that I want to do them but that SM in particular seems to be the only groups coming up in my range, and it can take upwards of an hour for our group to be up there and ready. So it’s added to frustration more than taken away!
---
Thanks for the encouragement. I just got to Badlands before calling it a night, but I’m not sure if that’s where I really wanna try to level. Trying to find a zone that just doesn’t feel so spread out, y’know?
---
Earthfury will most likely be Horde heavy given the name is a reference to Shamans (T1 set).
---
There's no way to hide the bnet friends? :( Thought there might of been a way but I'm unsure.
---
Yep. Some people are just ridiculously stubborn or dumb.
---
Watch as they don't utilise the coming realm transfers as well, because of some insane reason they concoct.
---
Nope. I gave you a blessing of wisdom in stormwind though!
---
They will come but they won't do it until the server populations have completely settled down and they can assure that they won't disrupt their plans with high pop realms. To be honest though, you could have moved a long time ago and you wouldn't be wasting any time. We know that paid transfers will come eventually but it could be not some time AFTER phase 2 when they merge all the layers down to a single one so that they have a final view of what the server populations will settle on and see if anything else needs fixed.
---
Did it as a grp of 5? ^^
---
And gratz, gonna do mine today as well (i hope)
---
Nice rogue m8
---
Scarlet Monestary Graveyard. Get a lv 32+ shaman for heal and 3 other melees and go cleave at it.
---
I'm running overwatch in ultra at 144hz
---
Yeah but now compare that to a shaman or a priest + lock.
---
You wipe, the shaman reincarnates after the wipe and rezzes everyone. 
---
Priest + warlock version: you wipe, priest stands up via soul gem, rezzes everyone.
---
Druid: 2 people die. Gotta run.
---
I use pummlers after I get some gear also there is a 1 handed mace in aq40 and a offhand from strat live that is a better combo but any feral who is serious will have this
---
I’m at 25 but I keep looking at city chat feeling like if I don’t drain my soul into the game then I’ll miss groups for dungeons
---
As an enhance shaman that’s been beaten 13x for this weapon. That hurt
---
There's already an incentive because of the queues.
---
Thanks, I like the name I cant take credit for the originality of it but i got it so fair game i guess. I got it from an old forum post in the WoW forums.
---
I have been going back and fourth with the GM's about it.
---
r/nobodyasked
---
or just turn on vsync like a normal person.
---
Do you guys not have phones??
---
Are you in the Invictus guild by chance?
---
Naw, Thunderfury. I was on Thalnos, but had to move off and ditch the 4-5 hour queues.
---
Justice!

Hi, /u/Sevanity

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czgq35/unfortunately_i_met_the_requirements/). 
---
I'm very concerned when we approach phase 2, if they actually do eliminate layering, we could be seeing 20k+ queues on every server easily.
---
This doesn’t mean what you think it means. Horde/alliance are allowed to kill the opposing factions NPCs, because that’s part of the game. They are allowed to ‘camp’ the opposing factions towns, because it’s part of the game. 
---
With that said, behavior that intentionally detracts from others enjoyment would fall under the lines of griefing a fellow faction member by intentionally tagging their mobs all day long. 
---
Good day sir.
---
I'm 10 so far. I'm scared.
---
Or, as was my case, I reserved the name, but when I saw the 10 hour queue I just said “fuck it” and made a new character on a new realm (and name was available because of it being new)
---
Nah, even discounting all the extra damage they do, all of your Sinister Strikes makes up for the slower speed in terms of poison procs. Even with a 2.8 MH and 1.5 OH I run out of poison charges on my MH much quicker than my OH.
---
now that's really interesting insight. they respond when the needle moves. this tells me classic is going to get a LOT of love, and is the reason they're putting so many resources into reducing queues and letting people play. if this turns sour they will tank
---
Nothing is better than reddit while you warm the water for your Morning Tea.
---
Yeah it'll be tough but I won't play specs that I don't feel to, if I get groups great if I don't I only do bgs
---
When the Warden Staff on my Druid drops and I'm in a group, I will need it. Despite of it beeing the epic mount of someone else. If it would haven't dropped, no one would shed a tear. When it drops, then the people who really need it, should get it. Period...
---
30-40 is fine as long as they mostly avoid STV. STV breaks the boys, and turns those who survive into hardened gnomes.
---
Leveling is slow, but that's ok. It's supposed to take a while. Yes, people found the most efficient way to level, but that usually requires a group and isn't for everyone. Pretty much everything you do is going to get you some xp. Do some dungeons, do some quests, do some exploring. Just have fun and play, and you'll get levels. I find, for me at least, that the best way to level is to focus on other goals and just let leveling happen. Want a certain dungeon drop? Go for that, and the levels will come!
---
no magic there :P just people logging off, compared to launch where once people got in no one wanted to stop.
---
I play on deviate delight which is medium for maybe 3 hours a day, and it feels pretty dead most of the time. I also got a char to 20 on skeram before switching over and it was like a different game.
---
Tough one. Vanilla was a long time back so I welcome anyone else's opinions here.
---
For DPS I'm gonna go with Hunter. You've got Trap and Tranq but you'll be using them much less frequently than the interrupts/CC of other classes. The fact that you bring less to the table will devalue you when compared to the other DPS classes.
---
I'm not really sure about healing. They all have dispels and I can't really remember what the breakdown is as far as important curses vs diseases vs poisons there are to dispel. I guess I'd say *not* Shaman, since you'd also have an offensive dispel, an interrupt, and the responsibility of using Tremor Totem.
---
Druids level in feral specc. Druids can just tank dungeons though. And even as a dd they are good enough. Because they bring some nice utility if played correctly.
---
Where's Mankirk's wife?
---
I've had 2. One was [Shadowblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2163/shadowblade) from and ooze in Un'Goro crater back in Vanilla. I think I sold it for about 400g.
---
The next was in WoD. I got [Blackrock Bulwark](https://www.wowhead.com/item=118874/blackrock-bulwark) off of a Warsong worg rider in Nagrand. Sold that one for about 180k.
---
That's a 12 points investment though. You won't be able to stand up to a mob while casting freely up to Lv 22
---
Fire's main atractive is ignite/crits
---
Leveling you have no access to high crit chance, to there'll be almost no ignite procs. 
---
Fire is all damage with no utility or survival. It's much easier to wreck a mage leveling in fire than one in Frost or Arcane. 
---
If anything, Fire should be the worst leveling spec, as it provides nor Arcane's consistency nor Frost's defenses.
---
I am also, however the official list that’s been released suggests you can only transfer from Arugal to Felstriker. Which is ridiculous. 
---
I have a character I’d like to play on Arugal, alongside my new character on Yojamba but I can’t because the queue is crazy and now they’re suggesting I can’t move to Yojamba? 
---
The OCE launch was so janky.
---
or if you don't like orcs
---
Almost everyone stuck with Whitemane but there are 3-4 of them that didn't want to stick it out so now we're split.
---
Never tried Necrosis back in the day so maybe I'll give it a shot now.
---
I am serious, Idk what would make you think that I'm not. Yes I am addicted, I've always been when I played this game. Nothing on this world makes me feel like this game. Not even **any** other game can do this. IRL I'm also introverted and rather dislike human interaction, but in WoW it's different, I'm the friendliest motherflower and happy for all interaction. 
---
I get what you're saying, but I really feel that if I just stop playing WoW for her (or play for like only 2-3 hours a day, which is patheticly little imo), I'm choosing not to be the person that I would be happiest by far.
---
Hey, did you find a solution? I'm gonna email Blizzard and ask.
---
My guess is that this conversation took place after someone mentioned how awful staysafes raid was tonight in MC. Gloating the whole time he’s never ever wiped on Domo and then proceeds to wipe at least 4 times (I lost count) and then abandon Rag after wiping over and over. Not really being sure the strats etc.
---
i come out of stealth on an enemy rogue who are mid fight with a mob and unstealth while dancing, then promptly vanish into the night while they process what happened
---
I'm glad you get to eat like that, but when I shop at where I shop and get the essentials, it comes out to (a little more than) $30. You can definitely spend more and get stuff like seafood, but if you already have the spices and sauces, a little over $30 is  a week's worth of meals.
---
Corpsemaker will serve you well for ~8 lvls if you aint got bros helping you.
---
I actually don’t send them to you because I know that’s mean. And I don’t hate you or anything but I just want you to stop being so dramatic with everything. Like this title is outrageous
---
True. The desire to kill is strong in the warrior... Every ten seconds.
---
Cut your losses and start again. It’s only week one and you’ve started at the best time. Think of the long term investment and if you’ll be happy on PvE.
---
Excuse you
---
Ill submit a bug report. Just wanted to check before I did. Couldn't find any proper info when I searched.

What interrupts the swing? Any ability?

I don’t post anything on Facebook. A frivolous past makes you fly under the radar;) my mate does not have such reservations and yes he ask and pry like he always did.

Going to bars to flirt? Where have you been the last 25 years ?;)
---
Does the big slow weapon thing apply to stuff like priest wands? I got a DPS upgrade but it shoots faster with slightly less damage per hit. 
---
If I’m literally only auto attacking off it is the DPS stat the be all end all metric to use for damage?
---
It’s his girl now.

Oceanic is in a bit of a tough place and i think they're in the right to QQ. Oceanic launched with 1 PVP server and ofc that was at capacity right away, they bring Yojamba end of day 1 and people are split up. Problem with only being able to go from Arugal to Fel and not having Arugal and Yojamba to Fel or Arugal to both is that it doesn't address 1 of the big reasons people wanted transfers, because the queues caused guilds/friends to split up.
---
😂 Did this guy just compare a reddit post to a job/school work/anything that matters in even the slightest?
---
I’m dyin’ over here 😂
---
Meanwhile on less traffic server in worst time of a day i wait 10-15 minutes.
---
I personally didnt manage to wake him on phone, but I just turned off sleep for the next week or two, so no biggie, maybe you can wake him from second PC, but I havent tried that.
---
&gt; But I don’t think it would be a hard stretch to prove, with data, that from a psychological and sociological standpoint, the mindset of a PvP player is less intelligent and mature than that of a PvE player.
---
The mind of the average carebear
---
I think Rag was about 4.5 months. Pretty sure all that info is out there if you want to poke around.
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I felt like I really enjoyed a lot of Desolace; it was a zone I’d never really been to, I felt like the xp rate was good, and the aesthetic was really neat to me, so I really enjoyed my time there and it flew by! Since then I’ve kinda struggled a bit. 
---
Do you know any particularly interesting zones just to run around in, and maybe quest in, between 38-40? Demons/undead in particular are more fun as a Pally because I can do more than just my seal. STV, Badlands, and a bit of Hillsbrad are the areas I know of/haven’t done, but none of those seem all that interesting to me.
---
Saw the warrior getting low and I'm thinking wtf, dudes frosted. You got some mana... slowly zooms out and your polymorphed lmao lost it. Great video.

I mean I'm OCE as well and I've seen game after game open, then close, OCE servers from lack of population. The way they did it was the right call IMO.
---
Omg. THE SivHD?!?
---
Dude, I needed their horn for the quest. Me and me buddy went to kill them, he got his from the first mob and I got left behind. It's fine, we killed a bunch more and the mob finally dropped that goddamn white item. Happy to be finally done with the quest, I went to turn it in and... It was a fucking tail (I guess a cooking ingredient) and I didn't notice the difference. Gosh darn it, lizard.
---
It's just crazy how predominant this "you need to be super careful" mindset is on these forums, when you don't see it at all in game.  And even without it, it's still pretty easy to get through content, as long as people are not just completely doing their own thing.
---
Sure, on a boss or raid give the tank a bit of time to establish threat.  Sure, don't aoe immediately after a big pull.  But burning a kill priority fast is going to help the whole group out, even if the tank doesn't manage to tank it.
---
Big dick
---
I lol'd so much Good Day ahead!
---
20-30 as an alliance hasn’t been a gankfest at all in my experience. I just do Redridge Mountains, Wetlands and Duskwood. I’ve seen 5 hordes at the most during that time.
---
Would be nice to have someone to give me $10 i would like around 100,000 people doing it.
---
(random silver boss) is up!  
---
Yeah, I just gave him a little Viagra.

---
You will never get free transfer from a low server because that would make the server even lower. Unless that server is closed/merged.
---
Oops. My bad. Switched to horde with classic
---
Then why are you here?
---
Massive
---
Yeah, you can reset every 15 minutes, and as long as one of you is a healer and none of you are terrible, you can easily clear the first 15 minutes of a reasonable level dungeon.
---
It's a little rough around the edges but I've been using [QuestGuru](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questguru_classic).
---
A dungeon run can be reset maximum 5 times an hour.

You're the real MVP.  I get irritated with healers that save DPS from their own stupid decisions.  If you're a DPS warrior and you're charging the lead mob before the tank has even touched it, you deserve to die.  Especially while leveling when no one is actually specced properly to tank.  You're not speeding up the run because a tank that isn't getting hit can't get rage to get aggro, which means the healer is OOMing more and pulls take longer to get under control.  Healers that let idiots die get 5 stars in my book.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.  If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault.  If the DPS dies, it's their own fault.
---
If I have a DPS consistently trying to rip hate, I let them have it.  And they get to keep it until they die.
---
I think you’re lost. You can’t be on a pvp server and report the opposing faction for simply playing the game. I’ll camp your corpse all day long and gank you every chance I get, you gonna report me? 
---
This is my point.
---
Everyone paid for a month so they're gonna keep playing for that month
---
No.

In fact, most of the time grinding mobs for exp is better. For example, level 19 area, I killed a mob for a quest for about 140exp per mob. The quest gave me 1350 exp. It would be more effective just kill every mob instead of doing the quest. Or at least, purposefully doing the quest. Because I can kill 10 mobs faster than I can take the quest and give it back.
---
Nothing! Me not that kind of orc.

Kirtonos crew checking in
---
Yeah, I did Arathi for a chunk of 36 or 37 and enjoyed it. I just wrapped up STV tonight (Save quests Questie days are level 41, so I’m avoiding them until I’m 40).
---
I don’t think I’d mind doing SM (I’m 38.5), I’ve cleared all the wings at least once, but the big problem I’m running into is finding a group. Tanks especially are in *really* short supply on my realm so it can be upwards of an hour+ before we’re all ready to go, so that feels like so much missed leveling time to me.
---
Yea I always give them a chance to tank stuff out of respect but if its a healer I just stop caring. ill tank it, which is easy as a shaman, and just kill it
---
Does that apply to classic?
---
If youre solo questing as a pally thats a normal pace. Classic leving is slow and you picked one of the slowest class to level. You get a free mount at 40 though where everyone else has to pay 100g. Thats a 60% movement bonus and running around questing is then 60% faster.
---
Everything in moderation mate. Your gf will be there for you in numerous aspects of your life where WoW simply cannot. Utilise your time to achieve a healthy relationship and enjoyable gaming experience with your friends. Make sacrifices so you can reap rewards later. Quality time on WoW and with your partner. 
---
Try and put yourself in her shoes and see if you can relate to how she might be feeling.
---
I know, I just feel bad for the Pallys and Shamans out there having this exact argument with a Warrior right now.
---
there's definitely shorter queues this week. Plus absolutely, the big test will be when everyone's subs are up and people make the choice if this is worth the $15 (talking about the people who came back for it... of the people I know playing, that's about 50%)
---
I hear so many pvp stories about hilsbrad but so far nothing :/ did a bunch of quests here and no alliance groups came to kill us or nothing.
---
The argument isnt that the other specs are useless. Its that they require more time to be as efficient and good as a simpler dps class like a mage. 
---
Most people dont have the time to learn as much as APES players did. Retadins have a harder time because they have a higher skill cap meaning  you need to experiment and actually look up the ins and out of your class while little jimmy can just hotkey frostbolt and kill a mob.
---
As much as most players say theyre not casual..most players are casual, but just play much more than a casual.
---
You could look at which mobs drop useful stuff you can make money with and grind these.
---
I mean it was 15 years ago but I swear that Darnassus and SW both had Auction houses when I started playing, well before 1.9.
---
I looked at the actual patch notes and they do state that in 1.9 the AH's were linked, but not if they existed prior to that. Maybe I'm remembering wrong.
---
Did you submit an in-game ticket or post to the Blizzard bug tracker?
---
Yeah, I’m excited for the mount, and I think it’ll help a lot. The running back and forth (especially in STV and the later Desolace quests) has been *killing* me.
---
Even if it was not effective for the realm, it was for the players who had characters there which was unplayable.
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
Delete the phial of scrying then talk to him again.
---
Oh definitely, but the beauty is that kind of min/maxing obviously isn’t needed anymore if a guild did want to open up its core raid comp.  maybe bring 2 retadins instead of 1 and they’ll still full clear! You know what I’m saying
---
Cries at level 14 warrior stuck farming centaur bracers..
---
Blizzard.. Raise the bloody drop rate!!!!... :/
---
No, Ill try that. Tons of people are coming up and turning it in in front of me lol
---
Respec consecration prot, find a good shield, retribution aura+consecration aie farm, profit.
---
Ive done that.
---
Guy is either a troll or a moron. Either way just ignore him.
---
For single targets try focusing more on shadow bolt and your wand. Try pulling multiple mobs at once, if you can handle it your DoTs will be much more effective spread across multiple mobs.
---
[maybe this article](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617583661) will help you? sorry!
---
Okay this just blew my mind, usually i run through the Wetlands into Loch Modan. I had NO idea you could do that little swimming and dying short cut. I've been doing the same migration since original Vanilla and legit never saw this. Will try to keep that in mind for any NE alts. Funny enough, first day I made a NE and did this right away...didn't even give Teldrassil a chance lmao
---
Pvp or pve matter? Pve myzrael is pst. 
---
I think it hits high during peak times and dwindles to medium super late at night but I've still never had a problem with finding groups. I havent had a que either since day 2 of launch. 
---
Lotta friendly horde players. Cant speak for the alliance.
---
get a pocket healer, easier said than done but I play with my nephew and he's an orc warrior and i'm a troll   
---
 resto shaman, works great. I even heard of him saying " these mobs aren't as hard as I thought they would be" got a bit annoyed because he didn't realize how much easier i made this to him. Let him solo a bit and he was about to die almost every single time and now he understands.
---
You know this whole layer thing worked out decently enough for me. I dont see the effects of layering. I never had mobs appear or disappear next to me even when joining groups. At least so far. That being said the whole invite to layer messages in /world are really annoying. I even had a guy whisper me yesterdqy to please invite him because he needed to change layer. I just ignored him
---
Here’s what helped me:
---
Turned off all overlays and turned off gsync. 
---
I kept getting a nvidia dmp error and it only happens in WoW but, so far, this seems to be the fix.
---
If each of you donates 5$, i can have a jet!

if anyone gets that quote, you're my hero

It’s actually spiders.

im not too sure about it, it can be good i guess but also it's not really fair and also it kinda defeats the purpose of playing a game, just my opinion.

Sort of a running bit on my discord, but I want her voice:

I use it sometimes but it's very ineffective. Almost nobody uses it. Trade chat, lots of people see trade chat. That gets the job done.
---
I just fear that one day I’ll get on and biases about level or class will dictate invites entirely ... so I keep grinding until my warrior eyes bleed
---
He just takes reaaaaally big steps.
---
Chat being filled with LFG spam in one way or another is part of the classic experience.
---
It takes me 15 seconds to start playing from the login screen. Deviate Delights &lt;3
---
If someone else levels your character, you'll lack the fundamental mechanics to play it at 60. Do it yourself or don't do it at all.
---
I don't think anyone thought it would die in a week.  It's months from now when the drop-off will really be felt on the lower pop servers.
---
OMG druids can turn into trees again.

hey! can you add links to tukui site?
---
In all fairness, he was PostingUnderDuress...
---
Unless I am mistaken those shoulders are good and hails from zul farak dungeon. I remember I was soo happy when they dropped back in the day.
---
Agreed. Being one of the first groups in SM on my server was a huge rush. Had to clear all the trash into the monastery ourselves. 
---
Now a few days later as we are closing out cath and moving onto uld/Zf that Sm entry trash gets cleared by someone else. 
---
It’s a nice feeling to know you were there first.
---
I hear you, I’m saying the whole argument is kind of out the window at this point.  All the endless back and forth about ideal raid class for all this time and it doesn’t seem to me like it matters very much anymore.   This content is obviously so easy that to even bring a full maximum dps crew would be overkill.  So why not bring your boomkin buddies?
---
I assume you are new and have never been around for free server transfers before (they have not had a population large enough to have to do them in a very long time) but doing them like that completely defeats the purpose of fixing the populations. You need them to go to the medium pop servers to create new high servers and you need the largest most massive servers like Herod to go to completely new servers so they don't just transfer their queue somewhere else.
---
Also, maybe you just don't know that the label system has changed and low, medium, and high no longer mean what they do on retail but there are no low pop realms. The lowest pop servers are medium. Sure some drop to low in early morning or very late at night but that is normal. And with the new sysem, low pop servers have several times more people than FULL servers on retail launches previously, they just have a lot more space for new people. There are no truly low pop realms the way you are thinking. Even when those medium pops become low pops over night, they are still jammed pack.  Medium now means strong healthy servers. We are talking huge servers compared to retail. High means holy shit we are at capacity and playing is probably gonna be impacted because of too many players. Full just means there is a queue. Whether its 10 people or 10k people.
---
So please, stop fear mongering and making people worry about non-existent low pop servers. I included their description just to be thorough but there currently none. And if you just didn't know about the changes, now you do. Also, the targets for the transfers were selected intelligently so by the time i's done, ideally everyone will be on high pop. The servers with queues of 20-30k during peak are paired with servers that only have queues of like 5-6k and they are getting to transfer to their own brand new servers. By the time Herod and their new partner finishes transferring, that completely new server will be high pop. There are too many people on those two servers to not make a new high pop server.  The other type of server that got transfers are those with a lot but not like Herod, Faerlina, etc. Servers that have like 10-15k queues. They get to transfer to their own server and aren't paired with anyone but they are transferring to already existing servers that are medium now so by the time this finishes, they will be high pop as well. All the old servers? They will still probably have queues but much smaller ones and potentially none for smaller problem servers.
---
These are all good things. Blizzard has been taking a lot of flak from people that don't understand but the way they are doing things to make sure every server ends up with stable massive populations even if that means opening them slowly, etc.
---
Do what you want bro. When it comes down to it, its your money and your time.
---
Using an addon for an advantage vs using in-game mechanics for an advantage. OP is a hypocrite.
---
You'll be stuck on a character that you don't know how to play properly and it'll ruin the experience for everyone else. In retail, the game gives you a tutorial on your basic rotation and you can go do world quests or LFR to get some practice in.
---
Going out and soloing some mobs isn't going to give you enough practice with a classic character to know how to play in a group setting.
---
Considering how little time you have, leveling would probably align with your schedule more than anything at end-game. There isn't too much to do solo in end-game besides farm some gold or do some professions. Most of it is farming dungeons and raids for loot which it seems you might not really have time for since there isn't a group finder and sometimes just finding a group and getting to the dungeon can take a half an hour and the dungeons themselves take a lot longer than in retail wow
---
I already know the kind of responses I'd get over there though. I think I get better responses if I ask people of my kind or at least who know what I'm talking about. These people wouldn't understand I think.
---
It's only 10mins too. In retail the 10mins feels like forever in here it's so quick it's whatever :) I can't wait for the day I go back to retail and overprepare while le eling only to 2 shot mobs and not die when I pull more than 2 things lol
---
How do I get my XP bar to be that handsome? Sleek UI there!
---
Some hours more people are logging off and other hours less people are.
---
Thanks, I have all of that info too, what I'm looking for seems like something nobody else wants. I guess my playstyle is a bit weird
---
What level is it?
---
Yup, there's a thread going on the official tech support forums. People are having issues logging into Retail and Classic realms across the board.
---
Same issue on Blaumeux
---
yes you need to spec prot, your threat holding will suffer otherwise
---
Is there an error message? Without knowing much Id say a memory issue. If you have one bad stick itll throw an error which causes bsod's. If your CPU is getting too hot, itll shutdown or reboot. An i3 is not really optimal for gaming.
---
I can get into the game client ok and into realm select, but then instantly gives an error and says "disconnected from Blizzard services" when i click enter world. Error code is WOW51900101. Noticed the "disconnected from Blizzard services" popped up in-game earlier this evening but I was fine staying in until I logged out. Now I can't get back in since I exited and came back a couple hours later.
---
Oh I remember that, that was funny. It was a crazy time when bc came out man, it was such a big update it felt surreal
---
You can do 5 man dungeons in any spec as long as you bring your shield and know how to tank.  From UBRS upwards you need to be protection spec , but that is lvl 60
---
It’s super easy to tell who is using keyboard macros. There are ways to kinda obscure that you’re using them, but if you’re hitting a button every X milliseconds then ez tell.
---
Same vein as yours, but I got Kraknuz or "Kraknutz" for my VW. He's been cracking nuts (or getting his nuts cracked) for 20 levels now.
---
I *loved* Desolace, but sadly I’ve done everything there that I can find, except for the caravan and escort quest, which I’d rather blow my brains out than do.
---
But I might go back to Desolace and grind the level 40 demons and skeletons. They give good exp, and it’s always more fun when I get to use exorcism and stuff, y’know? 
---
I just started Badlands before finally logging off. I’m not sure I’m feeling that place though; the sort of wasteland feel to it wasn’t jiving with me.
---
I feel attacked!
---
Same, getting  WOW51900101  when I select my realm.
---
Hey man the whelps sell for a really good chunk of gold. I sold an emerald whelp for 50g on day 5 and it got me my mount at40. Save all the wicked claws and large fangs you get they are used in a lot of desirable crafts later on. I sell all leather to the vendor except thick leather and above. Try looking up the items you're getting and seeing what they are used for. That should give you an idea of their value. Popular crafts like Lionheart helm take 40 wicked claws.
---
Will it really be "felt", though? A "low" server (with the old system) is already a much bigger than a full server back in vanilla, due to layers.
---
Even if 75% quit after 2 months, these servers will still have a somewhat healthy population. Medium realms, even more so.
---
But do you even play classic then?
---
An hour? Rofl
---
It should do, always did in the past. Managing populations in MMOs is no small tasks, you need to get the right balance of servers as well as look at faction distribution, class distribution, peak times, all kinds of things. People like to talk big by saying how easy it is to just "open more servers" or "just merge them later" or whatever else but the reality is way more complex than that unfortunately.
---
working as intended?
---
Gah at least it’s not just me.
---
I remember back in the day I had a lucky streak for a few months where I would keep on rolling numbers like these, so much that even my guildies starting suspecting me of using a cheat add on. One day on ZG I said "look guys I'm not cheating !" and rolled. I rolled 98.
---
ayy thanks, i freaked out haha
---
They will just merge realms down the road if one is "dying"
---
good bot
---
Onya mate, that was my thought but it’s always best to double check. Cheers.
---
you're right, thanks!
---
Upvote this to the top for visibility! Best add on for this purpose
---
Nice.
---
Drain tanking is ezpz and you're at the point where you can start thinking about going that route. [Intro vid to that spec]
---
Voidwalkers suck, even with 3/3 imp void. Use imp until you get Succ and then never look back.
---
same on mankrik
---
thank you!
---
Mankrik isn’t letting me in either but I can connect to stalagg
---
Tell that to the other dps's on my team who needed more healing than the tank or a Rez every 3rd or 4th fight
---
I’d been Holy for quite some time, but *damn* was that painful once I got around 27 as far as solo leveling goes, even if healing dungeons flowed better. 
---
I’ve only healed one dungeon since switching to Ret, but I’m happy to continuing doing that. I don’t think it’ll really be a probably atm, at least it hasn’t seemed to be. 
---
The bigger problem with grouping has actually been finding tanks! My server has a huge lack of them, and it’s not a role I can reasonably try to fill atm with my gear.
---
As a healer I like seeing you drop low...
---
 it means you’re dumping mad DPS into the mobs and I will happily top you off.
---
Lock is lifetapping? No problem bro, let me assist you with your DEEPS
---
It also helps that I’m a Druid and can just dump Hots on you and let you tap away to your hearts desire without sacrificing the tank.
---
Good day to you sir!
---
~30 of my Guildies and I decided to move to Thunderfury from Herod on Wednesday night last week. Absolute zero queue and it was the best decision we made.
---
are eu realms mentioned anywhere? specifically can i get off mograine
---
Maybe you forgot to buy the void walker spells upgrades at the demon trainer?   You seem to do the right things.
---
Ok... Okay I might have to swap to a PvP server...
---
Such a fucking RIP off. 100 bucks and ill power level ur toon to 3o. Back in the day it was 120 for 1-60
---
... he'd still not want to change server?
---
As s hunter I always ask if anybody else needs the melee weapon because it's a stat stick for me. Even when the others need on a range weapon I very much like....
---
Actually we can put a price on time...that's what an hourly wage is. If you mean in the philosophical sense of "time is limited and we only got so much" sure it can be priceless. Economically though? No.  We can put an exact figure on each person's time through the free market.
---
Can't log into Blaumeux either and i just got home to play for a couple of hours ;-;
---
How do you know what the gear will look like equipped?
---
Westfall (Normal) server hasn’t had queues since Wednesday/Thursday
---
I was reading your comment and thought of something, what if they made primary and secondary specs?
---
It's a lot of damn balancing but you would take say a hunter, because I main hunter.
---
I could have primary spec beast mastery and have all the beast mastery tools and then secondary spec marksman, where I would get some of their tools. I think that would solve a lot of peoples issues with the current spec set up.
---
I uh.... my Tauren never scratches... yeah..
---
Meanwhile Staysafe's raid with all the melee dps lower than the tank proves that players will drag down your raid no matter what class they play.
---
I don't flag for PVP so it's not too bad. 🤡
---
Killed by a boar! Too much wine.. missed my thrust.
---
Well they certainly captured the feeling of the original WoW, I seem to remember it was always like that years ago
---
are you sure there wasn't a sale?
---
in game mail takes 1 hour in classic
---
Yea
---
who needs armor when u got thighs
---
BAAAARF
---
IMO you skipped out right before the best part. TBC was easily my favorite. Kept playing into WotLK because I kept hoping they'd do something, anything, that didn't bring the quality of the game down. Quit when they announced cross realm and party/raid finder because then there's absolutely no accountability for being an ass. Previously people would get reputations and would be known server wide. They couldn't get into any decent guilds. Could hardly find any groups.
---
I suggest getting an addon to help you figure out where is appropriate for you to quest. Classic zones usually offer quests for a variety of levels and there are very few zones that are meant to be done in a single session. 
---
If you want to no-brain it you could get Guidelime. This tells you exactly what to do and where to go, but it might be hard to jump into with a already created character.
---
ClassicCodex is another one that helps you spot all the quests that are available to you. As well as show you what level you should be before taking on those quests.
---
Through my extensive analysis over the last week I've come to the rule of thumb of 2.5 minutes per 100 in queue.
---
Right on!
---
No, not really compared to live. It's not necessarily a cake walk either though. You need to still manage mana, aggro, and try to pay attention to mechanics.
---
My ex was just like that. She would sit around watching Netflix all day but apparently playing games for the same amount of hours was worse. Always had an anxious feeling while playing, like I was doing something wrong.
---
My current gf plays old-school runescape because she saw me playing it. She never played games before but she saw how much I enjoyed it and wanted to try it out. Now she's got a better account than me and might be starting classic with me :D there are good girls out there that do support your interests
---
I hate the fact I can't see what my friends from other servers are doing in-game or what level they are!
---
Yup. Exactly.
---
Beat his ass because warriors are garbage at PvP
---
Because people need a reason to do the new content. If the old content has +2% hit then the new content should have +3%. But there are also multiple raids per expansion, so the next raid could have +3% hit and +1% crit and so on.
---
How many expansions have we had now? People would run around with +100% hit and crit chance from their gear and absolutely ridiculous levels of stats like spell damage and attack power. That's why they had a stat crunch too.
---
I dont like hit and crit rating. I felt it made the game less interesting and more difficult to calculate your stats. But it was necessary.
---
I also thought about the world size problem. On high pop realms chat already flies by fast enough. If everyone would be on the same server, the sense of community will be damaged even more than it already is.
---
not op. but man.. im farming lvl 40 chests at lvl 15 as a dwarf
---
You two put in work
---
One such instance is during a druid vs. druid duel. You will want to very strategically weave in and out of forms to bait out a hibernate for instance. In that case I would want to drop into caster form but not necessarily cast a spell to do so (waste of mana and global). 
---
I also don't want to waste a keybind or clique macro on a simple /cancelform. I am using a Naga trinity and I already have all 12 buttons bound, as well as Ctrl, Alt and Shift modded binds for each of them.
---
Naughty secrets.
---
Btw was in Thalnos Server.
---
i feel your pain, was fortunate enough to have a levelgroup until 35, was a blast, but after that I struggled a lot.
---
Now I have achieved level 40, got my mortal strike and ravager, and now I can finally solo a mob that has the same level as me
---
I knew there was a trick to it.
---
Where does the healer stand? Can i just stand on the edge of the balcony where we come in? Will I be in range of the other balcony?
---
*\glass shatters*
---
Why didn't I think of this? Thank you!
---
But as I stated on the post, it ain't overheating. Look at the temps, I'd say they are pretty normal. Faulty hardware... I doubt it since other games work just fine. It's a really weird issue.
---
I'd roll on that as a hunter, I do a lot of melee in dungeons.
---
no that i understand. i meant the "well fed" buff we get as players, you know, the +AP/SP for 30mins?
---
Just did Shimmering Flats at 35, the quests are green and still worth it. You'll get some chains that go back to STV also.
---
Hi there, thank you for the reply.
---
I did upgrade all my pets abilities from the demon trainer, I'm just frustrated my pet cant hold aggro. leveling seems slow. I thought about trying a different pet, like a succusbus.
---
With those temperatures?
---
I find chat channel content (and participant maturity) follows a curiously regular pattern. Late at night, you get all the politics. In the early morning, it’s like some sort of elementary school chatroom. Apart from those times, it’s actually pretty ok, at least on my realm.
---
This sounds interesting. Forgot this was possible. Thanks! Will tinker around with it
---
The imps Firebolt doesn't scale that well later on, and when you get Fear, you can start juggling a couple of mobs and the voidwalker is better for that since he can kinda keep aggro and has more health and armor. In dungeons imp is nice because of the stamina buff for the whole group.
---
Technically a higher chance of becoming a dead server, though.
---
Yes because it would show that the item sold in the auction history and that money is on the way with a count down :(
---
Its gotta be just classic, bc I can sign into retail with no problem.
---
fair enough. hopefully you work it out.
---
Lost a roll yesterday 40 to 41, but at least to a warrior and not a hunter...
---
I hope they eventually manage to balance things out. I don't want to worry about queues anymore, but my server has become my home. I have a Guild that is growing, people I've met, relationships and a reputation I've formed so far.
---
I will have to see what people in my friend group and guild think, but I'm not so enthused about the idea of having Herod runoff in Earthfury. Private servers were fun, but I sincerely doubt some of those people want to give up that level of prestige/dominance, and thus we might see private server lords all over the place. That might just be my imagination, but after already having my tanking pace critiqued by a "M+ player", I don't like the idea of someone playing on a pserver tell me I did things incorrectly.
---
Is this the wrong post to say: "I never had to wait in the queue"
---
any tips starting off as a tailor? never did professions but im really interested in tailor/enchanting. any tips for getting to the point i can make linen bags? or do i just grind it out on mobs?
---
are you joking? because 2 of those are very viable and 2 are meme specs
---
No errors at all, it just shuts down randomly without any particular reason. But I don't think it's the processor either, just look at the min. graphics for Classic
---
YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN WETLANDS?! THERE'S A SHORTCUT?!?!?!
---
I assume check the EU forums. I only know about US.
---
So I rolled on bigglesworth and leveld to 40, but my friends rolled blaumeux. There's next to no chance that I would be able to transfer there right?
---
Yeah it kinda sucks.  Managed to convince my guild to move from Herod to Stalagg and it turned out to not matter at all.
---
Not quite correct. He wasn't in the beta, he was in the live game. I remember loving him, and being super sad when he disappeared and I had to wait for boats again.
---
Just gave out starter pack again!  1g total donated to fresh players.  Worth every penny!
---
WORTH NOTING:  LET PEOPLE KNOW WHICH MAJOR CITY YOU'RE IN!  All the major cities' chats are linked together - don't let some poor tauren in Thunder Bluff try and find you when you're in Orgrimmar like I did!
---
If you read the quest it says you have to survive the harpy waves. Someone probably activated the event before you or something. But anyway its a group quest. After you kill like 5 waves of 3 harpies the boss harpy lady comes
---
I remember back in the day camping snarler. Was awesome when rare pets meant better pets. Now its just a damn skin.
---
The entire point of the game is stealing from other players?
---
currently lvl 33. getting fuckin slaughtered. flying from zone to zone.
---
def the least fun i had so far (FUCK desolace) but still enjoyable and ik itll only get better
---
Because those are the portraits of the ancient female human model from WoWs Alpha
---
It's been like 5 years since Nostalrius launched, and private servers were around for a lot longer before that. And yet the size of the vanilla player base has only grown over that time. And many of the same people who rolled on Nost are still here.  My nostalgia wore off years ago, and I'm still playing this fucking game. 
---
Where did they get this idea that this trend would not continue with official servers?
---
Yeah this is happening to me as well on Skeram. I can touch every other character on other servers. I just wanted to mage pull 18 mobs tonight after work!
---
Same, cannot connect to Skeram, but can make and play other characters on other servers. My friends are currently playing in skeram no problems though.
---
Thanks, ok, you think it's worth the 300$ can't see the older prices so I wouldnt know.
---
I miss Ironforge, I’m a horde. But I played vanilla alliance originally. It was so epic there.
---
Most people will say combat swords, which is good. I leveled as subtlety ambush, worked just as fine. I went subtlety because I like ganking too. You can also make macros to equip daggers on your ambush/backstab, and swords on your sinister strike/hemo, like I did.
---
The rogue was invited because he was expected to cooperate to the best of his ability. It might work that way on retail, but in classic classes contribute a lot more than the basic dps/tank/healer role. I'm playing a warlock and if I decided on a whim not to summon someone and have the party wait 30 minutes for no reason, they have every reason to kick my ass from the group. As long as there are no reagents involved, something like that means that you're not working with the group in good faith. Of course, this doesn't mean that these classes shouldn't be afforded some civility and be ask first, but it's part of the social contract that they do it when asked.
---
Realistically, with the amount of endgame content available to start, I feel like leveling is 80% of the experience. I suppose if you just like raiding, you can skip, but the raids don't seem terribly hard and they'll be there to progress through even months from now. Don't give into the ratrace
---
Tabards with rep gain weren’t a thing back then right?
---
Wait a little while but it'll come through your mail.
---
Lol it always felt important, welfare epics weren't some easily obtainable thing for a while.
---
Clearly themepark mmos aren't for you, I suggest you play a sandbox.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
not sure if serious.
---
only weapons and very obvious choices can be decided on the spot.
---
but can you offhandedly decide if that item with 13 str 1% crit is better or worse compared to 16 str 8 agi 20 attack power? 
---
or if an item with 1% spell hit 10 spirit 15 int is better than 1% spell crit 5 spirit 7 int 25 spell power? 
---
can you tell immediately if that 4 mp5 is better than 17 spirit on the other piece?
---
or is trading 80 spirit for 40 spell power worth it on longer fights? will you run out of mana and do less damage then?
---
most item comparisons in vanilla are even less black and white than BfA...
---
More shields! Spec into shield strenght from the disicpline talent and shield all the warrior tanks! Rage IRL is better than rage ingame!
---
Nah, just raging alcoholics
---
True and to be honest, I do mix a bit of the settings, I like the feel of classic but do prefer updated looks
---
I've had some irl responsibilities these past weeks and was interested in reliving the raid scene, but this is why I don't think I'll bother starting now, everyone will be so far ahead. All raid spots and auxillary's will be filled long before I get to 60.
---
My point is that if people paid money, and we're unable to use the service for 3 days, they are entitled to game time or are most definitely allowed to call it a shit show. Because that's what that was. I'm very sure it cost them subscribers. If you don't think 3 days off unusable service after paying is acceptable and is smooth sailing, I'm not sure what to say to that.
---
Okay, let me ask you, if he had been the opposing faction and had killed him to get the chest, would that have been a dick move?
---
Add-on help: Looking for an add-on that shows dungeon quest info.
---
nope, I think that was wrath?
---
10 fps in molten core
---
only because mechanics don't kill you doesn't mean they are not mechanics. there are emchanics that can be cheesed and bypassed, still doesn't mean they're not mechanics. i am pretty sure that lfr ghuun or lfr jaina are still harder than ragnaros on classic. as we've seen couple days ago, that speedrunnign crew blew ragnaros away without even having a full group of level 60 characters. also on retail there are 4 difficulties, lfr being the lowest one, for either people with no gear, or people who can't do better in the game for whatever reason, and mainly for people with ZERO coordination. classic raids are somewhat organized (its harder to organize 40 people than it is to organize 20, no denying that) but come on, the raid doesn't really have difficulty whatsoever, if it can be called the first day when only 3/4 of the group hit 60 with shitty gear. 
---
you cannot compare classic raids to retail raids and bash on lfr when that is only an excuse of a raid difficulty for people with serious lack of time or skills. sure you can ignore those mechanics, but assuming you are a decent player and you play the mechanics as you should, lfr is definately more engaging than ANY classic raid boss.
---
Perfect, this is what I was hoping for. A little sad about ret, but if pallys hold up as tanks, that'll be my job :)
---
Bloodsail here, happening to me too.
---
Thanwayne is going to need a Get A Load of This Tank cam, also.
---
And it shows.
---
Happening with Mankirk as well
---
Combat for ez leveling (5% extra hit is just amazing) and nice DPS in dungeons.
---
The most efficient way to spend your points is to go 31 points in a tree first, and then spend the rest (Nobody wants the 31 point talent in Assassination, though. If you go Assassination, stop at 30)
---
You seem to have your mind made up already with not playing, but I’ll say this.  If I decided to roll on a PvP server because my friends wanted to, and they went on leveling without me (which I would never blame them for doing), I 100% would worry about myself at that point and start playing the game how I wanted to play it since I’d be solo 99% of the time at this point.  
---
In your case, since it sounds you aren’t ahead of the curve (I’d say that’s around 30+), I would roll on a PvE server, meet new people, and just enjoy playing the game without the “annoyance” of getting yanked.  Once you hit 60, I’d plan on Blizzard having character transfers available, then you can roll back to the PvP server to play @ level 60 with your friends if you decide to.
---
Either way, you do you.
---
No, it's an actual question! I've been wondering off-and-on for awhile why sometimes I could assist without stealing the kill, but other times I did. I had *no idea* what the above posters were talking about with the "turns grey" thing, but I just came from playing and I know what they mean now! Sometimes the other player has to hit it a couple of times before it's officially theirs and the color changes. I should have asked a long time ago.
---
Love kromcrush
---
That zone is pure hate and love at the same time.
---
Do people forgot how poor an clunky the design of everything in classic was?
---
So many better dungeons in all the next expansions imo
---
Get chase by the lich king, and come back!
---
We're talking boe blues, which is bind on equipped, so it can be traded.
---
No, because it's not stealing, but yes, the entire point of the game is 
---
screwing over people for your own benefit.
---
Oooo, I like that. I’m going to use it in dungeons.
---
All i ever see is swedes yelling about some guy namned ”Joel”...
---
I'm not complaining, I'm in love with it, just was confused by the scheduled maintenance vs the time I am having issues.
---
"Ah shit, here we go again..."
---
The queue has gotten shorter though. I only had to wait 200 minutes last night!
---
It's not just those harpies that come in waves, the regular harpy spawns in the cave are nearly instant. I had the same experience. I don't know why, most caves aren't like this, even when there are tons of people in there. I think the dynamic respawn system in there is somehow broken.
---
Because all I want is to destroy your vanilla experience.

Your warrior friend is GOAT man. What clutch plays!
---
Probably for the better since the macro is instant, EZdismount made you press once for form cancel, then again to cast the spell.
---
I think it's just for threat
---
But yeah a lot of the procs in Vanilla seem so weak and little lol. Hell the stats too. Get a 60 weapon and it's got "+5 agi"
---
Hard to get unused to big numbers
---
I want to play arcane so badly, but till TBC nothing...
---
Same issue on OCE - Felstriker for me. Checked the other realms mentioned in this post, and getting the same error there.
---
I don't think any of them.  I saw at least 5 fighting the elite ogres in the centre, another 5 or so at the farm north and a few dotted around the yetis.  
---
I really wished I'd kept a track of the numbers during my time in northern/mid STV though because I was convinced I'd seen more Alliance players even though everyone states it should be a horde dominated zone.  Do you have any recommendations on zones I should track that should have a horde bias from 40+?  I'll probably be returning to southern STV to mop up the higher level mobs soon, should that be a horde dominated or at least equal zone?
---
Ooo, I like that.
---
Do not take the bait of free transfers. I regret when I took the bait during WoD, remember the queues will no doubt decrease as time goes by, but dead realms will remain dead forever.
---
No, never do that. Wow forums are even stupider than YouTube comments.
---
Same here. Tried a bunch of things that are suggested on blizz forums, FPS settings, network settings, disable add-ons etc, none fix it. I DC at least once an hour.
---
Yup, running into the same issue here, on Mankrik. At least I'm not the only one; I was afraid it was something I did!
---
I’m currently level 34.
---
If I pull a mob 2 levels above mine, I die.
---
If I pull two mobs, I die.
---
If I pull a mob the same level as me and he parries more than thrice, I die.
---
But at least I will be unstoppable and definitely won’t get one shot by casters or kited / cc’d to death once I reach 60, right ?...
---
That item competes in the weapon slot with other weapons that add agility. It's actually retarded for a hunter to roll Need on that item.
---
I read that the sit bug doesn't exist anymore
---
Always have one Moonkin spot in your raid to cheer you up if needed.
---
Pretty much exactly what’s happening. Thanks for the reply
---
I didn't find this to be true at all.  I mained a fire mage in Vanilla and it was Superior to frost.  I tried frost a few times but always came back to fire.  You learn a lot about threat for sure.
---
How is bone biter better? It’s got less damage per sec less top end less speed equal stats?
---
good to know thanks
---
Good way to lose your entire blizzard account to them either now or later down the line. On top of getting banned form wow that is.
---
Ctrl right click the item.
---
Lvl 30 rn, went full affli and i'm happy with it. I'm not sure if succubus or VW is better. Succubus do more damage and generate almost the same aggro but VW is more durable, has a self heal and can tank multiple mobs.
---
At lvl 30 i went 5/5 suppression (really great), 5/5 improved corruption, 2/2 improved drain soul, 5/5 fel concentration (drain tank when needed and helps getting improved drain soul buff), amplify curse 1/1 (amplified agony deals ~ 50% of a player hp bar which make them think twice after attacking you again), 2/2 nightfall (not that useful because SB is expensive and generate too much aggro for your pet to keep it) and 1/1 siphon life.
---
I can easily pull 2 and even 3 mobs if i can fear. VW can tank one with full dots and i can drain tank the other while barely taking damage.
---
Honestly, Skyrim looked dated at release already.
---
The nature shots were beautiful, but the dated engine made anything meant to be alive look wonky and janky at.
---
The engine was old, Bethesda didn't really care, and it showed. It was clearly Oblivion with makeup.
---
I'm currently rocking Ghost Saber but I was thinking of stealing the white tiger from the horde.
---
I sold on AH some lv 15 mail shoulders for 50s
---
Back then you would only teleport a short distance forward. Was great for going to places you werent supposed to.
---
Sadly every addon that does this has been broken, and none have been updated, the only way is to use a cancelform macro, it's nowhere near as good, but it's better than nothing.
---
I have 3 gaming computers up to date!
---
But I also live alone :(
---
What a Classic.
---
This does not look like the sunken temple or UBRS.
---
Asked a few guys if they played back in 2005, they looked at my nickname and called me by first name instantly. Name reservations is what made people catch up , not 16 years old who have been playing retail, but 30+ who played vanilla
---
Thanks a lot to everyone who responded above me. What’s the difference between Classic or Retail? They look the same to me? Sorry for the dumb question haha
---
Is anyone actually telling people what they should do?
---
These servers are still way over populated. They cannot turn layering off in this state.
---
Except that's not PvP. If it had been PvP, he would have had a chance to fight back (unless it was a ganker, in which case also a dick move).
---
Like I said in my first comment, just because it's technically allowed doesn't mean it isn't shitty.
---
My only hurry is getting home from work to play wow!
---
[Orb of deception](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1973/orb-of-deception) &lt;-- best one IMO :D 
---
Got it, used it without thinking twice
---
Do you know of a way to efficiently use ambush as a combat sword rogue? Ive been trying to find a macro that swaps between dagger/sword main hand or just anything that allows me to do it without spending half the fight in my inventory hehe..
---
he absolutely won’t it’s an integrated GPU
---
In really interested in seeing you defend that statement
---
Oh my god, I think I was the hunter standing next to you when you did this, is this incendius?
---
That char name, you  play Raid Shadow Legends?
---
These people play WoW, they don't have girlfriends. and if they reply saying "yes I do"...they're lying

---
Personally I get home from work, join queue, then sleep 5 or 6 hours so I can play all night till work
---
So I could tank as like fury?
---
Had a Troll Hunter when TBC started and I absolutely wanted the Hawkstrider Mount!
---
Went broke after quitting the grind for the cloth and bought everything from the AH. Good luck.
---
You may probably want to add a SSD to that setup
---
I have a mage named Bellatrix too 😶
---
Same as me and several others.
---
did the same thing yesterday
---
was waiting for group mates to come to scarlet monastery (we're alliance) and I started blabbering stuff like "did you hear, there's rumor that deathwing is still alive" or "did you know there seems to be unexplored islands in between eastern kingdoms and kalimdor" and funny stuff like that
---
then I got challenged to a duell, and we went outside. I almost won the duel (warrior vs rogue) but we both got killed by a low level horde mage
---
needless to say we camped that bitch after we revived
---
I play a dwarf and on one of the first Quest, where you kill the Troll to get the journal, I grouped up with an dwarf paladin. 
---
I was running around if the other day and we met again. He was something about lvl 20.
---
Haha, that too!
---
It’s not really hard to write a keyboard macro with a random interval of 3-5 minutes between pressing the space bar.
---
It feels so much better to earn your swag. When everybody looks good, nobody does. All that time you spend looking like a clown only builds to the satisfaction of getting a good looking set.
---
Classic has different rep values than private servers that video is based off.
---
If you have some good names and are sure you're not going to play again, release them to the wild ;)
---
It kills me everytime. I played everything at one point or another, trying not to fall for it again even though i really want to roll a shaman/hunter/druid to play besides my warlock.
---
You had no choice. It forced it upon anyone looking to log in
---
But almost noone is buying them from the AH. You could try to sell those in the starting areas, or really just vendor them
---
we really need dungeon finder system. other than that its all fine. i was fed up with dying till i reach 18 as warlock tho(god bless soulstones)
---
If you're doing melee in dungeons, you're playing your class wrong. Roll a Warrior or Shaman.
---
In tbc and wrath I raided in a few top 50 guilds and being honest a good majority of the people did not work or go to any form of education. Saying something that sounds offensive doesn't always mean it's not possibly true.
---
I've had a rogue need on a venom strike before
---
 I just told him congrats. He's got the same right to the loot as me, even when it's better allocated to someone else.
---
When I played a paladin I would always linger in undead areas because I could have a more fun rotation. Badlands is a bit empty but I like zones where I can just grind and grind as I run around.
---
It's a PVP game, you can't get mad when you lose in PVP.
---
The leveling is slow and without good planning, there's definitely a lot of walking around. Desolace in example is fairly massive, so without a mount you spend a lot of time just traversing it.
---
Thanks. I knew things would slow down, but I think my conception from videos/other people talking was that it didn’t get that slow until like 55 or so.
---
I’ll try to reassess my ‘values’ I guess (that sounds really pretentious, but do you get what I mean?) while also trying to do some of the things I’ve seen suggested, and we’ll see if things get any better with how I feel about things!
---
Woah I'm 19 with 5g. Haven't sold my leather and herbs yet either
---
The UI of a simpleton.
---
Nalpad sounds like it could be cough medicine. I hope you have a /say macro "I choose you, Phanmon!" when summoning the VW.
---
If they'll offer transfers from low pop realms it'll either be in form of a merge or a forced transfer to a server of your choice. Optional transfers wouldn't work for free since they'd just make the realm even more dead.
---
Yeah Mankrik is still having issues
---
I was racing to 60, first of all my friends and guild. Then I started working again and I currently work more than full time. So to play I wake up 3am and play before work, because when I come home the queue is over 6 hours...  
---
I am in love with this game once again :)
---
The eye is really buggy. Sometimes you have to wiggle it literally under the nose of the mobs to aggro them while sometimes they'll aggro from a mile away. And if you move away too fast the mobs will just reset. Void pulling is just much more reliable.
---
It’s been good, not too much RP but it’s happened here and there. Not too many trolls in chat thankfully but a lot of people who have no idea how to run classic dungeons and a lot of solo folks who just say “no” when asked to group. Overall it’s pretty good. I’ve had some amazing groups too don’t get me wrong. Give it a shot, also as far as I’ve always seen on Grobbulus the Alliance smashes the Horde in pvp regularly.
---
Yeah, it’s nice being able to use exorcism and stuff! I think I’ve decided I’ll be going back to Desolace *at least* to hit 39.
---
You are the kind of man I will be putting in my ignore list right after you steal my chest. Cya
---
Found Elfo.
---
Group finder would still suck even if it was one server only, but it would definitely suck less than it does with cross-realm.
---
Eh the shitty people won't reroll at this point.
---
Try making a 40man raid with enough healers and tanks and see how you like it when that resto shaman wants to go ele but you have more than enough DPSers and no more healers.
---
People should also be aware that any guild raiding with a lot of underperforming specs will be full of actual idiots who have trouble doing the most basic things like not standing in fire and dispelling.
---
12k que on Golemagg EU yesterday around 17:30

Except 9 times out of 10 you try to res the person and they're either AFK or logged out so you just wasted 10 seconds and a fuck ton of mana
---
Tell me about your family please. How many of you were there growing up and where are you from?
---
That's EXACTLY comparable, because that's exactly what happened, 2 opponents went up against each other, one of them lost in the game they both agreed to play, and now one of them is crying about it.
---
These are members of his own faction.
---
The game is not only about getting every bit of copper and seeking to get every edge you can.
---
You are playing with other human beings, and you have a name. You have an identity in the game.
---
Your actions will reap consequences, good or bad.
---
It is in your own personal interest to conduct yourself in a manner which makes you likable and respected.
---
It is against your own personal interest to be a dickhead and steal someone’s chest while they fight mobs.
---
You can try to argue about it all day, but people don’t like people who steal and do anything they can to make a couple extra silver. Wasting other people’s time wastes your time as well. Because you will suffer the consequences of your actions somewhere down the road.
---
K
---
The same thing happened to me today, I also play a priest
---
Felstriker is doing it, all other OCE realms ok.
---
Have multiple characters and my experience has been great! There’s people rping, and those who don’t and just do game things. Everyone I’ve met so far has been friendly and willing to group up and I genuinely enjoy the server, despite the long queue times sometimes.
---
My voidwalker is named "Thanvhug" I read it too fast as "Thughug" one day so now I tell him "Go give em the thug hug" as I send it out to battle.
---
really? that's a bummer :(
---
Western and eastern plaguelands are very fun as a pally, I don't quite remember what levels they are though. One thing that's fun (to me at least) is trying to get to new zones. Get there And see what it has for you! Or, check out wowhead and the suggested level ranges. 
---
I hope you find your motivation to level, cause classic wow is a ton of fun, and you really don't need to stress about leveling as fast as you can. The classic community is here to stay, and there will always be people leveling alts and such to level with you :)
---
The default loot setting is Group Loot. Any grey or white rarity items are excluded from rolling and whoever loots the bodies gets them. For any green or higher rarity item you'll have the option to "greed" or "need", "need" supersedes "greed" so you should only select "need" if you plan on equipping the item or using it for your professions.
---
Which graphics card do you have? I have a shitty laptop now. It runs wow 20-30 fps and I find that unplayable coming from 200fps. I just wanna be able to enjoy it while traveling or on the couch.
---
Laptops in general are a big waste when it comes to gaming. Bought my desktop PC for 200$ and upgraded it for another 150$ and with a screen for 120$ I can play anything with atleast 140fps on medium/high settings.
---
It's just so embarrassing for Blizzard that they can't get their shit together. It's 2019 and they still can't provide enough servers so many days after release.
---
What laptop is that and what FPS does it hit on wow highest settings please?
---
I've been getting the same error code when trying to login to my one server with characters, so I read this reply &amp; figured I'd try out an empty realm. No error code, and straight to character select screen. Any ideas?
---
This is classic, gear ISN'T easy to come by, you either don't actually play; or you're just oblivious.
---
Might just be me or a settings issue, but does that bag add on not close when you press the bag button again?
---
If you are far away from everyone and a green drops, you'll still get the roll popup, but you are the only one eligible to roll.
---
This is definitely happening. I guess it's for the best, but it was annoying missing several evening due to getting logged on when the system normally would have kept me in, and going back to 5h queue. At least we could have been told about this.
---
Ask other warriors to do it together.
---
Wands for casters are game changers. Cast your instants/dots, stand back and wand. Cast enough so that your almost full mana when the fight is over, and you'll be ready for another immediately.
---
Venom strike is actaully Bis for rogues at that level, there are about 20 better weaps for hunters including one that literally drops from the trash next to the boss that drops corpsemaker
---
I don't view it as bad probably because thats the class I pretty much only played as for the most part.
---
Im leveling as subtlety ambush, and have macros to switch between daggers and swords.
---
use the macro, example
---
#showtooltip Ambush(rankX)
---
/cast Pick Pocket &lt;------------ optional
---
/Cast Ambush(rankX)
---
/equipslot 16 ShiftClickWeaponHere &lt;----------- Main Hand
---
/equipslot 17 ShiftClickWeaponHere &lt;------------ Off Hand

Might not be the distance alone. I'm playing from West Canada right now on OCE servers and I'm sitting comfortably on 180 ping consistently.
---
Come on baby, let's go Hogging.
---
Nobody "agreed" to anything. What part of "just because it's technically allowed doesn't mean it isn't a dick move" do you not understand?
---
Okay, do you know anything about the value of the laptop?
---
Playing on Grobb is my first time ever playing on an RP server. As far as I can tell, RP is something that is there if you want it, and it's something you can pretty much ignore if you want. I'm told that it'll probably ramp up more once everyone is done focusing on leveling, but I have no idea what will happen. I'm currently playing a Paladin (level 28), and could not be having more fun with my experience. Most everyone is a delight to interact with and I'm glad I ended up playing on this server.
---
I'm going combat till 30 and then respecing to sub/hemo and sticking with that till 60
---
Every part of this speaks to my soul. Except hit 60. I’m level 22 dying to quilboar in the barren. Send help
---
that balding female orc hair tho
---
I deleted most of my bnet friends who were not that imgood of a friends anyway so i dont have to scroll. Im not ever going back to retail anyway. I would rather leave game for good.
---
Wand it up! If you haven’t come across decent wand, buy in auction house.
---
Well, judging from that statement alone, I can tell you're the kind of player I'd prefer having me on ignore.
---
I like this idea lol thank you :)
---
 **PSA** 
---
If you actually don't know how to take them the default key is **Print Screen**.

The screenshots can be found in the \_classic\_ folder under the Screenshots folder.

And if you just want to capture parts of the screen straight away a great tool for this is the Microsoft Snipping tool, which you can find by searching on your PC.

I hope this will help people post better quality images about their cool stories.

---
Thanks; I really was having a lot of fun until about 36 or so. I don’t know what changed — maybe the zones getting bigger? Maybe me just knowing the mount was close?
---
Grr. It might just be that I’ve also just been playing *too much*. I’ve definitely gone pretty hard, and I think I just need to realize that grinding away *all day* is only going to make me regret time lost and not speed up the process that much. Y’know? Like, even if I just manage one level a day (which in itself isn’t bad), that’s still less than a month.
---
Wow, I’ve had an epiphany. Lmao
---
You can upgrade it in the subtlety tree, makes it a lot more useful.

First grind the tusks in STV. You can solo them easy around 32-33. Buy Liferoot off the AH. And then I'd recommend getting to 36 or so and just going to the elementals and start farming them. Most likely you'll run into some other warriors doing the same. They'll invite you and you can farm together. From there you farm them up in the 3 locations and can go complete the quest together. Not a big deal, you're not asking for help, just working together.

i mean you can always engage interaction on retail. all i am about is saying that most interactions in classic come out of you **needing** them, so they are mostly self-serving and eventually may turn out to turn into something like friendships. i am not saying that is bad, or that retail is better, i am trying to be neutral. all i am saying is that all those things could be done on retail too, although there is no need to do it, but really noone forbids you to talk to people when you are fishing in the same spot, or heading to a dungeon, or doing the same quests. the only thing that i fully agree on with everybody concerning ruining socializing in retail is sharding. because each day or hell each swap of zone you are sharded into a different server with other realms and other people. but i think it is kind of delusional saying that "group finder destroyed socializing". it surely reduced the need to look for people by communicating to them, but it does not really deny the people the chance to randomly start a conversation in group chat. that is 100% players choice, just like it is a 100% players choice in classic to talk to others. people got used to the convenience and are to lazy to talk to their fellow players on retail. so retail did encourage huge QoL and convenience, but the lack of socializing came from the players over time. because when LFD and LFR were first introduced, the communications didn't stop abruptly, it happened over time. so the game is not to FULLY blame for what happened. i never said it is innocent, i just wanted to shine light on the side of this problem that players seemingly want to *cover up*

I only had to que once for like 10 minutes the third day. Not once after that. (Nethergard keep)
---
tbc
---
Happened upon this post 8 days later and well, that didn't age well since layer hopping is instant and has no cooldown.
---
These were used by level 60s for a long time despite the weird agility stats because 2% Dodge is pretty good. Dodge used to not generate rage though which isn't good, so they were slightly better for paladins in terms of tanking. Not sure about the 1.2 version.
---
If I res every corpse I walk by in the barrens I'd soon be a better Necromancer than Kel'Thuzad has ever been. 
---
Seriously, occasional resses are fine, but I want to spend at least a few minutes of my time doing actual quests.
---
Greatest of all time!
---
Yup, had my first huntard experience yesterday as this cool little hunter thought herod’s shoulderpads would look nice on him..
---
In classic an affliction lock is the king of pvp. Seen many a lock take multiple players by themselves. Fear and multiple instant cast dots is super nasty. Diminishing returns aren't in Classic so keep fearing and keep dotting.
---
Im lvl 30 now and also considering to respec to reckoning at 32. Is it better for leveling than ret? I read a lot of comments that say it was only good on pservers due to "/sit" bug.

That's the point, the person I was replying to was pretending the hunter could just get an axe with agi instead.
---
I usually login when I get back home from work around 17:00. It has a small queue of 170 then, so a few minutes. I would say the queue grows till around 5kish. If you're mostly online in the evening, logging in with remote desktop while going home can greatly reduce the actual waiting time :)
---
Zug zug, Thughug.
---
in other words, you don't have an answer or any reasoning and should probably keep quiet
---
Where is the pirate music?!
---
Actually not true, I play on Kromkrush and sometimes the Queue can be upwards of 2.5k and it goes by in less than 20 minutes because people aren’t scared of logging off since it usually does not have long queues.
---
Buddy if you can't understand why taking the reward  from somebody else's work could be considered 'a shitty move' you might be a sociopath.
---
I have never being asked to invite someone to my layer. 
---
I have also never got an NPC or mob vanish in front of me.
---
How does someone know which layer he is on and what layer to go to?
---
The only thing I noticed, is that when I started, I had 200 people around me and now I have 20-30 when farming. It just feels empty (although there are 1-3h q when on prime time)
---
I was hoping for a Voidwalker with an apostrophe in his name because they sound more demony, but I guess I'll have to live with Nuts. He's a good guy nevertheless.
---
Damn you're brutal. I like that.
---
This is my problem. My husband has our PC tricked out for his WoW needs. Well I decided I wanted to play classic, but I have to use the laptop. We worked it out though.  I connect my laptop to the 60" TV we have through the HDMI and plug in a keyboard and mouse. It is pretty sweet. My husband almost took it from me. For retail it doesn't work quite as well with the graphics but for classic it works perfectly.
---
Thanks, that's good to know. I have a good wand for now :P
---
This would trigger the fuck out of me lmao.
---
You just reminded me I can get whirlwind axe now. First time I think I got the stupid spear or sword.
---
Talents reset start at 1G and go up each time
---
I'd like to know your definition of "grievance" then, if what I said and was quoted on doesn't meet criteria.
---
Thank you. Not quite done yet as we are still looking for fitting wall decorations. But we are getting there. :)
---
Vw is Thannagma which is really just Thanos + magma
---
Why are half the comments so anal about the image quality? As long as you can read it, why would you care?
---
so currently, my imp's firebolt is at rank 3. He runs out of mana after just 1 pull. 
---
If I have to soak up too much damage, it will slow me down. DoTs + void should be good. I'll go full affliction and just wand it.
---
Don't even need a friend to do it, you can just make your own alts and force renames on your transfers.
---
So? There's also a class called a rogue, would that change anything about how you feel about said actions?
---
My expert tells us its worth 40 gold... but you did find it on a corpse so i dont know if you are the actual owner.... beat i can do is 3 gold
---
Is the healthstone one working? i just want it for trade ability
---
I remember my friends list looking like this on retail, nowadays I only speak to my guild mates and have no need to add them
---
you could go for broken tooth at your level.  fastest attack speed in the game.
---
LortiUi does that
---
I don't care about him either, but kuddos to you for writting an objective review setting aside your personnal belief or dislike for him. That's rare on the internet these days.
---
You should write gaming articles, gaming site need those kind of writting
---
Hunters may have to kite for certain bosses which is a pretty big responsibility. But not every hunter will have to do this
---
Im talking back in 2005 and  on shitty Australian adsl1. I'm sure it's gotten better.
---
Tanking strat/scholo as arms is going to be a stretch. You'd need some top-tier gear, and you won't have that as you start those dungeons. So you'd want to go prot for those most likely.
---
Respecs start low (1g) and go up the more you do it. So ideally you'd minimize that respec.
---
Fury is the top DPS end game, so you'd probably go Arms for leveling -&gt; Prot / Fury depending on what you wanted to do.
---
Rouuugghh

Don't go prot until at least 40 if your committed, for shield slam

what a legend, have fun bro

No one's in any danger, I don't think you're getting this at all!
---
Okay, let ask you, a Freezing Band drops, pre-raid bis for a frost mage, the mage rolls need on it, is that okay?
---
"virgin feast"
---
The typical rule is, you only need on things that you need for the role you que for. So if tour a healer in the D, you should only be rolling on healer items unless you ask first and no one else needs the item.
---
How does a SM dungeon Grind work, amd why do i need so many casters for that? Can i join as a hunter? What would be the ideal hunter setup?
---
I can't see it properly, can you repost this by taking a photo of your screen with your phone camera?
---
TBF I will never go back to retail
---
Go play on a PVE server.  We like it when they kill our NPC's, camp our bodies, ect.   It gives us a reason to call in to Local Defense and kill them and return the favor.
---
Let me know if you are a horde player so we can come over and kill all of your NPC's when right before you come back from questing.  
---
😈
---
demonshear \*drools\* It shears demons

Hey, piggybacking here since you seem to know your shit about mob grinding.
---
I'm lvl 37 on my warr and still need about 50 gold for my mount,any idea what I can slay the next few levels?
---
only reason is I don't like the number 145 compared to 144. literally no difference in performance, just aesthetics
---
Imp named ruppel. Reminds me of Rupert from the TV show Survivor
---
Yeah felstrike is barely established, it was made a bit too fast, yojamba the 2nd oce server had at most 2k queues and that was in the first night, so not many on felstriker atm, hopefully this helps boost it up a bit
---
My buddy just died to them. “I ain’t no puss” were his last words.
---
Lmao you really think blizz had no idea without forum poats
---
Same same.
---
It still is awful.
---
People don't have threat meters, so tanking is miserable. And even when you get an invite, the dungeons are so fucked in Classic that they start off level 26 and end level 35... you can't hit anything, so you can't get rage, or you can hit, but you get shit XP. Charge, Demo Shout, Def Stance, Bloodrage, Sunder... oh shit, what do you mean the hunter led with Multi-shot, I just had to do 20 things to get that group of 3 lined up right... and now it's all fucked.
---
Shit DPS, so questing sucks. Anything solo sucks. Finding weapons sucks... used the same 1-h for 16 levels, had the same 2-h for 12 now.
---
No self-heals, so PVP sucks... not that you're ever in a fair fight anyway, all the rogues and hunters are at least 3-5 levels ahead of you by now. 
---
No movement buffs, so world travel sucks.
---
Costs a trillion gold to re-spec, not that it really matters... so you're kind of locked in.
---
High repair bills, and stupidly high ability costs, so you're broke... I've got less gold than my DPS friends who I occasionally get to group with.
---
you can buy bags from the vendor
---
Firemaw and Gehennas are the same. I checked Firemaw at 6pm last night and it had a 10k queue. 
---
I'm on some shitty realm (Ten Storms maybe?) and just hoping realm transfers aren't too far away so I can play with my friends.

Got it. Learned the skills I needed tonight. How do I check what a pets attack speed is though?

Okay! Ill listen that makes sense thank ya haha
---
Haha I love this!
---
I’m more the type to help people. I always help hordies when I see them getting killed by a group of mobs. I’ve even had them then turn and kill me anyways. I still will help the next one I see. Even if it’s a pvp server. I’m down to pvp but I like a fair fight!
---
Thats just the way I am. Instead of asking for help I like to be the helper. It’s no wonder I mained a resto shaman from tbc till the xpac before BFA lol.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers. The RP crowd is a strange beast.
---
For me it's just that the pet is the most annoying piece of excrement. It always pulls more... and more. and ohh an enemy 2miles away...charge.
---
blizzard has 36 range + 4yrd phantom range, that's 40yrd range, that's a long distance, also when did i ever say out in the open, i said in chokepoints, for example in WSG while protecting your FC you'd sit at banana (path up to roof) and R1 Blizzard in the entrance connecting banana and tunnel, you can also stand at an angle to the entrance allowing you to 99% LoS
---
Raid bosses have 100% chance to drop one or multiple items.
---
STV is a place where I think about the idea of using layering smartly.
---
Balance the player level for the layers. Put the higher level players in the same layer and keep lower levels together. This keeps the game engaging. You mostly deal with players your level. Say for example the layer has 50 60s on the Horde side, theres a similiar amount in the Alliance side.
---
This sub has more active users than League of Legends, Fortnite and Apex Legends the entire day. League was the closest but still down by thousands in comparison.
---
Oddly enough I'd say the GE was one of the, if not the best updates RS/OSRS ever received.
---
Buddy, if you think it's a shitty move beating someone in a video game, why are you even playing a multiplayer game?
---
Solid work! 
---
Unlike your dps in moonkin 😬
---
Why frostbite? I’m pretty sure it can mess up your AoE since the idea of blizzard AoE is to keep everything stacked and slowed together and frostbite can mess that up by freezing some and leaving others. Basically it will not allow you to group mobs efficiently.
---
I didn't even know a 'lost' kodo was out there. And he's not even part of any quest, it's just for flavour and worldbuilding.
---
My wife is my pocket priest. Level 14 troll love bugs. I'm even leveling as Prot. lol

I think it's a 24h bug

Curseforge is my goto

Anyone who is parsing in low level dungeons and talking about it is a virgin pleb cringe kiddie who needs something to validate their life. Ignore them.

Yup, had a 1 hour queue for 6000 people on day 1 for herod because I get home from work a little after midnight pst

Oof, im brand new to WoW. Give me some suggestions.

I would probably call him G-man or Grandma.

thats why red is dead
---
Nothing does
---
Big bonus: It's world-wide unlike Trade which is only available in cities.
---
Or the tank class that actually comes with Thorns? :\^)
---
It's a good wand, and a great replacement since they're hard to find in the mid-30s. But how much gold? Who knows. Nobody is going to have much money to spare in the late 30s because they need mount money.
---
I'd pop it in the bank and wait for people to get money to spend on alts.
---
Didn't feel sorry for the raptor whose head you cut off though, huh? Prejudice smh.
---
This sub absolutely hates hunters and will downvote any mention of the bugs to hell even if they were given definitive proof to show them there are major issues. I am level 36 on my hunter and have had plenty of pvp encounters and dungeon runs and i can tell you in both scenarios fd trapping is very very unreliable, there is a very long delay to drop combat so a trap can be placed, most of the time its so long that you just get put into combat before you can. 10% percent of the time it seems to work normally, so it may have to do with spell batching but there are many different speculations as to why. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference if you and your pet are not attacking or being attacked. Even going to drop a trap to peel for my healer in sm feels like flipping a coin. People on this thread saying  incredibly intelligent and constructive things like like: " you're just ass mad you're getting killed in PvP. "-icy-age are the reason posting on this sub reddit won't bring proper attention to the issue. Even this comment will get downvoted more than likely. The best we can do is to report it as a bug and direct our posts to the official blizzard forums where biased idiots on this sub have no power over who see's it before its stuffed to the bottom of the barrel.
---
Quality meme
---
How does someone know which layer he is on?
---
Did you lose addons/settings/macros
---
Wow
---
Wand is absolutely great for warlocks. Just throw two dots and wand while questing, and it saves you a ton of mana and food because you won't break your pets aggro as fast. This may seem slower at first, but you will rarely have to sit down and eat/drink which saves a ton of time. Shadowbolts aren't really worth the mana until about level 60 when you can get a much better build around them.
---
Wait, you left your room so soon?
---
Well if they keep their promise and layering will be removed with Phase 2 then the economy will fix itself after a while. I do agree that right now it's pretty damaged.
---
Currently level 38 on a priest. It’s by far one of the easiest classes I’ve leveled lol
---
Dont tell me that warrior picked up a dress instead of Triprunners...
---
Nope, still have them, they work while the game is streaming as well
---
not really good 50 or so armor wont change much for the most part
---
I had a 6k tell me &lt;1 minute. It lies.
---
Do you have a plan for professions end-game? If you plan on going engi at the end, it might be a good idea to go mining and save the mats on a bank alt.
---
Are you planning on going alch? Same but with herbalism.
---
I wouldn't work on any other profession besides skinning/mining/herb while leveling unless you're doing it just for pure enjoyment and fun, which at that point you can do anything you want as long as it's fun for you.
---
In Vanilla professions do matter. It depends on your future goals. Going to play PvE or PvP? Or just casual and continue making gold?
---
I will keep skinning and mining in the beginning to just vendor all the skins (AH prices are almost vendor prices atm) and save ore for future engineering but once I get my lvl40 mount I will switch skinning to engineering and start making granades to sell and thinking about keeping engineering since it's nice in PvP (lots of crowd control stuff etc.)
---
There are plenty of good guides on professions in the internet once you figure out what your goals are :)
---
TIL: Not caring when people beat you in a video game makes you a sociopath.
---
Yeah, free transfers generally don't let you pick where you go.
---
If you're on x you can transfer to y.
---
If you're on a you can transfer to b.
---
Etc
---
Blizzard usually pics which servers they want people to leave to from the server they are on.
---
In a controlled fashion.
---
Otherwise to many people jump ship then other servers become over populated etc
---
Not aussie just a nocturnal america
---
Isn’t the argument that the Rey brings utility and support that a warrior doesn’t? For example he could save a wipe with LoH... not saying that makes them as good for a raid necessarily but we can’t just compare dps, there’s more to consider.
---
No, I don't think so.
---
Ask your boss for the credentials.
---
Okay guess I’ll risk it and spend 15 bucks. Thank you u/lechango!
---
Grob mob
---
Retadin can kinda tank, but it’s not something I’m comfortable doing yet atm.
---
Think we'd be better off with a sticky that explains this icon. Seen about 10 of these posts so far.
---
World first 60. 5 minutes after he dinged, he tried to delete his character in front of 300.000 people watching his stream. He got an error message that said he couldn't delete it because he had mail. He logged in and deleted the two pieces of mail, he then logged off again to delete his character again, but he got the same error message. He then logged in to see that his streamers had sent him hundreds of mails in the few seconds it took him to log in and out, which basically prevented him of deleting his character.
---
I definitely agree with you, people should realize ganking is part of the game. 
---
However, one thing that happened to me and several other people the other day was a lvl 32 Druid ganking people 10 levels lower over and over again, which can make the blood boil on even the most thick skinned of people. 
---
Now back to the topic in question:  One (quite big) reason a person picks a server, regardless of tag, is based on where his/her friends are playing.
---
I know what you mean. While I deleted my alliance characters to play horde, I will say I will miss the feeling of playing a paladin and rushing to an allies aid, healing them, and doing my best to aggro the mobs so they can escape or fight on.
---
Why not play on a lower pop realm with no Q?
---
Didn't know Bert Kreischer played Classic!
---
It’s weird how much that can differ between servers. My realm usually has a 2-2.5k queue during prime time, but that has never taken more than 25 minutes for me.
---
Uve got a virus buddy
---
Still too early to say tbh.
---
Everyone from my entire guild who went to play Classic (Some 20+ people) has returned, except 3 people. All citing they got to around level 30-35 and the charm wore off as they all came to realize "This is it" They had all their major rotational spells, maybe 1 or 2 more spells to look forwards to 20 levels down the line.
---
Additionally around level 30 with most their rotations intact they no longer felt the world was "Scary" anymore. Dying 1v1 was no longer realistic, 1v2 was almost always doable, just slooooow and annoying, not tense. 
---
The server pops are still silly high with long queues because people are refusing to move away, and because Some people said "I'll try again in a week when the queue is lower" showing a steady influx of new players to replace the ones who gave up in a week.
---
No joke!
---
50 more resistance at level 36?! No it's cool, I didn't want to hurt you with nature spells anyway!
---
Retail has been a "weekly lottery" for such a long time. I hate it how every week I log in to open 2 lootboxes that are often the only source of upgrades for me. I buy a lottery ticket from the azerite RNG vendor. 
---
Then I complete my weekly conquest cap and M+ in the first day. I have no real gain if I farm PvP or M+ really hard, they can only drop bad ilvl gear compared to the weekly RNG boxes. I outgear all "farmable gear" in 3 weeks of a new patch. Then it becomes a weekly lottery of 2 lootboxes.
---
Gnolls in SE redridge too
---
You can try installing it on an external hard drive or flash drive and play it from there. Other than that, I don't believe there is a workaround.
---
Just be careful that your company doesn't have a way to track what you're doing on the laptop as it may get you in trouble if you try to circumvent your  user rights.
---
Welcome to classic WoW lol
---
Normally you should be able to just copy the whole directory onto a flash drive and then on your notebook. You don't need the b.net launcher iirc.
---
Yea, nothing about classic's end game is going to be anywhere near as hard as retails endgame is.
---
Classic has a better world, but in no way shape or form has harder dungoens.  The fact that rag was killed from level 1 in 5 days is proof of this.
---
BRD is not ZF either...
---
Yup you’ll be great
---
Might be able to just copy the classic client folder over and launch it from the .exe file? Not sure though
---
Lol, it's especially fun because I'M the one who said "who would do that?" lool.
---
Its the honeymoon period
---
Hey m8 glad you find WoW so Relaxing and stress reliefing. 
---
I find the same when I Play. It seems like work but thanks to Long runs and slow killing I actually feel very relaxed while playing too. 
---
Thanks to the community it doesn't get boring because they Keep the Chat alive!
---
I feel just like you :)
---
Have fun on your way to 60! :P
---
Those who expect at least average performance from other party members in order to complete a dungeon in a timely manner.
---
No wonder OP is bored in dungeons when only he knows how bad he's actualy playing and not trying to his class strengths.
---
Hmm, I will ask my mage friend if he wants to give it a go.
---
Have you tried with a lock? Considering they do have AOE as well and I imagine they do a little bit more damage with hellfire then blizzard does.
---
I've seen people use hunters and\or druids for pulling and I can't imagine that being better simply due to the lack of AOE. Hunters have Volley I guess.
---
Unless you're a Druid. The Druid Code is sacred!
---
Ooooh, brilliant! The battlenet friends thingy is annoying me.
---
Updated my post to show the clause in the ToS.
---
Right. Stalaag queues have been up to 5-6 hrs for me
---
I agree, but when you get ganked I think you're allowed one "goddammit, fucking rogue got me at half HP... what a pussy". As long as they aren't being dramatic and whining incessantly. A little salt goes with the meal.
---
And the archive from one of the ulduar 5 man's, with Brann Bronzebeard's sarcastic comments all through the fight...
---
I don’t mind getting killed, but it is frustrating when you’re questing and 3 people that are almost 10 levels above you gang up on you or camp to kill you over and over and you have to beg for layer invitations. 
---
Whenever I see someone lower level questing in the zone I’m in, or someone alone, I just wave and move on.
---
It’ll be fine. The demand for flasks is going to be insane
---
A lot of people act like once you hit 60 or clear MC that the game is over, without realizing just how much left there is to do and how being at least somewhat ahead of the leveling curve can be a huge benefit. Personally, my goal is to build a reputation as a Blacksmith and to do that, hitting the early mine nodes is essential. Hitting zones with Mithril/Truesilver with little to no competition has been incredible.
---
I've had several assholes at low level looti g the quest items I killed mobs next to. They just have no shame and don't respond when I ask them why they're doing it.
---
Jokes on them, I MT'ed as Warrior in a server first vanilla guild and I'm playing Warrior again in Classic. They won't be going in any dungeons with me. Good luck finding a tank.
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the more plain look of gear. Seems more realistic to wear that than fel glowing over the top stuff.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords server?
---
Mainly the XP from this is just from killing the mobs yes, but of course you grab the quests that are available :)
---
Blizzard never expected it to be a week. They expected a month. That's why Layering was set to shut off in a Month. (They're expecting a lot of people to not resub once their first month is up)
---
\-.-
---
My druid is forever level 87 because I won't go through that damn leveling in pandaland again.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I **strongly** disagree.
---
No. Where did you hear that? It's thriving. Had a rough launch, but that's hardly DOA. Wouldn't have had 3 expansions if that were the case.
---
Thalnos has been available since the beginning.  I reserved my name with the major initial name reservation release, so you are incorrect here.
---
Best thing you can do is check the AH and see what’s selling for more. Even this early in the game it’s probably going to be a bit different from realm to realm.
---
I thought layering had no effect on the servers' maximum player capacity.
---
dont tell me how to play.
---
also learn not to die
---
Fresh bread for sale! BTW
---
This motherfucker!
---
Wasn't that the vanilla experience on launch? It's a feature.
---
Umm he literally said users aren't using scripts, they are using macros on gaming keyboards. The macros aren't very intelligent.
---
Yepp, that's the experience my mates had last night. They went to shimmering specifically because i said it was such a fun place to level and that the PvP was much fairer and then after a short amount of time in the zone 5 horde began roaming and camping Raceway one shotting and camping them.
---
Hillsbrad and STV were the two zones where every enconter i had was 3+ horde killing me, i even poly saved an orc warlock and finished his mob for him, then broke him with wand and his two mates just jumped me and he helped kill me lol.
---
I disagree entirely. I think warlocks should not be expected to summon, and noone should be expected to do shit outside of what they join the group to do. You kick a warlock that wont summon to invite someone else that makes your group still wait 30 mins to do the dungeon? Doesn't really make sense... The social contract you sign is "NEED DPS" "IM DPS" now you are socially required to dps for the period of the dungeon. You are not expected to tank or heal, but are free to assist if things go south etc. If you take a rogue and say "hey we are taking you over other dps so you can open locked lockboxes" and the rogue goes "yeah sure thats fine" then you have a social and verbal contract to share the loot.  
---
Also in retail all loot is personal... You can't get anyone elses items unless it is a downgrade for them and then they can CHOOSE to trade it lol.
---
Warcast
---
I fear that people will get bored of Classic wow after a few weeks, but they won't return to Retail.  The nonsense of retail right now with all its arbitrary timegate grinds is really off-putting in comparison.  BfA just feels dead, its just grinds for the sake of grinds with no community feel at all.  
---
I think that will be the biggest kicker in all of this.
---
Yeah this was my first guess, tried it without addons and it's still spiking unfortunately
---
What server are you on? Desolace was a walk in the park in skeram.
---
In the evenings when I make dinner for the family and get the kids to bed I put an alarm on my phone for 8 mins, go move char when alarm rings, set alarm again.
---
Several times I have been booted to char select screen after a while of doing this (I usually play some, do some stuff, play some, eat dinner, play some, put the kids to bed, etc etc)
---
ever tried /world ?
---
Yeah my first toon ever back in Vanilla was a Hunter. I think you might not know how the class is played. There’s this nifty ability called shoot which lets you attack from range!
---
If you are meleeing all of the time, you are doing one of two things incorrectly. 1, not knowing you can attack from range. 2, not knowing know aggro with your pet works.
---
If lots of people don't report it, those people probably also don't report the times it doesn't drop.
---
Where is the picture for aquatic form
---
For priests no?
---
Awesome, now pay it forward
---
Wish I could upvote this twice, I'm so tired of seeing those posts on here.
---
It's the best anti-caster pet.
---
Tanking start/scholo as either 31/0/20 or 0/31/20 is fine. You should just be aware that dual weild or 2h tanking doesn't work there any more.
---
Been fairly accurate on grobb
---
am not sure this quees artificaly generated to keep up the hype...
---
I did it when I first started because I didnt know what the tram was, I was not a smart man.
---
How to hack classic should be the title
---
Arcane mages also have their own improved wands talent.
---
I think a thing a lot of people who've chosen PvP did, was only consider the PvP and ganking *they* get to do. Not thinking it would happen to them...
---
3k queue is about an hour of wait time, just do some shit you were gonna do after you played and you should be fine.
---
I am going to stop arguing now because you are far from reasonable. First you base your "facts" on personal experience (friends didnt get to endgame without boost) and now WoW isn't even a MMO anymore
---
bye
---
this is seriously awesome!
---
Dude the point is Shield Block + Revenge Spam. You will literally have no more than 15 rage at any point in a fight. You can tank 2 elites by yourself and kill them.
---
You can tank 5-6 elites by yourself with a modest shaman or priest behind you. You cannot do this as Arms with simply a shield equipped. The extra block gained from Shield Specialization allows you to mitigate upwards of 50% incoming attacks vs 4 mobs. And revenge spam **stuns** a mob 45% of the time; you can switch targets in the melee to make sure diminishing returns doesn't set in.
---
If things hit the floor you always have your Last Stand + *Best Potion* macro ready. 
---
It's not about holding aggro as much as it is about being unkillable.
---
Twitch desktop app
---
this! This game just have it's own pace, and for me after a stressful day it's just relaxing to log in, to take my time to the next village, to gather some ressources and stuff like that. Even the combat is very slow paced andrelaxing and I really dig this!
---
Druid is complete shit until 20
---
Looks like a bread vendor
---
&gt;All those shadowpriests people fear in pvp? Those are just your rage battery. Their mindblast keeps getting stronger as they gear up.
---
Mind Control you off bridge! Dirty Warrior!
---
Too bad fd trapping is bugged and is very unreliable, i really hope they fix it I'd love to see hunter played at this level in classic.
---
Because all the cool kids are in 1 server and every other server is dead and literally pointless to play on /s
---
Oh god I'm on Atiesh and I swear I saw the same convo in Goldshire. I ended up blocking about fifteen people in an hour. There's no use arguing with those kinds of people.
---
Many companies have policies that forbid workers from installing anything on their PC for security reasons, if that's the case, there are no workarounds, also not a good idea to break those rules.
---
Only thing you can do is ask permission to your IT people, I wouldn't do that though because it's not professional behaviour.
---
This is incredible. I kinda know why this happens though. Basically, the boat has its own coordinate system. So when you’re on the boat, your position is relative to the boat, relative to the world. For example, your regular position in the world might be 7000, 3000, 1000, but on the boat it’s 10, 20, 10. As such, you get glitched into the world using your boat coordinates, wherever continent the boat is at. It’s really cool, thanks for sharing!
---
Classic :D
---
Sold one for 20gold that I found yesterday
---
It’s possible, but requires patience and exploration.  I’ve been playing vanilla for a long time, so I have an internal questie for what I need to do.  The first time I played through WoW it took me something like 17 days /played to get to 60 because I ran into what you did, but didn’t have a mod to help me.  I think it depends on your personality and the pace you want to take.
---
So max 60 fps?
---
Yep, totally killed an alliance players escort in desolace, at the burning blade fortress lol
---
This is case IF warrior is actually like 1 level off from getting Whirlwind Axe and is actually going to get it. It requires quite a lot of materials and also if you are still 5 levels off this is definitely for warrior. Warrior is most gear dependent class out there and good weapon really makes difference when killing mobs.
---
Rogue here who has the Defias Bandana!!
---
I was so excited and happy when I got it. Naturally I un-hid any future helms now!!
---
Well happy ending then.  Ninjaing gear is just annoying. I don’t mind losing rolls on stuff to classes that can use but I can’t have the ninja nonsense
---
Fuck I wish... I joined yesterday afternoon at around 4pm and hit a queue of 13k.
---
Took me 4 hours to get in. :(
---
Check your AH for Greater Magic Essence. Anything below 14.97 Silver is profit when making wands that don't turn gray until 150.
---
Void Walker is named Krakthyk.
---
Even in the endless void from whence he hails, they take pride in a thicc booty.
---
Yeah when I started playing wow I had no idea thats a default model. I just thought people had a taste for rly ugly portraits. Gnome is also terrible
---
I wouldn't watch a stream...
---
I'll just end that sentence right there
---
Especially since that boss has adds. That both have a high chance to drop Armor Piercer, which is like 11 agi or so.
---
See, this isn't Blizzard's problem. They gave you the tools to play. The *problem* is you want to hang out at a specific club and the bouncer has told you the fire marshal won't allow more people inside.
---
This isn't the club's, the bouncer's, or Blizzard's problem. It's one you and your friends created.
---
First, any semi-decent raid will have master looter. Second, anything bind on pickup that is green or higher will have a confirm tab pop up "are you sure you wanna take this?"
---
If you’re using Windows you can create a scheduled task that will wake the computer at the trigger time that you define. Pretty neat.
---
My boyfriend is the same way. Has an awesome PC setup in the bedroom, but would rather sit on the futon and play on the laptop in the office with me. It's one of the first time in years I've gotten him to game with me.
---
Tbh I'd reroll while you still can. You might level quicker now having done it before. Better reroll now rather than regret your choice for the entirety of classic.
---
Queues are fake confirmed
---
"But it's really important that I do 55 instead of 50 damage when I pull!"
---
Imagine this is a lvl 19 item. Rogue twinks would spend good money for this
---
It was late and many people in the raid said they only had time to stay for one attempt. I think they did two attempts though.
---
Half will be high by noon and all but 3-4 will have queues by 5pm
---
Yesterday it was a pain in the ass trying to finish quests in Ashenvale on the beach near the horde flight path.. Full of 25-30 lvl horde groups, just dead alliance lying on the ground.
---
Come to Australia, our servers are so unstable you'll get in immediately!
---
Then not be able to play properly but that's besides the point.
---
If you really want to try you can usually just open a chat on the support site and get some free gametime, I've done it many times. Sometimes you get 1 day - 1 week.
---
If you're just interested in the lore, you don't need any addons or guides and I'd suggest not even getting one. Just make a character and go at it and have fun.
---
You called it perfectly
---
Do people actually use the retail access lmao
---
Or you know, just run full agi and don't take the fucking warrior's, paladin's or shaman's gear.
---
Ignore him, he's either a troll or the ultimate huntard. There's another thread where he's straight up arguing that there's no problem with stealing other people's loot.
---
The queue times on Arugal have actually gotten a lot better since the first week. People going back to work and whatnot.
---
Most of the people who quit due to queues probably think "ill just come back in a few weeks" which means... they all try to log in at once and we get longet queues.
---
I think blizz put spell dmg on it to mock hunters or something
---
I level up fine because I'm not a retail pleb who needs add-ons? I'll check Wowhead occasionally if I'm stuck but that's about it.
---
Im using it, If you use the twitch app to install addons, its called like questlogex or something
---
I was having the same issue. Retail was fine but couldn’t login to classic. Issue seems fixed now though I’ve been playing the last 20-30 min
---
The biggest difference is that you spam shields as often as possible, because shields allow casters to keep casting while getting hit. Warriors hate that shit, so you need to change the way you heal =)
---
Also, regular heal abilities are too slow because when a mage gets hit he gets hit HARD, especially if they mess up a bit and have 5-6 elites hit them at the same time.
---
Friend of mine got instagibbed yesterday, it's not always going to be your fault if someone dies. The mages have to make sure to kite as much as possible. Perfect pulls, you will still have a lot of mana left as they won't take much damage.
---
Be prepared for some learning runs, where the exp isn't all that great. It's fun as hell though imo. Some might say you need to be disc\holy but that's simply not true. 5\5 wand spec and rest in shadow, I have no problems.
---
What I can think of right now at least, definitely recommend it and you will get a lot of mage friends in the process (free water later on).
---
I heard that most servers eventually unbalance themselves, because people are getting ganked, they eventually either roll in a different server or switch sides.
---
But more realistically you'll have 36 people showing up with hockey sticks, 3 people with baseball bats and one with a rusty spoon.
---
And it's better to bring the 3 with baseball bats and put the Rusty Spoon man on probation but bring him too because bosses don't scale to raid size.
---
It is but you just need /aap skip or /aap reset
---
&gt;I agree that modern wow RNG is bullshit, but not for the reason pointed out here. It is predatory to the max, and is meant to keep people at the slot machine to so speak. But the complexity it adds is imo a side issue at best
---
I wouldn't say it's an issue at all, honestly. People just like to complain a lot. It's a GOOD thing when the player has to sit down and read those item tooltips and maybe has to inform himself on the web whether that effect is useful or not. The problem is simply that retail shows an itemlevel and people look at that one number instead of what the item actually does.
---
Rogue, hunter or druid for mostly pvp and little bit pve?
---
One option is to get the black war pvp version. It requires epic mount skill and I think it costs 20 marks from each BG but I can’t remember exactly.
---
The only time i was annoyed in 30 level was when quests sent me to the barrens or the lvl 30 zone below it,10+ horde questing inside the cavern where you have your quest item for the warlock quest
---
I do believe you can use this:
---
[Classic Quest Log for Classic](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24937-ClassicQuestLogforClassic.html)
---
Not tried it myself, but it's listed in this pretty good list of add-ons for Classic [here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294842/best-addons-for-wow-classic-updated-and-expanded)
---
But I want to, even if it means less loot :D. Having fun is more important for me. Plus Whirlwind and Cleave are acceptable alternates to Mortal Strike. Will I do top tier dps? Definitely no but it's still possible to be around average mid tier damage wise.
---
Dude you have no idea we my friends and I have made up groups with a random hunger 4 times and it’s 4/4. Now we know our ideal 5th guy is a ret paladin.
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat...
---
Cheers
---
Just sprint lol
---
My friend cleared Ragnaros as a PvP specced Retridin in Rank 14 gear.
---
He joined the raid As a healer.
---
As I said in my OP, it seems to be affecting people's main character realms. Can log onto alts on other servers.
---
May have to do with which server you played on today. Seems more likely. But as of now it seems to be affecting main realms only
---
Fearing a big group of mobs and letting them kill everyone in the area is fun.
---
~~mining node~~ chest
---
Titan panel, zperl, questie. I also recommend messing with macros. Some abilities don't trigger global cooldown so you can hit 2 abilities with one key. I have exorcism and judgement on one key so I can burst undead.
---
That is just because of steroids
---
I'm rocking some cloth shoulders that dropped ... even though I'm a warrior :D
---
Fish crates for rumsey black label. I played a private server where these crates had an incorrect very high spawn rate, and the rumsey i fished up still sold for like 10g a stack
---
Nope. This accords perfectly with my memories of rogue before the new system of constant regeneration.
---
The random 19 and 21 ticks is correct.
---
The trick is to understand that dumping your entire energy bar gives you some initial burst, but ZERO effective DPS increase over the long term. Keep a reserve of energy to allow you to kick, etc.
---
Heroic strike simply adds a flat damage value on top of your next swing. It doesnt profit from a slower weapon at all.
---
A bunch of people cant log in
---
That gnome in the background lol
---
I’ve never hit end game before
---
It's a dagger. Specifically the dagger that the first boss from RFK.
---
You linked a video of a guy doing the aimed shot rotation with 1 melee swing every 2 aimed shots. You can literally watch the combat numbers with 8k damage from range and 1 500 damage melee slap. He’s using an agi weapon like a smart hunter.
---
Please realize that 1 melee every 6-8 seconds as apart of the ideal rotation (which prioritizes agi, not weapon dps) is not the same thing as meleeing constantly. And if you were using Corpsemaker in a Patchwerk fight, your dps would be significantly lower than if you were to use a lvl 11 +4 agi 2 hander.
---
I was just wondering is there any "hidden" lore books that i might miss? Some other MMO's have interactables for lore that can be easily missed.
---
If you are interested in the lore just pretend anything after wotlk didn't happen. You'll happier that way
---
I'm having a real hard time to see how a mage can pull as well as a lock, but I'm going to give it a go.
---
Hopefully I'll find a mage that has done it before and can show us the ropes.
---
I complain that I can't gank from a PvE server.
---
Flag yourself, pussy. DO IT!
---
The amount of people on this sub who don't know how to take screenshots shows boomer the playerbase is
---
They have been quitting by now dude. Used to be 24k or just simply full ques..
---
Is the str bonus more worth it for us than an agi 2h axe?
---
Thumbs up for "stvietnam"
---
I disagree. I buy mats for less than 4 silver, sell potion for 1 gold. You are wrong
---
I’m not playing on a pvp server. But I should be banking all the leather or ore and then switch to leatherworking/engineering to level up fast is what you’re saying?
---
IT's also a blizzard policy, that not knowing something is a bug doesn't protect you from punishment.
---
The paladin who one-shot Kazzak after stacking Reckoning 1000 times. Do you think, he knew this was a bug? He got banned.
---
The world first kill of Lich King Heroic got banned for using Saronite bombs to remove a mechanic from the fight. Even though they used Saronite bombs all the time in raids.
---
There are plenty of examples in woWs history where people got a temporary ban for exploiting a bug, even if they didn'T know this was a bug.
---
This here is abusing a bug knowingly and systematically. Severly reduced XP gain in raid groups has been in the game since Day 1 and especially the players and guilds who abused it the hardest have no excuse, as they have extensive private server and vanilla knowledge to know this was a bug.
---
Not doling out punishment to everybody who abused the bug, just because so many people did sends the wrong message.
---
To my understanding and hours of research... 
---
Fury Warrior is top melee DPS, closely followed by Combat Rogue. Protection Warrior is essentially the only Tank at end game. Frost Mage is the ranged DPS until Naxx, then it switches to Fire Mage. The best healer is Holy Priest. Though Resto Shaman is a great Raid healer or for speed clears. Holy Paladin is the main tank healer. 
---
Though all classes are playable; any class that can heal, is a healer, unless you're playing with friends. All classes bring something, especially to raids. Marksman Hunter, Affliction Warlock and Resto Druid are the ones I haven't mentioned earlier, and those are there specs for PvE. 
---
This is assuming that you're going more for the pugs, due to the stigma against some specs. But get a good guild, and you might be able to play almost any build. 
---
I should mention that I've only mentioned each classes main talent tree here, for those playstyles.
---
/sorry
---
(takes it)
---
/bye
---
Why wait if you already set your mind to it?
---
You mean the best UI.
---
Yes. Couldn’t tell you what it costs, but the rogue trainer did have the option to unlearn your talents.
---
As if half the player base decided to raid 5-man dungeons...
---

---
Gotcha! My bad then, must have misinterpreted your statement.
---
Definitely the organisation, logistics and obviously repeatedly training that is all a good chunk of work. It's not as impressive as people doing basically the same without knowing every Detail of a new Raid, but it's a respectable achievement.
---
I like to see how much worse all these Streamers with their Speedleveling guilds are. Just watched Soda's and Staysafe's try on MC. After those recruiting sheets that indicated they look for the most hardcore and experienced players I thought they at least got people that are above average raiders. Turns out they just know how to AoE clear dungeons repeatedly and can't track 1 debuff nor read Guides before. This isn't against Soda or Quin or Staysafe, I think all 3 of them are pretty good and entertaining, but their choice of Raiders was poorly in some cases.
---
Yeah, if someone got your name first, and you name yourself Ghoose or Gôôsê then you're the WoW equivalent of a knock of Gucci bag that says Gukki.
---
Especially when it's a generic name like "Goose" 
---
When someone took Sco, Methodsco, Scowarr on all servers so Sco from Method went to NA. That's a name theif.
---
This is someone who was quicker on the draw than you.
---
Imagine complaining about a 3k queue, that would be a dream to come back to! Last night i came back to 8k still.
---
Big mad huh
---
My point is exactly that if a server is going to be "unhealthy", it will be due to a too large population, not too small.
---
A lot of people have issues after installing the update
---
Where is my aquatic form!??
---
But having server friends at the top would be a small and welcome change.
---
2.5k, that's nothing.
---
I’m probably going to get downvoted, but in my opinion it’s not a good thing. A 20-30 minute queue at primetime is healthy for the server, at least you know it’s full and a little bit more. If there’s no queue you can’t know the population exactly, maybe it’s rapidly decreasing by the day.
---
&gt; And if you were using Corpsemaker in a Patchwerk fight, your dps would be significantly lower than if you were to use a lvl 11 +4 agi 2 hander.
---
I'd love to see you math that one out.
---
The fact that he couldn't get it by himself in the first place show that we need to hammer it in him as long as needed
---
So what does the "anti-aliasing" setting in most games do?
---
I'm split between 4 potential characters at the moment, so I play whichever one I feel like playing that night
---
Paladin - lvl 10
---
Warrior - lvl 10
---
Warlock - lvl 13
---
Druid - lvl 6
---
Only one (Warlock) is guilded so when I want company/chat I log him in and lark around with guildies, otherwise I use the others to proverbially stop and smell the coffee..
---
.... Interestingly this has made me slow down in retail wow as well.  I used to try and cram as much as I could into my game sessions for fear of 'falling behind'.  Now I do whatever I feel like - as long as I am enjoying it, who cares.
---
Bring a pack of beer to your IT guy
---
Idd, it's not impossible to raid in vanilla as any spec but like i said if you're going to PuG or look for a raid spot in a guild without any connections in the game the majority of the time you won't be playing ret as a paladin.
---
We used to take people in their PvP spec, farm spec, etc. We had 3 minute mages fighting Rag where they were forced to use Frostbolt without being anyway specced for it, but we were all friends. They were still what we needed them to be a majority of the time.
---
Red is dead and gnomes deserve a teabagging. Dwarves deserve a kiss because they are cute and the only good ally race
---
there are a few quests that may have specific bits of lore you might want per faction. For instance you aren't going to get much Troll/Orc lore rolling alliance.
---
Its that exact attitude that will leave the 4hour queue servers with queues and over population and the dead servers dead. If people were more open we’d have a much more even spread of players on servers and would have a more authentic classic experience
---
I just experienced stitches for the first time ever yesterday. I don’t remember the last time WoW scared me like that...
---
Hey, you are in a guild with that streamer who has long hair and squeals like a pig. Grats on downing Rag and Ony.
---
First week is over, anyone that took a weeks annual leave will go back today also. Plus it's &lt;9am, plus schools are back today.
---
What did you roll! Have fun, imo there is always something to do, which I love!
---
That explains last night. I was spending time with the missus and set a timer for 29 minutes so I could move my character. After about an 1h15 I came back and had been logged out.
---
Also depends on the brothers spec and skill level.  Personally i will mark which one i want dead first but build threat on the next target more since first mob should die in seconds.  And probably 1 / 5 times does aoe cause problems where i cant regain threat.  But thats do to dodges,  misses,  and resisting taunt.
---
No reason to take the bait on that one, it’s clear to everyone with a brain. Stats that are good for you &gt; stats that are not good for you
---
Was in badlands. No swimming.
---
As I level, I made 2 macros.  I have a sword and dagger equipped. In stealth I have one macro for backstab, which will change to ambush once I get it, that's switches my dagger to main hand.  Then my sinister strike macro switches the weapons putting my sword in the main hand for the rest of the fight.
---
Macros are:
---
Backstab/ambush
---
/equipslot 16 "name of dagger"
---
/cast backstab
---
Sinister strike
---
/equipslot 16 "name of sword"
---
/cast sinister strike
---
I think I'm losing time to a partial global cool down when I switch back to my sword, but until I find something better, it is what it is.
---
You're in for a treat, my friend.
---
I know this isn't classic, as I haven't made a lock on classic yet. But on retail, my fel imp is named: Niple
---
Yikes you’re right
---
lol
---
If any of my friends want to go alliance, they are not friends I need
---
This isn’t a case of them not having their shit together. Blizzard isn’t going to open a bunch of servers only to have to consolidate them all after all the tourists leave.
---
Ok. Who is the fire marshal here? Because there’s no safety problem. Just a money issue. I shouldn’t have to change server and not play with my friends because they’ve not invested enough money (they’ve made a fuck load from this launch already)
---
For the horde!
---
If you like the lore and the way the story is out across I’d use Immersion as it changes the boring questing panels in to a more immersive story like way. 
---
Other than that, just enjoy yourself :)
---
I wish the shaders would be this good.
---
Dungeons are your friend, since warriors are so gear dependent.  RFC quest gets you axe of orgrimmar which will make things easier.  Wailing Caverns gets you crescent staff, plus a decent tanking set.  And a good dungeon run can almost flat get you a level.  Dont forget you can tank even as dps specs, which makes finding groups a lot easier.
---
My friend JUST downloaded that for me tonight. I think its called QuestLog Extended. Atleast thats what it said on my addon list
---
After checking WoWhead comments, it says you can't eat anything. I think that's what happened. I ate food, even though I didn't eat food that gives any sort of other buff. Apparently eating ANYTHING removes the buff. Almost impossible to use, then, cause I gotta eat after every fight.
---
Tbh I think you could jump on a guide without much problem. I leveled to about 20 before I started with it. And sure there were a few questlines I had missed, but that wasn't that big of an issue. If you dont want to miss anything you can just look up the pre quests and do them first to make sure you're synched with the guide If you want i can give you the link to the guide when i get home :)
---
Dark whelplings in badlands and emerald whelplings in swamp of sorrows are mobs that are good to grind because of their loot table (especially if you have skinning). They drop valuable grey items for vendoring and reagents you can sell on AH as well as a very rare pet if you're mega lucky :p
---
Should have
---
Fun meme build, but you definitely want Arcane Meditation in this.
---
Holy shit that's beautiful.
---
Which is kinda funny, since looking at a Voidwalker, they don't even seem to have a booty, just a huge fucking upper body and arms.
---
Yeah, I'm a shaman as well.  Leveling enhance and respecing resto at 60, so I know what you're saying.
---
Same here. 
---
I feel pretty save as long as avoid joining raid groups and have a healthy dose of friends outside of WoW.
---
I don't understand why looting something when loot is set to FFA is considered ninja looting.
---
You vs. the Kraul Bat she tells you not to worry about.
---
Fuck off
---
Yeah they’ve about halved. I’ve noticed though that the queue moves quickly as well. Spose blizzard has something to do with that. 
---
Used to be 1k = 30mins or so.
---
Now it’s close to 2k = 30mins.
---
Same, but this is not a stat stick. Corpsemaker doesn't really have any useful stats on it. When it dropped in my RFK run I just passed. And the Warrior took it. I was there hoping for that Polearm. That is the ultimate stat stick for a hunter. It's a crappy weapon but got lot's of Agi on it.
---
I finished an Uldaman run yesterday with my guild and headed back to Kargath to turn in a few Quests until I got critted twice by what I thought to just be a bird. It was a Level ?? Zaricotl. I forgot about it and I paid dearly. Bloody amazing.
---
Remember: Tabbing out bad!
---
&gt; Sure, in a year's time when players start complaining about dead servers Blizz might start offering free (probably paid) server transfers
---
Blizzard already announced free server transfers coming in the next couple of days. Granted, it's the other way (from high pop --&gt; low pop), but it would seem that they have begun stepping up their game lately.
---
Is there some kind of social guide to the game? Like what do all the abbreviations mean? How do you find group members for dungeons? Just all the things you have to know to be able to play and communicate with other people? 
---
As a complete beginner these things can be very confusing and/or intimidating.
---
I hope when you're level 60 you miss a epic trade or group youve been looking for forever because all the people you block LUL
---
What’s that mouse rest? Also glad she joined you in on the fun, enjoy your adventures.
---
I was gonna say that the priest was the MVP here, but that warrior was insanely good. 
---
Really enjoyed this vid and both players are excellent!

Hi, /u/Thundrbang

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czhs5y/week_one_goal_complete_returning_to_work_tomorrow/). 
---
Any word if the Latin community is planning on transferring though? Would hate to move if they're moving as well. Not hate to them at all, just makes it kind of annoying when a server is split in half with a language barrier
---
And in this case you're willing to throw away a large amount of stats that are good for you for a tiny bit of stats that are slightly better for you.
---
As you said, it should be clear for anyone with a brain which is better.
---
True, and i think this is where the unintunitiveness comes from, but if they seen any of the vanilla bis lists where lvl 58 blues or that one lvl 40 epic druid staff is BiS rather than any raid item even from naxx, their heads may explode.
---
Looking at just one number almost always failed you in wow gearing. 
---
i see what they are getting at, because even in vanilla it didn't make the best of sense, like the legendary not better than epic.
---

You are right if it ryuins your entire experience you shouldnt play on a pvp server. But why are you not allowed to complain about the game, people complain about every other aspect of it just fine. For some people its so immersive that getting killed over and over is emotional to some degree, doesn't mean theyre smashing their monitors, but sometimes people need a small outlet. Thats also part of the social experience imo.
---
Even the servers that they announced the night before got full. There was basically No choice. Dpd in all ends. My friends first wanted to go shazz. Then firemaw when it launched, but it quickly filled up, so we choose the New server mograine where queues have averaged around 10k... Would not say we were not adaptable, but we wanted to play together, that doesnt make us stupid assholes. There was simply traps and queues on all ends except for hydraxian. The designated dead server.
---
To be fair in the MC run i remember apes having a few paladins in the top 10 dps
---
OP learned something new today: Where all the people with lives and responsibilities go during the day.
---
On the flip side, it doesn't matter what gear you have! You can roll on anything!
---
im using [QuestlogEX](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/questlogex/) does the same thing near enough
---
Truth is just getting 40 people is usually so challenging / takes so long, that you're willing to invite the level 59 Warrior doing the Ironman Challenge just to fill the slot.
---
If he does 10DPS that's 10 more DPS than if you went without him
---
But this is Hillsbrad Foothills, not Barrens. It's for the new plague questline.
---
Zandalar tribe and hydraxian waterords in eu are a bit exempt, they are the only rppvp and rp servers in eu, so theyll always have their specific userbase :D
---
The helm I can understand, since it has +1% crit. But the shoulder is stupid. You don't need that.
---
I love TukUI, used it for a long time but I don't like the player/target bars, mainly because health is displayed below them rather than on them and not very clearly, everything else is amazing though. Any idea if you can turn off the player/target bars?
---
Send me back
---
Some druid tanks also throw hots on them self before they enter a fight.
---
and that's why my guild and I switched to the Allianz. Superiority through skill not numbers. Also much more easy targets.
---
Its engineering
---
gotta be in trade chat
---
I could be wrong here but pretty sure instant poison is PPM and not affected by weapon speed.
---
All abilities use MH damage as base, and this damage is higher with slow weapons.
---
you ALWAYS want a slow MH weapon. daggers, swords, maces - everything.
---
OH can be either, and usually people prefer fast because deadly and utility poisons are applied faster.
---
And to add, yea if your on voicechat and you are just acting negative that would also piss me off. I would let them know and mute them if possible.
---
Why order a #2 with no cheese ? Just order #1 .

---
What does this addon do??
---
So? I'm not racing but these posts and all the comments make it seem like you guys need validation or something. Just play the game how you want
---
One of the best things about Classic right now is that everyone's roughly on equal terms, and everything is new. It's like those first few days/weeks of a new expansion, where everyone's goal is to work on the new content. Except this will probably last for another few months before most of the playerbase will be focused on raiding.
---
And then it's time for alts and the next content phase, and the whole circus starts again!
---
Inside wow it'll only capture the wow window.
---
Do we know when we're getting Cloth turn-ins? Daddy wants a battlecat.
---
\&gt;:(
---
I think that is something quite different. Remote access has no relation to cloud services. As for unauthorized streaming or transmission it refers to any such transmission from a third party server to any device. The clause is confusing and I'm not entirely certain what it even is supposed to cover. But in the case of Teamviewer, no content is essentially streamed. Everything remains on the original device. I simply access my PC remotely.
---
&gt;everything is a one shot mechanic.
---
This is lazy design.
---
Yes. Don't use Flash Heal as your Lesser Heal! 
---
Since Heal(Rank 1) is pretty close to Heal(Rank 2) you might want to use Lesser Heal(Rank 3) as your... well, lesser Heal. But it actually is a bit low. Usually I aim for having my "downrank" be a version that heals about half of my highest rank. That's easiest to work with in my opinion.
---
It also takes a bit of experience to recognize whether something was your fault or not. Your own level is not so important for healing. The amount of mana manareg you have doesn't change drastically within a few levels and depends more on your items than anything else. But the level of your group-members is very important. A tank that is a lot lower than the mobs will receive an exceeding amount of crushing-blows, making him take a lot more damage. DPS that are lower level will have issues with glancing-blows and resists which drags out the fight.
---
A lower-level tank also can lose aggro to DPS forcing you to heal them instead.
---
Another aspect is the pulls. Was the lowest amount of enemies possible pulled or are you dealing with more than what you should have to deal? Is there someone who can apply CC like polymorph? It makes a super-huge-difference on the healing required if 1 out of 3 mobs won't attack before the others are dead.
---
If a fight consists of you exclusively healing the tank and being able to do so with your biggest heal without "overhealing" and you go OOM regardless, then there really is nothing you could have done better. Except for chugging a mana-potion, perhaps.
---
It will steadily decline over the next year or until the next phase. Same thing happened with OSRS, it nearly died until they started adding updates.
---
Why?

Did the exact same thing yesterday. Never got that sword tho.
---
WHERE IS THE PVP??  
---
As someone who is only interested in PVP, and since BGs are in phase 3 which will be release in 2020 (omg).. Am I wasting my time or should I head to contested areas for my PvP? If so, what are the main pvp areas?
---
It's crazy, but I am still logging in and smiling at the fact I am playing legit *Classic Wow*!
---
If you don't like your race and/or class, definitely reroll. 15, in the grand scheme of things, isn't a lot. Higher levels require more XP, so while 15 may seem like it's 1/4 of the way, it's really not. For reference, half-way, XP-wise, is about 42.
---
That's not to downplay your hard work, just to give some perspective. 15 is pretty early in the grand scheme of things.

BRE had different stats for 10 out of 12 vanilla patches... so the reason it is considered better now is not because it got "figured out" but because it has its stats changed dramatically. For the majority of vanilla sulfuras was better than BRE.
---
Yep I had something like that happen in STV while getting the troll tablets. I was slowly making my way inside when out of nowhere some idiot druid runs past me with 10 mobs on his ass, dies and then all of a sudden they just go after me when I had not casted a single ability that affected him or myself once I saw him coming. I was moderately tilted, to say the least.
---
On that note, don't be that person. If you fuck up and get yourself killed don't take some random person down with you

I forgot stuff like this happens... I was wondering why there were so many dead bodies when I reach SW tonight
---
Hey, not in-game related, but if you are interested in the lore check Nobbel87 YouTube's channel.
---
You've got a point there, with regards to story telling. But this is a game, and it becomes a lot more light-hearted with Bronzebeard being what he is.
---
You cant open chests in combat
---
You should see my friend on discord. He's on the verge of rerolling hunter.
---
That they can’t be looted in combat.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I probably wouldn't have rolled on it but now i'm thinking I will
---
Yes, I said locked lock boxes because it had alliteration, but i was referring to chest. Didn't think you would actually think I was referring to lock boxes but that's funny. My entire point is the same about chests. If bringing a rogue gives the group new access to the loot it's the rogues choice to share it. If you got in a group and got to a box and the rogue said "skill not high enough" would you kick him because he isn't fulfilling his role? With your warlock example early you seem to imply so.
---
Yeah that’s great. Should have been the case for every server tho, and would have if they would have just announced a reasonable server count up front. People are idiots, and thus many figures the two pvp realms announced for EU would be enough, because “blizzard magic! They know best”. Entire guilds are stuck with 10 hour Qs most time of day now. I know as I had to bail from two due to their server choice. They picked one and wanted to call that it for fear of losing players if they switched. Welp.
---
There's [this](https://classicguides.app/vanilla-wow-abbreviations-you-should-know/). Finding group members is most often via the trade chat in the cities, or in the chat of the region where the dungeon is located.
---
I guess anything’s more comforting then a pile of twigs and huts
---
Leveling with demonology makes it a breeze
---
More than I expected
---
You can have the community and ques or you can have cross realm massive servers without community.
---
Pick one
---
To be fair, a lot of us are new and constantly dying, and really don't wanna die trying to help a rando.
---
He looked at me funny ok!?!? IT WAS SELF DEFENCE!!
---
Mage paladin
---
Yeah at no point does the faction indicate that there is any form of Alliance.
---
Remember, don’t jump, you never jump. No matter how boring your travel route is.
---
Except there’s this one place in that one dungeon you gotta jump
---
It goes down to the classic answer of DM is fine for the deadmines because when you run Dire Maul, you’ll always specify E W N or Tribute.
---
All my friends and guild are on Faerlina. I've been lucky to get mostly queues between 2 or 3 hrs, but that's before peak time where people still have to wait between 6 to 8 hrs.  It's crazy, but I really wouldn't want to play alone. Even if I'm soloing quest, just using the guild discord, etc makes the game better.
---
Unless you're tauren, then ya kinda screwed
---
I wish brokentooth looked cooler. I'm rocking ghost saber and I don't think I'll switch.
---
I’ll turn you into a fucking sheep for that.
---
Pretty much this. I've watched queue times on herod go from 25k at launch to 10k a few days later and now it's usually 3-6k. Luckily most of my friends have stuck it out and the trend seems to be going in the right direction.  I'm not sure whether some of the lower pop realms will die or not, but I can be damn sure the higher pop ones won't.  I would hate to end up on a dead server, it's so much worse in classic wow than in retail to not have a healthy population.

im a woman and i dont see any cringe, or problem in that guild name. just name like any other. who would get upset over that?

Thank you! I have been looking for something like this. I have equipped the dagger manually for now, but it sometimes goes in the off hand, so it’s been messy.
---
Is there any point to copper ingots other than sell them? Got like 80 of em in my bank.
---
Hah. NT.
---
Reminds me of my first ever character. Ice mail jerkin dropped in ZF and I needed on it (I was a hunter). I wielded that proudly, but I cringe thinking back about it.
---
That is a great question to which i have to aenser sorry
---
I am aware that you often cann just brute-force-your way through the dungeon anyways.
---
Tanks usually have about 35% damage-reduction from armor and another 10% reduction on the rest from Def-Stance. Also they usually are the only ones with a big enough health-pool to fit in the biggest heals comfortably without the risk of them dying which means fewer casts and more regeneration.
---
It is definitely noticable that they are easier to heal, which helps with reducing your downtimes and thus speeding up the run. So I really don't see why you would deliberately make it more difficult for not only them but essentially yourself too.
---
I mean it can be fun if a situation gets out of control and you have to pull all the strings. But I don't want to be the one responsible for the situation getting out of control.
---
I mean, 3g is 3g...
---
Who plays in the mornings? Spoiled kiddos and that's it.

Where does this clip come from?
---
Mathematically speaking, there is only one best way to do something, but you’d have to define that something very clearly, which on practice nobody does, so you’re getting vague solutions for a vague problem.
---
you are missing out. Even if it dies down, if if it's empty in 3 months, just the journey of once again all leveling together, bonding with random strangers, that's what makes it valuable.
---
That's what you don't get anywhere else ever those last 15 years.

At least on Mograine it is

Im only there for the serotonin to hit

Nice i done a run with guildys yesterday and got the Blue staff :)!
---
It's enough to fill like 5-6 since all those 500K are not going to be playing at the same time all the time. (even DOTA with 12 million registered account only has 700K concurrent at peak) 
---
But yeah, it's enough to have 5-6 healthy servers to facilitate some play, and call Classic a "Partial success" but enough of a drop-off that saying "It was just Nostalgia, and you think you do but you don't was correct"
---
Honestly I’ve literally found zero problems with layering so far. I still see familiar faces all the time
---
It's also on the Twitch app for those of you(us) that use that for convenience sake.
---
Real talk: why does it matter? I understand the problem when it's like "look at this beautiful scenic location" shot at janky angle with the user's reflection in the screen, but when it's "look at this character name"- if it's readable, what's the issue?

I was farming quillboars last night. I felt pretty good about myself, I was pulling one at a time, barely eating. All was going well. Next thing a hunter runs by, pulls three, downs them in the time I took to kill one, /cheers me on, and runs off to massacre more groups of mobs.
---
Pretty high, around 150 + bait. It's north of strangethorn, around nesingwary's camp. So, extra value because of the pvp ganking risk. If it's unlike the private servers, you'll have schools of sagefish instead. You might want to fish these anyway so they may respawn as crates.
---
You should check the river all the way to the left and then come back down, up to the point it becomes a lake, where the goblins are.
---
Good decision :)

Dire Maul didn't exist when I started. VC was an afterthought.

I still Herb Run on Mobile. Earning Mills each week without *actually* playing.

Also AFK in the NMZ when on Classic WoW too
---
It precisely is both their problem and specifically their fault. You asinine fanbois always come up with this bs, and thinking like this is precisely why ppl were moronic enough to look at the initial server count on announcement and think “that must be all, blizzard knows best”. It is blizzards fault, and your fault specifically for being part of this pathetic fanboy culture.
---
Last priest that healed me was acting like I was insane when I asked him to stop shielding me
---
Hogger? I hardly know 'er!
---
I'm really looking forward to actually levelling with people, been solo for most of my journey because none of my friends took a liking to the game, until I found a guild, but I can't raid with them just yet.
---
Also really want to feel the challenge, I haven't been on a proper raid, I started at lvl like 80 or 90 doing Molten Core by myself and always wondered what it felt like not killing Ragnaross in a few hits and actually working together with a bunch of people!
---
Just wait till you see a mage...
---
Nope. Like the user above says, pressing Ctrl + R puts an FPS counter above the unitframes but I can't find any config in TukUI to change the UI elements themselves.
---
Well first, I don't think the honor system is in the game yet, and second that is not what I am looking for
---
It's the entire design of Classic. Low difficulty but harsh punishments
---
Lol. Why not give it a try? Or is classic too hard?
---
If you like to do instances I'd probably go for priest personally. If you want to do more questing and grinding then shaman hands down. I am thinking of making a priest alt, I can't do a lot of instances on my mage obviously, as usual tanks and healers are in shortage. That char would be doing instances mostly.
---
I have raided on shaman in BC, that was a great character, I loved it and was super sad when they castrated it and made it something completely different. I think it's a super fun, unique and lovable class.
---
I think this is vanilla?  if a party member is in a different saved instance
---
There was literally a Q to signup for a subscription. For subscription!
---
That's what I do, 29, no problem at all. Tanking is fine, damage is fine but I did buy a blue weapon at 21 (Killmaim) for 1.70 gold. Helped me a lot.
---
Will then get Whirlwind Axe at 30+, I'll see the struggle after mount time, and if It's too much I'll go AH again or pray wow gods to get a better weapon.
---
I always pat him when I run past him. :(
---
Warriors really have my sympathy, all of it. I will level an undead warrior, there's just something cool about the concept. But since I'm a coward I'm going to need a main first so I can shower my warrior with gear and utility. Anyway last night I was leveling alchemy and had some stacks of low level health potions and sta/str elixirs, I just did a */who durotar warrior* and sent some of this stuff to some of these poor people.  
---
I hope you all make it to big boys!

Yup, mem just ran out and I don't plan on picking up a bond for probably a month. Bummer
---
It's not so much that fat women feel self conscious or not recognizing that it's a joke. There's already many things that feel alienating (like.. people literally not wanting to play with you because you're a woman) so the little things do start adding up.
---
Don't sell them to vendors. Sell them in the auction house. Anyone saying vendor them is giving bad advice.

Lmao retail is a snooze fest.
---
It’s easier to remember when you learn that you want high weapon damage in your main hand! (And high weapon damage means a slow weapon in terms of dps)
---
Sinister strike, backstab and ambush all benefit greatly for having high weapon damage: 
---
Sinister strike deals weapon damage + 10/15/20
---
Backstab deals 150% of weapon damage + 20/40/60
---
Ambush deals 250% of weapon damage + 50/75/100
---
The numbers are not accurate, but that’s about the formula for weapon damage and why you want a weapon with high damage in main hand — who also is a slow weapon.
---
Yes looks like you guys had fun... but..

For real, wtf is this reply chain. I love WoW too guys, but it's a game. The dude says he loves his gf, wants to have kids, shares a lot of interest in other stuff, and her biggest crime is seeming annoyed that he's been no-lifing a game. Take a step back and reevaluate your priorities man. Breaking up is fine, but this seems like a pretty stupid reason for it.

Nice troll but too obvious

I give it a 4/10.

Well, few of my friends already quit at level 20. Most canceled their subs and aren't renewing once their play time is up. I guess we should wait by the end of September to see how things are...
---
Alright, guess some people are just like that then.
---
You can't just waltz in here all willy nilly and say things like that. It shatters their imaginery idea of their game.
---
It's still just worse than Frost for solo play though.
---
I did run Arcane up to POM when we were spam grinding SM and ZF because all I was doing was spamming arcane explosion and the instant flamestrikes were nice, but really I could have gotten by with less of an investment in arcane just to get threat reduction and then had the defensive and utility benefits from frost alongside a much better solo experience (not that I was soloing much until I finally respecced back to full frost/arcane).

As opposed to the rest of us who won't have to pay ourselves?

They will, in phase 2. I don't think you want it currently, every contested zone would turn into a giant battlefield.

&gt; The events of later expansions in retail WoW simply don't happen.
---
Pretty easy tbh. Portal stays closed. We don't go to Northrend. Burning Legion can still come (think the launch event for BFA with the invasions). More World bosses, new BGs. Tolbarad? Why not, it's there. etc.
---
Meh, personally I have no issue lvling on a "high" population server, with full knowledge that it might be completely dead down the road, and having to pay for a server transfer is something I fully expect to having to do anyway.
---
Benefits of lvling up on a lower populated server is
---
\- You can actually manage to finish quests in a reasonable time wo having to fight 200 people for mob camping
---
\- No 8h logon wait time

I guess now is my chance to become R1 on my server if any though, all the pros are invested in classicwow &gt;:)

It's not useless, plenty of people in it on my server and much more effective for groups than Trade.
---
If only brain dead 45 year olds play classic why do you want them to move back to retail.
---
Thanks for reminding me to never invite hunters in my dungeons.
---
Yeah, as /u/Minus-Celsius said, I ment 4-8 mobs after eachother, not at the same time :P Should've specified that to avoid confusion.
---
But yeah, it truly does mitigate a lot of damage, to the point where I'd even argue that warrior might be better to level than rogue, or at least on par. But that's a whole nother argument with good points either way.
---
Their point of view only works if you have self guilt. Just don’t give a fuck and their argument won’t matter. It’s made up bullshit anyway.
---
In Cata I finally bought a LCD monitor, because I could no longer read chat on my dying CRT. You can extrapolate backwards to guess what I played vanilla on.
---
Dude, im glad thats what i see now lol.
---
I might actually be able to play after work.
---
I \*accidentally\* sold two wool bags for 8s each. I meant to sell them for 8s all together but the guy misunderstood. I took his money and I feel bad.
---
Of course it matters, by that logic stealing from your friends would be fine. The hunter screwed him over, that makes him an asshole. If you feel there's nothing wrong with what the hunter did do you feel there's anything wrong with what OP did?
---
what the hell x(
---
No seriously, its impressive. I had to take res sickness in the same exact spot forget about doing the quest that was the least of my problems at that point.
---
IP is 20% chance, so faster weapons get more procs.
---
I put mine in a separate window that I only keep open if I care about groups.
---
I agree!
---
i mean the key is to use a good pet that can tank for you, not all pet in vanilla (IIRC classic is actually normalized once, so not the raw raw version) can tank properly and hold threat
---
you are supposed to use one such pet, AND watch your own aggro according (esp when lving up a new pet).
---
I started last Friday I've been online two times since then..
---
Coming home from work at around 5-6 just to sit in line for 4-5 hours yea I got other responsibilities than waiting to play a game I've paid for.....
---
Luckily I was only lvl 10 so I switched server to an only semi full server, hopefully that'll give me something for the money haha.
---
Still fucking love it when I'm in
---
it's perfectly fine to roll on gear the tank needs. what you shouldn't do is roll on things that give you a tiny stat increase while they'd be a huge boost for other players. eg. rolling on a good 2h axe as a hunter because it has 1 agi more than yours. or the opposite, rolling for a bow/gun as a warrior when the hunter needs it.
---
it's really just common sense.
---
That’s either a bug or a mistake on your side. You should always be able to pick cancelled quests back up.
---
I hate to be the one to tell you, but you can just teleport to Westfall from the barrens and run to Stormwind from there
---
No because if you read what I actually wrote, it says that they should help their group "to the best of their ability", if there's no ability there's no problem. This is not a matter of loot but the attitude of uncooperation. This to me this is no different than ninja looting. Just because I can roll on a BoE rare mace I can't use doesn't mean I should, even if I do have ability to obtain for myself by rolling for it.
---
Don't use this, player made channel, LFG is better.

Love seeing a horde mage doing aoe pulls. How shall I ruin his day this time...

Wow bro, thats life. Looks like you really have a good Time. Enjoy it and all the best for you
---
Meanwhile, I, as someone who never really liked Vanilla or TBC and only started liking the game in Wrath, decided to give Classic a try because why the hell not. To my surprise, I'm loving it. Now, if only I could decide which class I actually want to focus on leveling...
---
you know it's classic, when no achievment plopps up!
---
I would recommend everybody to roll 31/5/15 for as much versatility as possible and not having to respec. Or even 31/0/18 (with 2 points wherever you want) if you really want last stand.  
---
You will not be 100% optimized for dps or tanking but you can easily do both with that build depending on the situation, and by the time you really need to choose optimized tanking or dps, you will have enough gold to not worry about respec.
---
And it costs them nearly no time
---
Oh I totally forgot about all the spell things for h.pets
---
Also, macro  the pet auto attack to your buttons for better DPS. there is a delay on switching targets that is reduced by doing this
---
To a point I know what you feel, my fiance doesn't care about video games, she hates sitting still and going for a 15 minute walk with her means the world to her while I seriously don't see how people can enjoy "walks" as for me it's just pointless. Don't get me wrong - I'm not some fat nerd in a cave that doesn't like walking, but I think that there are other outdoor activities far more exciting. But it is how it is - she loves hiking, I love video games etc etc but the real deal is when you can make compromises and satisfy both of you, you don't have to be 100% compatibile and do the same things together 24/7. For example I both go for a weekend trip with her as well as I let her go more hardcore hike with her sister and father without me when I don't feel like it and it works both ways - she doesn't mind me playing video games when she would probably want to do something else and she lets me go for a weekend to my nerdy buddies without her etc etc. In the end what matters is that we're here for eachother 24/7 I love her and I know I can count on her as well as she knows I'm always there to support her. Maybe someday I'll get her hooked on video games or maybe someday I'll get hooked on hiking you never know, but this is just something that you work out together if hobbies is the only aspect of your life that you have differences with.

I've been begging my brother to play. No luck unfortunately, he's all about that new Call of Duty coming out soon.

Having a Shaman buddy would be amazing.

How could it "always" be dire maul if dire maul didn't exist when deadmines was out?

That's why world chat has tons of people asking for layers.
---
Issue is nobody wants to move to a low pop/ghosttown is/to-be server. The fate of each realm is basically decided in its inception as unless you have 1/3rd of a high pop realm move, the server will remain a ghosttown. And if you are on a high pop realm, why would you drop your access to a big pool of players to recruit (and classic has a significant turnover) and a healthy economy?
---
RIP Joe Rogan
---
You should be able to pick it up somewhere again. Happened to my with the druid Water-form quest. Turns out I had to speak not to the initial quest giver but the chick next to him in Moonglade. Try looking on classic.wowhead and tracking down the dude you need to talk to
---
It dropped for me in vanilla and i remember selling it for about 50g. It's probably worth even less on fresh servers. It might be worth much more when twinking enters the scene.
---
Let other people move, i am staying.
---
I did the same thing, except it was a filthy undead rogue! :)
---
We started as 5 but the last paladin had to leave, so in the end the Fellowship of the Fist only had 4 members (rip Boromir).
---
found boots of avoidance and underworld band yesterday in \~2h of grinding pirates in tanaris
---
Dude, people are working or attending school. Almost every night most servers are full or high..
---
Me and my friends started on a max pop server, we didn't like the queue and all 20 of us migrated to a low pop server. Easy.
---
Im waiting for the hype to die down a little bit to start playing, so i don't have to deal with large queues.
---
Whats confusing? You’ve taken this at 9am/10am ? Most people will be in work.
---
There’s hardly any economy yet. What % of the players do you reckon isn’t level 40 yet? Most of those people are all saving up their gold for their mount as well as selling everything that they have; supply is insane and demand is low. 
---
Also take into account the amount of gold thats in the economy. It takes time for the playerbase to build up their gold and there hasnt been any inflation for that reason yet. It will come in time.
---
Un'Goro Crater
---
Yup pick the first ranged weapon skill you drop. Helps so much in dungeons It's unvaluable. To pull patrols or speed up stuff is the group is good.
---
Luna Unit Frames, for all your UI needs.
---
A pve server, failing that group up.
---
Before Level 40 I see little point in speccing shadow.
---
As a priest I'd run a 5-X-5 build with all points except for wand and spirit-tap put into Holy.
---
You get +5% crit and +10% damage for your holy-spells and a talent that converts 25% of your spirit into Spelldamage. All that ontop of getting faster and more mana-efficient heals.
---
When I reached 40 I didn't even feel that much of an urge to spec shadow as I found my killspeed in combination with 0 downtimes while soloing as good enough.
---
In the end it would result in a 14-32-5 build for leveling which I would probably even try to keep at 60.
---
The usual build at 60 is 21-30-0 for the spirit-buff, which is certainly better for raiding but giving up Spirit Tap would honestly feel like such a loss in all other situations.
---
Oh, my bad!!
---
[This is you](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/Waluigi.png)
---
Just checked and you are right. TIL
---
&gt;	Channeled spells are handled a little differently. The five second rule starts when the spell’s channeling starts; i.e. when you pay the mana for it. The rule continues for at least five seconds, and longer if the spell is channeled for more than five seconds. For example, Mind Flay channels for 3 seconds and interrupts your regeneration for five seconds, while Tranquility channels for 10 seconds and interrupts your regeneration for the full 10 seconds.
---
That would work exactly once and you would literally be banned from the game though. 
---
I think people overestimate the amount of people that actually care about griefing streamers when they aren't streaming. 
---
You basically have like a subset of their viewbase that actually plays WoW; then you have a subset of those viewers that are actually on the server; then you have a subset of those people that are actually the same faction; then you have a subset of those that are just there to grief the streamer; then, at the very end, you have a subset of people that care about griefing them even when they aren't streaming.

Damned beakless birds. Same goes for you headless mobs I've been forced to kill!

Try limiting the FPS with v sync
---
Hunter main here. What is that yellow/orange circle thing under the “click here for loot” icon?
---
That's exactly what OP is saying
---
There is always the possibility to grind elsewhere. Skipping a couple of quests in order to avoid the most congested areas isn't a bad idea.

Personally my main funds from selling raid materials will come from selling the herbs to make those potions. Planning on spending some time just keeping tabs on herbs like black lotus farming as much of thise things as I can before layering is gone and it gets a little harder with more people.
---
At least you don't look like Elsa in frozen as a human male mage in the early manarobe levels... I tried really hard to LET IT GO.
---
But it's not stealing, the chest belongs to no one.

And no, I don't think there's anything wrong with what OP did... In isolation. I think it's kinda hypocritical to feel it's a dick move for someone to take "your" chest, but being okay with you killing other people.

Wasn't it just yesterday we had that top post about how to take screenshots? I mean, it doesn't take away from the amazing story or anything, but still.

No one expected people to quit in a week, most people gave it 6 months before numbers dropped.

These posts were dime a dozen in classic too. They're not funny, not witty, not original, and not informative.
---
Not even just AFKers. If you sit in the same general area for too long you get booted off. I'm 100% sure because one day I was just talking with friends while jumping around and got kicked off twice during that time. Never had a DC except for that.

I bought this for 22g the other day with a last minute bid on an ah post. Pretty solid investment. Looking forward to reselling it down the line.

I have weakaura but i find the version im looking for easier to keep track maybe because im always checking the health
---
Why even reply?
---
that arm position is gnna give her arthritis
---
oh! so what can i do to be as viable as possible as a hunter?
---
Burst means cooldowns. Cooldowns are in general 2 minutes.  You don't know what burst is do you?  
---
For example: 
---
Shamanan has Stormkeeper and the elemental. And another 30 seconds cooldown to generate maelstrom.  
---
Now doing Stormkeeper when you are high on Maelstrom is wasteful. Again is wasteful if the boss enters a state when you should focus adds.   
---
Hunter: They need to keep barbed shot max stack but also have Bestial Wrath quick more to this make sure don't stack on Focus. They need to keep track of a buff + move.   
---
These are 2 example of the "most easiest" classes.   
---
Tanks on the other hand are even harder. In M+ there is no "tank and spank" there are certain modiffiers to mythic(affixes) which you need to kite the mobs and kill them a certain way or wipe. Even worse you have a timer so you cannot cheese 5 hours dungeon to finish it.  
---
You never entered mythic. And that was on Legion. To be fair there were no affixes then. But it was "way harder"  
---
There are 3 potion buffs. I don't think "buffs" are a quality design since it makes you bring a certain class to raid even if that class is badly represented and no one plays it.   
---
For example monks on my server are very rare. And they bring a debuff.  
---
There is no skill on "waitting threat".
---
It was the Westfall tower quest where you had to sneak up and steal the book or something from the chest. I deleted the book i looted from the chest.
---
I seriously doubt it, could it had happened once? Maybe, but you act like its a re-occuring theme. Why would any1 care that you are a woman? If you know how to do your job who cares? Nobody thats who, and thats why im calling bullshit. Besides how do they know you are a woman?
---
It’s a figure of speech. There are more stuff he did but I’m too tired to write a text wall.
---
Well there goes a lot more into server choice than just the pvp/pve aspect.
---
there are still npc's using this old model. Not sure if in vanilla but alot of them were reused in tbc and wrath.
---
yes
---
I'm waiting for 40 to do STV.

Release Spirit.

For farming on that scale, try to convince a group that 2 mages is enough?
---
I’ve spent 6 days in queues. /played 9 hours
---
It's all about patience and dedication ! You just need to accept the fact that you will most likely wait a long time to achieve your goal, but once it's done, boo yah.
---
yeah, apparently a lot of people saw my first post and whispered her and stuff it was great. Like i said, have that big dumb and forgot to put MY bnet tag in the post sooo yeah lol
---
Mograine. I signed up 5 hours before launch.
---
It really is. However it's not as fun as hulksmash with windfury
---
FYI, the pets have better pathfinding in classic than they did in vanilla. I've noticed it handling a lot of things that would be an instant wipe in vanilla the way it would handle it in BFA. Probably came with the updated engine they're using.
---
It's good but I always preferred Axe spec, the 5% flat crit is just godsend in this world where it's hard to get gear with good stats. Now some people swear by Sword specs but I'd rather hit more reliably more often than have a small chance to 1 hit someone.
---
Can I play overwatch while staying in the queue?
---
My VW came out named Mezzgak and that's very much the kind of name I like.
---
Well yes, but it’s an upgrade this time, I swear!
---
Weirdly this is sometimes why I die while AoE grinding as a mage. For some reason, sometimes mobs that are in Africa, who I did not touch or gain aggro from will randomly run to me and leave the person they were chasing. I lvled during TBC-BFA and tried vanilla on a private server and have never experienced this before. Was this a thing in vanilla? Or is it just a classic bug?
---
This also sometimes happens when I’m just passing by, not even attacking anything or casting at all.
---
Can you really take the private server community as an estimate ? there will be a big portion of people who don't know about private servers, don't want to invest time in something that might get shut down, people who never played wow etc... This might all be people who will now play on official servers and that never appear in those private server numbers. The target group of a private server is just way smaller.
---
I tried playing on a private server once couple of years back. you could not compare it to the official experience. buggy quests, buggy mobs, some talents not working properly. almost no players and so on... that all turned me away from private servers and I am now back playing wow classic with absolute no desire to play retail.
---
Voidwalker bros! Mine's named Zag'gore

How awesome! I need to relearn to take my time with everything instead of hurrying, after so many years. To look for moments that can become special, like this one!

In online gaming a lot of people care about your gender, apparently. I'm as confused about that as you are.
---
&gt;Besides how do they know you are a woman?
---
Discord.
---
Is this Stranglethorn-Vale where it dropped for u?

Mate, I don’t need convincing. I know that yes, I could abandon my friends and play solo on a low pop sever. That isn’t the point.

The reason people go is the orbs. Really nice for selling when demand for crusader enchants goes up.
---
Not sure about specific times, but i've heard that he had anywhere between 8 to 12 hours of respawn time, didn't manage to get an accurate timer. 
---
There is also Dishu in the Barrens, although much weaker. But she can spawn cubs apparently so i might try to get that skill :D
---
That’s terrible proof. I’m not saying that classic is harder but using that as proof is wrong.
---
The guild that downed it has been practicing non stop for ages in private servers for this moment, thus it isn’t even a fair comparison.
---
Well not all people have a screen recording app.

She plays 20 hours... per year. I guess thats ok.

In case she keeps playing WoW I will make sure to get her a good setup.

I spent 5 hours in STV last night and only one guy tried to fight me. I probably met 40 of the opposite faction.
---
Without honor ingame, there is little incentive to fight and the only people who do it seem to be rogues who specifically rolled their class to pvp.
---
The one guy who did fight me last night regretted the decision after getting shatter-comboed.

He’s a total troll who has been arguing in nearly every thread with the stupidest stuff I’ve seen. Apparently hunters should ninja loot corpse maker from a shaman and hunter as well according to him lol.

In vanilla, the horde racials are generally considered stronger than alliance, at least for pve and to some extent PvP.
---
As of right now the overall balance according to the server is more horde.

How did you get this alliance rogue badge? I want one too

Soon, there will be a free movement of players between servers, Blizzard said. So a lot of players could arrive at yours.
---
Xebt
---
Can't do that while polymorphed
---
It shows how popular it is, while i dislike the the queues i'd much rather have them than a game going dead too early.   I do think however they should give all players a few days free game time because of the waiting.
---
You are an idiot. Do you even know what immersive means? It has nothing to do with how many mobs you can pull.
---
That weapon doesn't do anything for hunters. You want agility on your weapons, not strength. You also don't care about attack speed, you care about that agility and attack power. If it had stam/agi then the hunter would be all over that axe, or stam/attack power. Stam/str? Str doesn't increase your shit.
---
Ehhh not as clear cut as that. Not for leveling anyway.
---
The damage per second stat trump's both. It's ideal to have a quick offhand unless ofc you have a higher dps weapon - even if it's slow.
---
He has no honor, he is no horde of ours! We fight until blood and death!
---
what is the paladin ranged sap? if you're talking about repentance, that's been in the game since vanilla.
---
K but you're wrong
---
OBS is free
---
I doubt most people will go for the transfers, it’s usually not worth it because there’s a high chance of getting stuck on a low pop server which makes find groups difficult as hell let alone clearing raids with a guild. Blizzard should have done the smart thing and make some South American/Latin America servers in the first place.
---
Kitty specifically. Bear mostly uses it as a threat gen.
---
Medium/Low pop is &gt; 2,000 players per faction. This is more than vanilla FULL pop. Run a census addon and look yourself.

is it possible to get a resistance for that....

pls...

Strat live was one of the most commonly run dungeons at 60 from my experience. It's got the orbs, the flask recipe, the mage's 55 food book, pristine black diamonds and multiple pieces of pre-raid BiS gear (such as Diana's pearl necklace and the mask of the unforgiven). Really, really solid dungeon for making a bit of money.
---
Blood for the blood God!
---
That's true, in the art community at least it's a HUGE no-no to upload without permission from artists though. I figure the least they could do is put which subreddit they get their memes from in their bio, or at least copy the link and put it in the post body.

Some pets hold aggro far better than others. You either want a DPS pet that will hold aggro through dps'ing, or a more aoe/threaty tank like an ape.

Unless it's a leveling dungeon. Now way someone should assume I don't need leveling (DPS) gear if I heal a deadlines or a scarlet monestary group.

Aren't jokes meant to be funny or insightful? This is neither lol.

What addon do you use for the characher health and head thingy. The Stuff in top left

Sounds pretty dogshit m8 , peak stv is ganking lvl 30s as a lvl 37 and then simultaneously rage when you get ganked by lvl 44s on mounts.

Trust me. I’m really not. My free time is vastly reduced to what it was in 2005. I’m not wasting it in queues. I have a ton of other games to play with the time that I have. 
---
Plus, I can’t really miss out on an experience I’ve already had. I’ve already cleared all of this content. I already done the PvP rank grind. I was already one of the first on my server with Sulfuras and knocking the hell out of people with a big, orange hammer. It would take me hundreds of hours to try to recreate all that, bad even if I could, it wouldn’t be the same.
---
Classic is a good copy of Vanilla, but it’s still just a copy. It’s a museum exhibit, a faithful recreation, but it’ll never fully capture how it was the first time around. The sense of wonder and exploration is gone. There’s 15 years of WoWHead data that has detailed and optimized every aspect of the game. From leveling guides, to cookie cutter class builds, to boss strategies - every aspect of Classic has already been done and documented. 
---
That’s why I chuckle at “World Firsts” in Classic. Congrats! You were the first to follow a recipe and bake a cake that your Mom first made 15 years ago. No one in Classic needs to figure any of this stuff out. That is what made me love playing it in early 2005. No one knew WTF to do. I bonded with strangers because all of the sudden some gnoll named Hogger is kicking my ass and I had no idea why. When we first fought Onyxia, we learned about many whelps the hard way along with the rest of the world. Now it’s all just memes and recycled Chuck Norris jokes.
---
I’m very glad Classic is here. I’m very glad people are enjoying it and that it’s seeing a swell of popularity. But like any big wave, there’s only two good places to be: far out ahead, or long after it’s passed by. There was no way I was taking PTO from work to grind out 60 levels ahead of the pack, especially not with the extended queue times. I’m perfectly content to wait for the hype to die down and server populations to settle. The friends that I want to play with will still be there.
---
I wonder which person is most fun to be around.
---
The person who doesn't get mad and cry over non sensical things.
---
OR
---
The person who insults people for no reason.
---
I think an easy way to help is to open with a lower rank of your main abilities.
---
Only a fool sends a bank alt to collect flight paths.
---
does this work with warlock pets?
---
Man i missed the %.
---
The unit frames? Looks very similar to shadowed unit frames, I need to look into it since I'm still using default.
---
Its far from useless on skeram, it's flooded with people already.

/Cast moonfire

Abuse the AH, sell literally everything. I’m 35 on my rogue and have 133g already. Just farm materials, drop crafting professions for Two gathering professions( don’t mix mining and herbalism though, can only track one at a time)

Almost looks like a fan art of medieval!

Man that brought back some memories.

Just wait till one of them zaps your ass with lighting for 200

Most healers i run into are thicc dwarf dudes, lol.
---
I joined a low pop pvp server, wait a couple of weeks and shits get merged anyway. Or I'll just use a server transfer for $25.
---
It does put you in combat.
---
Wait so he isnt allowed to kill the same quest mobs as you?
---
Stranglethorn Vale.
---
The current cartographer addons do not work with 1.13, I just tried. And it wont be getting updated anymore so we're out of luck.
---
They change, yes, but idk about gender.
---
I always just thought the greater ones were older, so one day, maybe in about 15 years time they'll grow up
---
Harvest ALL the Stranglekelp!
---
FYI, this isn't the same engine, and it will splash the error message that was added around cata/mop if you try to use a graphics card that's too old. It's actually a much more recent engine than that even and has all the bells and whistles in it. So yah.
---
Dude I played a warrior in vanilla and I had sulfuras myself and before the AQ 1.9 patch (Normalization came in 1.10!)  Sulfuras was by far the best 2h weapon for arms warriors (in pvp but also in PVE). Outdone by arcanite reaper hahaha you probably didnt even raid back then lol Stop talking out of your ass. Point stands: normalization and stats changes came in 1.10 so for the vast majority of vanilla sulfuras was the best 2h weapon and not a "joke of an item". those pserver heroes with no clue what they are talking about...
---
I just love when someone tries to PvP abuse due to lvling and people outskill and outsmart them. Fucking loved this clip.

BTW, which addOn are you using as a debuff timer?

Take a look at this reddit post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives\_drain\_tanking\_guide\_for\_warlock\_leveling\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
In it, there's a link to a very detailed guide on drain tanking. It's what I've been using for the past 6 or so levels (respecced at 29), and it's been working pretty well for me. I can handle three mobs at once if I need to, albeit with fearing one and maybe popping a healthstone.
---
I've followed Dive's talent build exactly, since the choices he makes (and his reasoning behind it) makes sense to me. Maybe it'll work for you?
---
Yeah, but “Slow weapon better” is better than
---
Well, haste is my best stat and versatility is my worst and this one has a high haste stat and  versatility, but Crit and Mastery are my 2nd and 3rd best and have a higher total stat block than the other item.
---
Downvoted for invisibility
---
I was running SM:graveyard and the torturing poker dropped. I as tank needed it, since I was still using a sword from WC, but for whatever reason the mage also wanted it, even though it has no stats. 
---
He did the right thing, he asked if he can need it. If I didn't, we would let him have it, even though his reasoning for wanting it was somewhat frivolous (literally a lvl 5 green with +1 int would be better than this for him).
---
He passed but only because the rest of the party suggested he might be out of his mind for wanting it, not because I said i need it. Tanks don't really have any loot prio in pugs.
---
Level 15 is nothing. I think the world record leveling run had ~20% of the total time between 1-30 to give you an idea of how exponential the levels get. Your two weekends aren't entirely wasted too, chances are that you have a little money you can transfer to your new char to make lvling the second time go a lot more smoothly than starting from scratch. In all honesty you're gonna end up with a lot of alts anyways.
---
How are druids for tanking in dungeons?
---
Lots of time spent with little challenge =/= Harder.
---
Wait, someone actually said that to you, gjeez. I have a male human mage and female NE hunter and I play whatever the f I want. Also, priest aren't support. Everyone is support, can't it without tanks, dps and healers.
---
Have you seen female troll? That’s an abomination.
---
Me when I stop to see if someone fighting near a herb is going to get it. I did it one time tho without waiting and they guy kept whispering me after and finally said “I hope you only got a single leaf” well good sir...my three Plaguebloom and I had a merry time continuing the route
---
The current version of wow, not wow classsic which is 2004-2007 vanilla
---
It does work. I don't think they will ban you for using it. But once it becomes more well-known, they'll most likely fix it. Similar to how they fixed the raid-XP-exploit without punishing anyone who used it.
---
nice skill bar
---
okay, thanks very much!
---
The man is venting his frustration. "Didn't read" and "Thanks grandpa" is childish.
---
Good on you for taking the time and thought to write this out instead of doing nothing. Doing something is the difference between success and failure by default.
---
Gotta disagree. I'm 39, and have been vendoring at least as many bandages as I've used. I've been eating fish mainly; they're a few copper, while bandages cost silver, plus that you can stealth while eating, and are guaranteed not to have the debuff if you need to bandage in combat.
---
same. i called some dude's character super ugly and he never responded
---
Warrior leveling have been blast because its difficult. Every xp have to been earned. Every levels feels huge accomplishment. I had over 3 parries in a row and it was painful. So painful that I died. But I will never give up because Im a Warrior and its Warriors death for me!

I wrote a very short script, just hitting space randomly between 1 and 300 sec intervals, to not get booted during Sunday lunch. While it worked for the lunch, I did get booted eventually when afk-ing for ~1-2 hours in the afternoon.
---
Not sure if adding additional keys (directional, spells hotkeys etc.) to the script would work, and not sure if I want to risk a 6 hours queue by trying.
---
Is there an estimate somewhere of how many people play Classic right now?
---
Got mine last night.  Probs took 3 hours and was a grind but thoroughly enjoy the quest!

Or you could do that but instead recording footage on your phone if you getting on a boat/zeppelin at the last second.

My guildies and I remote access our computers to queue from work at around 1430... Firemaw has 17k in queue at prime time.
---
delete this before they try to break it again
---
Just be like the girl in my guild, act cute and complain in gchat until someone gives you the gold
---
this is the way I see it as someone who played private servers for years. I've been exclusively playing pvp/ranking and didnt have any time left over to do any kind of raids. So with dungeon/blue pvp gear I find that I prefer the axe spec the most because with that kind of gear the 5% extra crit is invaluable. You definetly dont have enough crit and damage at that point to use swords and rely on the proc. At the point when AV comes out its usually worth using TuF tho because your gear might be a bit better with a mix of pvp blues/epics that you can musterwithout raiding and because it has much higher top end dmg than whatever you could get your hands before. 
---
If you have the time to raid and/or get r12/13/14 then sword spec is the way to go for sure.
---
Im hoping with this phase timing is gonna be the first time I can relax a bit and actually get rag weapon before honor system/bg's come out. BRE or Spinal I dont care, to be honest, fuck the meta this time I would take spinal over bre because I love how it looks and getting 20 rage after you execute in bg is very underrated imo
---
&gt; in a year's time when players start complaining about dead servers Blizz might start offering free (probably paid) server transfers
---
I don't know, if they have learned their lesson, but back in the old days those free transfers would be from the overpopulated servers to the empty ones. since no one wants to play on an empty server, almost no one did transfer and the servers stayed crowded or empty.
---
The best way to deal with dwindling server population will be to take the empty servers and merge them into a decently populated one. No one loses their friends or guild mates, but everyone has a good server population to find people to play with.
---
I've checked some english servers and only PVEs are where I found alliance majority. I haven't checked all realms, but PVP mostly horde favored.
---
Same for bear tanks.
---
I upvoted the comment saying "Dump her for WoW, obviously" because it's funny as heck but it's really bad advice. I thought it was obviously a joke.
---
You have established that he did not die because he did not die! What an enormous logical feat!
---
Anathema was one of the last ones added where people didn't move because they were waiting for transfers. I don't believe it was only 100 people by any stretch of the imagination as I saw it at medium since then which would be impossible. With that said, one of the servers with a queue is moving to and the two should balance out.
---
How do I afford my mount at lvl 40 or as close as possible? I'm getting close to 40 and am nowhere near the amount needed. I've been looking it up online but all the info I found seemed to be based on pserver drop rates which doesn't seem to be the same as classic so the grinds are obsolete. Also, I heard something about getting it cheaper if you have reputation with a certain faction. It this feasable to achieve? I'm a dwarf so I guess it would be Ironforge for me but I haven't been doing much stuff around there.
---
Fun fact : during my levelling, this is the only epic world drop item i got.  As a mage.
---
I was in a group of 5 and we were doing a group quest when this little gem dropped from a random mob. The thing is, nobody in the group was able to use a shield (I think we were 2 mages, 1 warlock, and 2 priests). So we all rolled greed.... and I got it! I think I sold it for some gold at the AH.  
---
Since I was levelling during BC, those world drops were not that valuable anymore.
---
The cost is too deter people from using the service. If you don't want to spend money on a transfer you should make up your mind on what realm you want to play on beforehand.
---
Yes, Skullsplitter Troll Hunter.
---
He actually just sped it up. The slow mo run appears to be due to [run animation cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz6wv6/bringing_a_night_elf_to_stormwind_in_100_seconds/eywdx4n/)
---
You didnt get banned for being gay. You got banned for breaching the naming policy / code of conduct.
---
This is the big downside of classic, you can take everyone back to vanilla but you can't take away 15 years of WOW experience.
---
Everyone is a much much better player then they were back then and it's going to kill alot of the raiding enjoyment.
---
We're you playing on a rp server?
---
salty much ?
---
LFG / LFR is what killed the social aspect of WoW  
---
Classic is bringing the social aspect back... now go back to retail and cry in your empty server
---
It does. How many mobs you can pull is a factor of how strong you. In retail, from lvl 1, you are a literal god, the ''Champion!'' as the game likes to spam you about. One of the millions of champions lol. In vanilla, you are actually a character.
---
No one cares, you werent banned for being gay. Surely there is something more interesting about you than your sexual orientation.
---
It really wasn’t too bad, didn’t get attacked on the way, and I just sat down and had my breakfast and a cup of tea while running. I’d almost go as far as saying it was relaxing! ;)
---
Just dinged 20 as hunter and was looking more into some pets I should hunt down, only know of broken tooth for his atk speed so far. Is takk saught after by hunters as well?
---
You’re Bread-Taking!
---
 EU, Alliance, Ten Storms.

I'm a level 11 Gnome Warlock. Played the game back when just Burning Crusade was out but I haven't played it since and I haven't played MMORPGs much since. The game pretty much feels like a new game to me. Just looking for some people to maybe level with, chat to, hang out with. Just make the game a little more sociable really. I play an hour or two a day. Let me know if you wanna hang! :)
---
I believe it's 21 days. So way more than enough.
---
Oh ok thx
---
I rolled on a different type server AND a different faction! Muwhahahaha!
---
Mega cringe.
---
You are gonna have to level both in my experiance.If you find a good upgrade every few levels and it just so happens to be a gun you cant just ignore it. I doubt there is much difference in terms of drop rates for ine or the other
---
I know it's not even close to the image but when a mage wins a wand over my priest, it hurts my soul.
---
My guild legitimately never experienced that, we played high pop and raided at peak so on the rare occassion enough people didn't show, and enough of our benched were offline we couldn't do it ourselves there were always enough 50%+ Pre-raid BiS and partially raid geared players sitting in cities. 
---
Failing that we knew all the other guilds that raided at the same time as us from grabbing the world boss buffs together that we often borrowed each others benched players.
---
All in all i just think if you're wanting to experience all of WoWs raid content and are coming at the game alone and casually you're magnitudes better off playing cookie cutter than niche. If you're part of the 5% that can put in the time to form connections and make a home for themselves in a guild then do whatever.
---
only after saying it was the word gay, and what exactly is rosh ? have you heard of it before now ?
---
You’re an idiot hey. Cop it and move on, calling out homophobia and crying because you can’t have gay in your name? What are you fucking ten? Rename your character and move on.
---
No, you got 4 day ban cause you broke the rules not because of sexual orientation.
---
holy shit, i don't think it's possible for anyone to try playing the victim more than you
---
it's people like you that are a problem to all concerned parties
---
Are you a Brit based in Germany for the army?
---
Assuming from your username, your English and the pfand-looking bottles on the top.
---
If so, do you play German or English language servers? My Fiancee is German and thought it might be fun to get her playing German WoW so I can practice my language skills whilst reliving my glory days (with her)
---
If I see someone dying in battle, I'm gonna rez them.
---
But if I have no clue how long they've been lying there, if they're afk, if they are maybe 50m from their body? Nope, gonna save my time and mana.
---
Good luck! Let me know if this is actually a thing!
---
People like to take stuff from reddit all the time.
---
They should credit but meh it's the Interwebs... as long as we keep providing they'll keep taking.
---
That makes me a sad panda.
---
Ahwell let's play frisbee.
---
&gt; Every single mob fight is engaging, challenging and interesting on it’s own.
---
Erm... I really like classic too, but I wouldn't lie about something like that. :o
---
Hunter is easy to play, but I would argue it also has the longest list of big mistakes you can make (mostly related to pets). Warlocks have a simpler approach to pets, but other classes are still simpler by not having any.
---
Priest is probably the easiest to learn, but also isn't as powerful in terms of leveling.
---
Yes.
---
I have no sense of time at this moment ;-)
---
I saw a rogue wearing the bandana with helmets turned off. Like, why?
---
I guess the current amount of ppl can be a bit overwhelming especially if you're on a very crowded server.
---
Maybe try coming back in a few months ?
---
you can remove videos from recommendations, and when youtube ask "why?" answer "I'm not interested in &lt;channel name&gt;"
---
which rule in particular ?
---
There was one made earlier but I can't find it right now. Basically they took the number of servers that were full, + how many in queue for all regions.
---
IIRC they arrived at around 800 000 concurrents
---
Check http://www.wowclassicbis.com for a basic bis gear list. There may be some upgrades, but they are too expensive or rare.
---
I don't know how a common term makes someone a failure but you should probably just neck yourself.
---
This post inspired me, and we made a some new friends today.  A few players completely new to WoW who wanted to join in and hang out.
---
We capped it off with watching an onyxia attunement in stormwind and taking a jog up to darkshore.
---
I'm doing this every week now.
---
Hyperbole? Thats illegal
---
Thanks for that... forgot the sound was on and opened in the middle of the office... lmao
---
Since you appear to have omitted parts of the conversation I can't confirm that. They told you what rosh is.
---
You read it wrong. At 43% health or below you get the maximum of 30%haste
---
[Link for the lazy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/server-friends-only)
---
Mood
---
I have never seen 43% buff. I have no idea where you got that idea from. The max buff is 30%, as per the tooltip.
---
Definitely better. 1 week ago it was 25,000 wait. Much better than measly 2,500
---
Yeah, I mean this was emphasized quite strongly *before* the launch.  And I don’t accept the name argument tbh, if you really want a specific name and its taken; just put an accent on any one of the characters, it’s not the end of the world.  You won’t have the same community of people as the olden days, the people you play with on the server will know you with your new name and get used to it, very quick.  You don’t really have a big reputation to uphold (for majority of people at least, unless you were really famous or some shit). 
---
It seems they will now start with free character moves, maybe that solves your problem?
---
Also what worked for me is, I started using Chrome Remote Desktop, I have a similar working schedule so I usually just run this on my phone and get myself queued up, by the time I get home the queue is progressed quite far, I believe you need to perform an action once every half an hour to not get kicked out (though not 100%), so it’s not that big a deal to queue up at 4.30 do some actions to prevent getting kicked around 5 and start playing when you get home.
---
take all my upvotes! this is awesome!
---
You broke the naming policy, doesn't matter the reasoning behind it of your explication of why you broke it and deserve to be an exception . Broke = Ban
---
Spotted the guild owner
---
how then ?
---
what do you mean they didn't have teh original vanilla code?
---
first of all allow me to let you in on a little secret: BLIZZARD KNOWS MORE THAN YOU. by expanding this theorem we can easily speculate that this company can bend the laws of physics, can create universes snapping its fingers but also we can prove that is the best at crushing gamers dreams. top spot right there.
---
second, and this was showed in numerous threads here on r / autistic anonymous that love wow classic, 
---
&gt; THERE IS NO WAY BLIZZARD DIDN'T HAD THE ORIGINAL CODE BECAUSE - AS EXQUISITELY PROVEN WITH NO REFERENCE TO MINIMAL LOGIC - THERE IS NO WAY THEY DIDNT HAVE THE ORIGINAL CODE and also, as pointed above bliZZaRd KNowS mOre THan yoU.&lt; 
---
anyway, moving on...
---
&gt; We are talking about what IS, not what could be.
---
it shows that there was an alternative. probably BETTER alternatives than this shit bfa client. ERGO CLASSIC WITHOUT BFA CLIENT is entirely possible, which, i believe, is the point you are trying to make. i hate it that they choose to make it like this. btw fuck blizzard and those fat fucks shareholding
---
anyway, do you disagree that chronologically speaking we could not have bfa without vanilla? i may be insane but i think vanilla started it all
---
6 million goblins*
---
Unless Microsoft have changed it recently, Windows Remote Desktop doesn't work as a host on Home Edition.
---
Chrome remote desktop is a good alternative that works on any computer which can install chrome and chrome extensions.
---
You really think gayrosh is a resonable name?
---
But! You can mind soothe every mob around and loot it freely. My favorite ability!
---
get questie
---
Spec into the recommended levelling spec
---
Just because you dont find it offensive doesnt mean it isnt to someone. 
---
Youre also twisting this into something it isnt for the sake of refusing you are in the wrong. This is blizzards IP they own the rights to the game and everything in it if they say you breached the code of conducts naming policy then you have no arguement.

You can always equip wands. They don't go in the mainhand or offhand item slots, but in the ranged weapon slot (to the right).
---
This is why i launched on an RP and a RPPvP server. No queue times and I've got a solid guild built up on both.
---
Grind(humanoids for cloth and silver or elementals for materials), use ur professions and see if you can make a buck. You can also flip the AH
---
With is entirely unreasonable and the result of a poorly handled launch. Some Q's are to be expected during launch week to be sure, but these have been absolutely massive, as much as 10 hours, which no server should be afflicted by. The ones that are didn't get there just because of streamers, it got there because the total count for servers on announcement was 10 (EU). Ten. A million players easily for the region, and they thought 10 was a good initial count. It wasn't. Yes, they wanted to measure player interest and go from there, but you just don't start with what was obviously less than half the servers needed. A mere 2 was pvp, the most popular format. Go and look at those 2 pvp servers, they are absolutely fucked.

I chose warrior because i wanted to tank. The options were warrior or bear. I chose warrior. That's all.
---
&gt; I assume it because everybody wants to play with the streamers 
---
I seriously don't understand what is wrong with some people. You play a game only because you want to appear in someone "famous" screen? WTF?
---
Anyway, I have had your same experience. The first 4 days it was quite tragic with queues at 6-7PM  starting at 2 hours of wait. I used to come back home, queue and go play with the kids / prepare dinner. Usually I was in just after they were in beds.
---
Now it's down to 30-40 minutes usually on my RP-PVP server which I suppose means that the non-weird servers must have anyway quite some queue still.
---
I see where you're coming from, but I think his point is that this locl basically just tagged all the mobs instead of sharing he could've just tagged two mobs instead of 4.
---
I'm not talking about how many people I've seen, but rather how many people show on /who. Until Monday, it didn't show a single level with 50 or more players and the total number of players added up to less than 100. Does /who only show people within the layer? I doubt it since I've seen the same names in the top 20 each day.
---
A friendly druid heals all wounds. Thank you. It was the same for me, had to get the quest from some middle man, not the original guy! ALL GOOD!

I'd say that's pretty normal. I have over a day played and I'm only level 23.

Not really. Most people who work in online environments will tell you that once money is on the table market surveys, comments, replies, and shares are worthless to determine actual purchasing power.
---
You can ask your community a thousand times "If I make Product X and sell it for 15 dollars, will you buy it?" Get a million + positive responses, then when its time to actually put your money down you sell 100 of them. Games are the same.
---
Millions will tell Blizzard "Yes make classic" X wants to play, but won't do it when its time to pay up. Y only said Yes so that the people in Category Z got to play the game, and Category Z are the actual players. It's incredibly hard to make a market analysis for longevity for a thing that costs 60 dollars every 4 months

Now this is is how I would imagine Brill ... Excellent artwork and thanks for posting!!!!  I wish I had a 36x24 poster of this in.my office.
---
They didnt ban you for being gay.
---
They banned you because of an inappropriate name. You are twisting the hell out of it to make it look like you are a victim of discrimination.
---
Appreciate it bro, but I’m NA! Thank you tho!
---
rosh isn't a thing.
---
Nobody uses sim in bfa when leveling though, or at least I assume so. Likewise, i wonder if simming in classic would become a thing after a lot of players are trying to get BiS items. But stats on items are all over the place in classic so it's probably not hard to determine BiS..
---
If you are honored with ironforge you'll pay 90g. If you are also pvp rank 3 (not possible this phase) you'll pay 80g.
---
Honestly, you'll have to just grind that money. 
---
Run dungeons for an hour, how many gold did you make? Farm your profession and sell some goods for an hour, how much money did that make?
---
Compare different routes, pick one.
---
It's really normal to not have that gold available.
---
Stupid question but why are you in China
---
I mained a warrior in vanilla, and doing so again in classic brings back all the feels.
---
You will get there, and it will be that much more glorious when you do.
---
60 is the prize, but never forget your beginnings.  I never gank opposite faction warriors on the road.
---
If a game gets stale I'll just play something else, thinking you should play the same game for years is how we ended up with the infinite mount, rep, benthic, garrison shit that attempts to drag out your time for as long as possible without actually being enjoyable.
---
They are amazing.
---
This has literally nothing to do with you being gay. It has everything to do with you breaking a policy of blizzard. Stop using sexual orientation to elicit sympathy or an uprising of some description.
---
I don’t have a pc that can actually run the game
---
Me and my flatmates play together as Warrior, Shaman and Mage. Basically having a blast together, like a on old school lan party. Is there anything we can do in this setup other than just going through the quests together and grinding the mobs one by one?
---
Wait till you go to the Kodo Graveyard in Desolace, seeing that shit was depressing actually
---
This was actually really entertaining. Thank you.
---
You are doing good for someone new to the game, that speed is normal.
---

You get the feeling this isn't the first time he has pulled the victim card in a situation where it couldn't be more irellevant. It's just TOS, nothing more
---
have you heard of rosh before ? the last time it was mentioned on the internet was in 2010 on urban dictionary. Come on. I was banned for making a pun on garrosh.
---
Are you having fun?
---
yo dawg, i heard you like bags, so i bagged your bags.
---
If you are new to the game, and playing without guides, id say thats fine. Dont worry about leveling too fast. Its much better to enjoy the journey.
---
That said if you're not liking that you are slow, if you feel like you would enjoy game more if you leveled faster, then i recommend looking at what causes you to level slower:
---
* Are you taking a long time to kill mobs? As in, too much time? Are mobs constantly killing you? Are you taking too much time to recover between combat? Then you might be using low gear / bad spell rotation  / too high level areas. Look into that.
---
* Are you not sure where to go? Do you spend a lot of time running back and forth searching for quests to do? In that case Questie would help you as it shows you quest locations
---
If this is your first experience with wow, and especially vanilla, you should prioritize having fun over speed. That being said, do you have your voidwalker? This is a reward from a quest that you're warlock trainer gives you and it acts as your personal tank.  and are the quests in your quest log colored green or grey? Because that means those quests are too low level for you.
---
Yeah thats pretty normal I have about 3 more hours than you and I'm 18.
---
Anyone know a weak auras string that tracks absorb shield remaining? None of the ones I've found work for classic
---
if rosh is this terrible word howcome they use it so often ?
---
NIce try Activision. Nice try.
---
You spelt Lose* wrong.. And why don’t you post a photo of your epic buff chad body, go on? I ain’t a female or overweight but if you ain’t perfect then kindly stfu
---
In TB both trainers are right next to each other.

It’s fine haha I’m studying here and I have an internship as well so I won’t be back home for a while

Do i really need to link you the same link that GM gave you in the chat log you posted yourself?

WoW isn't a game you need high framerate. Set your monitor to 144 hz and play on 80 fps. More than enough. -- Remember, WoW is a game you play for hours on end and pushing your graphics hard to push frames it simply doesn't need to will destroy it.   
---
Higher graphics - lower fps - 144hz on the monitor. Enough

---
R/healsluts
---
Considering the fact that the robes are still bop in BfA I sincerely doubt that they will.
---
Sorry miscounted. Its a letter 2 long
---
Are you sure that you are playing classic and not retail
---
The name thing is not about reputation it’s just nice to have a name that is “rare” say what you want.
---
I’m on mograine and they didn’t warn about that server.
---
Also about the remote desktopping, that’s fine but then it takes away from the fact that I don’t personally want my pc on all day and all night. That will break it a whole lot faster.
---
I literally just have classic installed. Don't want to waste an extra 100 gigs on a game I don't play.
---
Jfc learn how to respond in one comment. I'm starting to think the actual issue is mental illness and not sexuality.
---
still only 4g at 22
---
I was thinking to stock up greens on a bank alt and sell them all as is ( or disenchanted) either Friday night or in the days before I hit 40 cuz I figure by then the prices will go up more
---
And how is China?
---
Still no sympathy to those who made characters on the servers the blizz explicitly told people not to many any more characters on because there'd be stupidly long queues.
---
This. Back in the day it used to be a big deal switching servers, if the price was lower it would be beneficial to ninja + switch realms and easily namechange to avoid notoriety. No thanks.
---
Yeah but even good organized players used to think you needed at least level 60 lol.  Or fire resist gear.
---
I had a roommate back in the day. And I would hear him laughing his ass off in his room. He had a badass warrior in TBC and he would queue up his heroic strike and such, and charge people, and they would die before he saw his swing animations. He loved how it looked as though the charge itself killed his enemies.
---
Oh wait the part I heard was about black lotus, my bad. Lotus is BOP currently right, making herbs mandatory for alchemists looking to craft raid consumables?
---
Can't get caught up logging in if you never log out, am I right?
---
I am jealous
---
You're not very clever, are you?
---
Naming your character after a established blizzard character is tasteless.
---
Having your sexuality in your name is tasteless
---
I wouldnt name my character heterodan(illidan) for instance.
---
Thats my opinion though and not the reason you got namechanged.
---
blizzard provided you with the reason to why they changed your name and it had nothing to do with the use of the word gay.
---
thats really rude man.
---
Warlock here, i don't understand it either, i only know we have a free mount at lvl40 &gt;:D
---
What's the Ravager man..?
---
I'm pretty sure the axe is the best no matter what, but I'm still tempted to take the sword as a fury.
---
That's true. You can't sell light leather or medium leather for a profit but most people, myself included, are vendoring the leather. It's crap money but it does add up.
---
:DDD
---
Aww U just made me miss moonglade
---
&gt;It's so easy they said
---
The fact that you can go in there below max level and collect epic gear that you can't even wear less than a week after the servers opened would indicate that yes, it is easy. Try to get some perspective on this.
---
last edited in 2010, its some random ass word noone has heard of. If its so offensive howcome they have a charecter called Gentle Rosh.
---
If it's written down it must be true.
---
My friends are on Firemaw and I get off work at around 6pm CET. I haven't been able to play yet due to 6 hour queues.
---
Genuinely curious, why aren't hunters supposed to roll on MAJOR weapon upgrades?
---
As a hunter I need on anything that has Agility and Stamina or Agility and Intellect. Or just Agility.
---
Im 110% sure
---
The community at large decided that, 15 years ago in Vanilla.
---
It's really simple;
---
* If you both pull the camp at the same time whoever finishes fighting first wins the chest.      
---
* If you can loot the chest without fighting the mobs by leveling them significantly and no one is fighting the camp, its yours.      
---
* If they're the other faction, you kill them and take it.  
---
* If you wait for them to pull and then run in out of combat and take the chest you stole it and you're a dick.  
---
Nothing else matters, you can see it first, you can be closer to it, but who ever puts in the work to kill the mobs guarding it wins, if you don't need to kill them that's fine but if someone else is currently killing them then you leave it.
---
You don't have to follow the rules, not everyone did back then and they did just fine but you'll find if you behave in a selfish way or in a way that makes people not trust you then you'll find more and more guilds will simply ignore your whipers to join their groups and their no dungeon finder, no cross realm, you're just stuck with being known as being a shitty person.
---
Don't ever post this again. Request a MOD for deletion.
---
Ive had no issues AFKing frivolously. But usually not more than 10 min at a time
---
Because Corpsemaker is not an upgrade.
---
Haha i feel EXACTLY the same way as an undead. Theres like something so uncanny about being horde..
---
This
---
I'd never tanked before and I wanted to try it out, just did my first RFC run last night and didn't really enjoy it, but that seems situational. 
---
Was a level 14 (dinged 15 on the 2nd pull) Troll Warrior and was in a group where everyone but the healer was in the 20s. Must have just been boosting a friend through for quests but it was kinda frustrating not knowing if I sucked or if the Rogue/Mage were deliberately pulling aggro off of me because they knew it didn't matter due to their level. Basically I got boosted through a dungeon, learned nothing and didn't have all that much fun.
---
R u paying for the sub?
---
There are two reasons to play a warrior:
---
PVP and PVE.
---
If you plan to play PVP a lot, warriors are very strong. You dont need a group for it.
---
If you plan to play PVE, warriors are terrible without a group. They shine in dungeons, raids, parties. They are terrible solo, at least at low gear levels (and you wont get higher gear levels without a group). 
---
I would really recommend picking another class (a dps, for solo-oriented gameplay) unless you really, really want a warrior.
---
It’s fine I miss home a lot but I’ve still got a long time until I go back
---
Going to try this tonight, thanks!
---
rip voidwalker threat then at later lvls?
---
If you have to wait 6h in queue to log in to delete post just to transfer it's kinda broken....
---
My week one goal was to hit 30, then 10 more levels each week until I hit 60 after a month.
---
So basically I have to do like 1.5 lvls a day, which should be no problem.
---
I understand you are gay but why do you have to advertise it, especially in your character name? It's like putting a "bully me" sign on yourself.
---
The world is not fluffy rainbow tolerant, please stop assuming so. Especially classic which had a brutal community even back in the Vanilla days lol.
---
What's really rude is accusing people of being intolerant of sexuality because instead of accepting the name change you threw a fit like a pissbaby and got yourself banned, then cried about it on here. I got my name changed and wasn't banned because I don't act like a douche.
---
Because its their game, and they set the rules. If you dont like them, you dont have to play the game.
---
Looking for that male succubus?
---
Thanks for asking tho
---
What a casual, you arent even running zulrah on one screen while doing, idk some random fucking fetch quest. Fuck me osrs spoils me for quests lmao.
---
i was debating on doing this once i maxed my main. i hope this becomes a thing in the classic community. its really interesting the life of Ult Iron mans or even hc ones
---
if the word rosh is offensive, why do they have a charecter called 'Gentle Rosh' ?
---
I've played both factions in the last 15 years but horde more. I've rolled alliance this time, but two things I don't like:
---
1. IF has way less players than in Stormwind. That is not how I remembered vanilla, because when I played the only AH was in IF.
---
2. I miss the original Orgrimmar with the bank roof. (I don't really like the retail version)
---
Ahh nice, ty i test my luck :)
---
Because its offensive bro, I'm not even gay and I find it offensive lol.
---
This shows the aoe grind spots Jokerd used during his world first 60 run:
---
[https://on-winning.com/jokerd-mage-aoe-leveling-guide-talents-spec-addons-wow-classic/](https://on-winning.com/jokerd-mage-aoe-leveling-guide-talents-spec-addons-wow-classic/)
---
I had to abandon and redo it 3x on my hunter because I was trying to tame him and people kept killing it lol
---
It would be interesting if the transfer system was adaptive. Like transfers are up until certain day or if the destination server meets a certain pop, or leave Horde transfers open while closing Alliance transfers on realms with a poor faction balance.
---
Darkshore is my favorite zone.
---
You need it just as much as the warrior needs your gun. How would you feel if every warrior needed on your guns?
---
Hopefully they manage it better this time. Mistakes are meant to be learnt from. And look, it was WoD.. So who knows what the hell was going on. Blizzard didn't.
---
I've never heard rosh as an offensive word. I've even got friends that are named rosh...
---
Wow nice troll bro A+
---
omg you guys are such snowflakes.
---
Lets find the crossdressers in WoW :D
---
Yep
---
I ment as in it being china
---
I think it's going to increase.
---
Much more accurate to literally make stuff up! You're right!
---
People not wanting to play with you because you're a woman isn't a super common occurance. Being harassed because you are one is far more common. 
---
&gt;Discord is toxic cesspool to who ever, female or not, its your choice to use it, and my choice not to.
---
Eh if you're raiding in a serious enviroment like pushing mythic, voice chat is required. I don't get on unless I have to.
---
Good to know. Now, to find out where those areas are
---
Okay thanks! Was worried there
---
Posture check!
---
plz upvote to help take down blizzard.
---
oh yeah i will. And i need to get a comfy chair
---
Well arent I lucky that I keybind pet attack and follow
---
And practice calling my pet back feign death and placing my traps in a regular rotation usually.juat to reduce my threat while in dungeon.
---
(Why do you think auto attack is a hunters best damage output? So the player can learn to manage his pet and utility)
---
And I know how to preemptive lay down a freezing trap and play around it so if I do get meleed the trap gets triggered 
---
And also play with my tracking spells
---
Now I cant credit to spells not working due to buggy game mechanics that's just the game 
---
And I dont like macros except maybe mouseover healing ones.
---
Where would that be and how do i figure out where i need to go to meet them?
---
Should have said Rosh was the Jewish usage, then you would have double the victim points
---
Could you send me both sets of macros please?
---
Thank you, sounds good!

Are you really that jealous that you can't have a single scrap of sympathy for them being griefed in any way? I don't particularly like streamers either, but come on..
---
Would involve some traveling, and traveling back for the first class quests, id just try to come to an agreement and play the same race, ALOT easier.
---
Fair enough mate, you do you but if you play Mograine throw me your char name.
---
So are you writing a letter to BLizzard , or just crying on a internet forum ?
---
Aw don’t throw us all in a bucket like that D: I never need on anything thats a large improvement for other classes over me, or I’ll ask if its okay to need for it before hand.
---
This is such bull... I have a character lvl 30 on Gehenas and started a new on Bloodfang and now I can't even transfer that lvl 30 over to Bloodfang...
---
The subscription lasts one month :)
---
You'd *love* EVE Online. The devs consider practically everything fair game.
---
I'm not not positive cause I was so young back then but I'm wondering if that's not supposed to be like that? It would make sense if you healed the person running, but it seems like even if you just heal yourself without ever entering cmb it happens.
---
Is fucking bad? No
---
Is goblin bad? No 
---
Put then together
---
classic is honestly garbage and i wouldnt play it if not for the hype.
---
Haha, that is indeed great.
---
Boomer
---
I might be thinking of the one from Cookie in Deadmines.
---
That one is a good melee weapon.
---
Yes but you can’t break it more!
---
Don't feel obligated to play the game though.
---
I did it for a quest mob boss...
---
I would totally agree with you if it's a group with friends or guildies, or if the upgrade is suitably small. But with strangers, at a level where melee weapon damage still matters for hunters? Just roll on the thing. I can guarantee you that that warrior was going to do the same if a ranged weapon that was an upgrade for him would drop too.
---
it has been for 15 years on Pservers, so 16 years shouldnt be a problem
---
Some cheeky charlie trying to sell one of these for 60g yesterday
---
This is the heart of the classic WoW.
---
I have no love for the Horde. But all warriors share the same burden. Safe travels, my friend.
---
May we meet on the field of battle, someday.
---
What i can remember in vanilla is jumping down a ledge in brs and 5 minutes later the entire instance showed up to kick our asses, with the Hunter's pet leading the charge.
---
Agreed! If I could enjoy the game the way it looks now, and add on the new models with it, that would make me so happy!
---
Its a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; videogame &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; get your shit together dude.

Damn these classic cults get more and more hillarious with each passing day.

Your spawn location is determined by your race (orc, undead, gnome, etc)

I did this once with a friend. I was undead so travelled (a long way) to Thunderbluff to meet him, as he started as a Tauren, so we could quest together from the start.

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.8.0 :
---
&gt; The mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance. Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; - Two-handed weapons: 3.3
---
&gt; - Daggers: 1.7
---
&gt; - All other one-handed weapons: 2.4 
---
&gt; As a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons. 
---
&gt; This change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons. 
---
&gt; Please also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Sinister Strike, Ambush, Backstab, Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and Overpower. 
---

Alt specific for farming gold? When my gf isn't playing, I'd like to level an alt mainly for gold purposes, thanks!
---
Also make sure you're leveling up your pets abilities at the trainer
---
Oh I don’t disagree, I just see the point they are trying to make. The first time venomstirke dropped in WC a warrior rolled on it. Luckily I still won it, but people disrespectfully rolling is definitely not exclusive to hunters.
---
We have Will of the Forsaken lol
---
I just checked it actually only was 50 days /played as in 1200 hrs actual Play time... Which is still quite insane xD

I feel like you're asking from a min-max perspective, but blacksmithing is never useless, especially this early on in a server's lifespan. All you have to do is be the guy who gets lucky and gets the Nightfall recipe, or the Lionheart Helm recipe, or maybe even be the did who gets your guild Hand of Rag by building the Sulfuron Hammer.

The professions of WoW are beautiful because they are all needed and they're all necessary. The game simply wouldn't work if there wasn't someone working hard in every single profession.

I have such massive FOMO but I’m holding out on playing right now. I only have a small time to play now that I’m older and I wanted to get things get a bit more stable before diving in again. I’m SO looking forward to going through the quests again and taking my time to relearn the game!
---
After a week? Nah. I'm going to wait a month after release to play WoW Classic. Even then, I'm sure it will be rather busy still, on all servers.
---
With how mana hungry my mage is (and how I sometimes seem to misjudge how much mana I need to kill something), you can bet your ass I'll be rolling on any wand that is an upgrade. Sorry not sorry.
---
Maybe your too low of a level? Questie can show you quests above your level in the options, doesn't mean you can accept.

You realize that's the attitude I've been arguing against this entire thread right?

right

I started a shaman/warrior only group and just rushed to overlord each time. 12 minute runs and group stayed together until everyone got it. Total 2 hours well spent but slightly low experience for higher level chars. would recommend 5/7
---
**That's it**! You are correct. I tested a shaman and it went from 1.9 to 1.33 which is a 43% buff (1.9/1.43). 
---
So yes, it's class dependent. Now it makes sense, thanks pal.

Oh, actually I am a German with a bullshit username.

I used to be in the German Army, the Bundeswehr and my first name is Sascha and people called me Sash so I came up with ArmySash.

I actually can't give any hints how to trick your fiancé into a game. My wife plays videos games once every year for a few days until she doesnt and instantly forgets that playing video games is fun. I enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Hex is not a polymorph though. Also not all classes have targetted stun. The bubble you are talking about isnt really a bubble. I mean you are right in some extent in regards to saying that classes are much more similar nowadays but its mostly the gameplay in buildup &gt; spender
---
Ys is clearly the most skilled player on your friendlist
---
The other thing I'd say in favor of hybrids and odd specs is that we're going to be seeing much shorter boss fight durations in Classic than we did in Vanilla. Suddenly a Shadow Priest might not actually OOM so badly anymore during an encounter since the fight only lasts 1-3 minutes. Back in the day you'd struggle for 5+ minutes and by the end you'd be pretty much dry.
---
This is one of my few surviving screenshots from 2005, but you can see here that on a short Patchwerk attempt I was actually the top raid DPS as a Shadow Priest...and that literally the next top 4 spots were the Warlocks I was buffing.

Run south through Silverpine, then east basically following the main road. Look up where Tarren Mill is and head there. Stay on the roads
---
Ooh... gnomeregan was the best for that...
---
In vanilla you had to be super high pvp rank to unlock the war mounts, required Commander rank on Alliance.
---
Most zones in the game have kinda wide level range to them, so say that you go to a new zone that has proper level starting quests for you, you'll eventually get to a point where the quest levels go well beyond your own character level. At that point it's best to find another zone of similar level, and return to complete the zone at later time when you have couple extra levels on you.
---
You have to do this zone splitting a lot in classic, as it's not very good idea to try to struggle your way through orange and red quests with mobs that are multiple levels higher than you are.
---
I had a dream a few nights ago that I was in a dungeon, clicker Need on an item, and someone told me I wasn’t allowed to Need it because I’m a girl and it isn’t pink.

Wait. What is “find minerals”? Is that a thing?

The 25k to 6k is probably when they increased the server limits.

the 39 mins go by way faster then 39 minutes.  plus, you load it up and then go do something for 15 mins and come back and you will almost be in.  no biggie heh
---
You're\*.

I  understand you and me myself can handle it, but most ive seen cant and get super mad when ganked and will probably do the same later and probably when theyre max lever. Myself i cant wait until level World pvp Come, war mode in retail took that away from me :( i miss looking over my shoulder for every mob im about to attack, i miss dying and running back to heal up just to fight again and the joy when your pals join your losing fight and dies with you but we all release and keep fighting. It all makes it so much better to win. So for me dying for my is just wow telling me "thats not good enough!"

Just from vague memory, I think quests in Silithus will first be available later - perhaps with the AQ phase?

you grab a snack only 20-30 mins after coming home from going out to dinner?

You can still be productive while waiting for the tank to grab aggro. For example: try to loot a nearby Serpentbloom

Hunter or mage

That flask recipe pays for your epic mount right there

Keep your gayness out of WoW please. I don't care if you like animals in real life, but it is a game and I don't want to know about it. Also if my kid will ever play I don't want him to be bombarded with gay ideas.
---
Wrong. Damage trumps in main hand. Speed in right. 
---
More damage = higher dps due to extra attacks
---
More AS = faster poison application. 
---
DPS rises as you get higher damage weapon with the same criteria.
---
Don't need things you can't equip.

If its not your graphics card, maybe its permissions or compatibility;

Go to your games folder and run it as administrator in windows 8 compatibility mode C:\\WoW\\\_classic\\Wow.exe

Get him to try arcane, arcane levelling in vanilla is good fun, end game as fire or even hybrid arcane fire for some good fun times

Almost every server is medium each morning last few days

Oh I know for a fact if I was on a mage I would roll need.
---
 It's just my rotation for my priest is 3 spells then wand to death. So you can understand the salt ha.
---
Pls gtfo.
---
What is this post and why is it here?
---
The same is going to apply for the other leathers too, heavy leather, etc. ( i dont remember the other types at the higher levels) Because as people are slowly leveling, they will keep skinning and collecting. This needs to be cycled.. Of course the only ones benefiting from this right now I believe are the ones that are already lvl60 and buy profession mats at vendor price.
---
Still better than me pulling stuff with moonfire while low on mana and when mobs came i realized i dont have mana for bear form :D few funny pulls like that in WC last night, but we made it anyway.
---
Whilst I can appreciate your frustration, Classic has a big learning curve for new and returning players which they are now adjusting to. In the earlier levels you're going to experience these sort of errors as that's the nature of the game.
---
Don't go into a dungeon with the expectation of everyone playing perfectly to make your tanking easier, shit happens.
---
It was normalised in LK.
---
Or maybe even try and contact a GM yourself
---
Except now the higher ilvl weapon is generally a better upgrade unless you manage to find something absoluetly horrendous(looking at you thunderstrike) with bad speed, worse dps, and shit stats... it's generally an upgrade after 1.8
---
You're right but the que times are the price you pay for it. Everyone wants to be on "the" server.
---
Ah cool! Better story than mine haha... My username is my old warrior's name which became my irl nickname at school...

I think she might enjoy it, she enjoys simpler games such as those on the Wii and Sims but I'd love to play WoW with her.

I hope your wife is going to stick to WoW with you!
---
I do this with the chrome extension while I'm in work. I've havnt queued since the 2nd day.
---
Yeah, I’ve been opening the game out of bnet though maybe I need to login to the bnet client
---
Well as i keep saying, classic is really fun to play, but alot of its flaws were fixed in tbc i think. But you still didnt have the dungeon finder etc which ruined the immersion a bit. Wotlk had really nice rotations though, every class was different and every spec was unique with unique gameplay
---
How long ago did you start your subscription, it takes a few hours to kick in afaik

and don't forget to close the door behind you.

In football do you score on your own team? Your faction is your team. If you disagree, you are wrong. Stop arguing with people just because your are lonely and bored. It is cringeworthy..

Virgin Kraul Bat vs Chat Greater Kraul Bat
---
Why comment on something you don’t know
---
You can always complain about rogues
---
&gt;I think that's commonly referred  to as "guilds" :P 
---
Heh you are actually right. Essentially what I'm trying to say is that I won't do set weekly raids with guilds. When I have the time for raids I will look for PUGS and that's about it. I know I'm supposed to tank and that's actually what I want to do. Tank in PvE and DPS in PvP. I just want to know if it's possible to get decent raid gear doing things like this since this isn't retail. It would be a shame to sit on my max level warrior with no means to get any gear unless you commit to raiding full time.
---
We are playing on OCE servers from China with about 160 ping. Group of foreigners. Can ping me if you’d like.
---
I believe playing on a laptop in such position might be the reason she doesn't play much :D
---
I would still say Rogue. They have many abilities, but you learn them at a slow pace while leveling, so you will have lots of time to figure things out! 
---
As for race, just pick that appeals to you the most, I wouldn't worry about which one is a few percent better in the endgame. If I had to name a race, I would say Human or Undead. Humans have  really nice starting zones (subjective), and Undeads have a very convenient racial ability in Cannibalism, which comes in handy for classes that lack healing abilities.
---
Good luck out there! :)
---
so many hunter items in one kill
---
Hey I'm new to wow and I can't decide which class to pick. I am torn between warlock druid and mage. I would like a class with a strong pvp and raid aspect. I have heard bad things about druids but the class seems fun to me and I really enjoy warlocks and mages too plz help.
---
Who the hell plays a game they don’t like “for the hype”? Why are you wasting your time doing something you don’t enjoy, in your free time?
---
Sulfuras has been pretty dope as well. At absolute peak (which was specifically Labor Day around 7:00 PM EDT) queues got to about an hour, but there's no queues for 90% of the day and most days even at peak times they're not more than 15-30 minutes.
---
I hope loads of frustrated players will move from Shazzrah since my friends don't want to move... and it's hard choice for me... friends with queues or no queues and no friends... ;(
---
People will complain about literally anything.
---
Nice and simple advice there. When I started playing around 13 years ago I had a friend who was maxed out and helped me through everything. Yes it was great to have my shadow priest levelled up quickly but I missed out on so much. So many simple things. Classic has given me a chance to start again and go along at a much slower pace. Really loving it.
---
I don't think I even ever went to Silverpine Forest as a low level priest when I originally played.
---
Aight, you’re a casual player, no need to get uppity.
---
I keep spending my earned money on repairs and spells.
---
not  illegal
---
Nah, I'm arguing because people keep insulting me for god knows what reason.

Guess they think that's easier than coming up with an argument.

---
well yeah and to alleviate that they opened more servers, is it blizzards fault players are too stupid to change servers? 
---
And if you are gonna complain then give a solution. Increasing server size is not a solution, since it will make other servers die faster. The best strategy from a top level is to let the players distribute themselves so every server can stay at a healthy population.
---
The only reasonable solution i see is to allow free transfers from full populated servers to low/medium servers. 1 way transfer and restricted only from congested to low population. They'd also have to define which servers are considered congested and which are low pop. Free transfers for all is also not a solution
---
Only for "fun" or revenge. (someone high level killed me earlier, i'll kill the next low level i see)  
---
There is no honor yet, so you see a lot of player not attacking each other, it will change soon.
---
I'm on a small realm (Nethergarde Keep EU) and I've only been in queue twice now, both times were within the first 3 days of launch. It really isn't that bad if you're not trying to go on the biggest realms on your server.
---
Completely agree, and I have had no issues at all during this launch.
---
The queues can be beat with TeamViewer anyways.
---
Hardly, constantly takes you from zone to zone, misses out some easy quests too..
---
Literally...anything...
---
I have the addon that restores the double pane with the quest list on the left and the quest description on the right. Didn't realize how much I'd miss that lol

Is it scummy to not credit? Yes. Does it change anything? Not really.
---
Actually a cool shot, shame it’s not a screenshot though.
---
thx for the response. i only do this so i can play classic more im poor
---
Yea, sorry to let you down like that :(
---
On the twitch app when you go to wow add-ons you will see a drop down menu. Select classic from there and it works perfectly 😄
---
Shiny armors ,big arsenal and crits. Want more?  It really is hard to level and if you are a good warrior you make a name in your server. Not all are meant to be.
---
use the addon questlogex
---
No that's about right. 1400 took about 15 for me yesterday on whitemane
---
Do this addons exists in twitch storage?
---
Nah it was definitely an unreachable area, it also had a tunnel that lead off the edge of the map causing me to perpetually fall and constantly dc 2 seconds after logging in, about 8 times in a row until I was finally teleported to ironforge.
---
Stop telling people how to tell people how to play their game! In all serious this back and forth is getting a bit silly now.
---
Actually on retail it would sell for decent amount of gold
---
Just hit 30 last  night. Heading to shimmering flats to grind it out there. The hardest part of classic is finding where to level imo
---
Thanks man. I feel like I keep hitting a point where quests go orange and I don’t know where to go, or that all the quests become gathering or messenger quests which feels quite crappy and slow. Maybe I just need to chill and get on with it. I’ll def give loch modan a try
---
You can just hang outside in the sun all day, tossing a ball around...

Or you could sit at your computer and do something that matters.

sad that world of warcraft seems more important that all that is going on in whe world

If your faction is your team, then why does it matter who gets the chest?

maybe your are missing a patch or something

Windows has My Games in My Documents, developers could just respect such a folder in My Pictures too.

I do too (I think everyone does hehe), and regarding winterspring grind, you are talking about winterspring frostsaber, and I think OP screenshot is not that mount but the level 40 nigthelf mount.
---
Oh is THAT why this is happening? I thought something weird was happening with this but it only happened occasionally so I never looked into it
---
This is a common misconception since it's true for lvl 60. Because of additional talents which bring up hit at lvl 60, it becomes worth investing in a faster offhand. Not the case for lower levels.

The whole "no changes" argument does hold a lot of traction for the majority of the game that's fundamental to the experience but it's random QoL stuff like this that will never get changed that annoys me
---
no, but i turned off debuffs, installed Luna unit frames, disabled everything except the target frame and debuffs.. which works as a bandaid
---
also neatpaltes works great as nameplates with debuff timers
---
The goblin mortar is quite sick if your class lack other aoe spells!

Agreed. I will not be shamed away from ganking people when I have a significant advantage whether it be due to level or circumstances.

No, you can decide yourself. https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/

I wonder if pvp to pve is possible?
---
Opening the battle net app now I’m hoping it just is an update I need that I haven’t got since I’ve not been logging in through bnet app lately
---
its for people that want to play classic for free or for people that are poor that cant pay the sub
---
Yes, for example Guidelime is one I installed from Github, but doesn’t sync with Twitch
---
Torn between a human rogue vs undead mage — kinda new but know the general gist of the game. Goal isn’t so much raiding at max level as it is doing World PvP/battlegrounds when they come out and the occasional dungeon.
---
Also, does anyone play on Kromcrush? Have some RL friends that want to play there but not sure how populated it is!

I was thinking of adding a NSFW tag :D
---
Does not having rotation at all make it better than having a 1 button rotation ? You have 4 hours.
---
Report yourself! Hah, that'd be a name change, and you can pay for that buddy ;)
---
that's the case with anything if you look at it from a relative perspective. Same with armor. Going from 10% to 11% mitigation is the same amount of damage reduced as going from 98% to 99% (extreme numbers, you can't get that much). In absolute terms it's exactly the same reduction. A 100 damage hit will be reduced by 1 damage in both cases. But relatively speaking, going from 98% to 99% is huge because it halves the incoming damage (from 2 to 1).
---
i make one post about my feelings and it gets shit on :P i hope you are proud of yourself

Thanks for responding. Stupid question - do you mean the category drop down list? Or somewhere else...

Stonespine, only queues during peak hours.

40min is the max queue I’ve seen, usually it’s sub 20 min.

You don't have to heal the warlock. They know this, and when they run out of health and mana they will drink
---
Night Elf Warrior here who (luckily) has a very loyal Druid friend. We'll see if we manage to reach the Deadmines soon...

just do corpsemaker runs and get all your members the corpemaker.
---
&gt; A Warrior has no need for that weapon 
---
This is next level stupid.  
---
Warriors normally get WW Axe around level 36 without higer levels helping him  
---
Corpsemaker can be aquired much sooner, so this is BS

Hello, 3:4 (and 4:3) is commonly used by artists to promote their work on Instagram. That platform used to only allow 1:1 (it would crop images uploaded with any other ratio). 3:4 (and 4:3) was then released to allow users to create vertical and horizontal content, while still keeping a clean viewing experience for visitors, almost exclusively using the smartphone app.
---
They got more flexible nowadays, but 3:4 ratio is still the most common ratio used by artists.

How do i get to darkshore from sw

Dusk Wood is 18 to 30

Yeah, I already had forgot that rolling for chests is actual thing and proceeded to open chest as usual in one instance. Of course stopped opening it once one of the guys said that I should roll. These things happen sometimes because of misunderstandings.
---
Yeah it's a shame, started levelling an alt on skullflame for the same reason and now I get double fucked 😂
---
Go with another player and let him aggro the mob then you can pickpocket freely
---
Gz. You completed the game
---
I think they genuinely did their best to estimate usage, I think they just didn't expect sustained interest (even a week on) to be what it has been. Even with the name reservations I think they probably put that down to hype and expected a good amount of people to log in, realise the game wasn't for them after a few hours, and log straight back into retail.
---
It's in their best interests to make sure the server populations stay at a good level for gameplay long-term for financial reasons, and it's in our best interests for long-term gameplay reasons. It was a shit-show, but a necessary one.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.

I have one day played time and I'm level 16. Got all my professions to 75, even fishing. I read quest text. I run instead of taking the gryphon sometimes to save money. And I'm loving every second of this adventure!

how do you feel more immersed by looking at what is clearly a picture of a game rather than the game by itself?
---
Work work.
---
How many fingers am I holding up? ✌️
---
To be honest last week the queue was about 12k and yesterday it was just 5k but that's due to people just giving up and picking different realm, not me tho, I've been waiting for 10years and I'm committed.
---
How is warrior damage/ability to solo compared to other classes like in end-game? Have been struggling a lot solo leveling my warrior.

There are plenty of girls out there who would share your passions. Don't let someone passive aggressive the joy out of your life.

Wanted to give this hunter on FlameLash some love.

Think this will be the last time he helps someone x)
---
I got 8 of those on my warlock while questing in Westfall.
---
0 on my rogue while questing in Westfall.
---
Both are no longer in Westfall.
---
Just feel those would go over to a warrior who could make use of them :( But as a holy paladin I probably won't use any of them? Whereas alchemy the potions are useful for myself and Guildies etc . Honestly just not sure and don't know if I will just sink a load of time money into it and not use anything I can make
---
Thanks a lot
---
Lol I tried to take icarium on my server but it was taken so I named my orc lock Gothos
---
I try to level with balance/resto (ouch, ouch, stop hitting me I know it sucks) so that I could heal better. So far only done 1 WC which was painful since I was 19 and didn't even have the 1 resurrection.
---
Horde and Alliance are at war. There is no mercy on PvP. Try /wave
---
Ive only got 3 so far a hunter that i did an elite area with and a warrior priest combo i spent 3 hours leveling with. Its about quality not quantity
---
Do you just have 2 friends or guildies? jesus youre shortsighted 
---
sure lets just go ahead and remigrate 30 people on a coin flip. Not to mention all the servers that was available was already full. So all of us should just change servers after spending 10 hours getting to lvl 8 on launch. Im not making this nearly as coherent as id like just because youre pissing me off with how stupid that wss.
---
Blame blizz for rolling out 1 server at a time like a bunch of retards.
---
This has happened to me several times, and I play a rogue. 
---
So you don’t even need to heal to get aggro. 
---
I don’t recall being like this in vanilla.
---
Yeah I don't doubt that priests use their wands more than mages do, so I get being pissed off.
---
But it's a meaningful part of leveling for mages too.
---
My friend group are spread over different servers because they joined at different times, so experienced different queues. While this will probably fix queues, it doesn't fix our problem caused by the abysmal numbers of servers at launch.
---
I'm really happy they're finally doing this to address the queues, though, but I'm still hoping for paid transfer down the line so we can finally play together. I can't make them reroll after all those hours (and vacation days!) already spent
---
Pickpocketing worked, even though I've had the key drop from him before! thank you!
---
They are, it was 17k last week. with a timer of 250 minutes. Horrible, but still enjoyable, It's the real wow classic experience.

lol.classic lgbt leftists seeking atention.if you want to be gay be gay but if you are going to openly expose your self like that in public view then expect criticism.the only reason you made that character name in the first place is because you wanted to get banned so you can make a scene and get attention.im glad leftiat offended agenta hasnt made it to my country yet.keep being offended nobody cares
---
1 str = 2 ap
---
You can tank leveling dungeons just fine in arms or fury talent setups. I'd argue arms pairs really nicely with tanking dungeons as you get tactical mastery talent which allows you to stance dance and retain rage between those swaps.
---
That's what I've been doing, and it works just fine. 0 points in prot tree so far, and haven't really had an issue as a tank either.
---
low effort advertising ...  
---
GTFO
---
There is a addon that does this, already linked in this post
---
your being more of a dick right now, so gg you played yourself
---
on top of being slightly higher dps baseline, the whirlwind effect isnt just for AoE.  It's a 3.5 speed weapon, but the whirlwind procs deal weapon damage every 3 seconds, it's a dps boost even single target.
---
When I went there first I was really thinking its respawn rate was horrendously slow and was evious of a person who just arrived, the cat spawned, he tagged and killed it, then a bit later I read the quest again "Use horn"... Oooooooohhhhhhh
---
Worst part was that it wasn't just me standing there like an idiot we were a total of 2-3 people doing it.
---
Some people don't think it be like it be, but it do.
---
because leveling a op class would be boring and i like to tank.
---
so my first toon is a tank warrior around 50+ atm 
---
my alt is going to be  a druid.. feral / tank for farming  i guess
---
Some people hate the things you like as a jealousy/power thing, and its a red flag, people.

Need three light koda leather to make a bag and he’s only one.
---
Only if ALL players have an equal chance of quitting. Which isnt true for RP realms since rpers stick around for a long time, their enjoyment of the game doesn’t completely come from pve or pvp or anything Blizzard did. It comes from their own imagination.
---
Main hand, more top dmg = more better, you get the top end dmg for every instant attack you make, more or less.
---
Off hand, more dps = more better, but if you have two equal dps weapons faster is better.
---
Do you have both retail and classic? I have suspicion it is there only if you have both
---
It the just above mods table on the right side
---
I am sure arcane is pretty ok early on. But from level 10-20 I think fire is better because your fireball is at a higher rank compared to am/fb. That is why Jokerd went for fire before speccing into frost aoe specc. I think after lvl 20 frost is better for single target (improved crit) and aoe (improved blizzard).
---
Why is it actually capped at 20?
---
I am ising Shadowed Unitframes is it possible to get a healing prediction on the party / raid frames?
---
Needed an update. Just play on a 2012 MacBook right now so just spent 35 minutes trying to do it. At least it’s smooth in game :) thanks

Yeah sorry i was thinking it was the frostsaber.

Yeah you are probably right

No one cares.  You don't have to play it if you don't want to.
---
I try to prevent this douchebaggery by playing Tauren druid. This way in bear form I can literally just sit on the chest / quest item to prevent other people from noticing / clicking it.
---
I wouldn't heal if I wasn't allowed to need on leveling gear I'm pretty sure most would be the same I'd just tell the pally "you heal then" and dps instead.
---
Dayyuuuuum
---
you killed a guy that was dancing so impressive
---
Ahhh that could be it! I’m using my travelling laptop so I’ve only installed classic on this. Problem is, twitch still shows 8.2 addons so I have no way to filter for just classic unless I look at the version - which isn’t too big of an issue tbf.
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
You didn't get banned because you're gay, you got banned because you're a toxic twat.
---
Yes. I don't know if i will be rading at high end, but im gonna lvl my char slowly and nice for sure.
---
Whats the name of the trinket addon?
---
1 per spell. And the spell has to hit something
---
I know this used to be the case, but as soon as the client wants an update it forces you to install battle.net
---
Your failure amuses me.
---
Have an upvote.
---
Frost keeps you from being a tank, which is less than ideal as a mage. At cap, if you raid, you’ll have to spec frost for MC/BWL/Ony anyways.
---
There's no honor in that - literally. I can only laugh as I keep names and I know my advantage later.
---
Winters chill frost worth it? As a talent build for gnome mage, im looking to go frost mage but not sure how to spent my points

I hope this is satirical and I'm so dumb that I missed the giving part. If not, no offense meant, but sir, you have realize the fact that this is not ours, but another world setting, in which a god does not exist. Not yours anyways.

Blizz could have done it way better, and they didnt. Everything isnt just straight line. Jesus fucking christ

"Tyrone, you silly fat bastard."
---
Hey we never know.  Lots of people out there

Str is still +melee attack power  so its not going to waste (unlike with Hunters)
---
Its the slow weapon speed that really makes this shine, it means when windfury procs its like an atomic bomb hitting your target!!
---
That's a pretty sick set-up for dungeoning, you can take down pretty well-sized mob packs with AoE pretty fast, especially if you've hit 30 so the shaman has a windfury totem. Look for maybe another mage or a warlock.
---
Incendius can only transfer to Netherwing.

No you can’t lmao, charge &amp; intercept stun you as soon as the animation begins. 
---
You clearly don’t PvP, stop.
---
Spend your money and talents points very wisely
---
So far I haven't been caught in a queue
---
I waited a couple but only because it let's me cook dinner and do stuff around the house that I need to do anyway. If I didnt have the queue I'd be too addicted to take care of this stuff.
---
Selling is the same as swapping. I am swapping money for bread everytime I go to a bakery.
---
same, I don't know what gear I had but I remember that it took me some time to even figure out what stats you really need. But I have the feeling that was the same for almost anybody and any class. the way we did dungeons back then... oh my god no real healer no real tank. for most people it was the first mmo and maybe even the first real rpg. and back when vanilla launched it was not that common to just google everything.
---
Why did you need to restart in the first place? I suggest watching madseason videos on YouTube for some good tips.
---
It sounds like you're on Firemaw (large Spanish community on there). If so, it's one of the servers named for free characters transfers in the next couple of days.
---
My advice would be maybe wait until then and then see what the population/queues end up like? If the reason you want to leave is because of the Spanish-speaking players, it might be the case that they all end up leaving for the new realm instead.
---
Mage or hunter. There’s a reason why top 10 world firsts were mostly hunters/mages. CC/Range, and in the case of the hunter a pet to tank
---
I haven't hummed the music of Orgrimmar in almost 10 years.
---
Most ppl spent far more time on the grind, or rather the journey, up to raiding, than raiding itself
---
Woops. I was right down to the fucking day. And no layering abuse either. YIKES.
---
I'm a noob when it comes to classic I started in lk but I'm having a hard time deciding between warrior or rogue. Can someone tell me the pros and cons of each so I can try to decide? I was gonna play a feral dps druid but everyone says I'll be forced to heal and I ain't about that life.
---
EVERYBODY
---
Take your time, explore,, don't feel like you have to rush to 60.
---
Read the quests, it both gives you some story so you don't feel like they are all kill x amount of mobs. Also the text tells you where to go, people often miss this in their haste.
---
what race and class do you even play ?
---
Ah fair enough. I got dc in the middle of the flight, when I logged in I fell down here and luckily survived the fall. Kinda wished I had explored it a bit more now so I'd be interested to find how to get back up there - the coordinates were 23,67.
---
Why should you start it over?
---
When you have enough gold, reset your talents following some reasonable guide. And try not spend too much for useless things (like learning on low lvl every single skill).
---
i hoped the same but they were being serious.
---
i just noped out of the conversation lol
---
My buddy doesn't seem to like playing a mage, so I don't want him to go solo on a new char.
---
r/lostredditors
---
He's 100% using hyperbole. 
---
Shaman have Hex. A spell similar to Polymorph. A Hex is a curse, Polymorph is not. Hex has a 30s CD. Polymorph has no CD. 
---
Warriors have a single target stun. (Storm Bolt), similar to Paladin's Hammer of Justice stun. Storm Bolt is a 30s CD 4s stun. You also talent for this, meaning to take this talent you give up Double Charge. Paladin's do not talent for Hammer of Justice. All specs get this stun baseline, you don't give up anything to have this. HoJ is a 6s stun on a 40s CD.
---
Paladin's had Repentance in Classic. Repentance was a 6s SAP in Classic and it's still a 6s SAP in PvP in BFA. However, Repentance lasts 1 minute outside of PVP.
---
All healers have a Res now. All healers, except for Druid's (obvious exception for Rebirth) had a Res in Classic. However, Druid's in BFA remain as the only healer with a combat Res. 
---
Summons still matter. Don't know what he's talking about. Warlocks are the only summoning class in the game. And we use this every week when forming our weekly Mythic raid group.
---
Hunter's have an ability called Aspect of the Turtle. It makes you deflect all incoming dmg for. 5s. However dots still tick on you. You only deflect incoming dmg. Previous dmg still applies. This doesn't even compare to a Paladin's immunity bubble. Paladin's bubble can also be dispelled by a Priest's Mass Dispel in PVP. A Shaman cannot purge it, however, they can Purge BOP. Aspect of the Turtle cannot be dispelled. 
---
Not everyone has a targeted stun. I hope you don't expect a Priest to stun someone. Some classes have AOE 3s stuns, like Shaman's totem stun or Demon Hunter's Chaos Nova, but those aren't targeted stuns like Hammer of Justice or a Hunter's Intimidation (only available to BM Hunter's IIRC).
---
I know this doesn't fit the BFA bad narrative, but I have to correct obvious hyperbole when I see it.
---
I am NOT a classic tank expert BUT I do have some tips that will help. First, use marker icons over targets to identify kill targets and follow ups.  Discuss them with the group at the start of the dungeon. If someone is attacking secondary targets, pulling threat, and causing you to run around and waste rage to get it back, it’s on them to deal with it after one or two mess ups.  They will learn quick after that.
---
Second, discuss threat build up time with the group. This is classic and for a lot of new tanks, they will need TIME to get threat before DPS starts going balls to the wall on the mobs. Usually 5 sec is all that is needed but you be your own judge.
---
I’ll let some full time warriors talk about abilities and rotation but these two tips will help a lot if explained to the group and followed.
---
Hopefully none. We don’t need that sort of gatekeeping like in retail
---
Plan on what you want to do in Endgame. Playing a damage dealer is fun for questing but when you go for raids you will compete with other DDs for a spot. Tanks and Healers are always sought for.
---
Elysium has world chat that is manual join. I didn’t know for a while and was wondering why no one was looking for group in trade, just give it time and people will figure it out.
---
Yeah.  More like 279 min.
---
My group picked a very busy server
---
I even help kill mobs that are about to kill someone, especially if it's a warrior. That sort of intervening doesn't happen on live servers.
---
Its retail, dont lie!
---
This is some Yogi Berra level quote.

---
The hunter rolled need on it. We went 'wtf?' and he said that he heard from his friend that daggers are good.
---
This is also on Ashbringer!
---
I usually read the quests, but I use a DBguide to show me where everything is for 80% of quests.

Just an anecdote, I have had the exact opposite experience on Krom as Horde. Alliance are ganking everywhere I go - Hillsbrad, Arathi, Wetlands, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, etc. Tomorrow I'm farming SM because I'm completely unable to quest anywhere. I'm honestly surprised that realm statistics show more Horde - either I'm on shitty layers or Alliance are WAAYYY more bloodthirsty here.
---
That was the argument actually. The argument was that these other specs were not viable. The reality is that every class has a viable damage spec.
---
oMG CRINGE BOOMER 😡 SMH MY HEAD

He's talking about Repentance. Which has been in since Vanilla. His post is just hyperbolic.

I thought about “quitting” then I jumped into a different server, bought two more accounts and now I’m running a party of three, multiboxing, ass kicking machine.

My buddy seems to be bored playing a mage, and I don't want him to level again alone. We're only 8, 9 lvl
---
Actually, the shaders classic uses are from modern wow.
---
Vanilla graphics were way more basic.
---
I dispute that glitch is synonymous with bug. In the field of fault tolerance, “bug” can describe both persistent and transient failures, whereas here, “glitch” is defined as “usually temporary [transient].”
---
To be precise, the formal definition from Oxford dictionary of “bug” in this context is:
---
**bug (n.): ** *an error in a computer program or system*
---
As you can see, transience is specifically not mentioned. 
---
The two mean entirely different things.
---
LvL 22 warrior, just feels sad. 
---
The leveling just feels way too mutch of the same, i've starting to think it was only nostalgia for me.

I'll give another class a shot, but i fear worst...

Pretty sure paid transfers didnt arrive until TBC. And until then it was free transfers from high to low, just like they have planned?

Ok.

Lvl 8-9 is about 1-2 hours. I thought you are on lvl 20+ or something :D

My advice however stays. Read some guide about talents and skills on wowhead about for your class, and do not waste your money or talentpoints. Above those just enjoy the game.

I have sometimes a bad conscience for playing all day, because my gf is not into games. A ask her often if its fine. And you know what? It's fine, she "doesn't care" and watching Netflix in the meantime. She knows this is a part of me and I'm enjoying what I am doing. If she would not, she wouldn't be the right one.

With great gear Warrior is a beast. With bad gear Warrior is a lvl 1 peasant.

Source: played Warrior in vanilla and leveling Warrior again now in Classic. It does get a little better at higher lvls, and using the Hamstring method helps.
---
If you have to restart that's no problem, the main thing is that you're enjoying the game! As mentioned above though madseason has so.e great videos that help you pick a class for classic wow. They are pretty long videos but very good and very helpful

Shit. I'm dumb. Sorry \^\^°

Ask for help or groups in general chat. This is basically what leveling will be like on a PvP server, at least until most people hit 60 and the leveling zones become less populated.

Also, if you're leveling in STV right now, maybe go somewhere else haha.

Absolutely adore it! It’s giving me a bit of a MediEvil(the ps1 version) vibe. ❤️
---
Who doesn't know about 'print screen'?
---
12% it looks like.
---
hmm but it lets everyone know you find racism funny
---
I report each and everyone of these fuckers. 
---
Some of them try in less popular locations (like the NPC house on the mountain that's on top of wailing caverns). Even if they are 'just' running against a wall, if you pay really close attention to the character running against a wall there's a 'minor' flick to one of the directions. It's barely noticeable and most people assume that 'he is just running' and there's nothing wrong.
---
I can't be bothered to do this check every time, so I just report them and let Blizzard decide whether or not is a legit AFK or is a bot/macro/scripter.
---
idk if dagger + wand is better than staff + wand
---
I had a similar experience. My first toon was a night elf hunter, and at about level 11 someone was talking outside the Darnassus bank and saying that the human zone has better quests and more stuff to train (I had no idea I could just ask a guard for directions and hadn't discovered Thottbot, so as far as I was concerned, Darnassus didn't have any trainers LOL). Me and another guy grouped with this guy and he took us to Wetlands, then we died to level ?? croc like 10 seconds after leaving Menethil. So then we waited until someone level 20+ showed up and we paid him like 5s each to escort us across.
---
This reminded me of my time leveling in redridge with a friend. He was a mage and I was a hunter. We were clearing a camp that had a chest in the center and at this level we could have used the money badly. We cleared most of the trash but eventually succumbed to death. When we came back we found our chest had been stolen by a warrior who happened to be on the same quest as us. So out of spite I spent the next 15 minutes tagging and killing all the mobs he was running towards.
---
Nah, Zandalar Tribe.
---
Repost. Shame. SHAME . Shame
---
Yeah, warrior is a long time tank and shaman is a long time healer. Mage is pretty new to the game tho.
---
Don't you have berz stance?
---
I made a shitlist of scummy players for my guild, so we know who to avoid
---
I play as a orc shaman on a pvp server. I had a pretty good setup on my talents but a old random guild told me to reset for a ele/resto build but now I find it harder to heal with my talents being all over the place. I hardly ever cast and when I do it’s usually one cast before it dies. I found just using lightning shield, the fire and earth totem and then fire nova works fine while I bash it to death with melee. I just wonder how far that’ll take me. 
---
When I do dungeons I end up being the healer and love it. I notice when I am close to low mana I just go and melee the mobs to do some dent. So I was thinking of going Deep Restoration (tank / melee / Hunter group) 0/12/39. I was wondering if this is reliable for someone who wants to be a healer but also fit into another role if needed. 
---
My first time playing wow in general so I don’t want to mess it up.
---
The problem of the paladin isn't that it's hard. It's just boring. A snorefest. At least warrior is fun and interactive with many things to do.
---
Paladin will crush you. [Unless you browse porn](https://i.imgur.com/kUiQYsi.jpg) (safe link)

So accurate. Lol
---
Theres addons for this
---
Best alliance race for a priest?
---
I have the exact same thing going, except I'm keeping it alive during parenting hours in the evening with remote desktop from my phone. Well, I try to, but often fail, and when that happens I'm left in a queue for when I actually have time to play. It's a pretty crappy circle tbh.
---
Details! has a built-in Thread meter called Tinythreat. I use it and it seems to be correct.
---
Not yet. I don’t plan on going in it at all really. But I can make macro moves that swap me to it for them
---
*angry rogue sounds*
---
I usually just run up besides them, and start spam healing myself.
---
I agree, people have really strong unreasonable biases, that is by far the biggest obstacle for hybrid specs.
---
What do we get, if suddenly the low pop server gets a queue now?
---
Because on even on prime time, our server is on High!
---
I just really hope we don't get a queue now because of this...
---
Are there some specific dungeons notable for AoE farming or perhaps specific places on the map?
---
The thing is some people have fun by ruining other's fun. I don't want those people in my group.
---
It seems, He can't read. Firstly if you gay, nobody cares. But if you name yourself anything which against the rules they'll ban you. Seems fair. I'm very sorry about the OP for being bullied, because he gay. But that's the fault of OP, biologly speaking it's not healthy to be gay. I'm not homophobic just being proud of that you're against biology seems strange.

---
Maybe it's what people think is fun that matters?
---
I wholeheartidly agree. Private Servers provided an experience far closer to vanilla than Classic has  so far.
---
I felt the same when I was around level 25-30 on my warrior too, almost quit and started over. Now I am 36 and starting to feel a little better actually. Getting an actual good weapon and learning spells like Whirlwind helps a lot with leveling a warrior. Also you can do some dungeons as a tank to blow off some steam, playing a few alts dont hurt either.
---
Was actually thinking of doing that
---
Hell, I'm a priest and even I tend to open with MB when duoing elites with a War. And I was a DPS through BC. I *know* better.

TLDR: Bad habits happen to the best and worst of us. Give us time.

---
Which quest for the bow in darn?
---
I think its dwarf, human then night elf.
---
I chose night elf because I like the appearance the most.
---
Since I don't use my main hand for attacking, I take whichever has the best stats. I always use a wand and fill the other slots with whatever is better
---
You are doing wrong comparison. Dagger + offhand + wand vs staff + wand. That is correct. And you can ommit wand. It becomes: dagger + offhand vs staff. Compare summ of stats on the left side with stats on the right side
---
The thing that would solve this is having the queue become just barely tolerable. When it does, it will vanish entirely very quickly, since people will stop trying to game it. For Firemaw at least, it's going to take a while for this to happen naturally, but it could just as well happen by Blizzard upping server caps or something similar, like the free server moves.
---
For you it is. I feel the opposite. I play for the questing, crafting, PVE part of the game. Pvp, especially unfair PvP doesnt matter one bit to me.
---
Dwarf because of the anti fear class racial buff (prevents the next fear)
---
You can indeed. Definitely compare stats
---

It´s so great to meet the people you did Ragefire with again in Scarlet Monastery.

Im a warrior and a hunter needed on my Ravager today. I beat him by 1. I would have actually exploded if he got it
---
Friendly PSA: not *all* cats have high speeds, you need to check petopia to see which creatures specifically have what speeds (For example most bats have a speed of 2.0 but a couple of lvl60 elites have a speed of 1.0)
---
Don't think SUF is a good fit for raid frames, I've been using them just for character/target back in the day. I think Grid is a better fit for this? Haven't got to a point where I need to start worrying about my addons in classic yet so idk.
---
...and queue the music:
---
 https://youtu.be/cYpz3abAk98
---
What do the buttons do? We downed the boss last night and saw the buttons on the wall. We pressed tjem and nothing happened.
---
I got no issue with any of this other than how tight that shirt is...
---
Also the only way to upgrade gear in retail is through dungeons/raids/weeklies, theres no incentive to go out there in the world to kill mobs for gear unlike classic
---
It's not really if you think about it.
---
PC gone wrong is when you try and force something upon someone. Nobody is telling anybody to change a guild name.
---
But I won't be surprised if these guys use 8chan.
---
Tell me about it. Sometimes the tank doesn't even know.
---
I've been asked to heal a lot as a shaman and I've been with quite a few groups where all the dps is tanking as well, they try to dps an add each. They don't really understand that we can pull faster if I'm only healing one guy and I don't have to drink every pull because I'm desperately trying to keep you all up.    
---
Sometimes their hearts in the right place. A mob pats in and starts smashing my face and they smack 'em. Good! Proactive! Now stop dpsing the mob because you're not gonna burn him down before the tank can get to them.
---
Alsonpalce dash before showtooltip , reddit makes the name bold

does /join lfg work too?

Not the same zone, but this reminds me of my first venture into Ashenvale on a PvP server back in 2005.  My friend and I would jump at the slightest thing.
---
This will cycle trough the list of spells. For reset it had option to set time, if no time - no reset.
---
Yeah I'm never moving servers because of the names I managed to grab. Then again, I'm on a PvE realm that peaks at High and never goes full, so the queues do not go beyond 30 min.
---
Nice, now level an alt
---
&gt; Wait how do you uninstall your daily life? Im trying I cant figure it out.
---
Heh.
---
&gt; In case you accidently delete that while trying to uninstall your daily life folder like you suggested
---
It's more about the weight of your decisions in that matter, and how you can force yourself to have that discipline or not. 
---
Also, he can uninstall the whole thing, not just classic, if it becomes problematic for him.
---
Yeah that's about what I've been seeing. 2.5-3k an hour.
---
Super relatable. But of course, worth it.
---
Yeah STV is usually horde dominant. Hillsbrad+Arathi is pretty good (there's plenty of horde in hillsbrad too but they're usually lower level).
---
You HAVE to read the quests to know what to do, there are no quest markers in classic.
---
I would go with a druid then as it has stealth, a lot of utility and is really good at solo content and casual stuff
---
Wait till someone Ninjas your raid chest since its lootable by all. Youll find out why ninjas were so well known
---
Yes, because the intention of Blizzard is to lock those values and they did.
---
People though found a "workaround" because of what is most probably an oversight on Blizzard part (that is not also blocking all possible ways you can set those values with lua scripts) so that would clearly qualify as an exploit.
---
Just did it yesterday, had no idea what I was about to get in to...
---
More casts per second = more dps. However, start with 2/5 and 3/3 precision and by then you'll have a feel for your mana management.
---
If you're going OOM all the time and hate wanding, then you might be happier putting your next points into improved crit chance, crit bonus, slows etc.
---
You gotta do what you gotta do.
---
always make a bank alt with enchanting and dis everything
---
I mean that's notoriously the most difficult class to level solo. I've been having a blast chain pulling fighting 2-3 mobs at all times as a warlock with little downtime.
---
Just turn on appear offline.

Not really. I just wanna know how the streamer guide are doing.

Void Pro, K70 and a M65, I see you're a man of culture as well.

It doesnt anymore. They added an appear offline though
---
oh man those alliance filths just do not learn. quested peacefully in STV yesterday. as I went after my business with full life, no fucks were given by this NE druid. as soon as i hit below 50% this gayelf piece of shit started attacking me. I died of course. came back to take revenge. did the same to him, not of purpose, but it was right as I regged my health. he dies. comes back with full life and his rogue friend.
---
handed out some crits with my whirlwind axe and absolutely destroyed both of them. then they ran away

all i want is to quest and pick up flowers. stop attacking me
---
You ... you where the one who mauled his wife???

Send 1G or im telling him.

---
Twitch owns Curseforge so that would make sense :P
---
Prot pallies are pretty much overall. But druids are arguably the best 5 man tanks and make excellent off tanks in a raid environment. 
---
The issue with druids is their inability to become uncrushable. This means it's impossible for them to stop "crushing blows". A crushing blow is a normal attack that does 150% damage to the target.
---
Since druids can't block or parry it is impossible for them to become uncrushable. They make up for this with their higher health pool, but it's still not ideal for them to MT.
---
Warriors have the easiest time becoming uncrushable. Pallies CAN become uncrushable, but the gear required make it extremely difficult to do so it's not even worth trying.
---
If your goal is to tank I'd avoid prot pally. So that leaves druid or warrior. Both play differently so I'd look more into the differences between them. 
---
Personally I like druids given the different roles they can fill and buffs they provide to your raid team.
---
now that I have vanish I keep getting other players killed by accident when I use it after pulling too much
---
It has a really good lighting

He played WoW in vanilla and is really good as a ret paladin. I got rid of recount in favor of Details, never did like it.

You can’t create new characters on the free transfer realms.

Anyone know what addon is being used for unit frames I use elvui but can't seem to find the setting to have character name/level in the frames. Thanks
---
You're right but that just shouldn't be the answer to simple QoL problems
---
Because we like the danger and pve servers are boring.
---
Uh. No it isnt. I dont even have 4 gold and I leave half my abilities
---
So not real Everquest. That's the point.
---
same
---
A hunter was running past me with 7 mobs chasing him, and died after a few more steps. He then proceeds to whisper me angrily, asking why I didn't heal him.
---
I had to explain to him how healing aggro works and that if I threw him the smallest heal the mobs would instantly aggro me and suddenly I would be in the situation he was in a second ago.
---
Needless to say, he didn't agree this was a legitimate argument and his own careless death was now somehow my fault.
---
I agree, I dont have the drive for that in a video game anymore lol
---
I'm a sucker for grass is always greener. If I went mage I'm sure I'd miss having the ability to heal.
---
Same haha

Thalnos guild

This is beautiful! Can't wait to see em all!
---
Their love was forbidden.
---
I chose to wait like 3 days to play so I wouldn't have to queue.
---
I play in the weekend = no queue, low pop
---
I play tuesday night = 10 min queue
---
What the frick
---
Rationalize all you want. Spending a quarter of your life playing a video game, any video game, isn't healthy.
---
i see my guildmates asking for layer invites regularly. i'm not sure if they're avoiding wpvp or grinding the hardest of cores and need a new layer for spawns. i'd rather the later. play with the intention of wpvping or please go to a pve realm.
---
Sounds about right. It was a while ago at least. I never watched him much but caught a few videos.
---
This isn't about laughing at it, I understand that there is humour to be found in racial stereotypes etc. as much as the next guy. 
---
Would you find it funny if someone had a car bumper sticker that said 'hard r'? It's hardly classic comedy.
---
Or a weak aura.
---
If you are swapping gold, how is it getting you a subscription?
---
I have a 13 hunter, 12 warlock, 12 rogue and 8 warrior.
---
I'm an altaholic.
---
Need to get my warrior to the barrens and then level each on in that order about 5 levels at a time that way any decent green warrior stuff will massively help my warrior to level up. Generally when you get a green item it's a few levels lower than you are so my warrior should always be decently geared.
---
Did this on a private server and seems to work well since warriors are so gear dependant.
---
By the light, no!
---
My friends laugh at me on discord when I start ranting about misses or parries. So many mobs I shouldn't have died to because I missed 4 times in a row.
---
Still love warrior though. I like being the beefy boy charging in first.
---
Warriors...endure. At least I took 40 last night.
---
meanwhile on other servers
---
And everyone else's 🤣
---
Macro your feign properly, you can 100% reliably trap mid combat
---
You generate a little threat by buffing. I would just stand there and let nature run its course.
---
There's a super fast way to get from IF to Menethil Harbor.
---
rogue needed on corsair's overshirt at vancleef... As a tank Im never doing a group again without masterlooter on.
---
then get a fucking job not try to ruin the game for everyone else
---
When? In Vanilla they were all over
---
Sometimes people go on auto pilot and don't think about what they are doing. No idea if that's the case here or not. However, if that is the case, which is suggested at by them wanting to trade you it's really really weird to me you would refuse to even open the trade.
---
To then go further and talk about what kind of person they are is neither here nor there. All I know for sure after reading this is that you hold grudges with seemingly no potential for forgiveness :)
---
I am torn between the exact same class/race combos! I’m just slowly leveling both at this point...
---
\&gt; in his opinion anyone who is rushing to 60 needs to stop immediately as that isn't the right way to play the game.
---
Are you feeling OK? What kind of person goes around making up things to get mad at? Are you alright?
---
After that night of 2 hours, the next bar would've been through the chart at 16 hours sleep the next day. I'm getting old.
---
What means ding? I hear it a lot
---
Gayrosh instead of garrosh.  How is this an appropriate name?
---
&gt; As BM with a good 2h weapon you can keep up with warriors in damage (non 60 ofc)
---
That is patently false. As a Warrior currently 2h tanking SM and ZF, I generally top the meters unless there’s a Mage and we pull 6+ mobs. The rest of the time, I’m roughly 2x the damage of the second best DPS.
---
Literally me xP
---
I stopped reading halfway through the third paragraph, then I scrolled down.... what the fug
---
Not everyone is a forum-scanning basement dweller, sry to dissapoint you.
---
Got this in high res??
---
This is why I love playing a rogue. If you pull that on me, I'll just vanish and get you killed.
---
That chest is mine.
---
I have given up pvp servers multiple times for the reasons you stated. 
---
Pve is way better for me. If I ever want world pvp I will run around flagged.
---
It's the Fitbit dashboard. I wear it when I sleep and it tracks everything. There's a very similar chart for the number of steps i've taken since launch too...
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
There are addons to show the vendor price and auction house price of an item. Are there also addons to show the disenchant value of a particular item so that I know if I should vendor, directly sell on AH, or disenchant?
---
I'm pretty sure everything aside from possibly some named mobs gets turned female. Certainly they don't have a hidden gender "stat"; if one Ice Claw Bear shows up as female, they all will.
---
those random hunger checks really get you, better stock up with food at the start of a run.
---
LMAO
---
who cares
---
I didn't know that, what's the reasoning?
---
I'm leveling a warlock and should I just pump points into aff until I can respec and get 3/3 into the improved voidwalker(not sure what the name of the talent is)? Or will my voidwalker have no problem holding aggro 10-60?
---
As a warrior I need this.
---
Okay people refusing to group with you while leveling because you are a ret paladin are stupid, 100% agree.
---
Cant blame anyone for refusing to play with the wheelchair specs at 60 tho.
---
Not one soul said it was going to die on arrival, the discussion always was if it going to last years or die in a few months because it was all just nostalgia and hype
---
Pesto
---
Thank you my dude this will help a lot! Never played classic but really enjoying it so far and this will help to keep some of the more touchy tanks happy!
---
Me and my friend went to do this quest. I use my horn, spawn the lion and immediately a hunter jumps from nearby bushes, instantly tags it, kills it and runs away. He says "sorry, my got stolen as well!". God knows how many people were stuck in that chain, but luckily my friend also had a horn, so we broke the cycle.
---
No, I'm saying what's the point in not putting in effort. It'll make things easier when you actually need to do anything related to taking a screenshot, it's quicker, and it makes the content better.
---
If anything, I regret sleeping so much on the Saturday (31st)
---
Every high lvl that has spotted me in stealth has just waved and been about their business. 
---
Upstanding group of chaps on rattlegore.
---
Im 100% sure you did play ALOT tho :P
---
I had a chest stealer in Elwynn (I was fighting the last Murloc that guarded it)...but he actually apologized lol.
---
jesus fuck i could feel my beta levels rising reading this post. just uninstall you boomer
---
Difference being, you don't actually need to sim it. It's simple enough, and the weights change little enough, that you can easily do it by hand.
---
I always lie down in one of the coffins at the Undercity’s inn.

Not sure who you were, random person who laid down beside me on Yojamba server, but thank you for ensuring I wasn't alone.

---
Just fyi its only the handful of most populated servers with queues like this. I havent waited in a queue since launch because Westfall is just barely not full
---
Ninja'ing resources should toggle players into FFA mode lol
---
Tailoring is required for Mage and Warlock for raiding.  Pre-raid BiS chest for warlock is a BoP robe made by tailoring and the second best is a BoE robe made by tailoring.  Plus there are several slots of pre-raid BiS for warlocks which can come from tailoring.  When ZG comes out there will be a 3-piece set which is BiS and will require 300 tailoring to enable the set bonus.
---
While levelling you also have the Shadoweave set for warlock which lasts from level 44 until you can make the Felcloth set.
---
Zandalar tribe too. Highest queue i've seen after the weekend was 30 people... Took 8 seconds.
---
ehh
---
/cast Pick Pocket
---
/cast Cheap Shot
---
etc. Its just if they resist pickpocket or so might hit you out of stealth before you using the opener
---
How do you people have this kind of time.
---
Saeed, is that you?
---
I watched a bit of him recently. He’s not as bad as I expected and the above review is very accurate. He’s basically the geek loner who made it big, and is fairly tolerant of abuse by his fans in a jocular manner. He’s quite good at filling dead time with reaction shots and watching videos and commenting on them. He’s good at avoiding “dead air” which puts him ahead of 99% of other streamers.
---
True... but I still will do it!
---
Yesterday, half my group quit in gnomeregan after blaming my pet for aggroing half the dungeon. I was waiting together with a rogue near the endboss  for the others to make a corpse run (the healer managed to get killed by mines again). I wasn't even in combat and my pet, the rogue and I watched them getting slaughtered by the horde of troggs they aggroed by carelessly jumping down the hole near the entrance. The salt was real. At least I made a new rogue friend after we managed to get almost all quests done by ourselves :D
---
Transfers get priority of names, people get I think it was 24 hours to transfer to a new realm before new chars can be made
---
I personally am not a huge fan of my demon names.
---
Imp: Rupham. Sounds like rum ham or rump ham.
---
VW: Graz'zazt. How do you have a z before and after the apostrophe. It just feels wrong.
---
Succubus: Jhorlith (this one I'm the most upset about) just sounds like a dude name tbh. Not very seductive and just feels thematically off. Sounds like an elder scrolls Nord name.
---
Felhunter: Jhuumyn. This is actually the only one I really like. Sounds like a demon name. It kinda reminds me of juni from spykids sometimes tho.
---
Didn't feel like I lucked out in this lottery but such is life. Gotta love em the same.
---
What is mcp
---
What is the most powerfull class in battlegrounds? Geared in epics? and which one geared in just blues?

---
Hunter rolled need on a shadowfang drop in my sfk group.  Fortunately, the warrior won it, but everyone else in the group had the same question for the hunter.
---
this, i love to not have the questmobs shown on map. to read questtexts. to have frustrating classquests, but with a reward that 100% makes up for it! i love that bit of unbalancedness, where you can pick up an item so op that you wont replace it in 30 levels. i love that the top guys took almost 6 days playtime to get 60 (i got 60 back then after playing wow for a damn year, because i loved playing the world and not just grinding levels)
---
lolwut? YOU DIED. All "claims" are null and void at that point. You're just a toxic idiot.
---
Same, when I did DM over the weekend I was lucky to win Cookie's Stirring Rod and I do more DPS by putting Agony/Corruption on a target and wanding it to death than casting shadow bolts.
---
Basically when I pull it goes SB/Corrupt/Agony/Wand until dead.
---
Wow ok so basically, walk this tight rope or get kicked FOREVER and NOBODY will EVER talk to you again - your life is OVER!
---
Nothing personnel kid.
---
You're vastly overestimating how well people remember you, how big/small communities are, and you're advocating a very strange policy of ONE STRIKE YOU'RE OUT rhetorics.
---
Surprised to see bigglesworth.   Queue times on that server have significantly dropped already.   Last night my  queue was 10 minutes. I don't see a lot of people transferring on that one.
---
Frost. It is the most time- and mana efficient spec for leveling due to shatter.
---
You can run a single target build, easy and works even when areas are contested via PVP.
---
Or an AoE build, a bit more complicated and only works in specific areas. Also dependent on the amount of players in your zone.
---
My first ever time playing I picked an Undead and found out that you could buy a raptor mount (Trolls) in Kalimdor so I tried swimming all the way there from the beach north of Brill. When I discovered Fatigue was a thing I figured I could just corpse run, resurrect, and get a little further than last time. My dreams were shattered when I found out Fatigue affected you in ghost form as well :')
---
That’s my situation with Skeran. We have one East coast server, anytime I try to log in between 3pm and 9pm I get a que of 2 hours max 40 mins min. I’ve gotten most playtime when I log in in the morning before work.
---
Because guys are lame or because she was so annoying it was worth the gold to get her to stfu? Either way, well played to her.
---
I’m going to try moaning constantly about a holiday to Barbados until my work colleagues club together and get me a 2 week trip.
---
Eh there’s a difference between getting ganked, getting camped, and having fun on a pvp server. I don’t personally love the pvp aspect of leveling in low zones where it’s tough enough to just get through 2 mobs without dying. But once characters get strong in the 40s and 50s it’s all worth it. 
---
I think you’re allowed to complain about someone 20 levels higher than you killing you while you’re just trying to quest. The fun of pvp servers is that you can get in a pvp fight at any time - getting one shot by people that shouldn’t be in that zone isn’t really a fight.
---
The good ppl outnumber the bad ones so just accept they are there like in real life. No big deal.
---
Dance party (continue on page 26).. turned into a massacre :)
---
The part I don’t get is how everyone was so excited about Classic so we could get back to the enjoyable leveling that promoted grouping and socializing....and then speed rush to level 60.
---
Quit bitching holy cow. Just use an add on or live with it.
---
Lol why not? You want something specific thst changes something slightly that others dont care about? Do it yourself
---
Thirteen.
---
u wanted classic, right? so stfu :D
---
I got ganked by 3 horde in STV. I got revenge by dotting them all up on a quest boss and watching them die and I knew it was one of the farthest GY walks. Wouldn't have done it if I didn't get ganked lol. So satisfying! They had to clear the whole area out again.
---
I'm a WoW newbie and rolling a Warrior. What's that you're saying about Ravager?
---
I remade lvl 2 Warlocks 26 times till I got my old mains Imp name, Jubtik.
---
cyan
---
you might be on to something there
---
It is that good though. You have been playing for a week, if you don't like your class you can just reroll. If you don't like your professions, just try new ones. It seems to me you have no put enough time into this game to understand the strengths of your class or these professions. Classic is a slow walk my friend, you gotta work hard to make it to the end.
---
Me too thanks
---
I don't care that much what's going on on lvl 60 I know I'm not gonna raid or be gladitor or something like that I just want to have fun lvlin alone or in the group
---
I'm afraid that if I pick a shaman or priest I won't have fun playing alone because they are a bit slower
---
&gt; get her a proper PC please. Makes me cringe people playing games on laptops.
---
I haven't played on a PC in like 10 years. I prefer the mobility of the laptop, allowing me to freely game outside in the garden, in the bed, sofa etc. Basically anywhere that's comfortable. I guess it is relevant to mention that I need to be accommodating with a sick wife that works at home. 
---
Hasn't stopped me from doing well in any game I set my sight on though. Could I perhaps be more efficient on a PC? I doubt it when it comes to a game like Classic WoW.
---
This, and shitting on people like OilEndsYouEnd :D
---
Any tips for leveling in general? Did you grind a lot? Do any dungeons?
---
You mentioned the two pitfalls and seem ok with them so Warrior seems like a good fit.
---
At least I'll be getting XP there unlike him.
---
Or trying to.
---
So because it's a pvp game and youre meant to fight all the other players for stuff, why would you not roll need on everything? Like you only stand to benefit by rolling need on everything right? It's better to need and loot random greens from dungeon to fill up your empty bag spaces and vendor then to greed/pass and leave those bag slots empty right?
---
This is why when setting up my groups to farm this I'm using master looter and calling reserves on it. I'm a tank which helps. I just won't invite hunters, warriors or shaman to reduce the salt.
---
take druid and u will feel special forever
---
NOCHANGES
---
his the ceo now.
---
I rolled a Shaman and I’m enjoying it a lot so far (level 15) playing solo or in groups. I like the self reliance and hybrid toolkit but I’m of course playing an Enhance focused build. I picked up an Enh Shaman towards the end of Legion after maxing out my Monk and DH and loved it in that expac too. 
---
However, I’m worried I might not be very effective/get passed over for group content once I get up in the 30s-40s and above, especially if I don’t focus on my healing talents and don’t even want to heal. Think I’ll any problem getting into PUGs for high level dungeons and eventually Guild raid groups for DPS?
---
Also anyone know off hand how Shamans faired in TBC? I’ve heard they got completely gutted and ignored somewhere down the line but I don’t remember when. I kind of don’t care about other classes until DKs come out (I started WoW in Lich and my first serious character was a DK) but I don’t want to put a ridiculous amount of time into a Shaman if I’m going to regret it for a whole expac.
---
If you are in it for the race you're late and should have done previous research. At this point I'd recommend to just play whatever you like. I know if I ever roll a prot warrior it will be to spend most of my time in instances, perhaps it will be one of the many alts that I will only play with rested xp.
---
If you like the role and want to do it at 60 as well you may as well go and do instances but if you have a particularly bad group they take an eternity, so xp will fluctuate more because you're not fully in control over the xp...
---
For enemy castbar I don't know, I play a mage and just got counterspell and I will just use it on known abilities (you get a couple of casts on you you'll know afterwards what they cast and how bad is it).
---
For gear swap my method was simply to keep all off gear on bottom of my bag and click through the whole 'set' to change, it takes a few seconds and you only need to do it once in a while so it's perhaps less important...
---
Absolutely agreed.
---
I was annoyed when people who preferred WotLK were called wRatHbaBieS. No. Just no. The raiding grind of Classic and BC was not really funny.
---
Blizz released figures for how many players actually got anywhere in Naxx. IIRC that was less than one percent. We always felt like failures because we didn't participate in the tank-sniping required for 4 Horsemen(the stupidest raid encounter ever). Turns out, we were in an illustrious group even if we had no chance of ever clearing that wing.
---
I just broke my neck looking at this pic.
---
I just hit 26 last night and im still having fun
---
"very long dungeon run" aka Gnomer is a huge pain in the ass to navigate.
---
No, that was jewelcrafting. Enchanting has always been in vanilla.
---
for real though, its a pain to find the quest you want
---
You should quit tbh
---
Not at all but his question is kinda muddied by it. Those levels can easily be done in under two hours. By all means play how you want, mess around, have fun but don't track your time if your faffing around.
---
Uhhh ... You sell that shit, not equip it lmao
---
Lol, he is the President of Blizzard
---
My new schedule: Wake up at 3am to beat the queues, play for a few hours before work, come home, eat, go to bed around 8pm.
---
at least, until the queues are gone. Kind of nice being up before the sun though, gotta be honest.
---
How are people playing with stock UI? *cringe*
---
As an enhancement shaman, I don't invite hunters to my rfk groups for the reason.
---
Shift click when forming a group is your friend.
---
I don't have the heart to steal it from someone else.
---
I like a good race tho, when you both know you are both running for it.
---
But if they are taking it, get attacked in the process, I'm not stealing.
---
Except if they're trying to remove layers before they release content they need to figure out how to lower the high population realms by literally TEN TIMES or we're going to get day long queues
---
There is tradeskillmaster that shows it, just tried yesterday. Although for now AH prices are bad and fluctuating there is no clear economy yet so not sure how helpful it is.
---
There isn’t
---
Same mate :(

Sat here as we speak having a beer.

Wait... Hunter tank? Seems like a bad idea. Reroll to an actual tank class? Yes.
---
oh, damn. lol 😂
---
Yeah, it could be seen as toxic. But there was no requirement for this dude to join your Group. Maybe he plays solo. He seen you guys were messing around and probably figured you didnt care about the quest too much. 
---
Honestly dont really think this poor lone player did anything wrong.
---
whats the first scene
---
y'all out here with cool demon names while my voidwalker is named fucking konnar
---
What are you basing that off of? Most people I’ve ever talked to think 60 is the best part (although levelling is fun too).
---
You're right about talents, but you'll probably feel differently about professions later on.
---
You're a part of the problem there dude =/ If you die, you die. If he caused your  death just to steal, that'd be another thing. Don't be  toxic.
---
I tried that but it doesn’t work for me. I’m a tank and spam dungeons to level, so I can never really find the time to swap windows to click a few actions in RS when I’m constantly trying to tab/sunder mobs in the dungeons.
---
Imagine there were no layers 🎶
---
And no sharding, too 🎶
---
Imagine all the people 🎶
---
Waiting in a queue 🎶
---
Bastards do this for quest items too....
---
Biggle basically same way. At first hit queues, they upgraded servers and now it's typically a 30min wait during prime, but I've yet to be in a queue more than 10min in which I just go make coffee or w/e. Extremely pleased I didn't get baited into "being on the most popular because other servers will be dead" nonsense.
---
nobody, thats the natural thought progress i would say.
---
Like here you can learn professions. Then i think i can get cool stuff by doing them because thatst the point of crafting stuff isnt it?
---
Thunder Lizards =/= Kodos
---
Been there, done that.
---
But I've changed and for some reason I cannot bring myself to be the aggressor. I don't know what the deal is. Maybe it's because I know how frustrating it can be for the victim, how long the corpserun is, etc.
---
I have no problem fighting back and I do tend to intentionally put myself in positions where they will attack me first.
---
Honestly I’ve never had an issue with getting the money by 40. On private servers I’ll AH greens that have desirable stats. I didn’t touch the AH this time around, though. I picked up skinning for 20 levels and dropped for Alch. It was a huge waste do not suggest, because it’s a money sink to learn recipes with no returns (I didn’t touch AH).
---
I did farm the mats required for Whirlwind Axe at L38 and sold them to a guy for 8g, which saved my ass.
---
I saw a video about the spirit thing, apparently spirit originally made your weapon procs proc more often so was a primary stat for rogues. When they changed how the stat worked they just never got round to changing the itemisation
---
Back in Vanilla I had a guild mate who was a NE rogue with engineering. His favorite thing was to hide on the zeppelin or ships and then mind control people with the mind control cap and throw them off during the trip.
---
I’m assuming that we all know that is a fake post and are just laughing because it’s a long gag, right? 
---
An actual “Reverend” would know a) there is no faith called “the church of God”, b) would know the term “Reverend” is a style and not a title bestowed by a church, and c) would know to always capitalize Church when referring to their proper name of their faith, like so “I’m Father Bowen of the Catholic Church”.
---
Anyway, that’s just the crap from the first paragraph. Low effort troll imo.

I think the messenger quests give pretty decent money for the level, so they're worth it.
---
But at that level, check out Loch Modan and Darkshore if you haven't been to either yet. (And in another level or 2, try to get a Deadmines group for those tasty dungeon quests)
---
I never looked at any guide during classic and ended up doing fine as priest in raids. You'll do plenty of dungeons where you can learn the ropes of the class. Just read up on the major don'ts (like PW: shield warrior/druid) and the 5 sec rule, and you'll do already better than a lot of other priests.
---
Why shouldn't it be the answer?
---
Does the Horde not know we have our own?
---
I'm just going to keep an open stable slot so I can tame what I need in order to learn what I need.  But I don't need to keep him stabled.  I can just use the empty slot to find/train skills as I level up.
---
Look at me. I'm your healer now.

And we said nay, we are but men. rock ONNNNNNN HONNNNN HOOOOOOOWHOOOOA WAAJAAAIIIIAAA
---
You just don't need to sim  your Character in Classic becouse DPS checks are Piss easy. If the game was tuned around a midmaxed player like Retail is you would also have to sim constantly.
---
No. Get this garbage outta here
---
People that started classic with the intent of going all the way will stay, but I think it's fair to assume that many people just want to see what the hype is about and reaching 60 seems like a reasonable milestone to go for.
---
I didn't give advice, but I assume you inferred (read: made up) advice from my tone. 
---
Have a good one my dude! Enjoy classic.
---
lol? its my observation so far and its the truth like it or not.
---
Me Lacking information doesnt make the game better.
---
(Herod) Trying to do the Warrior quest in Stonetalon, saw (and died to) a combined 20 Horde players, met only 1 friendly Alliance. I could barely kill 1 mob before getting jumped on by 3-4 people. And the run backs to the corpse were unpleasant, to say the least.
---
Best part was asking in general if anyone could help and getting "dude just change layers lmao"
---
Sure it is but youre right to be able to effectively aoe you have to be able to claim lots of mobs. Currently im far enough ahead of the pack theres usually only 20ish people in the same zone as me prime time.
---
There's a spear that drops off the mobs either side of him that has tonnes of agility, would of been much better for him.
---
This is serious shit. My realm still has 5k+ queues even though it was in the second wave of realm releases. With layering, this could mean that the realm is 3-5x overpopulated, and free realm transfers ain't gonna solve it.
---
Rip in peace phase 2?
---
My wife falls asleep around 9:30pm every night, so when I come to bed after playing wow she will barely wake up and when she asks what time it is I always say 10:30pm regardless of the actual time....
---
apparently not, everybody tells me that it will change with 60 and that i lack knowledge to judge it
---
Yeah. Wasted close to two hours going for bite.
---
At least I got ferocious howl out of the deal. That's a bonus round. Unfortunately Bor is a boar and can't use it... but he's grabbing and holding threat better than ever using charge, growl and bite.
---
What about our little level 20 boys? What should we farm
---
Get auctioneer, one bag, and classic codex addons. Your life will be soo much easier. Just remember to enable auto sell feature of auctioneer for Grey items. This will save you soooooo much time when vendoring
---
Are you using any shaders ? :D
---
Coming up on level 40 now Pepega
---
It is a default channel, it's suggested in the chat settings and sanctioned by Blizzard (has no controls like gen, trade, and the defense channels), people just don't join it automatically and most people don't bother exploring the UI.
---
Get with the meta brah
---
You need to tell him to research and figure out what he wants to play. There are so many videos on youtube on this topic. If he is just saying "i dunno what i want to play" but isnt interested in researching or any suggestions, he maybe just isn't that into the game.
---
I will never look at wow the same
---
This is rookienumbers! :P
---
everyone wants DA KARMA MAN in troll voice
---
Do you really expect to be lots of people at lvl 60 after just one week????
---
It's not so bad now. 40 min to an hour for me. Was way worse the first 3-4 days.
---
Razorgore always has a 2k+ queue at peak hours, so it's far from 'dead'
---
People are starting to realize their first choice is their desired roll.  I know a lot of folks that chose Warlock at first on Herod have been rerolling as Mages for the one button spam.
---
The amount of people that don't know that Strenght is good for melee weaving is astounding (I get that they may not have prio for it, but they can use it effectively if they're a good hunter.)
---
The streamers sequestered themselves, this is people wanting to play with their friends and blizzard massively underestimating hype for classic.
---
An orc shaman healing WC?
---
You're talking to an undead rogue..
---
Especially when they run off round a corner
---
People really hatin’ on them redragon keyboards these days
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
Not if the mob is already aggro'd to something else, and the threat from the fear doesnt deaggro it.
---
This is too late. I already abandoned my lvl 8 on the most populated server and started over /s
---
&gt; Retail Wow tried to change this and look at what happened to professions
---
so professions are as useless as they are in retail. Outside of a few items for late game they dont offer anything.
---
its bad to use them during leveling up because all the items you craft before the endgame are literally worse than drops and items you can buy.
---
It is probably too late for you, but don't buy spells you don't need.
---
Wut? I just downloaded it three days ago, so I figure it would be the latest version....
---
Not caring is the cool guy way right? Just because it doesnt affect you doesnt mean its the same for everyone else.   
---
Why not just be a decent person if it doesnt matter to you?
---
How does this look so much like a screenshot but also obviously not a screenshot
---
Stop it with the cellphone screen shots! ... Oh. Never mind.
---
My biggest concern now is that people have no clue about faction ratio.
---
Would be nice if they announced what faction they prefer transfering for balanced gameplay
---
Well if you look at his post history....this post now makes sense lol
---
Im close to the level 40 mark as well.
---
They are the enemy. Anything you can do to slow their progress is worth doing. A dead lowbie means they will be high level later to gank your faction.
---
And barrens chat!
---
Wow, if only Blizz hard people like you developing their game.... that would be crazy awesome!
---
Why play that over bear?
---
apologies mate
---
Act like a shitty person and people will treat you like one. It’s really simple. Go ahead and call people “non-sensical” after being a dick to them and see how far it gets you in the community. Complain about people being “non sensical” all you like. Won’t change the fact that you’re wrong in the eyes of societal norms and basic decency. Have fun figuring it out the hard way.
---
I have for awhile,I think it started when bfa launched. I haven't noticed anything graphic wise having issues.
---
Damn that's a shame duo leveling with someone so close as a brother is the best shit
---
Such a good boy!
---
&gt; So because it's a pvp game and youre meant to fight all the other players for stuff, 
---
No, but it means you shouldn't cry if people do fight you for them.
---
&gt; why would you not roll need on everything?
---
Are you unable to tell the difference between random people and people you've chosen to group with?
---
use it while it lasts,
---
they will remove it within a few weeks i guese, you will have no problem
---
shame there is a text in the bottom, i would like it as wallpaper :(
---
If a mage is going to quit because he has to cast a spell he is just looking for an excuse to quit or is a drama pony. In either case the best course of action is to wish them the best, make a new friends that share your interest and keep the complaining and drama offline where it belongs. Good luck, there are tons of people that want to play out there.
---
How tf could you know if he's waited 10 years or not?
---
Following because I need to know as well. 20 is too short
---
You got me.
---
I had hearthstone in Sentinel Hill already. Took less than half an hour, and it saved A LOT of time when I grinded for the Big Iron Fishing Rod.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla and don’t regret, one of my fondest memories is doing (and helping others do) the epic bow/staff/quiver quest but it was from MC iirc.
---
I once took the hammer and have been shamed for it ever since. Forgive Lord, but I can't unsee that stupid axe as a shuriken nailed to a stick.
---
Yea me too. But ive worked around it. I que around 4, 4:30 pm remotly from work and i get right on when i get home.
---
I know lol... Stuff like this, as well as the whole "blacklisting" mentality, it really shows me that WoW is bringing out some of the worst aspects of human nature.
---
Like, not saying the anonymity of retail is better, but these people need to realize it's just a game. Meanwhile someone tags a quest NPC before you and they want to declare someone excommunicated from the server. I just find it kind of pathetic tbh. It's like they were never properly socialized and want to ostracize people from a video game the way they suffered IRL.
---
Or maybe I'm just projecting. But it's spiteful behavior and it's sad to witness.
---
Polymorph the cat
---
Problem solved
---
I don't really mind the downtime. It's mainly the idea of fury warrior that's attractive to me. But honestly, the mana cost of spells gets ridiculous later on as a paladin. Downranking helps but if you pop off a big rank 5 holy light it's almost half of your mana gone, which means drinking. Also, if you run out of mana during a fight its painful just sitting and watching auto attacks, even with Verigans fist.
---
Okay, well we "knew" northrend existed, but could get there and no maps showed it in classic/BC - cataclysm had that area under the ocean we had not seen before. The islands in legion and BfA we knew about but couldn't get to or see on a map.
---
Alright maybe a dick move from him and I'm not condoning it but let's look at your reaction options
---
1) post a large rant on Reddit about it
---
2) wait 5 minutes and do the quest again 
---
Seems like you have expended way more energy and effort by pursuing option 1 
---
Can guarantee that something like this will happen to every single person who plays classic at some point or another.
---
It's much faster and much less damage, that agi won't remotely make up for that damage loss.
---
Some of us are still waiting for the queues to die down before we **even start**...
---
I've been testing out Paladin or Priest on a low pop server because I can't decide which one I want to play in a party as a healer with my friends playing Druid &amp; Rogue.
---
Any tips? Ideas? I'm leaning towards Paladin because plate armour + shield + aoe tanking + free mount. Downside is the solo combat is BORING auto-attacks.
---
Doesn't seem fair! We tipped a warrior to tank just to wipe to his asspulls, and I have to save the day and should pay others for it BUHHH
---
 /s
---
oh shit, that's genius. I'll just toss a quick rejuv next time.
---
flamelash FTW, though I am alliance there too, don't gank me please :P
---
Pvp is fine. Pvppppp is not so fine.
---
I wouldn’t know. Probably a good chunk of this subreddit has probably never played boa. I’m not sure what your expecting, because professions in vanilla are more for the community with a few pieces for yourself.
---
Yes, you should roll a warrior and sell your tanking services if there is a market for it.
---
If you are serious about tanking as a hunter, give it a few tries before asking for money, because you're 100% going to die very horribly on the first AoE pack or boss.
---
Me and my friends are on Kromcrush. I think the population is perfect. It's high enough that we have a short queue (about 30 minutes) during peak hours but otherwise you can get in no problem. There's also tons of people in game. Definitely not a dead server. 
---
As for your class picks, rogue does give you an advantage in WPvP because of stealth, you can pick your battles. Ever since I started in BC I mained druid and whenever I play something else I really miss the stealth.
---
I literally gave you an example. Do you pick on one thing you seem to know and then just attack?
---
Learn more about the game and then have your opinion. Or don’t and quit the game. We literally don’t care.
---
You realize that pre-raid BiS chest for Warlock is crafted from Tailoring... far from "useless".
---
Warlock, that sweet fiery mount bro
---
Just hit lv15 warrior. How do I tank effictively for RFC? Is there particular equipment i should have, skill rotations or skills in general that i should get (or spam)
---
there is no difference, BfA values don't fluctuate wildly either, unless it's something like haste breakpoint, which is no different than experise/hit breakpoints.
---
where do you think someone came up with those numbers? he simmed it. so now we have  general guildeline for pre-raid gear stats. 
---
you know what we also have? the same damn thing in BfA. guides often have either "vers \~ haste &gt; crit &gt; mastery = agi" or more like "vers = 1, haste = 0.97, crit = 0.9, mastery 0.7, agi 0.7" and its basically just an arithmetic excersize aswell.
---
it has an internal timer most likely, if someone buys it it will take 30min or so to restock, (i dont know the timer, might me more)
---
it should also be there after a server restart
---
Because you aren't using any add-ons?
---
Upvoted for "book of grudges" and "dwarven way" XD
---
No, people *CLAIM* I'm wrong because their arbitrarily dictated rules  require that.
---
Only on the unit frames. If you target the mob it doesn’t make your debuffs shine or any bigger in the debuff list like it does in retail. I will try to remember to post a screenshot when I get home today. 
---
However, it doesn’t sound like this addon is what you’re looking for.
---
Shhhh, don't want everyone knowing! 
---
It's been great so far not worrying about queues, even if it has meant not playing on my preferred server (Mograine).
---
If you want to be a healer topping meters don't go druid, you are there for the battle ress and innervate
---
With the release of BfA, they updated their mininum system requirements a bit, and some older graphics hardware dropped to the "no longer supported" list (especially some Macs were dropped). And Classic is built ontop of the same software.
---
While it may still work (which it apparently does), Blizz will no longer provide support if it stops working.
---
I think many coupled think about breaking up, don't actually end up doing it and then end up being happy for the rest of their lives (or at least a long time). It's possible. Just be certain I haven't yet decided what to do yet, however I took the last 4 hours to spend quality time with her, so that's that.
---
in case you dont want to restart you friend wont take that long to catch up, and going solo isnt bad in the beginning. you could push your professions/farm while he does the levling for 2 hours, then you could provide items/mats/gold for the both of you.
---
It's definitely not against the TOS. Is it ethical? Probably not. If it gets widespread it will probably be removed, because this seems very unintentional.
---
How do you go from a realm called Bigglesworth to a realm called Anathema? XD
---
Regarding TBC Shamans - Resto and Ele were pretty good if I recall in TBC. I don't think Enhance got gutted, but I really never saw it played much.
---
As for Vanilla - most people will want you to go Resto, no getting around that so be prepared for pushback. It is the same for all the other "healing" hybrid specs when it comes to Vanilla. However shamans are one of the best utility classes in the game, regardless of spec. You'll still be able to get pugs, and you will probably be able to find a guild that will take you along so don't fret. Just not likely to be doing any world firsts / part of a hardcore guild.
---
Yah well like I said, I'm not in a rush. So I'm definitely not interested in the race aspect. I just wanted to join friends. Class and role isn't a problem. I haven't had any bad groups yet though.
---
Yeah I was looking for a way to swap in combat quickly. I understand how to do it manually.
---
So a 1050 ti is considered old now? Damn
---
What a relief.
---
Hold up, I thougth if I started a group, all the loot belonged to me.
---
Or is it only when it comes to chest the one who starts deserves all of it?
---
I dont think its a stretch to imagine that they will eventually. if blizzard wants to keep making money off this content for the maximum amount of time the answer is going to be sequential content unlocking and classic ladder resets.
---
it's fixed go updated your addons.
---
This my friend is why second monitors exist! You can also have your phone on the table and use that
---
Go to the subreddit page and search for flair
---
rofl smart boy
---
endgame professions being better than professions during leveling wont change that professions during leveling suck as they do in retail
---
Is this lorti ui?
---
That's infuriating.
---
it gets an update everyday, also try to use the comand /reload every now and then, because after multible quests questie might make mistakes and /reload fixis it
---
Get a turtle and a warlock friend, you guys will be fine if you’re careful.
---
Warrior. I was in dps role at the moment but tank dungeons too.
---
Messenger quests often send you to other areas and start other chains or open locations. If you don't feel like doing them ok, but then there's your missing xp. I had yesterday someone asking around where to quest it turns out they skipped a lot of crossroads for some reason - skip a quest or two once in a while if you feel like it but it's always good to shoot for clearing an area of quests before you leave, unless they get too hard (in which case you should return a couple levels later to finish them).
---
I've never played an mmo where tradeskills actually help you whilst levelling up. It just never works that way. Your profession is there for later on, to make some gold and help with alt levelling. 
---
As for the talents, idk enough about them. But I guess it depends what you pick and how you play.
---
I think it is a fair question. WoW peaked in subs around WOTLK. I reckon there's a lot of people playing Vanilla who are hoping it will continue on through til Wrath. Blizzard have said they are open to the idea based on community feedback.
---
At least you aren't playing on a realm named Finkle.
---
Which validates all of the points against voting in content. You say it's the best, what if others dont agree? 
---
What if classic+ players think LFG/LFR , flying mounts, or mounts at level 20 are the best updates to the game? 
---
People have this fantasy that you can have a classic+ where only the additions they agree with and keep the "spirit of classic" will make it past votes. In reality, over time itll mostly be updates to just make the game "convenient" (aka retail).
---
Nothing is ever this guys fault.
---
That is the rare, all organic, quest helper.  Not as efficient as a purely digital based program, but 100% more interactive!  Also great for cuddling!
---
Cute kitty!
---
:D
---
I thought the loot window can be "avoided" through the autoloot mechanic that was introduced later in the game and was not active in vanilla by default. And is pickpocket really on a global cd?
---
I play on razorgore, wanna meet up in STV? I'm all...horde
---
Night time should be darker than it is now currently in Classic :/
---
Lol stared at the ceiling for an hour then went and tanked DM to take my mind off of things, works great
---
Fire shield is not available until level 20
---
"we waited".
---
Kirtonos here, on Alliance side we also have &lt;Fat Girls Lag IRL&gt; and &lt;Chubbies Lag IRL&gt;
---
Can you explain your key bindings here? They don't make any sense to me
---
Its my own laptop. Work in maritime industry. And I work by myself mostly. Its been slow mostly the last week, giving me plenty of time to play even during work hours
---
I use the twitch desktop app 4 my add-ons. You see updates 4 your add-ons and can install them all by 1 click. I take a look in there before every login.
---
Imagone being new to the game not knowing the rules yet and someone like you doesn’t bother explaining it.
---
Seriously you people make yourself look like the assholes here you do realize that right. It’s a fucking chest.
---
Yup. Just farmed mine day before yesterday. Brought friends from retail to help and only invited rogues, casters and druids lol
---
Aw I was hoping to play with friends but they're limiting moves to specific servers. Though I wasn't expecting anything until paid transfers are available anyway.
---
Probably for the better. Soloing that escort quest as a warrior is... A challenge.
---
When I did it I found myself on the last ambush literally on 1 digit HP against a mob with 40% HP. Then he hit me...
---
And I dodged.
---
For me to auto &amp; execute him. Then stand still for 10 seconds waiting for my bandage debuff to wear off, then bandage, all the while the escort mob was fighting for its fucking life against the last mob.
---
10/10 would suffer again.
---
I may or may not have let the tank die on purpose because I was drinking, and they ran off and weren't in line of sight anymore...
---
Eh, one of the core values of my marriage os that my wife and i enjoy enough of the same things that im never really in OPs position. If thats something he would rather have (not about wow exactly but about whatever hes really into), this may be him noticing/seeing that.
---
Simply put if you arent happy woth X
---
Lol stared at the ceiling for an hour then tanked DM for an hour to take my mind off of things. Works great!
---
I only remember doing one grp quest in silver it was the kill rot hide 24elite boss which I found a grp for in the castle thingy
---
I really can't see this working. It'll reduce the queues but they'll still exist. The realms are extremely overpopulated.
---
I mean if you think professions are useless in BFA I don't know what to tell you. Professions are valuable in BFA and essential in Classic... probably relatively stronger than any other expansion.
---
Alchemy and Enchanting in particular would never be that strong again.
---
Right, but if they had anticipated doing so would eventually lead to a reducing a player to something as asinine as a raider io score I don’t think anyone would have reported a thing. That behavior is in large part at the root of why people want to play classic in the first place.

Level to 60 killing wild boars!
---
Life achievement right here, mate.
---
Coming friday Im off for 2 weeks, not sure if I'll make it to 60 though
---
I started playing on Thursday I believe? and found the lowest pop server I could (high). Never seen a queue yet. If it's a server you need to stay on because of friends I understand, it will be like this for a week or two but pretty much every release was like this, first wave gets to 60 then perhaps a week and a lot of people will be quitting. Any minute now :D "luckily" I have no friends to play with they all grew old and quit for good.
---
Lol there are like 8 servers that are full during the day and 3 of them have 2-4 hour q. Ya such dead.
---
If you don’t think altruism plays an important role in furthering your own self interest, you’re simply ignorant. Go actually read up on some evolutionary biology before spouting nonsense. We’re social animals. You play as a member of a group, or you play as a lone wolf. You’re free to reap the rewards of being the wolf, but you’ll reap the consequences too.
---
They ate those poor footmen
---
I get that, I replied to somebody else replying to this comment. I'm not trying to argue, I just find it silly to base your Vanilla class over something that's not confirmed at all. Vanilla will last 12+ months surely? Just pick the class you want to play in Vanilla and if anything else gets confirmed then change your plans? 
---
Picking a class because they might release a new expac is a bit silly if you hate dislike playing it/want to play something else in Vanilla.
---
oh you do, a lot. Look how angry they get, insulting even
---
Asserting dominance I see.
---
I'm not too worried about being slightly gimped by playing fury. Like you said, it's highly dependant on gear so I think I'll stick to fury and just make sure I'm using relevant weapons. Thanks for the reply :)
---
(Nixon voice) Arooo!
---
i think you are to negativ
---
also, even if its 10%, maybe 25,000 people are online and the queue is 3,000 long, getting rid of 2,500 would be a realy big help
---
also the new server will get people from other servers to after 1 day.
---
and btw, old servers would only hold 3-5k players so if it was an older server it would be full again :P
---
and additionaly, the ones switching wount be turists and most likly will stick to the game
---
Thank you that is very helpful
---
I am honestly surprised, that no world first contender adjusted to a more efficient sleep schedule. Humans can be fully functional with only 2 hours per sleep each day, when the sleep is split up over the day. See uberman cycle for example (20min nap every 4 hours).
---
You can sell enchantments mate.  You advertise in trade, and when someone whispers you, they bring the item do a trade and you enchant it from the trade window.  It's janky, and the reason why vellums became a thing.  But that is the way to do it in classic.
---
I dont get why people hate so much. Some people would rather share their experiences then fuck with software they dont understand
---
Priest early game with a wand are monsters :P
---
twitch app can track your addons and update them easily
---
PVE server. But I quest with PVP on to try and spice it up a lot. But it mostly just ends in getti g griefed and turn it back off.
---
I would just look up old videos on how it was done in the past
---
If you do this to your own faction you’re a bit of a dick.
---
I'm not racing to 60, i'm just trying to keep up with the friends that have more time than i do
---
I've definitely sat in 8+ hour queues the first week. I haven't had tons of time to play this week so far but when I did hop on the queues were no where near as bad. Herod btw
---
I'm in the same situation. It is frustrating that I won't be able to unite my characters on a single realm.
---
It does? Bloody hell, this explains so much...
---
How? Thought they went back to their zone was taken too far out
---
Alliance are so cringe
---
Truedat, has tusks tho right?
---
Druids got polearms some time later (cats?) So not impossible the person thought they could use them here as well
---
&gt; Idk man hearing a 30+ year old man refer to his computer as battle station is just fucking weird.
---
And I find it weird when someone pedantically complains about a choice of designation/word whilst showing absolutely no regard for grammar whatsoever. To each his own. 
---
&gt; Bullying needs to be brought back into schools
---
Only someone privileged enough to not have experienced it properly would even consider kidding about such a thing. Absolutely distasteful.
---
It is. I moved off Herod due to the first 4 nights wait of 18k, 25k, 11k and 10k. My rl friends stuck it out and remote logged in early. Also didn’t want to leave progress behind, which I get. 
---
Now they’re talking about jumping ship with the transfers. If they just left on Friday, they would have already caught their current levels or more.
---
Its great here.  Med pop till around 7pm est, then it goes to High.  Have never seen a queue
---
Inb4 someone takes your name on the new server before you can transfer and you're forced to change your name
---
Who could have thought I'd get so much hate from so many kids... almost feels good lol
---
Again, in what way is it NOT fast to get to 40 in a little over a week and still afford a mount?
---
Throw on a shield, use defensive stance. Heroic strike grants extra threat so use that to keep aggro, thunder clap can be useful for multiple mobs. Taunt things that you can't get with just a hit or two.
---
Typically you want to have a tank set and a dps set while leveling, but you don't really have that option yet. Use any stam gear you have lying around for more hp.
---
5 hour sleep on a gaming binge is ez.
---
Sure. But time spent =/= harder.
---
I Simply installed the addon pack from [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3tWBfLWZEM)
---
Classic. Retail is pure dogshit.
---
Was this thousand needles?
---
M+ BRD. Heh. With a tight 5 hour timer.
---
I've had several people attempt to gank me on my shaman (some successfully) but more often than not, i realize theyre attacking me and turn around and windfury their health from 100% to about 25% between WF and lightning shield. Its really funny watching would be gankers come to the realization that when a shaman is lucky, theyre toast. Its good fun.
---
Shaman what now? I don't think you quite recall how every warrior just needs every blue shield despite the +int and +spirit on it. "oh, it's got higher armour than my current shield"
---
Blizzard created the initial problem by releasing to few servers, but now it's players creating their own problem by refusing to transfer.
---
Thanks. I just hate healing in this game because it really seems like you spend all your time and mana babysitting bad Warriors while they pull too much, at least when pugging.
---
what the other two said, twich app everyday before login in
---
Venomstrike is an amazing MH for rogues though?
---
Damn, my state doesn't have basements. I knew there was something I forgot to do when I was 15...
---
I thought this was going in a whole other direction
---
The worlds and mob population are the fire marshal. On some full reasons you can easily spend an hour waiting on respawns to be able to kill 6 measly mobs. Imagine if there were two-three times as many people online at once.

If only there weren't a hundred channels all chopping his stream into clips.
---
Hydraxian here. I doubt it will be dead, the people who rolled here rolled here for RP, and this is their only choice.
---
I haven't had a queue, not even at launch, and the world is lively and great. I don't see the problem.
---
The way I see it, and sorry if I'm a douche here, people DECIDE to sit in a queue. It's a choice. End of story.
---
But now with free transfers, your friends might agree to reroll?
---
If I were to level quickly I would use a full leveling spec and perhaps look up some guides or use work time to google info on where to quest etc. ;) minimizing downtime helps quite a lot, it all adds up, do some quests go and hand them in together, do your traveling quests when you have to travel to get new skills anyway etc. No shortcuts, but efficiency makes a lot of a difference. I spend several hours for a level but then I stop to chant and didn't care about optimal leveling this time because I have no one to play with anyway... (*sad face)
---
Ahh yes, shared subscription with BFA, how dare they?
---
My fiancée plays PUBG with me on Xbox, however her first game she played with me hardcore was Diablo 3, so I showed her last night that WoW classic is basically Diablo.....hoping to get her on board!
---
Aww you poor thing. Did nobody tell you about the instant quest text in the interface settings?
---
What are you on about?
---
In a group, you should be using party loot unless otherwise agreed. When it comes to chests, you should all /roll and the highest number gets the chest.
---
Of course you don't share mob loot with other players when not grouped, but it is social etiquette to let the person who fought for the chest, claim its reward.
---
well people want Resto druids in raids, so if you are okay with healing, go druid.
---
If not, Rogue all the way.
---
Remember, respeccing isn't very easy in Vanilla wow. You won't exactly be swapping specs around. Jack of all trades? not really.
---
flashback to that one part after serrak'is where you have to wall glitch jump from the water to avoid a 5 minute swim
---
My pet got physical damage mitigation of 43% so I thought I should get one with aoe capabilities instead of more survivability
---
If you found something that edited the variable one way, try to reverse engineer it to go the other way at the end.
---
And as for your actionbar changing, you don't have to allow that either. You can macro abilities to be used when in stealth (considered a stance, like warriors or druids) or not in stealth and place them on a different bar that doesn't change. Or you could just place that specific macro off the changing actionbar of you like that it does change. I don't like the bar changing cause it has a slight lag before the bar switches that I don't like and found both of those to be good options. Just fyi.
---
40 mins is better than 3 hours at the very least...
---
Vanilla has stat weights too, though
---
There's an option to remove this in the interface options. I forget what page but it's a checkbox for "instant quest text"
---
Oh thanks, I managed to get a gamecard off taobao and it worked. I'm on a different server too =(

It was normalised in Vanilla. The story about Plate having high repair costs used to be because repairs were based on damage you took (so in a good raid only Tanks and melee were taking most of the damage) and on the total durability of the item (plate has the most durability so cost the most to repair).
---
Both of those things were normalised.

as i said multiple times. Professions do have impact in the end game but literally no impact before that just as it is in bfa

Pre raid bis is literally an endgame item
---
O no not the big scary chans!
---
I went to Disneyland today is just couldn’t stop thinking about stabbing alliance players on ashenvale.
---
Surely that's trivial to change with addons? Hell, it should be doable with a macro if the frames can be located within global context.
---
I just love how people find justification and cause for everything and Blame everything on another generation. I'm 27, i play wow since 2005, i was hella hyped playing classic anf took a PIC via Messenger to send my GF that was at work, later i thought about making a post here but i was on my phone. I have prints , but the situation on this picture os just too funny not to share. It's that simple. Everyone seems to be so worried about pointing out that i could have just taken a print that they miss the point. Also, if this was a print, yhea maybe it would be a better post, but i'm not here for the Karma i just wanted to share a funny situation :) have a Nice one guys.
---
Ah. Ya, you'll need to get others to use it. If you want to have it truly function.

Cheers to you both 🍺
---
Fat chicks need love too
---
My point isn't etiquette. My point was that the hunter can choose to take it and ignore etiquette and there's absolutely nothing he can do about that actively to stop him unless he is able to get a mob to interrupt him somehow.
---
Yeah I agree. I would love if classic had the updated visuals of retail, but I know its a hot button issue.
---
Same here, I've literally never had a problem with Nethergarde Keep EU, other than the daily server resets. All these queue memes mean nothing to me.
---
Ya go cant go wrong with any class/race combo. Only talents can be chosen wrongly, but you can change those by paying gold in game, so Make a character you think sounds fun and try it out, that's honestly the best way to get started. You can also join the Classic WOW discord: [https://discord.gg/J3yuW8](https://discord.gg/J3yuW8) and if you get stuck you can go there and ask questions. People are generally helpful in there.
---
Nice find
---
Well you made a statement about him not getting more upvotes.
---
You never said it was "more upvotes than the OP". Should be more specific!
---
1) I dislike addons users (especially Questie)  
---
2) I dislike content rushers (even if you have already seen the content)
---
To me you just look like the guy driving too fast on the city streets and thinking he looks cool, while everybody thinks he is an a\*\*. The kikimeter guy. 
---
**But, congratz on achieving your personal goal!** 
---
How I play the game: no addons, try to do all the quests per zone, try not to use shortcuts (suicides, grouping,...) I also try to be the best at each level (best gear, maxed profession, high gold). I also read quests for the immersion. Also never look at wowhead its a forbidden!!! To me its like cheating.
---
Maybe my way is peculiar, but i just try to share my point of view.
---
IMO nobody is gonna know who got server first, most important is the journey, and to make friends along the way. On top of that, no achievments, and almost no content for 60 yet. 
---
**Clouds is a nice name!**
---
cool, right? :D
---
Questie is bugged and shows a lot of quests that you can’t actually accept yet.
---
I have a script command for it that fixes this problem but you have to use it every time you log in and possibly every time you enter / leave an instance.
---
I’m not at home right now to access it but I can give you the command later on or tomorrow if you want it
---
Good game design
---
Were you there? No you weren’t, so how do you know the person was not aware? It is common sense, you see someone clearing mobs near a chest, what do you think they’re going to leave the chest? You didn’t even see how it happened, so how can you even judge my reaction (which was mild btw). You are the typical knee jerk redditor. You even said yourself it’s a fucking chest, I sent a 4 word pm. Get off the high horse mate, you been redditting a bit too much. :)
---
Nothing is advanced in Vanilla tbh.
---
Rogue would suit you perfectly.
---
this realy sounds like a bug, i would recomend you report it ingame or in the offical forums
---
https://youtu.be/5elh0aaIIz0
---
You mean something like this?
---
Can't really comment because I've never done anything like that. Is that behaviour inconsistent with that particular mob in original vanilla?  Layering is continent wide so it should be that causing an issue.

One of the first signs of video game addiction is when you constantly think about it and can't really think about anything else. It's okay to play video games as a hobby. Just don't let it ruin your life. Speaking from experience, I'm lucky I was only addicted during my teenage years.

There's Murlocs in Elwynn Forest? Didn't see those, that area is so trash for quests that after wasting like 2 hours I booked straight to Ironforge, where every two NPC you meet has multiple quests for you.

No such thing as fair in the real world.

Honestly, I wouldn’t trade the Grob Mob for quicker questing any day. It’s super cool to make a training run through a city and see dozens of active RPers doing their thing.

I remember when I was younger I tried running across the entirety of Deeprun Tram because I had no idea there was actually a tram. When I got about halfway some person I was in a group in put the skull raid icon on me. Having hailed from Runescape I thought it was hella bad news (getting skulled in Runescape meant that when you died you'd drop all of your gear) and turned back around.
---
As this seem relevant here:
---
As i didn't find any good answers so far, i was wondering what kind of classes are popular right now. 
---
Here a poll so we can get an overview over the state of the game. 
---
You can tick multiple boxes, the poll asks for the classes you play and which faction you play on.
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/18585758
---
It’s the default MoP screen
---
Afaik it’s intentional.
---
Literally nonsense. Except for a few that were swarmed initially (mostly thanks to streamers and their fanboi armies) all other servers are super healthy atm, very small queues during peak times only.

Author of "Server Friends Only" here, thanks for the kind words. Please let me know if you have any suggestions/issues :). I just recently updated it to automatically show your BNet friends online on your realm/faction.
---
 I have not seen the details for this particular update. But I do know blizzard intended to release an update a week or two after launch to make it  more difficult for some addons to interact with the UI. This was their response to the LFG add-on. It's very possible that that is this update and it also affected your quest add-on.

Take a pic using the Snapchat camera???? Opening this up on my phone definitely looks like you used your regular camera app to take this pic not Snapchat, as its way more square, where Snapchat has 9x16-20 aspect ratio
---
Max precision , 2 points into imp frostbolt, frostbite , imp Nova , Ice shards , shatter , ice block , cold snap. In that order.
---
It’s a chest, am I going to start a war over it? What would you do? Just take it like a bitch?
---
Blizzard has even said original wow realms had ~2500 players on high pop realms.  Your numbers are way off if you think 100k accounts is a good server population...
---
Thanks a lot for your kind advice.
---
Paladin and Priest are both good for healing raids if that’s what you want to do for endgame.  
---
The Hunter has a great toolkit for both pve and pvp, obliviously you won’t be able to heal with it.  If your ok with that try getting one to 20 and see if it fits better than the Druid.
---
They all say that. The trick is to stop cutting your toenails.
---
Could very well be.
---
Try to disable addons, and if it still doesnt work and it dosnt say the fish got away, then create a bug report ingame "Esc &gt; Help &gt; Report Bug"
---
I'm missing EU Zandalar Tribe to one of the new PVP realms. Seems like a lot of pvp'ers rolled on the RP-PVP realm to skip queues and would like the opportunity to transfer to a queueless normal PVP server. 
---
A lot of Roleplayers are dissapointed that they lost their only RP-PVP realm to players with names like "ComingForU" that just don't give damn, make fun of RP'ers and were only looking for a queueless PVP realm. I'm no real roleplayer either but respect the rules and enjoy the extra ambiance. Might even try it out later too.
---
But what are you trying to accomplish? People will corpse camp.
---
I don’t know why, pretty boring..but it will always exist.
---
Either 1) call in a group from the zone/guild mates or 2) log an alt and take advantage of that sweet, juicy, ready to go rested XP.
---
Why are you so damn defensive when people say people might feel alienated and harassed? Does it upset you, admitting that you're an asshole loser for being an asshole online?
---
Congrats, which in turn means congratulations.
---
If I left classic, I wouldn't even bother touching BFA. It's a dumpster fire of a game.
---
You gotta be fucking kidding me right ? It is anything but reasonable. Not our problem that blizzard is absolutely useless when dealing with this issue.
---
I really thought that it would be such a drastic change and missing so many quality of life changes (no lfg, have to buy ammo, etc) would be a major buzz kill. I know i thought I'd hate it personally. I was wrong
---
If the GE got voted in then clearly others do agree? 
---
I don't have any nostalgia, I'm fine with taking the game in any direction the majority wants. OSRS worked out great for the overwhelming majority of people, don't see why Classic+ can't too.
---
This is the correct answer
---
So thats what he is saying? Nice to know after ten years in.
---
War + Pally is probably the most powerful Vanilla 2vs2 combo.
---
Warriors are traditionally very tanky, the bane of healers, but stupidly easy to CC and control. A pally can pretty much negate that negative.
---
I don’t know on which server you are playing, but certain realms experience upwards of 10 or more hours of queues, which must be their priority right now.
---
LiTeRaLlY UnPlAyAbLe
---
Technically not, npc has a chance to spawn free action, or superior defense, or both
---
Basically same thing.
---
Just spam demo shout since it's broken
---
You and me both brother. 1440 21:9 please.
---
Absolute genius!
---
Lmao 5 hp is the first enchant you can get. Have you even tried leveling it?
---
The only way you can mess up a character build is through talent points but you can reset your talent points at any major city for in game money, so you dont need to worry about a crappy character build. You can also find plenty of leveling guides that will tell you the best way to spend your points if you want. None of the racial benifits matter enough to chose your race based on them so just pick which ever you like best. So all you need to figure out is which class you want to play so pick between melee, ranged, or caster. Or you can roll druid and be able to switch between tank, rogue, caster, and healer all in one class (you just wont be the best at any role, but druids are definitely still viable end game and while leveling)
---
There are no dead servers. There won't be any dead servers. Almost everything is FULL. It has been stated many times that a medium population server is larger than a 2004 at FULL. Odds are that this transfer destinations are going to rocket to medium/high and there will likely still be a queue on most of the origin servers.
---
Ppl seriously watch other ppl quest?
---
What exactly are your expectations about the professions?
---
What's the command ?
---
I can confirm this. My friend(priest) pulls aggro even from other groups while they are fighting the mobs in the same time I'm tanking our mobs.
---
I don't remember this in vanilla as well. 
---
It feels like the healing aggro is bugged or something.
---
He is not wrong.
---
You literally quoted the top search result which proclaimed "this is how to do it if you're lazy." You might not have searched for it specifically, but then coming here and complaining about BfA/mainline WoW because there's a lazy travel method as a search result was both the wrong subreddit (having literally nothing to do with Classic) and a silly complaint. People will oft take the path of least resistance, and I even pointed out how you can do that in Classic as well. It's more complicated and less likely, but it's possible to "be lazy." And if you don't want the lazy way, great, don't use it. But don't hate on BfA because people have combined multiple quality-of-life changes to allow others to be lazier on an unrelated sub.
---
You’re the one that felt it necessary to post this banal exchange on Reddit to make you look like a good guy martyr. Be fucking quiet you egomaniac. Post like this or horrible and you are making this place worse. Don’t criticize others. This is a joke
---
I hate you OP. I’m getting yanked for two hours and fighting back when I can and posting relevant PvP information in chat and people like you keep saying “quit crying” when I’m literally sharing information. Turn off general chat if you don’t like reading about PvP.
---
well played, lol.
---
Lol what? Of course dps trumps both. You don't have level 60s equipping level 6 offhand weapons just because they have a speed of 1.3.
---
There was no armory back in classic. Blizzard has confirmed that there won‘t be an armory now either
---
So....we need a *Cats of Classic* thread. Why? Because caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaats. :X
---
White Knights unite!
---
/ugh
---
Sounds like me.  I can log into Herod at 7am instantly. So my days off I can forgo sleeping in to wake up and play WoW.  If I try to queue after work it's a 6 hour queue and I'll be in bed before I can play.  Herod on days off, Atiesh otherwise.
---
Thanks ill do that!
---
That is solved in the newest version of "Server Friends Only" :).

Shaman are very much expected to need on Corpsemaker, and that's not some Hunter meme.
---
Enhancement levelling is what Shamans do, and Corpsemaker is literally the best thing they can get at that level and up until Ravager.
---
Enhancement needs strength and agility. They will *need* on leather gear.
---
Maybe new content could be horizontal progression from say, ZG or AQ20 then?
---
You'll find that kind of other isn't significant.
---
I think most people will hope for the same, and don’t migrate. So my guess is that this won’t help much.
---
you dont do class quests either ? like as a warrior you dont have any stances or anything else class related?
---
Do you have any data to back that up?
---
Youre saying that like youll achieve that in an afternoon. Prebis will take months and months to get for most people.
---
Honestly that’s an excellent move. Warrior was my first choice and the only thing I played for my first *three* 1-60 characters. I didn’t know better; had no idea how much easier it could’ve been. So that became my standard, and anything else is just an easy ride.
---
I like stories like this.
---
They are, there’s another thread for the US ;)
---
Some people might not want to invest heavily in a char during Vanilla, then maybe have to switch later.
---
I agree with you personally - I am not attached to characters these days. But I can understand the sentiment towards that notion.

If you are in a contested area you cant turn pvp off.

If you are alliance and you are in stormwind, you can turn pvp on/off, if you are horde in stormwind you are forced with pvp on.

Better than being in Faerlina queue for 10 hours
---
thats interesting, I have to say i have seen the same from the Ally on my server, I was thinking that was due to the classic community being more mature than retail or when i was younger. maybe a reason to stay ally...
---
I chose owl, and he is an absolute god. Screech powers the attack power in a aoe area so he becomes a somehow tanky owl due to that.
---
I disagree. Both are easy, you just die more in one. What is the punishment for dying? It takes more time.  
---
There is literally no skill required. An absolute idiot keyboard turning and never buying a skill just auto attacking his way trough the game will make it to 60 even if he has a 50/50 chance of pulling 1 or 10 mobs every time he pulls.
---
He will just take 10X the time a competent player does.
---
Darksouls is hard. It doesn't matter how much time you spend playing the game, if you can't get git gud you will never even see the first boss. Much less beat the game.
---
WoW, and WoW classic are both just giant pits that need to be filled with Time until you make a bridge to Endgame. The game determines the depth of the pit, and your skill is how much dirt you can throw into it.
---
Classic is about 3 timer of a pit than Retail but whether you fill that pit one teaspoon at a time, or one dump truck at a time, the pit will eventually fill if you do it long enough. 
---
That is not hard. That is time in = Reward out.
---
Generally mage and hunter. Warlocks once you start to get epic gear iirc. Warriors if you're playing with a healer.
---
got 2 and half playtime @ 35 priest.
---
This brings back memories. I bought one and have never heard my non-gaming sister sigh as loud as she did that  day...
---
Yeah there's something about running the game maxed out at a solid 144 fps that makes my inner 16 year old squeal with glee
---
Paladins are good tank healers for raids and can heal dungeons well. They are not good raid tanks simply because their mana runs out in a long fight and then their threat is done! 
---
In a dungeon they generate more threat than warriors because of righteous fury + consecration as well as you can drink in between each pull making it so their threat issues are significantly less. 
---
It's true that ret is mostly auto attacks but they're not there just to be a dps. Blessings, off heals, and their tremendous utility more than make up for their lack of dps. It's almost the epitome of a support class in WoW because you deal decent damage, make everyone else do more damage, make healers have more mana, and have tools like lay on hands and their plethora of blessings. 
---
I'm a huge fan of paladins obviously. They are what make the alliance unique! Purging evil with a big ass mace, pretty sick.

Bear is a good allround pet.   I would keep him and don;t worry, and when you are lvl 55 or so, ask around which pet lvl 60 hunters  prefer for PVP and raiding.   You can then tame a high lvl of that species
---
Built what exactly?
---
It's a Corsair Crystal 280X case where I put in all components.
---
I use IceHUD. The energy tick is a constantly traveling spark along my energy bar.
---
It's funny. This actually happened literally last night but with an enhancement shaman. The shaman needed on this exact axe, won it, and the warrior in our group freaked the fuck out and hearthed.
---
Now normally I would say since it's a strength item, it's obviously warrior loot, but the corpsemaker is BIS axe at 29, and the warrior who freaked was our tank so he shouldn't be rolling on 2 handers anyway. The shaman was totally justified, amazing axe for enhancement shaman. Unpopular opinion, I know. If you are tank don't fucking roll on dps gear. It's that simple.
---
[https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) this is for you :) the different skills pets have are kinda important
---
Not sure what game you are playing but 5hp is a 5% hp increase for my mage at lvl 20, and that's after putting stamina in consideration. It's by no means a small amount. 
---
Classic professions is definitely more useful for me while levelling than it is for current retail wow.
---
Without enchanting, my mage would be wandless until I clear RFC quest. Without tailoring, I won't be full green geared. 
---
So yea, I think you are just prejudiced at this point and no amount of evidence will change your view.
---
Also the talent system gives an illusion of choice (which to me is better than none) and a sense of commitment as well as a sense of baby steps progression that retail wow lacks. If you are not a fan of these plus points, then yes, you will hate the talent system.
---
Man even with a vacation i got a wife and kids to deal with. It helps my wife also plays wow but the kids basically keep your hands tied. I'm only lv 30.
---
To each is own. I've grinded Rank 14 as well as played on arena servers for years. Arena is just more appealing to me.
---
I’m not sure yet! I just hit 14 on my Alliance Mage and 7 on my Horde Hunter, so I can’t really say at the moment. The questing is similar, so once I’m able to dungeon and PvP it will be more interesting; and easier to compare.
---
Haven't tried it yet but it looks like https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lorti_ui + Leatrix plus to Hide the gryphons shown either side of the main bar
---
What idiot thought it would be dead after a week? You paid for a month, minimum. It will be a much lower population though, by month 2.
---
Good call, I've been making them into ingots thinking I was saving the buyer time.  Thanks for the info
---
Remember that when the layers are removed the queues will be insane once again. 3-4k in a server instead of the 10k+ or something right now. Same with each phase release.
---
Shamans leveling speed is going to be hampered by severe mana issues.  Especially in the later levels.
---
Just keeping your buffs/totems rolling is going to consume all your mana.  You have to drink *constantly*.
---
People make the time. Im married with a 3 year old and I work 45 hours a week. I took 1 day off last week and im  sitting at 5 days 12 hours.
---
Paladins are VERY passive.  They're honestly just boring to play. They can be relaxing if you want something you can read or watch Netflix while playing, and they're good at being tanky and holding points in PvP. I would personally roll a priest if you're not sure.
---
Gandling represent!
---
To hell with that. Battle station is a damn good name for that setup!
---
Oh great Arcane prophet /u/Quo210 \- what race do you recommend?
---
That's funny! I went to Disney World in Orlando last weekend. My wife thankfully didn't mind me bringing my laptop. Haha. Unfortunately the hotel had horrible WiFi and I wasn't really able to play. =/
---
Work is more tedious than leveling up my paladin.
---
You should try and think how do you play most games. Solo or grouped 
---
The class that best fits that play style may be very different than what is the best pvp class with proper support classes
---
Undead rogue here, can confirm. I always try to do nice things to people, but the paradigm shift is slow :(
---
Case 1: I saw a lock on half hp fighting some mob, seems like he's gonna die. Went to help him by backstabbing the mob and killed the mob (already tagged to him), waved and walked away. 15 seconds later he PM'ed "Why'd you do that, I wanted to get a soulstone" :(
---
Case 2: Dungeon chest rolls, it's a locked chest. Someone else won it so I unlocked it and let him get it. He was like "I guess what they said about rogue is wrong" cmonbruh I'm right here :'(
---
Case 3: 12 years after WoW and farming SFK and Arugal **still** doesn't want to drop Meteorshard. Arugal you literal dog please stop hating on undead rogues and give me the damn dagger already!
---
This is was how it was done before WOW came out. Quests were one of the things that differentiated WOW from everyone else.  However, there was still support for the 'old way'.  
---
Heck, in some ways I miss the huge Open World dungeons that some of the other games had..    In a lot of ways WOW "Classic" is the culmination of a genre. 
---
I don't like the mission running thing that retail has become, and the choices are less than you get in a game like warframe which is just a third person shooter.  It's just sad.  
---
In any event, I Think I'm going to see if we can drum up a server to play on.  for those of us insane enough to want to make a go of this.
---
Who hurt you my friend?
---
Cats and Raptors are a good bet for PvP against Casters of all kinds. The fast attack speed really helps push back their spells. Wind Serpents are great for anything with Mail or Plate armor since their nature blast ignores armor and their attack speeds are slower and hit harder as opposed to more frequently. The slower attack speed is better vs a Warrior as opposed to faster, so your pet doesn't just tickle them and feed them rage. 
---
Turtle and Owl in PvE for leveling are just a joy. They're super good tanks. For Raids I'd have to say Wolves due to the big increase on their Furious Howl ability. I think it's \~53 damage or something at rank 4, added to an ability. Tie that to a macro with Aimed Shot or Multishot and maannn it hits nice and hard. 
---
Go to Petopia website -&gt; Classic. Check out the Pets and Special Abilities there. I don't think the TP costs are correct on every account, but everything else looks about right.
---
I went down to improved drain soul in Aff. Then went demo until improved voidwalker for agro, then back down the affliction tree
---
bless
---
Druid, without a doubt. Priest is easy too, it's just slower and they have far less flexibility than a druid who can also tank and stealth.
---
Link to thread please?
---
Okay buddy, look at how angry you are over a ‘banal’ exchange that you felt the need to comment more than once in different spots on the thread.  You’re right about tagging, thankfully we can both do that.  Take it easy there, tough guy.
---
That's exactly what it is.
---
Lol what consequence some dork cussing you out in chat?  I would just report them.      This is how the game is played.
---
Pro vanilla wow tip: You don't own anything untill it's in your bag.  Until then it's fair game.
---
I'm not sure about the energy combos but look up the cooking recipe "Thistle Tea"
---
I see them everywhere
---
TBH, transferring is out of question, those realms will be low pop and die earlier.
---
They should have released more and merge later...
---
The server economy is far from anywhere near the stage it has to be at for you to sell it. Maybe 18 months and you'll be able to sell it. Sell it before and you've lost a lot of gold
---
The Geforce 8800 GT was released in 2007 and the Core 2 Duo E6600 in 2006. These are the minimal system requirements for Classic. Can't see why a 2008 PC cannot run it.
---
&gt; I bought her every expansion for Christmas that year.
---
Be honest, how broke are you?
---
EA is beyond shameless with those "expansions". Here's two new chairs for $5, because fuck you.
---
glad to hear this. I picked Benediction because Stalagg was full; friends from Stalagg will likely be transferring here when the option becomes available.
---
I was an OG enchanter I'm vanilla, I didn't really "sell" my enchants. I posted in trade "Free (insert whatever chant gives me a skill up) on top of Org Bank, PST." 
---
Now you'd be surprised what people "tip" for you just bring a decent human being. Not everyone tips but some of those interactions cultivate a reputation for you as a go to enchanter for some of those people. 
---
If I had the mats, wanted a skill point, and could potentially give that away for free to someone who needs it, that was good enough for me... A tip was just a bonus.
---
Bob Dylan did say "Times they are a changing."
---
Shamans are great to have in a group.  After level 35 or so.  Early levels not so much.

I'm sleeping 2-3h since launch. I decided to get some proper sleep last night, woke up 3 hours later anyway... I have no idea how sleep works anymore.
---
I didn't know you could do that, I'm playing a warlock too I have to try this next time. I'm really sick tired of people waiting for me to pull mobs and then sneak in to steal chests or quest items.
---
I started as a Warrior but it was too hard to solo quest. Kept getting rekt by 2-3 mobs at once. Hunter seems cool and I always get jealous when people have their pets. I love mages skills/abilities. Makes me feel so badass.
---
"hopes" ;)
---
What did you do from 32 onwards? Been farming SM GY with a group because STV and Tarren mill have been horribly overcrowded, struggling to get any quests done. We were pulling ~ 30-35k/hr at SM though. I'd love to know how I can speed this up, I am enjoying leveling, but I also really wanted to hit 60 before borderlands 3 comes out.
---
boink.
---
Queue is dropping - EU - Firemaw here and this time of day it was 3-4k queues rising to over 20k at peak.
---
I checked just now and there is a 300 queue, I basically queue to logon about 14:30 UK time and I am on by about 16:30-17:00 when I am due home from work the last few days.
---
This is the route I am thinking of going, thanks!
---
Thinking about starting a druid, aiming at tanking dungeons. Would I need to spec a certain way if my group needed a healer or would just carrying a healer set of armor work?
---
Yeah game is dying fast
---
Same. To each their own.
---
You were 5 manning bwl? Impressive.
---
Well that's just wonderful. I'm happy to see you're enjoying it! Hunters are a blast in PvP too, especially at level 60 with all of your tools available. Feign Death is hilariously fun sometimes, and useful all the time.
---
I tanked with a warrior dps and lost all the rolls in the Deadmines lol. I'll be avoiding DPS warriors if I can just because I'm greedy
---
+1
---
The problem with that is what happens when the streamers get bored and quit? Their followers will quit too. Herod or Stalagg on the other hand are extremely big servers without the worry of mass amounts of people quitting because their favorite streamer left.
---
Opposed to kick and scream when everything doesn't go as *expected* or as one might *feel* it should have.
---
I'm not taking ActiBlizz's side, just pointing out that such exaggerations can swing both ways.
---
Try being a little bit more objective in your assessments of the situation and you'll likely not be half as bent out of shape as you come across... honestly get a grip.
---
You’re not using them right. Enchanting is a difficult profession, but it does NOT suck. Keep at it or take up another profession.... It’s basically common sense.
---
Stupid people make me upset
---
When Clearcast procs off a Clearcast spell.
---
Not all tanks/healers will.  Let others have the arguments.
---
Plus warriors can get whirlwind axe!  If you as me the shaman almost has more of a right to roll need on corpsemaker.
---
Balance is hot garbage in vanilla.  Stay far, far away.
---
Resto and feral is all you want.
---
Ye I also had a Lock winning spirit gear over my priest, hurts. 
---
And when you ask he says 'Warlocks also need spirit' hurr
---
C'thun was literally impossible, originally spirit increase chance for weapon procs, but they fixed that.
---
Classic rogue is an entirely different beast than retail.  IMO, once you master him, he's way more fun.  I'll definitely be rolling one up eventually.
---
Oh wow I had no idea, I was actually looking at the Dark Core but I guess I'll have to keep looking for a wireless then.
---
Actually I checked and all site says I can learn at 155 at a trainer but I am higher than 155 that's why Im asking!
---
I can understand people going autopilot for certain things, but if you see someone at a mob camp fighting through enemies to get a chest and you just run over and loot it while they’re in combat, there’s really no excuse for that. 
---
I’ve only managed to loot 3 chests since classic released and all of them had already been looted, just had food left in them. 
---
On the other hand, I’ve had over a dozen chests stolen from me while clearing mobs out around it, with one asshole literally walking up to me, doing /lol and looting my fucking chest.
---
That's because they're doing this: https://images.app.goo.gl/2dTDaoGfFet7C7mE8
---
Thanks! Very lucky tbh
---
As long as you can cover it up. I'm working late since the Classic release. My shift ends at 3pm.
---
Someone who actually thinks on reddit? I must be delusional.
---
Imagine buffing a Warlock and not even getting Water Breathing. What's the point?
---
so does pw:shield prevent rage generation? I had someone tell me it does not prevent it.
---
You can also /join world. Theres alot of people looking for groups there aswell.
---
how to spot a speedleveler? 8 keybinds, clicking mount and grenade? WARSTOPM TOO? anyway grats on the ding and bind those spells please
---
Yeah and the debuff addon ? I’m supposed to see second countdowns on mine with my addons but it’s not working. What addon are you using ?
---
Not a repost, jk it is
---
slowpoke.gif
---
Because the new ones filled up. How many times are we supposed to refill characters?
---
See if you can find a pocket healer to quest with.
---
Of course they're your competitors, everything they do negatively impacts your ability to do what you're there to do.
---
I will check at TB but why does it says on all database that I can learn at 155?
---
Definitely friend! To assist me with ensuring that I read all quest text, I did not enable the "instant quest text" option in the interface setup screen. Thus because I don't see all the text at once, I cannot scroll down to see what I need to get without first reading the why. And some of the quest texts are hilarious, especially quests from a forsaken dude. 
---
My next character is going to be a forsaken frost mage. Can't wait to speak only with forsaken NPCs for the first twenty levels or so.

---
He is, but ain't nobody killing 4 mobs. The lock tried to tag them all and hoped the other guy would help out. He could have invited him or shared the mobs reasonably, but chose not to.
---
Reminds me of MediEvil
---
Those two share diminishing returns on Classic.  You're looking at a 4s trap if you scatter them into it.
---
[Actually "spelt" is an acceptable form of the word as well though not preferred when you're american.](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/spelled-spelt/) You're attempt at discrediting u/Mike-Ess has sadly failed.
---
Ugh well first you can make your way back to your own capital city.
---
&gt;against the common good.
---
How is it against the common good, it is literally a form of a queue. The idea is that the time taken to loot the chest is proportional to the waiting/work you put in. If someone killed 3 mobs for the chest and someone kills 1, the person who killed 3 is 'more deserving'.
---
Noob question how do I switch layers?  I was trying to make bags for someone yesterday but couldn’t due to layers.
---
lol there are so many things wrong here
---
Im at your pace. But i also stop often to play xbox and don't log out. Go to the bathroom. Eat meals. Go smoke etc
---
I definitely can see your point, especially if you were one of the big players in 2005
---
At the time, I was just rerolling all the time, never really getting anywhere, until I finally settled on leveling a mage undead and mostly did pvp with it, obtained the T2 pvp set just a couple months before BC hit, so even though I had a lot of fun, I know I missed out on many many things and today it's time for me to catch up with that.
---
Also, I would still want to emphasize that by today's standards, wow classic is an extremely good games, it beats everything else I have tried recently. Guild wars 2, FF XIV, elder scrolls, sw:tor, all of them don't hold a candle to what is today wow classic.
---
Wow classic is indeed the same game as wow was in 2005, mechanically, but in today's context it's a rebirth of a special kind of gaming that you don't get anywhere, much much less forgiving, even if at the time every old school mmorpg players said wow was for the casuals (and it was), today it's the opposite. It's for the HC players
---
no micro transactions, no hand-holding, no dailies, no getting your loot for tokens, no crates or lootboxes, just a vast world, full with other players, and you trying to find good spots to level among many you could go to at any given time
---
Also the engine is the current one, current wow classic is waaaay much better looking than it was in 2005, and it's really refreshing to revisit all the good old zones we do already know (I agree with you), but with a fresh perspective
---
And no, it's not all recycled jokes, you make friends with random people who help you for no reason, just because. They stay in your team until you finish the quest, even though they already have. You give out some good food you just crafted, they buff you, you exchange green drops that fir your respective classes, etc etc
---
The spirit is high and community is to notch, currently, and i haven't seen that online anywhere for a good decade, so for me that's MORE than enough
---
bonus is playing with friends and co-workers, who also played wow back in the day, when you all didn't know each other, but this time, you all team up and form a new guild
---
I see what you mean, you have the vision of a min maxer, taking PTO to level 60 first, aiming to quickly do dungeons, quickly reach goals, but really in my opinion that's not the point : the journey IS the destination, there is no rush in anything, leveling IS fun, so what's the point of rushing it ?
---
We chose a server with no queue, because we don't have any pressure to be on the "best" server. Yeah maybe the AH will suck for a long time, compared to the popular servers, but whatever. We will just loot what we need ourselves, after all that's the point of the game : to actually play the game
---
It's almost like the arbitrary thing is deciding the work is linked to the reward.
---
*laughs in whirlwind axe*
---
Any reason why you went for him apart from the looks? Yes he looks cool, but it is not a great pet.
---
Afaik, you can make a weakauras script to display some annoying icon somewhere on the screen if you **don't** have finding minerals/herbs enabled. Might be worth looking in to.
---
I laughed -w a y- too hard at this.
---
Knee jerk redditor? You’re the one freaking out about a chest and all the proof you give is a person saying “what do you mean”. Which is exactly what I’m describing. There’s a TON of new people not to mention people that only play retail where chests are pretty much useless and general etiquette simply doesn’t exist anymore. 
---
Relax a bit. Not everyone is your enemy by and not everyone does things to mess with you.
---
And you still wonder why he'd take a more human-like name and is looking for a new job? Imagine taking swords to the face on a regular basis yourself, wouldn't you do the same?
---
if mobs are in a patrol together, or at a camp together. They tend to pull together, whatever the aggro range.
---
There used to be one called KOS. Kill on sight. It allowed you to keep notes against player names for just this sort of stuff. Mostly for pvp vengeance obviously!
---
Video with clickbait title about some streamers with a teenage audience? Nah, I pass.
---
Especially since we don't have battlegrounds or the rest of the content yet. People have so much time to prepare.
---
here is a weather forecast from swifty  [https://clips.twitch.tv/FairSolidCrowBuddhaBar](https://clips.twitch.tv/FairSolidCrowBuddhaBar)
---
There is a lot that I enjoy or will enjoy, i just started last night, but there is one thing that can ruin it for me and cancel my subscription. 
---
If the majority of the players are all about rushing through dungeons like in retail I will quit like I did retail and wait for a game that doesn’t support that play style.
---
It's called "TukUI", Similar to ElveUI
---
cuz im cute
---
I'm convinced blizzard is trying to control the wild success of Classic so it doesn't kill retail. Queue are a tool for that. They could easily add layers and consolidate/server transfers, etc later, but instead they let it go on without a true solution. This isn't vanilla where they didn't have the technology to remove queues. They have it and are purposely leaving them long to limit the player base. 
---
I've had multiple friends quit that will result in lost subscriptions because of the queues.
---
You join a group with them. Whoever invites stays on his layer, and the invited join the other persons layer.
---
Have them inv you to a party or if you want to bring them to your layer you inv them
---
You got sleep???
---
If you're duo'ing I'd recommend something like Priest / Warrior which could be Human, Night Elf or Dwarf. You could also try Druid + DPS class or Paladin + DPS class. It's always a good idea if you're leveling as a duo to have high up-time and to play complimenting classes.
---
As for resources try [Classic WoWhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/) or [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/)

---
When MC went live the guilds on each server would announce when they were pulling Ragnaros because it would lag everyone else on the server badly for a minute or so. Same with Nef in BWL.
---
Imagine how bad it is waking as an undead:
---
Suddenly, you are pulled back into a dark, unknown world. You wake up in a dark crypt, with nothing but the cold and Undertaker Mordo to greet you. Your body doesn't feel the same. You aren't even sure it's your body anymore. You look at your cadaveric hands and begin to panic. "What in the hell happened to me?" is the question that comes to mind.
---
Then it hits you, as everything comes back. You previous life as a human. The Scourge invasion. The plague. All those innocents getting slaughtered. Your friends and loved ones being risen as undead minions in front of your eyes. All that death and destruction. You don't remember exactly when you passed away, but it sure wasn't pretty. The scars and the pain on your ruined and put back together chest are a good reminder of that. And now your worst fear came to be: you rose from the dead and are one of them.
---
Or are you? The undead figure in front of you tells you of a new power rising in the land. He calls them "Forsaken" and tells you of some Lady Sylvanya Windrunning or something. You can't really focus, with your head still spinning and aching so much. But things are starting to focus. As the man helps you rise, he checks your condition. "You're good. Just walk upstairs and follow the trail to the town" he says. And so you do.
---
Emergin from the crypt, it feels like you've been transported into another dimension. Where did they take you? This looks like Lordaeron, but it can't be it. The land is dark and unbearably gloomy. A creeping silence grips you as you step outside. It's like the very land is dead, but you can't shake that uneasy feeling that something lurks in the darkness. Still, now that the shock has passed, it's not fear that you feel. Just a steadiness, a heightened sense of alert. Your muscles are awake, your body responds. You begin to walk towards the lights down the road. This is your new life. Welcome to the Forsaken...
---
You guys make me sad with how little you saved xD
---
Yeah, was thinking that myself...
---
Have to do occasional quests/instances.  If you’re a tailor there’s some gear to be had.
---
If you really want the weapon, either check to make sure no other classes have rolled Need or ask to make sure they're okay with you rolling Need on it. For you it's a cool-looking item with situational use, for Warriors and Paladins (Enhance Shaman as well) it's a big upgrade that they will use 100% of the time they DPS.
---
A hunter past 10 has very little reason to be meleeing even in solo play, and even less later between Wing Clip, Concussive Shot and Pet aggro.
---
Meanwhile I'm on Ten Storms EU with no queue. Server is not dead just because there is no queue.
---
Abortion of a title tells me you’re in there too.
---
It's mostly personal preference, pick what you like. 
---
A bear is pretty nice and tanky but personally I prefer a boar. Just as tanky, also eats everything and comes with the charge skill. It basically works as a warriors charge and rushes to a mob at great speed and  increases the attack power of your pets first attack. It helps with building aggro quickly but I  like it most for the insane speed. 
---
For cats you can later on (STV zone at earliest) get Dash and birds can get Dive, which is similar but not as awesome really. I really like charge :)
---
Then the president flew in to OP's hometown to personally congratulate him for getting corpsemaker
---
Does anyone have one for tradeskills too? Ty
---
IIRC Fury wanted the fastest off hand for Flurry procs and rage generation and the slowest main hand for abilities? Or am i wrong? I mean, I could be wrong as I've not played a warrior in classic since 2006 but...
---
I ain’t going no where.
---
Big big yikes
---
It's built in with Tukui, but itle only show up if I enable enemy name plates by pressing "V".
---
That's the Classic "Experience".
---
Though, I don't recall back in the day Warriors rolling on Staves, so this is new to me.  Other than that, all this fuckery is on point.
---
Self-portrait?
---
its EAR is SCREAMING
---
You people take minor things very seriously, heh.
---
It's about 1k people per 20 minutes.
---
Lol awesome.
---
I was clearing to a chest and this horde priest zooms right past and loots it.
---
I followed him with Track Humanoids, he was fighting a mob 3 levels higher. 
---
I shot him with viper sting, feign death and shadowmeld. The look on his face when he died because his mana ran out. 
---
Probably has no idea what happened.
---
Thank you
---
Or an easy target for Chen's Empty Keg quest.

And what a terrible video
---
At no point even is Asmongold proven wrong or did apes win the “race”
---
Not the time and place for sarcasm. It made him sound like a condescending jerk.
---
Meh. The 1 to 1 server transfer doesn’t really feel any different than when they opened new servers. Sure people can keep their chars. But my group has remade twice now and still can’t transfer everyone together.
---
But sometimes they don't and science can't explain why.
---
As a Rogue, feint exists.
---
All my friends are on a PvP server :(
---
I don't think I'm as bad as that, though. I'd rather be on a PvE server, but I've sort of resigned myself to it.

---
Just dumb
---
Was questing on my Hunter the other day, it was myself and a Priest at first. Awhile later, another random Hunter appears begging to be invited into the group so we invite him. A few minutes go by and a chest shows up, I say "Let's roll for the chest" - what's this kid do? Goes directly for the chest. Priest and I look at him and at each other like "The fuck is this guy doing?" after he steals the chest he decides to not participate in killing mobs UNTIL they're almost dead. We weren't sure if he actually knew English or what because he refused to reply to anything until after we kicked him from the group. This was on an NA server as well. His only replies were "I put it down" "Inv back" "Inv group" "Inv" "group" "what?" - we ran off and let a bunch of stuff he pulled kill him. I saw him when on an alt in Goldshire about 4 hours later, he was still level 13. The worst part was the chest had an HP Pot in it, as well as a dagger of power. I had given the Priest a chest earlier because I always give the first chest we find to the other person just because they're helping me out.
---
You may want to consider Herb/Skinning for gold and holding onto the required herbs to get to 300 alchemy at 60 so you can drop skinning. Potions are helpful levelling but I would take the gold income from skinning over the 1-60 period instead, and then use what ive collected to get to 300 alch straight away, whilst selling the surplus.
---
Dianas necklace was added very late into vanilla, don't even think it's ingame in this phase?

Skills. Also, disenchanting most greens to level the profession doesn't help.

I used to charge and use thunderclap to kill the gazelles or whatever pack of critters it is that runs around.

Uh what? That’s all currently available?

Ty for the quick reply. Is that the addon for the name plates and font as well?
---
Are shamans good?
---
I am a 22 frost mage. But I played this back in BC and Lych king. I want to try something new. I made a Shaman lvl 8. It’s seems fun. Is it worth switching?are they good at pvp and dps? If so which spec should I be? Can someone post a link of a spec I should copy for pvp and dps? (I don’t want to heal or tank). Also, what professions compliment a shaman?
---
Thank you for advice in advance.
---
Dam if I was a warrior (which I am) and that scumbag hunter won that weapon I'd be pretty miffed too!

Mmmm, tasty zengy salad, full of nutritious words and other such lettures.

There's a couple. Some Yeti quest and some that sends you up to Altarac. 
---
Just keep in mind that you can stay in the same zone for tens of quests at a time for the most part.
---
This is interesting to me, was considering rogue, what makes you prefer hunter?
---
Bears/boats= tanky, eat anything, decent damage, charge/dash( boar gap closer) bite(boar focus dump) claw/bite(bear focus dump)
---
Cats= damage, eat meat and fish get a +10% damage boost for being an offensive pet, dash (gap closer) prowl (stealth for cat) claw/bite (focus dump)
---
Owl/bat= damage, meat(owl), fish and fungus (bat) 10% damage boost for offensive pet, dive(gap closer) bite (bat focus dump)screech (damage and aoe AP reduction both learn this) claw(owl focus dump )
---
Swapping to an AoE build now would be a decent idea if you plan to grind, the gold is worth it for sure, you will still be more than viable in both questing and dungeons
---
Ahh. In Louisiana, the water table comes up to inches below the surface. A basement would just be an indoor pond. They are simply not a thing.

If only the level 60s can vote, are they ever going to vote for low level content? The message would be "get to 60 or you dont matter"

I appreciate your downvote to my thought-out, effortful, and on-topic comment. Truly the proper use of the feature. Perhaps you care to respond, rather than employ this “hit-and-run” style of argumentation?
---
Not against clickers you can't. You'll never leave combat fast enough before they keep pounding you. The internet connection is too good. That really only worked because there was server side lag back in the day. Now it doesn't really do it. For instance before your feign death body even completes its animation I have attacked you 3 times if I'm on top of things and you don't get a chance to trap. You never leave combat.
---
STV is *INFAMOUS* for being where PvP happens on a pvp server. It's just a bloody battleground the whole way.
---
Are they going to be entirely new realms? If not you could just guess at a few and make toons there now.
---
Are you being serious in this post? You do know that these servers hold a shit ton more people than any vanilla server. Also "just expand the amount of people so that we can fit all 10 000 that are in the queue." Because onces layering is off the first thing i want is 5000 people in org crashing the servers and making it unplayable.
---
Bruh I hit 33 on my priest last night too! Hype squad!
---
Yeah give it 6 months - Old School Runescape declined fast after launch and it wasn't until they started improving the game that things got better. We need Classic+ roadmap as soon as possible
---
The title accurately described exactly what happened. Pretty obvious it was going to be a sob story so it’s your fault for clicking on it and expecting something different.
---
Yeah, I also processed the logic pretty rapidly and it all checked out to me, but I guess some people just invent humor by ignoring common sense.
---
In PvE situations you will most likely have to heal. Chain heal is one of the best healing spells in the game. Enhancement DPS is pretty subpar as far as I know, and elemental would be good but they always run out of mana and can't sustain in longer fights.
---
As far as PvP goes you can play any spec for fun. 
---
In high level PvP Shamans usually run a hybrid elemetal/resto spec and are very versatile. They off heal and help burst important targets while purging and laying down windfury for warriors. Usually you pick between elemental mastery or nature's swiftness and its really up to playstyle which you prefer. (Although I think Nature's Swiftness is generally preferred.)
---
Your build would look something similar to this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000135030215--0523031100501

10-20 is literally just auto attacking in bear cause you don't have enough rage (or abilities) to do anything else.   You're unkullable but it's extremely slow and tedious.

He didn't die, so it sounds like it worked to me.

Imagine ignoring where i said a /played req is better than a level req.

I didn't have anything going on socially on retail anyways. Just quests, pugs, and alts, so sorry your guild split up but I'm finding people to play with and socialize with again in game, so for me, definitely a positive.

For mages your spec in dungeons doesnt matter for shit. End game raiding usually requires a certain spec but that way down the line. Respec now and start trying out aoe grinding.
---
Be forewarned - it's not easy. You will die. A lot. Takes a while to master but when you do it's amazing. I suggest looking up "in frost we trust" it's a very complex dive into how aoe grinding works and even has locations to try it out. Good luck and reply or DM me if you need more help
---
Cool!  Kind of what I was hoping for.  Thanks!
---
Damn, it seems like i went hardmode. Yeah our guild is kinda girthy :-)
---
Had this moment last night but with a druid in stone talon. He's 5 levels higher and when we initially saw he eachother he didn't attack. 30 minutes later I'm questing in the area &amp; I just killed a mob and was at 10% hp. He then decides to pounce me, I fear instantly, shield myself and run away. Was so mad that he only chose to fight when I was almost dead, and still failed.
---
That’s on you. You could queues were a problem day one.
---
Why are you only leveling to 20?
---
I'll be the one to say it since no one else has: fuck people in trade chat like that. Let people sell/barter how they see fit.
---
I had this problem. Priest. Westfall staff is better, but looks brush-handle-y. Emberstone Staff is much worse, but looks cool.  
---
Guess which one I'm rockin'.

I enjoy it now as an adult because of the real-world consequences. I run my errands, work out, clean the house, get dinner ready, and take care of my business before I sit down and game.
---
Hang onto it until the market fleshes out, and people have money to spend.  Right now prices for everything are seriously deflated because nobody has extra gold.
---
Everywhere.
---
GPU is different than CPU. Your graphics card and GPU may be perfectly fine, but your CPU might not be. Take a look at your CPU temps.
---
&gt;People who have played the game before are not gonna quit cos they know how good it is.
---
Except for the ones who are actually here to relive some fond memories, and do genuinely just realize they've more or less grown out of it, even if they had some fun while the nostalgia lasted. Not to mention adulthood responsibilities, kid, spouse, job, house etc. 
---
&gt;And new players get to experience one of the best games ever made so why would they quit?
---
I personally agree that classic is better than retail (or the last expansion I played anyway), but that is subjective. I've personally seen a number of people quit because they keep dying while questing and it takes too long to get from one zone to another, or just one quest to another. 
---
&gt;But of course, the is population in most cases very high at launch and then gradually it declines, which is no different from any other game. It's just that some people seem to believe WoW classic was all about the hype train and not people being excited for the game itself. And i guess we can already kind of prove those people wrong :)
---
It's way too early to say that anything has been proven one way or the other. Nostalgia kicks and the "newness" aspect is still in full swing for many.
---
This is it.. retail felt dead to me, bc while youre leveling theres nearly no other player around you (at least on the realms i was playing
---
I bet wells are cheap
---
Australian also, 3k queue on arugal takes about an hour now.
---
If you're fighting a tauren it doesn't matter, they can just space max melee range which for them is beyond your trap. Any smart player will realize you're going for the trap and won't engage it, they will just stay far enough away to whack you but too close for you to shoot or melee back depending on your race. Atm tauren have the longest range melee wise.
---
I play a rogue but I definitely do not like rogues
---
How are they in PvP for both open world and Battlegrounds?
---
Look, I can understand your point of view, however I don’t agree with it.  
---
I never said you don’t know how to play, I just provided my point of view for you to consider. :-)
---
To me, I would rather have +5HP _while_ I am gaining those two levels. Every bonus stat point is useful. Plus I am not focused on leveling as fast as possible. You are missing out on the game if you are trying to speed level everything. 
---
Enchanting is very slow to level up at first, unless you have some help, because all you can do initially is DE items, and the only way to get greens to DE is to quest or run dungeons.  I focused on Tailoring first, and I am letting Enchanting level at its own pace. Sure it’s slow, but it’s almost 75, and I have leveled it mostly by offering free “low level” enchants. 
---
My Tailoring is at 142, and most of that has been from making bags and selling them.  I can’t wait to make silk bags at 150! 
---
So yes, professions are slow to level, but they are **extremely** valuable! The crafted items are very useful even at low levels. 
---
If you are frustrated by that, just focus on gathering professions until you are higher level and have a lot of gold to power level another profession (but again you are missing out on the Classic experience if you do that).
---
No, it isn't the definition of hypocrisy, as I explained.  I am against layering, not layering abuse.  I called out Blizzard for adding layering.  I did *not* call out people for abusing Layering.  If I did, then I'd be a hypocrite.
---
Let's say a city wants to add a stop sign to an intersection.  I say "this is a stupid spot to add a stop sign, it's going to cause issues." But they add it anyways, and it does cause traffic issues.  Does it make sense to be upset with the people stopping at the sign?  No.  Am I still going to stop at the sign? Yes.
---
Why do I have to explain basic logic to people?
---
You know, you're right. I double checked and read the database wrong. Sorry about that.
---
You can learn it from Brikk Keencraft in Booty Bay, or apparently from Saru Steelfury in OG

Just before this, I was trying to jump kite so as to not get dazed, and my camera bugged out to like 1000% sensitivity and I fell off the bridge. So I was a little impatient at this point haha

It's just that when you see rifleman, you don't picture a woman wielding a knife. I think it's where the humor of the picture is.
---
Don't tell people that.  That is how I get these god awful mages without remove curse.
---
No. Characters are not absolutely limited to the highest grade of armor available to their class. Stats are much more important than armor. The fuck is a Druid or Paladin to do to find healing gear for lower dungeons? Limit themselves to exclusively Of the Owl gear of their armor grade? No. They're going to get all of the "Increases Healing Done by Magical Spells" gear they can get. Can't use the Acidic Walkers if your argument is to be followed. Agility increases armor, dodge, and melee crit for Warriors. Because it does that for everyone. Those are all stats that a Warrior needs to be comfortable in combat, leather armor be damned. Retribution Paladins shouldn't be scolded for wearing agility either.  
---
You're trying to tell me that a Warrior should be limited away from leather and agility, forcing them into strength? There are only two of the five cardinal stats that effect melee damage. All other forms of increasing melee damage are secondary. So because agility is a multipurpose stat warriors are to give it up.  
---
You're flat out fucking wrong and stuck in the past.
---
And how exactly do I mark? (New to WoW)
---
Me neither, I am very confused, but i've tried a few things and each time removing the GPU solved the problem. I had wanted to get a new GPU eventually, but was just waiting as it was a 980ti.

I needed this meme back when dark souls pvp was huge
---
thank you
---
people argue through their emotions rather than the facts. The funny thing is that they claim that I dont argue objectively instead
---
the crafting professions should be able to produce items during leveling with impact but only a few of them. I think bags are a great example to think about. Lets say bags are harder obtain. There are only a few 8 slot bags available through quests or random low chance world drops. So players maybe have one or two 8 slot bags. But the tailors can craft slot 8 bags by using a lot of mats, lets say 6 or even 9 Bolt of Woolen Cloth instead of only 3. This means that tailors can produce bags that are wanted by many players which can be sold to other players for a decent income. 
---
If you compare it to how bags work in classiv in reality you will notice how even the tailor can buy 8 slot bags long before they can even craft them. This automatically makes bags useless to be crafted. Anybody can just buy them at the next best npc vendor.
---
Im curious to see if crafting professions in the late game have as much impact as people praise them to have because so far i dont see a different to retail. Items you craft during leveling in bfa are also pretty much useless with very little impact.
---
Are they all in town? I got the flight path, did my rogue stuff in Ravenholt and then decided to go do wetlands because I didn't see any. It's possible I just wasn't paying great attention though.
---
There was poor performance once you got in the game in addition to having to wait and server crashes
---
Are you hitting T? I think that’s the default keyboard setting for attack, not sure if it works as a toggle though.
---
Sort of a spirit of the law vs letter of the law on things like these.
---
Keeping the pixel * pixel size or the portion of the average screen estate it took up in vanilla.
---
So while it is the same size it is also a lot smaller than the experience most players had back in vanilla. 
---
Sort of like playing Diablo on modern resolutions. Back then opening up the inventory ate half the screen, today all that info takes less than a fifth
---
I would put STR on really low priority but I wouldn't and don't turn down high STR two-handers while leveling.
---
I wouldn't roll Need on instance loot against actual Melee classes though &gt;.&gt; That shit gives you bad karma.
---
Yeah trolls seem more jhaghut but I couldn't bring myself to not be an orc
---
Yeah, it's all built-in.

---
Depends on what you mean by good. You won't out dps a mage. Shamans are more well rounded, with the use of their totems and general utility. In pvp, enhancement's windfury procs and elemental's burst 40+ is hella fun. 
---
In raids, you *can* go as dps but you may have a tougher time finding a spot compared to a mage, and elemental has mana problems. 
---
I'm training skinning and herbalism as I level, vendoring skins for income and sending herbs to my alt to save until im 60 at which point i'll drop skinning for alchemy. You could also go LW or enchanting, it's really up to you.
---
The shaman discord is a good resource for questions like these - https://discord.gg/Jq7kz8

i mean i'm not bitching but if it fulfills your "fuck retail casuals" narrative then sure. but do realise you're spitting so much vitriol at someone who doesn't like how the quest log shows 6 entries... which more shows how petty the "no changes" community is
---
Because that wouldn't ruin server balance for other servers at all, right? The entitlement is insane. Blizzard warned multiple times about the megaservers before launch, but people were to stubborn to listen.
---
What's impressive is his guild asking him to stop resisting
---
I usually help people around me, if I see that they are about to die. Had a greedy priest take 2 quest mobs infront of me. He got hit pretty hard and started running. I thought about freezing the mobs to save him. But nah, fuck him. Watched him die and pmed him "you greedy fuck" he pmed back and just said "yeah lol" I took his mobs and he had around 3 mins grave walk
---
I mean believe what you will I’m certainly not going to waste more time over this, it happened and I shared it. Think of it what you like.

I don't think it has an internal cooldown in 1.12, it just can't proc off of itself.

What is the deal with heavy leather ? I remember seeing people wanted to buy it more than any other leather
---
Like any chat really
---
Well, within reason. They investigate. /Unstuck I've read, tried to move you a few feet in a direction to free the toon. I don't know how it actually works now.
---
Even as someone that spent hours on mogging and getting mogs in retail i also like this change.
---
Also because you can see what gear people have, if you recognize something good you know this guy spent some effort
---
It happened twice? What are the odds lmao!
---
Because the questing is significantly faster there than other places.  The quest design is generally better there once you pass level 12 because of how tightly the zones are laid out and how close the zones are to a main city.  Remember you have to go back to the main city every 2 levels so that can be very significant.   They also all have very good areas for mob grinding either leather or cloth depending on your needs as well.
---
When I was logging in last night every server showed high pop or full.  The three I have rooms on were on full and I joined all low pop.
---
More people are coming to play and jamming everything up.
---
Free server moves coming soon I saw, hopefully new server because good Lord hour long queues is a pain in the dick.
---
&gt; All abilities use MH damage as base, and this damage is higher with slow weapons.
---
There's also an implied attack power element to many instant attacks that is normalized across weapon speeds by 1.12, so it's not just MH damage.
---
&gt;Traditionally she forgets how much fun video games are after not playing a few days in a row.

I play on Bloodsail Bucc server, while it is an RP server there is a fairly large Youtuber who plays there and still no Queues to be seen for me.
---
I’m very impressed by this website, thank you.
---
Yep. I've gone from 6 hrs to 2 hrs stalagg here
---
Please don't use G2A.  
---
However, to answer your question, you just need to buy game time to be able to play Classic.
---
you should make a paypal account since it's free, and attach your bank account to it..
---
Usually it works, but on occasion it doesn't. When Blizz shut all servers down to add new ones on launch night, I got right back in but my brother did not. Took me maybe a minute, took him a little longer than that. Most people say the grace period is 3-5 minutes, and I'd say that's true almost all the time, but there are times when it doesn't work as intended, too.
---
It makes sense because the World of Warcraft was designed around that number of people (2k-ish). We're playing in the exact same world.

We times the frost novas. I’m not sure the names of the spells. I was the healer.
---
Surely most guilds have a vote first?  We did it on FB, had a vote on PVE or PVP, name etc.  Only bad thing so far is our server's one of the worse for queues.
---
If you just quest like normal you’ll end up there eventually. No need to run anywhere.
---
Clearly it isn't.  People didn't know to prioritize chance to hit back then over crit, and how trully good were item with chance of an additional hit. 
---
This makes most gear in bwl and most t2 item almost useless for mages for example. You want that ZG crafted gear! 
---
Keep telling yourself that people didn't sim and do the math on the gear to provide a bis list for each class.

Missing attacks does generate rage. It's auto spent on a hidden skill called Salty AF yeet

People are at different stages of age and life. That's always the answer.
---
Speaking as a Hunter with full OG vanilla experience, you'll find your leveling to be smoother if you draw aggro from your pet as little as possible. Keep their abilities leveled up (you'll need to stable them, tame other pets, and learn higher ranks from them), keep Growl + (one damaging skill) turned on (but switch to two damaging in instances depending on the situation), and if an enemy draws close, practice wing clip + kite away until your pet reacquires aggro.
---
All these things will help you in instances later on, and you'll need to Melee less which is a big DPS loss. Since you're ideally not meleeing often, don't roll on two-handers against actual melee classes. Even though they're really fun to have.
---
google.com has some great ones

I always went Cat. The black lion in barrens specifically. Dps was really nice and I got to call him Scar.

“For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there.

C'mon my dude, put the game away while in class. Not cool.
---
Right but if your opponent has gobs of armor (pvp warriors, paladins, and flag carrier druids for example), then poisons will often contribute more to damage output then Sinister Strike.
---
Nah both equally right. No warriors getting WW axe @30 without a pain in the ass or a higher level friend sharing that pain.

cause not liking a small quest log and thinking a change that would be more appreciated than hated would be beneficial to the game means i endorse the wheel of fortune retail has turned into... ya sure
---
No, you caused the problems. Blizzard never announced how they will implement realm xfer, you just hoped for the best and splitted up to dodge queues. You can complain about the limited xfers but keep in mind that the decision of your group to split created your problem.
---
Well You will probably never find out ;) :D haha

Thanks! I realized I had forgotten that only dwarf priests had fear ward in vanilla... So I had to delete my level 8 and I'm now back down to level 3 ☹️

Considering the two dot classes are the ones having both most problems tagging as well as a fear spell, this sounds like a great idea to get back at tag-takers.

But frankly, let em be assholes. People will remember them when they seek to fill up their dungeon groups and players who continuously annoy others will end up with noone or only other assholes to group with. The beauty of not having random asshole finder in the game.

I reported the Bug ingame but cant post on the Bug report forums for some reason even though i have characters in retail and classic. I hope blizzard will read it and fix it soon.
---
Gnome rogue is what I'm playing and ive been having a blast, leveling is harder then a warlock though for sure!! 
---
Druid would be a fun alt mind as like you said can do everything
---
you do have a job, sleep 9 to 10 hours a day and managed somehow to reach lvl 15 already? damn son
---
This is a very good idea. What is the drop rate of this weapon?
---
1. you only need game time/a subscription from what I've read
---
2. IDK if prepaid visas and all that work on battlenet, but that's hopefully an option
---
3. alternatively, link the bank account to a paypal account since I see you say you normally buy things via account (which, tbh, I've never seen as a possible thing)
---
69, 420 huh?
---
I don't watch him but he isn't dumb, he's very self aware and after hearing his story years ago I'm happy for him
---
You can place it on a memory stick, it's only 4gb
---
looks like a bug to me, normally it should pop up and say "The fish got away" if you fail to catch it.
---
I disagree with everything in your comment, except that it is more useful to a priest. In the end a high mana pool is not gonna do you a greater service than spirit will in terms of efficiency (as in time spent). But we are both welcome to keep our opinions, and I hope you agree, regardless mine is that spirit should be considered way above int and stamina. Should you add PvP into the factor then sure, both int and stamina are alot better than spirit.
---
Any pet is going to be fine for leveling, I use a lion, but will more than likely grab a gorilla once I'm in STV Boars are also nice.
---
Enjoy your classic experience.
---
2006 was a different time.  In the days of yore, laid &gt; broke.  Nowadays im not so sure.
---
Charge -&gt; Miss -&gt; Parry ... still not tagged
---
As a non-alliance-player, I didn't even know about this shortcut. I've done the run a couple of times the regular way.
---
I won the game with getting a voidwalker with the name Helrath
---
Couple minutes boat, swim past dun morogh till zone pops up, drown, ress kharanos.
---
10 min, done
---
Yeaaa desk has seen better days
---
Leveling and farming is easier. It would be unfair for you transfer your wealth to a more competitive market iirc
---
Not possible usually,
---
PvP to PvP/PvE  
---
PvE to PvE
---
I would choose rogue, as well. In my opinion, in classic, the other two suffer from being hybrid. Then Druid and then paladin.
---
I think any race should pick the axe over the other alternatives, the synergy arms warriors get with axe spec is just too good.
---
This is why my solo character is a lock lol.
---
Yes and there's always been server specific colloquial terms for certain things in the game. This appears to be one. Idk what your deal if dude, you reply like an asshole to everyone.
---
Congrats! ;\_\_; I'm about 10 hours into farming whelps with no luck.
---
It's a bold move, cotton. Let's see how it plays out.
---
Send them a tell that says "Skinner?" If they don't answer when they're out of combat or proceed to skin, then you're fine.
---
I will skin anything that doesn’t have people in the immediate area. If there are people killing mobs, I leave the corpses unless they walk away.
---
If they're right at the mobs dont touch them. As soon as the wander away though, it's free game.
---
Afaik the quest only requires you to give something to Stanley. After that it's over so it doesn't matter who kills him.
---
All pets have Growl and at least one focus dump. As with player tanking, the key is to ramp up your DPS, not go full throttle right away. Which pet you use while leveling is less important than that, and then keeping their skills leveled up too.
---
2,395 yard walk in non wisp form to get back. 
---
;-;
---
gotta get a decently priced laptop for the wife, shes interested in playing as shes had friends get super into wow. Fingers crossed this could be her in the next 2 months :p
---
In some parallel universe where WoW has physics-based fighting system, tauren with world shrinkers mounted on clefthoofs are the most fearsome cavalry unit on any battleground
---
Healing spec for me. I plan on living in dungeons.
---
I like the popup Raggy Advert I get sometimes reminding me classic is out before I login into classic. Its the only reason I use the bnet launcher experience.
---
They also never addressed the poor scaling for Hunters post BWL. /shrug. They never gave Warriors the chance to get a Tier that is something besides Tanking gear. The list goes on and on.
---
Its been this way all year, if not longer.  The vitriol from private server plays on here got *really* bad around midsummer.
---
At this point I'm more concerned by the insanely high healer population more than the queues.
---
No problem queuing as long as you can actually get in a group because every other person isn't a healer.
---
:*
---
It's MikScrollingBattleText probably a version Tha works on classic too
---
&gt;anti afk bot for queue skipping
---
People who do this should be banned
---
I work 8 to 5 pm every day, sleep from 10:30 to 6 every morning, and didn't play Friday to Sunday at about 10 pm due to going out of town. I am level 25, almost 26.
---
To be fair, I would probably be 60 if I didn't have a life.
---
Well when you need an enforcer to check and make sure everyone brought consumables to include food to the raid you know who to pick.

MUTINY
---
Turned 36 few days ago - was playing wow on my birthday - felt like I was in college again expect today is my first workday after my holidays - I was literally the orc this morning when I got up
---
What does PW:S mean?
---
Yeah at lvl 46 I have had many many fights with the horde not ONCE has one layered away even after fighting for 15 minutes he gets back up, I'll get back up goes on tell someone out numbers or tales over.
---
You must be alliance...
---
29 shadow DPS is better than 32 fire/etc for me anyway. Yea there are a couple BOE wands with good dps but who would throw away several gold pieces for a temporary upgrade at this point? Rest of the good ones are all mage only.
---
I played MUDs. The first MMORPGs. Fuck I'm old.
---
It’s hilarious to me when people get offended because they didn’t understand the joke and then continue to be offended when you blatantly point out the joke whet over their head. Oh well. I tried.
---
Isn't that just epic mount tho?
---
Or it could be a positive in that the english speaking people on those realms get to move to a more english speaking one. For example me and my buddys had nooo idea thalnos was going to be so heavy in spanish, that along with a big que every day is making northwind look like a good home.
---
You can buy the charms from the AH or another higher level warrior. Only thing you would need to farm would be the trolls in STV which some are 33-34 which you may need a farming partner for at level 30.
---
Attention priests and warlocks: stop putting dots on enemies the rest of us have started our openers on and then complaining you didn't get the tag.
---
Two handed weapons are the preferred route for warriors while leveling. That is if you are not tanking the  use a shield) Arms or fury would be the best route to go. Personally I would reccomend arms talents like improved rend to eventually get deep wounds and improved overpower.
---
Eventually you get the skill sweeping strikes which will help tremendously when you pull multiple monsters.
---
There's a troll that keeps spam baiting with this on our server, very effective bait he always gets replies.  
---
Trade chat is mostly memes anyway, there will always be be people lfg there too, it will not change
---
slower weapon speed is absolutely better if you're hamstring/piercing howl kiting. since the object is to trade one hit for one hit with the mob, making that hit gigantic is better.
---
#nochanges
---
Uncle taking advantage of his family as always :(
---
I think they didnt "fix" that bc simply druids would be too good then. I mean we can do everything! And if you buff his ability to tank, he may be better than warri or pala when you tank. And i think thats a no go for blizzard.
---
Vanilla tanking required a lot of tab targeting and micro management. :/
---
Warriors are even worse on multiple targets, Paladins being the best AOE tanks thanks to Consecrate.
---
Yea just start phase 2 and give every single server a 8 hour queue, sounds like a great plan mate.
---
i as well as a bunch of people i know are on krom. Ive never seen it listed as "full" but its listed as "high" during peak hours
---
last night there was a ~1000 person queue around 8 PM EST took maybe 1/2 an hour
---
We play Alliance
---
You don't get bad reputations for fighting over  resources nodes.  I did play vanilla and  only bitch ass douche bags would put you   on a blacklist for a resource node. 
---
Rational people understand the anything in the open world is fair game and reserved black lists for serious offenders who griefed dungeon groups or ninjas dungeon loot.  So you are full of shit and kieing trying to scare me so fuck off.
---
Then she wasn't worth it anyway. She just wants candy. She doesn't deserve the full soul food 5 course meal.
---
Wait til plate repair money comes in.
---
Oh, I took my dwarf to Darnassus.
---
My wife got me into one of her hobbies and shared it on a forum for one of those hobbies a few years ago. Guess she's a misandrist and sees me as a pet. 
---
Oh wait, it'd be toxic as *fuck* to accuse her of that. 
---
I'll take a happy dude sharing something that makes him happy over a toxic guy accusing strangers of sexism any day of the week.
---
I skipped like 20 spells as a mage, but lesser decurse was not a skipped spell. ;)
---
all the rush to endgame is just retail mentality.
---
What about playing it on a usb stick? Is that possible, even with the battle net launcher?
---
how does she play with those demon talons?
---
And he would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for us meddling kids!!!
---
Yes. If you buy a subscription you get access to classic and retail. You’ll have to buy the dlcs for retail though.
---
the method stream they were saying that lvl 44 is about the midpoint of the 1-60 leveling
---
How are they doing it? From what I understand you can’t choose the layer you’re in, nor can you see if you’re separate from someone else unless you’re in the same area.
---
Which server? I can't imagine being on one of those crazy queue or streamer servers
---
Changed now
---
Yeah, try Hunter if you want a dps class
---
This seems pretty trivial. Kill player A on sight before homies come in. That or Run. Either way, you need to assume that every player on opposite faction is trying to kill you (they are). Always have several plans of fight or flight.
---
I’m assuming you just avoid the 3 year old then?
---
Yes - because even high-pop realms in Vanilla felt the pains of late-hours and slow seasons too. 
---
The high-pop servers will be fine, but even the medium and low pop servers at higher capacity will still feel the drop off. It might be less impactful due to their size, but it will felt.
---
Durring peak hours it won't be a problem, when you'll really feel it though is the later-hours and non-peak hours.
---
If only wow looked like this, one can only dream...
---
yeah i saw speculation that the longer you are afk the shorter the kick timer gets, but who knows what theyre doing. does seem that theyre doing something at least though
---
I don’t know man, I just really do not want to have to deal with it along with people transferring max or near max toons when the highest on the realm is in the 40s
---
That is just too cool! Congrats friend, enjoy the heck out of it and I'll see you in Azeroth!
---
Work hard in class! Classic will always be waiting for you when you come home :)
---
Your best bet in this case is to get groups very close to the minimum level for a dungeon, and preferably a tank only slightly higher than that so they can keep aggro. Doing rfc at 12, or sfk at 18 and you have to CC and LoS pull every pack, and every downed boss feels like an achievement. 
---
However a lot of groups want level 22+ for SFK and rolling in there at that level it's a stomp and is no different than facerolling a retail dungeon.
---
this is true. my husband and I are both playing. All of a sudden, I don't care for together time.
---
switch server then
---
Honestly as Prot you can fight 2-3 mobs at a time and finish with the same amount of HP as Arms does after fighting 1 mob.
---
Plus with more mobs attacking you you get more rage which means most of my attacks are Heroic Strikes/Cleaves. Once you get Revenge it speeds up even more.
---
People do this around nodes. I always wait if I see someone killing a mob around a plant/ore node to see if they're going to gather it after they're done. 
---
If you're the type of person that just runs up and grabs them after someone has cleared the way, I hope your asshole becomes sentient and eats you.
---
polymorph is a very great skill
---
I usually read them when im running to the location...
---
Raids will make up very little of your actual time at 60. Outside of raids you can easily tank and heal any dungeon with 0/30/21 spec given you have the right gear equipped. You could even dps dungeons if needed. You can even heal in that spec for raiding if you have a good resto set.
---
That's too low, as a warrior you should aim for 1-2 levels lower.
---
What? You're telling me they're just going to remove them and have  10k people running around in the same layer? Nope
---
I made the same mistake, started downloading the retail version because I didn't realize there was a little drop down menu on the BNet launcher. Choose Classic and you'll be good to go. :)
---
I feel like those things you mentioned shouldn’t be considered quality of life. More like a different way of doing things but not necessarily better.
---
I believe that we should both be willing to teach and learn and have some patience with stubborn players.
---
Players that started playing after WolTK hardly had to understand nor care about threat as most tanking classes got revamped and all got some kind of AoE threat generation. As a result most DPS did not need to choose their targets carefully or wait for 3x sunder Armor anymore.
---
Naw, if you have 2-3 enemies on you I'm attacking the untagged one and pulling it off you.  I have to buy every attack from an ammo vendor.
---
You people, no one wanted layering have you been hiding in a cave blizzard made it not people on reddit.
---
Thats just silly, as a warrior all i use my gun for is pulling, hunters can save arrows and definitely do need to use melee weapons esp on a pvp server where they face classes with multiple gap closers
---
not a viable option. 5% crit is fucking huge.
---
I’ve played alliance (human paladin) on retail from Vanilla in 2005 to BFA.
---
I switched to Horde (undead mage) for classic to play with my cousin. I’m at level 34 and it’s a lot of fun so far, experiencing a new side of the game. I will say though that I much prefer SW and IF and miss them quite a bit.
---
I have some friends who rolled alliance on a different server so I may eventually level an alt with them but we will see.
---
It takes multiple months to adjust to uberman.
---
seriously what's this person thinking?
---
Wait, I thought that character xfers (other than the free ones) weren't available in Classic. Am I wrong?
---
What's the usual course of action if the chest is locked? If you have a rogue he can open it for free sure, but what if you only have a blacksmith?  
---
They got to craft those keys with resources and they are consumed on use.
---
Pickpocket lvl 30-40 mobs and youll get worn junkboxes. That will help
---
Was this on Arugal Horde? I think I saw people bitching about it on chat...
---
Depends on how you measure success in life. If you see it as successful at life when you enjoy it, then wow is not detrimental at all. If you measure it in money earned/year or pussys slammed then WoW may be detrimental to your success.
---
Played on Defias in TBC-patched Vanilla and during TBC. Was an amazing realm! Great community =)
---
You say Rtard.
---
Not sure what growl is going to do in pvp
---
I think now you're gonna be known as 'that guy'
---
Bro its college.  At least hes in class honestly.
---
Had a hunter need and win on a Ring of Defense BOE ring last night. Plus 4 defense and armor on it. With 2 warriors and a paladin in the group because he “didn’t have a ring.” I was bitch I’m wearing a spirit ring as a warrior right now.
---
Their utility is not nearly as good until
---
they have sprint IMO.
---
I assume the stats are the same as the horde one, which means it's quite good, especially for survivability. If you're solo you won't be able to do the WW axe quest until you're 36 or 37. If you'd like a good weapon upgrade I'd suggest running RFK. The second boss drops an amazing axe. From my understanding though, for alliance there is a quest around that level that gives a weapon better than the WW axe. A mace I think? I haven't played enough alliance to know exactly.
---
i cant imagine thats not bannable
---
Get extended quest log.
---
I might look this up. Sometimes I want to ignore someone but I also wanna know why I ignored them 3 months later when I've inevitably forgotten why...
---
We had a similar battle the other night in hillsbrad. A bunch of 32ish alliance start tanking kids south of tarred mill and the full weight of the horde responded. Probably about 12-15 of us came in, all around mid to late twenties and we beat them back. Eventually they broke ranks and we just kept killing them as they rezzed and retreated to darkshore. They had a good 4-5 lvls on most of us but we were teamed up and better organized. On a side note, haven’t started a single pvp fight but I have finished all of them. :) Lok’tar Ogar

---
I think you need to chill out a bit and just be patient
---
Yes, good luck in the blackrock areas as fire
---
Any luck mate with the addon?
---
Shadow spec. 
---
Going holy only gives you slightly stronger heals/renews and slightly lower cast time on heals. None of which are needed at all in low level dungeons (I spend 2/3 of my time wanding anyway in a dungeon). 
---
There is zero point in leveling as anything but shadow.
---
cooking is useful if you are healing in dung/raid and run out of mana
---
To turn off all the crazy shit, you go to config under general and press lock
---
They have better pathfinding but I have noticed the issue of the pet unable to attack a moving target even if the pet is right ontop of the enemy is still there. More than once I have died because my pet was stutter stepping while trying to attack.
---
Average persons reading speed actually is close to the quest log scroll. People are stupid man.
---
But I mean?... you’re a mage.. this isn’t very impressive...
---
Anyone else think the quest log max of 20 is shit?
---
Yeah me too
---
People with good jobs get paid time off? Do you mean vacation?
---
Is there a website where i can find informations about my server ? Total pop / % horde alliance / % player by class ..
---
What is this sleep you speak of?
---
I work 8am-5pm Monday-Friday and I get my 7-8 hours every night. Myself and my girlfriend didn't play on launch night due to work but have been playing every evening since and we're 33. We're not rushing anything doing our professions and such. I can't see how anyone can say someone being 15 already is excessive.
---
I mean, the tough part is that non optimal pieces are in fact upgrades (which is one of the things I like about vanilla over retail). It's not like the hunter, warrior, shaman, etc. doesn't know their class...it's that they don't know it's significantly more of an upgrade for a class they barely think about.

I mean I wouldn’t just hop down anything willy nilly, I still dismiss pet before ever going down, but specifically in WC the first jump if you fall, your pet definitely ports with you.
---
Love it.
---
Agreed this guy doesnt realize how many brand new players there are playing Wow. Like me.. Ive already made a couple mistakes on accident. Most people correct me or teach me. Only had one guy get upset because I took an item on a quest while he killed the mob. I assumed he was doing something else. He said wow really and added me. I said sorry and asked and asked if I could trade him back. But he didnt respond. I mean I got it figured out now but it takes a while to realize how the game works and that everything is shared in the world. 
---
I opened a chest in a dungeon and party told me to roll next time and I had no idea what that meant. No one got mad and they gladly explained. Player see chest player open chest. Its that simple, new players dont understand these made up rules/ethics. 
---
And to just dismiss the guy after he said sorry thats pretty toxic, doesnt even give him a chance just ignores him and thinks the worst of him. Sounds pretty toxic to me
---
Ya. Retail is kind of a silly place. Lets not go there.
---
To quote Michael Scott: "There's no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke."

But if that's your only real defense that you make Michael Scott quality jokes, then the only people that are your  friend is Dwight.
---
ended up with a touch over 60 gold at lvl 40.  Guess im waiting a bit more :(
---
Not being able to vendor all my greens due to enchanting really sucked.  I even started vendoring them all a few levels before and it still wasnt enough &gt;.&lt;;
---
Still not sure i would have had enough gold even factoring that in, though.  I havent even been wasting it on stuff, i just have no idea where its been going &gt;_&lt;
---
Ive been skipping training a lot of spells, even.
---
Chain. :-/
---
Will I have trouble getting a group for dungeons as a Paladin? I've only ever played DPS classes (Mage/Rogue/Hunter) during vanilla and a few return stints.

If you're in NA be aware that there are East coast and West coast servers.  The comprehensive list is in a blue post somewhere or you can Google it.
---
Pick whatever race/class you feel best fits your fantasy and if you don't like it after a while, then make another!
---
Be careful to visit the classic version of wowhead since it also has a retail version.
---
High level gold farming seems to be 20-30 gold an hour reliably. If Dire Maul isn't nerfed on release,  it will be 50g per hour or more depending on class. If you are constantly respecing and at the 50g mark, it will be between 1 (I think mages and hunters can hit 100g an hour in inatances) and 6 hours to farm the gold.
---
turn on sticky targeting to make sure that you arent accidentally de-selecting your target by clicking on the open ground
---
 This, I respect!
---
Run Gnomer and report back...I ended up just dismissing my pet altogether.
---
I love your take on the hunter in classic!
---
Have you picked up fishing and cooking? Your cat will love some fresh fish and homecooked meals are a treat for the both of you! And what is more hunter-like then making a campfire in the wild and cooking the raw food you hunted/gathered.
---
first aid will be a great thing to have too; out in the wilderness you might have need of healing or poison removal, and turning old pieces of cloth you find in bandages feels like a survival skill too...
---
You know, I was trying to work out what to reroll to after the warlock didn't work out for me, and i think I've just got sold on the hunter! Thank you for sharing!
---
Is there a working /petattack /petfollow macro that works? The old if statement macro no longer works.
---
I so want this to be a thing.
---
Demoralizing shoot is your aoe tool... swipe when you have extra rage
---

It's not as simple as just "getting the fuck off" specific realms. People have friends, family, and guilds. You will 100% splinter groups in leaving and no one wants that. It also doesn't help that a lot of people have very justifiable reasons for being concerned about long term server populations.
---
I pray your server maintains a healthy pop, but while my queue on Herod might be a bit crappy atm, I know for a fact that a year from now it'll at least be a healthy population. We can't say the same for Low/Medium pop servers.
---
my vanilla guild nearly broke up in MC when the first CHT dropped and a hunter won it. some people actually gquit on the spot
---
the guild as a whole was only saved because Perds dropped from Rag
---
This, I respect!
---
You been reading this sub long? Just about any time someone says anything about TBC, the Classic shills say the only way they want TBC is if it comes as a Classic+ experience, without any of the improvements TBC made over Vanilla.

It's been bumped to 2 weeks now then people will drop off apparently.

I had an odd chest stealer encounter. Someone ran in and looted a chest I was fighting 4 troggs for, but he left only a pair of potions behind, which honestly I was really hoping for since I had just used up all of mine.
---
I think both are worth the visit. Hillsbrad was decent for me until about 23-24 and then I moved to Ashenvale. SFK is nice and close to HB for nice dungeon loot. Ashenvale has BFD as well. Happy questing!
---
Only reason I'm gonna invest in tbc is in the hope that WotLK comes out xD
---
BODY SHAMING IN 2019!!! /s
---
You can't loot chests in combat.
---
I'm levelling a healing priest, and I want to get good at healing efficiently, but I hear different advice that doesn't sound compatible.
---
On the one hand, I'm supposed to get lots of Spirit and use the five-second rule to recover mana as much as possible, only using heals when necessary and allowing HP meters to run down while I regen and wand.
---
On the other hand, I'm supposed to use low ranks of spells so I can keep group members topped up without overhealing and wasting mana.
---
Don't these two views conflict?  If I'm trying to recover mana, surely I want to just wait and use big heals, so that I spend as much time recovering mana as possible.  But if I use low ranks, I'm necessarily going to spend much more time casting and less time regenerating.  Am I missing something?
---
am i the only one who dosen't like these modern graphic renderings of wow landscape? 
---
Something dosen't feel right.
---
Well that’s just depressing. 
---
What level are the mobs in SFK?
---
I am level 14 and put all my talent points in cruelty, should I respec if I want to go Arms or just keep my 1gold and mix it up for now? Is there any reason being fury warrior?

Oh, that's true! Just found it on https://www.wowace.com/projects/vanaskos

Damn, im going to have to update SUF and try it out again.  I use it on retail, but just couldnt seem to get it quite right on Classic and i hate to have to go through and set *everything* up again with it how i like it &gt;.&lt;

No I understand, I'm just saying that a warrior has the choice of mail and plate at all times whereas as a hunter I have to wait till much later to use mail. So I do stick to my class, would you not be pissed as hell if I take an intelligence cloth piece from you, even though intelligence is much needed for me?
---
I'm okay with not giving directions, just looking for more info on some of things I prob walk right past
---
Only if you aren't full health. Overhealing causes no threat.
---
What classes have the least downtime? I already have a warlock
---
Honestly I didn't think it was controversial to say naming a guild "Hard R" is liable to make people think you're racist but here I am, clutching pearls apparently.
---
Sure that works, but you can't actually be part of the guild and you can't raid mythic content until the raid has been out for a long time. Also your AH is probably very different compared to a large server.
---
Man when do I get to the stage of life where I get to play 19 hours a day for a week? I've always had school, a job, etc.. I hope Classic is still online when I retire in 40 years.
---
People are gonna condone it and think it will take away from the classic experience because 'nuh changes' but honestly there's no logical or reasonable explanation as to why this would affect gameplay or players negatively. Rather, if we did get it, i'd be positive because we'd enjoy feeling fresh as fuck from after changing our character's look that started to feel stale two years ago. (Speaking in a hypothetical sense some years down the line that we don't have this option)
---
An American Pie meme about WoW?! Man, this really is a good year
---
As someone said below, you're going to want to play as a Night Elf is she is, so you guys can start together. That means your options are:
---
Warrior
---
Druid
---
Rogue
---
Priest
---
Hunter
---
Each of them will offer vastly different things to the two of you. Do you know what kind of druid she likes? Healer, ranged, or melee? You would have more success picking something opposite of her.
---
Honestly, even though Druids are a bit more complicated for beginners, you could have a lot of fun and success if you both picked them. But you will fight for gear (which really doesn't sound like a problem). Hunter is another really good choice to pair with a Druid for leveling.
---
In my opinion you're going to want to not pick a Rogue.
---
Yeah that's not a good idea, mate. Save Mocking Blow for when taunt is resisted, as a backup extra taunt. Using it off the bat on the mob you're going to be building threat on anyway is pointless.
---
Imagine if the game looked lie this! it would be insane
---
The second you add a single feature from past expansions you open the flood gates. So hard no from me, hope it doesn’t happen at all.
---
It won't be a dead server especially when phase 2 hits and layering is gone, Faerlina will have a 8 hour queue with the current amount of players if no one switches before they drop the layering.
---
Eh, Pole Arms tend to have decent feral stats on them.
---
Does Luna show that hideous blank section with the question mark when units are out of range like Shadowed does?
---
It’s 15 minutes of being AFK before being kicked to character selection and then 30 minutes in character selection before being kicked out. So you have ~45 minutes before having to requeue
---
I was thinking of respeccing once(at 18) in order to get my 3/3 Imp. Voidwalker and then once more at 60 for my go-to spec.
---
In class distracting other people
---
Last night i was doing my Felhunter quest chain on Wetlands. It was already late so i wasn't look for active pvp, i know that i would draw attention to me and i didn't want that.
---
I'm lvl 31, a rogue lvl 26 or so, opens up on me. around the mob camps i was questing. So i do the only logic thing you'd do on my situation.
---
I fear him.
---
Re runs, Straight across the map, into a 6-7 mob camp, he gets obliterated.
---
Few minutes pass, he opens up on me AGAIN.
---
Do the same, fear, he runs into a mob. This time i had no mercy, Dotted him and waited till he died slowly, Dazed being pursued by a mob 3 lvl higher than him.
---
It felt good.
---
As a feral druid tank, I prefer to recruit casters for dps.  I don't take their int/spirit gear and they don't roll on my leather.    
---
As opposed to bringing a hunter or enhancement shaman who will roll on everything they can equip.  Pretty sure warrior tanks hate enhancement shaman as well, since they roll on shields, 1h weapons, and then insult to injury they roll on the 2h weapons as well.
---
I mean, people gave an explanation. They do it because it's fun and the reaction it invokes amuses them. If you can't understand that, I guess you'll continue to wonder and make misplaced assumptions about people's intelligence because of that lack of understanding.
---

Certain addons (atlasloot) have databases of items you can search and link in game.
---
On stallag.  Guild planning to move over but am holding my breath in case streamers make the jump in which case not touching it with a 10 foot pole
---
Ugh, this should be a habit you break soon. Mocking blow should be used for emergencies and taunt resists. The cooldown is not practical for common use.
---
Starter Edition WoW doesn't include Classic.
---
Just in time for WoW Classic Classic to release!
---
I'd look it up but could you just tell us?
---
Holy fuck dude it’s a joke
---
There also was no layering or patch 1.12 at the start of vanilla. I dont see how QOL improvements like this would impact the game.
---
Damn why u so salty
---
I made a troll hunter as my main, but want to have an undead as my secondary just so I can go through the eastern kingdoms zones. I was thinking about doing a mage since they're also decent at leveling and having portals seems nice, but is it dumb to focus on a mage and hunter first? It seems like it'd be redundant since I'd be rushing two classes that basically exist to be ranged DPS and gold farmers at end game.
---
Yeah because of that Reck bombing isn’t viable in pvp and the aoe farm is slower, but with multiple mobs pulled it’s still more efficient than 1v1ing single mobs as ret from what I’ve read. I’m only level 16 though, so I haven’t tried it personally.
---
I found out the hard way that they didn't get Pole Arms until later expansions, after needing on the green agility spear from RFK.
---
Getting back into wow after 10 years off. This was the highest rated budget keyboard until I can afford a nice mechanical
---
End game PVE your only choice is healing. PVP is definitely doable as Ret but you'll need to find a guild to carry you if you plan on raiding as Ret
---
that's rude
---
Dungeon spam is your best bet. Find group spamming scarlet monastery. It's a pain to get to but easily the best xp for that level.
---
I have seen lots on it. Only what I see is people wanting TBC after vanilla.
---
Normally, I would have agreed with you in any other point in my life, but I have just recently started my career and I don't have much time to play my beloved game. I only have a few hours a night, I don't to spend what little time I have in game standing at the AH trying to make money on the items I've spent time earning, when I can do it on my lunch break. 
---
However, to make it fair to those who do actually walk there in-game, there should be a considerable fee for placing auctions through a phone app. 
---
I'm just spit balling here, but something like a 20-25% AH fee, or double the posting deposit of auctions. Currency for convenience... but not real money....
---
Raids "reset" every tuesday in NA servers. If you complete a raid, you are locked in that raid until the next reset. For example, you cannot kill ragnaros or any other raid boss more than once a week.
---
Got no kids and only level 15. Your kid is going to have some serious attachment issues.
---
I’m going to Hawaii next week. My wife made my *buy* her a laptop...
---
It arrives today.
---
Depends on what you mean by “successfully” here. Not trying to nitpick, but everything profession wise sells well in terms of actually selling.
---
That said, the economies right now at new so A LOT of things are far less expensive than they will be in a month or two when the playerbase has a lot of 60s running around. I’d suggest keeping bigger ticket items (like twink-viable BoE blues) until the economy matures. But in general, things are going to go up in value and even out as time goes on. It might be best to do a bit of research on and figure out what materials are a bit more rare and then hoard them for awhile.
---
I know not a direct answer, but hopefully this helps.
---
Everything on Google suggests frost/aoe build. There isn't that much that suggests fire 1-60 I guess because of MC and whatnot. Im not enjoying this build as much and I don't seem to be doing enough damage/have enough mana to effectively aoe. My gear is some blues. Mainly greens all geared to intellect. It's more likely I'm shit playing mage tbh
---
Yeah. Been practicing kiting, but tend to end up kiting into more mobs that just spawned. 3 points into improved blizzard has helped a lot.
---
Its been there since StarCraft. Holy shit.
---
Dunno but it makes hunters cry so maybe that?
---
Besides warlock the other ones are probably Hunter, Druid and Priest in that order.

RE RE REEEEEEEEEE
---
Agreed, if it's their money they can do what they like, but I can't help but think it'd be distracting/annoying to others around him. (Not noisewise, I don't assume he's a monster to play with sound on, I moreso mean the screen movement/flashing spells/colors)
---
Thats not true though, at least for 99% of the population. We start seeing some serious side effects even with adaption to a different cycle.
---
Ok, that's really sad. Not sure where you live but in Europe you are entitled to at least 26 days paid vacation. No matter how shitty your job is. I've never heard of any additional paid leave if you are not a f*cking billionaire
---
I can tell you why I was going to choose warrior but, ultimately, in the end, decided not to!
---
I wanted to tank! In my other main mmo (ffxiv), I’m a tank main, too. However, I don’t want to be a bad tank or one that a guild doesn’t value. This would have been the case if I did decide to main a warrior though. What I’ve been told is, If you aren’t farming for your consumes outside of raid, and making sure you have ample supply, you WILL be letting your group down. So, without the time to invest in all the things needed to tank well, I decided I’d do myself a favour and play something else. 
---
In the end, I went for hunter. It has a similarly large skill ceiling in both pve and (mostly) pvp.
---
If it's red it's dead bruh
---
Launcher says an hour.
---
you seem pretty offended that people don't like your shitty brand of "dark" "humor"
---
WoWHead and Icy Veins are pretty good. Also, check out MadSeasonShow on YouTube. He's very knowledgeable on the game and his videos are always straight to the point.
---
I'm down for the entire classic trilogy having servers. I'd probably dabble with WOTLK TBH, I played from the release of vanilla to WOTLK and quit during Trial of the Crusader, but I would love to experience Icecrown Citadel while it was current content. It's probably my biggest WoW regret (although fuck Trial of the Crusader, lol).
---
Don't give up on instances.  Find a guild with like-minded people.  Or...  The tank and the healer outrank the DPS.  So one of you goes tank spec and the other healer spec.  Then you boot any DPS who gets uppity.
---
That would be cool if I wasn't stuck in a layer with 17 alliance while the one others are on has none
---
Definetly not. I really like the OP, but wouldn't want to play it like that.
---
And this was done in the past, almost a decade ago. People don't leave and the high servers stay high and the empty ones stay empty.
---
It's going to happen again here.
---
As a warrior trying to level... how important is hamstring kiting?
---
Is it worth it to do it with every mob?
---
&gt; I understand what it’s used for and how to use it.
---
But you demonstrated pretty clearly in your previous post that you do not. Opening with mocking blow is pretty silly. Opening with a heroic strike would give you a big enough threat lead on a single target, and opening with a thunderclap or a demo shout would give you instant threat on multiple mobs. Opening with mocking blow gives you...pretty much nothing? Heck if the goal is just to keep the mob you're on from snapping to someone else, you might as well wait for that to happen and then instantly taunt it. This produces actual threat on the mob (mocking blow does not), tying you for top threat, and forcing it to attack you, and is on a 10 second cd instead of 1 minute. 
---
Really I can't for the life of me figure out how opening with mocking blow is advantageous in any way. I'm sorry I upset you by questioning your use of it.
---
Does a free name change come with the free server transfer?
---
I don’t have any from you baby,
---
I think the only thing stopping me is that I’m around 30, and I’m already pretty far behind the rest of my guild. If I reroll now I’m going to be even more behind.
---
All raid instances reset on Tuesdays. Meaning, if you kill a boss on Wednesday, you’ll have to wait until the following Tuesday before you can get gear from that raid again because it locks you out. Before first reset in this context means before yesterday as yesterday was the first reset.
---
I get none of that as a sad little protection paladin but the free mount at 40 still kind of makes up for it.
---
he's mastered the art of rhetoric. asking hypothetical questions based on a point in a youtube video / twitch comment / game experience, then exploring the aspects of the question, then offering an opinion.
---
a lot of it is filler, but sometimes it leads to interesting discussions.
---
the issue with Twitch is that its more like radio -- stream of conciousness entertainment. Youtube is more like television, selective production and editing in a focused way.
---
Youtube tends to have more meaningful/relevant content due to higher production values, but twitch is more like live sports... you're watching for if/when something happens.
---
I've only seen like two episodes of Simpsons and don't remember this guy's voice, so I had to read it in my own
---
The retail game typically has downtime Tue in Murika and Wed in normal countries, but since Classic had a simultaneous world-wide launch, there is simultaneous world-wide maintenance as well.
---
The y didn't switch it, this is something else. Also not abnormal in the first few weeks of a release.
---
Chill, it's $0.02 of game time.
---
You are evil. But the same happened to me in Mulgore. Some hunters seemed necessary to steal all my mobs before I could tag them.
---
I found the take shortly afterwards.
---
WoW: Classic, The Remake
---
Coming soon 2034, WoW: Classic’s 15 year anniversary.
---
I got level 15 cloth shoulders on my mage shortly after hitting 15! My shoulders have been so warm :D
---
Weren't they down yesterday as well? I guess every day is maintenance day with Blizzard.
---
I can't attest to in game because I haven't touched that dumpster fire in weeks, but definitely on forums and especially in Barrens chat in Classic. The shills in Barrens chat are usually tossed appropriately with: 
---
"GO BACK TO RETAIL!" 
---
It's glorious.
---
Sure seems to be when playing
---
You can do the brutal armor quest easy at 30, and youll be running rfk anyways for the axe so its a win win.
---
K. Queues the first couple days were at 27,000. Now they're 8,000 at peak hours. That's a massive improvement.
---
I'm thinking it has to do with the free character migration.
---
Ret is a meme
---
Except when no one wants to group with you endgame because you're not a mage.
---
Can you not add ENB to WoW? Here is the first Google result- [WorldofEnhancedWarcraft ENB](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info21309-WorldofEnhancedWarcraftENB.html)
---
Why does your action bar have no abilities
---
So having your pet run around in circles as you swap between mobs is a better option than having it stay on a specific target and only change when I need to?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I had that realization today.
---
Oh obviously there's better choices. But you gotta get to those points and if one drops you may as well use.

In Game UberEats addon.

and its obviously the best server

Spamming instances as a group.

Cut my mans into pieces,

This is my last frost bolt

Evocation, no healing

If we wipe again I’m gonna be leaving

But I’m losing my time, losing my pride

Losing my time, losing my pride

Wish the tank would stop for a while

Not every pull, not every time

I’m drinking and I’m trying

I’m drinking and I’m sighing

I’m drinking and I’m crying 
---
Wait!
---
Guys thank you for your help. I need to go to Darnassus in the cenarion enclave. I was at the wrong trainer. Thank you for helping
---
Stupidly most players will just layer tell they find it
---
You'll still be able to gank people on your current layer. If they didn't have layering youd be still waiting for 1 raptor spawn with 100's of other players.
---
Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures!
---
Ahhhh, someone complaining about unexpected maintenance downtime, the true classic experience.
---
Huh, could you share your settings? Ive tried setting the specific bag and a maximum number of shards but nothing seems to delete them
---
I’m pretty sure Tom Tom is in classic
---
No worries my man. ;)
---
I see thanks.
---
That is pretty dramatic, but I am getting tired of all the maintenance during the time I can play.
---
I hope they one day have a WoW VR with graphics like this.
---
Ok thanks I didn't see it. Looks pretty lame and it's only from specific servers to specific servers? That doesn't much help folks that got split up due to queue times. :(
---
would only be cool if you were also on the Herod server
---
Very nice have an upvote
---
This is what I needed. Thankyou
---
Lots of places?
---
Here is [just one](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/rogue/leveling-1-60/) I saw the other day.
---
Thank you for the info
---
Ehh..... sure it will work if you're just trying to be decent.
---
To be good though, paladins do need a few extra keybinds. The main rotation is a pretty simple 3 spell combo, so it is one of the easiests ones to do. I always have the following on a quick keybind:
---
Judgment, 2 seals, holy light, flash of light, hammer of justice, cleanse, loh, bubble, bop, freedom, 2 blessings, hammer of wrath, repentance. That's 15 spells that will not fit in your standard 1-9 numbers anf F keys (who reaches past number 6 anyway...)
---
Dude chill out. The world  isn't going to end. The game isn't going to end anytime soon. Scheduled maintenance don't last long. And if you want to continue to have a better experience these SCHEDULED maintances are VERY important.
---
Scroll past them.
---
Well when you're in a group where someone else is already healing and only 1 healer is necessary... There's no surprise there.
---
Your blessings and auras are some of the best utility in the game, your dps should be serviceable and always remember you need multiple healers for 40-man raids, paladins among them.
---
Also, in PvP, you can do a well-timed BoP on a spellcaster allied and turn the fight, or BoF on the warrior and again, turn the fight. Things a priest or druid cannot - they can do other stuff obviously.
---
I think you need to remember why you chose Paladin in the first place because it seems to me that you once knew but now have forgotten.
---
Did you know that Beast Lore works on Druids in cat and bear form? Unfortunately, it says "cannot be tamed", but imagine if they could?
---
That bad healer streaming it with his trophee Fearline #1 healer was hilarious too. Good entertainment. The poor guy probably never raided. He was looking through his spell book to down rank spells.
---
I don't think it's fair to compare your average player to the #1 Private Server guild in the world who has been practicing this for almost 10 years. They also still had a ton of deaths. Hell, other guilds that have killed Rag wiped. And these are the best of the best.
---
Your average player isn't going to walk in at 55 in greens and down Rag. So... ya, it's an issue.
---
Your buff and heals and blessings of freedom
---
And protection are priceless to your team. Dont lose faith we are the greatest support class and turn other classes into recking balls. My tip stick with it forget about your dps stats and have fun with your friends.
---
YESSSSS

It's in beta right now, so you have to pay $5 to access it (via discord), but it's TOTALLY worth it and you get an image comparable to this artist's style. You have to play around with the settings to get it to look right and it's still a bit buggy, but it's impressive as hell.
---
&gt;and some nice complimentary dps when needed
---
Paladins don't do that.
---
Drop Ret, respec entirely Holy.  Get Int gear.  Retribution or Protection are dead specs.
---
Abandon and accept manually.
---
I read it is an conflict with some auto-accepting add-on like aap or questie.
---
Ugh, yeah, thanks!
---
But will you go back, big fatty?
---
It's probably the 17t with an 8750h and a 1060

---
Also, 144hz G-Sync
---
STOP DISCUSSING! *compares games*
---
They are also used in Silk Bags, which is the bag type probably most of the server is making right now. I’m sure there are outlier servers, but at least on my server most players are in their low 30’s which, if we assume that coincides with cloth drops, means silk bags are where people are at. This is probably why, in part, the demand is so high. Everyone needs bags. 
---
But also this is just the level where mats start to be a bit more cross-profession in general
---
Yea agreed. Even the keyboard mashing could annoy those around him.
---
Hopefully OP is at least in the back row.
---
Hey thanks I'll have to give that a try.
---
I love moments where I'm standing looking at some elite mob I have a quest for and I turn and see another guy eyeing it. Usually send a party invite and slay it.
---
Mixed on if we stick together for a few quests after or not. Never played WoW before now but loving it
---
Addons are not temporary solutions. They are customizations. What you wish for is a customization.
---
What are the starting areas for each race? My friend and I have both never played before but we want to jump in together. Any suggestions? Also any good complimenting classes we can do?
---
I love PvP even when it's pointless it's half the reason I play, ganked so many horde now. Fair or unfair fights love it all will not stop. Almost dead fighting a mob I'll finish then off. No mana let's go son. Rogue not stealthed see ya later.
---
And is there a BiS list for leveling in BFA for every single different approach you can take? Is it intuitive? That's the point I was making, making a BiS list for your current activity (leveling) is so dependent on the conditions/premise you set, that it's practically impossible.
---
Sure it’s an outside thing but it would change a lot. Because ppl would check it for group making etc. This would make a difference ingame.
---
It is my internet and my game every bit as much as it is yours. I will keep being critical as long as I keep seeing stupid shit.
---
Just dont forget to stable them sometimes so you can learn new pet skills from other pets.
---
O for sure. I am specced Fury for leveling but have been running 2h the whole time.   
---
You can hamstring kite a whole lot easier with a slow speed 2h!
---
Except for spell batching..spell cast on key down instead of up...streamlined macros. those are alright
---
but a harmless cosmetic thing?
---
**nochanges**
---
Step 1: Ask a guildie to invite you to a different layer.
---
You know I thought the same until I actually played on one! While leveling, most people tend to leave you alone but there are times where someone will try and jump you. It makes you become more aware of your surroundings while you play.
---
I think world PvP on PvP servers is really how this game was meant to be played. You lose out on so many interactions playing on a PvE server. I do understand the part about leveling in peace though.
---
Bitch
---
Asked what improvement. I gave answer. Sorry your feelings were hurt.
---
I use SpartanUI
---
I think this entire comment thread embiggens the "fuck changes" narrative to the size of a medium-sized solar system
---
If you're thinking about raids then yes warrior 100%. For everything else you can get away with the other tank classes but they just wont be as good and will require a decent group around you
---
Rather than kids in their mom's basement, those level 60 guys with blue gear are probably retirees playing from their own very comfortable basement.
---
I think it’s all great other than the no grouping. Grouping is a part of the experience. 
---
Regardless, good to hear you’re having fun playing your own way!
---
a lot of peopple have been abusing layering and this mob, 1500 exp is no joke
---
In 04 they didn’t try to cram 20-25k people in each server, and when the queues got too high, they added more servers because they weren’t positive the massively successful game was going to flop.
---
This sounds like some fetish you have but I don't judge.
---
Nice strawman. The upvote and his political opinion have nothing to do with each other.
---
how is it awful? its better statswise than corpsemaker?
---
&gt; but honestly there's no logical or reasonable explanation as to why this would affect gameplay or players negatively.
---
Just because something doesn't negatively effect game play or players doesn't mean we should allow it
---
&gt; Any leveling tips 
---
Don't sleep or shower or eat or talk to people obviously.
---
It was a quick estimate. I have 24 hrs played on my main
---
We must have been following different groups, my man. I 100% knew Rag would die in less than 2 weeks. Private Server guilds have done it time and time again on servers with overtuned bosses. Classic is "easier" than the servers they perfected this on.
---
You're 100% right, raids will drop faster than they did back in the day and more people will get to raid; we have more knowledge, better internet/PCs, and better players. It's not a matter of skill but time investment. Getting 40 people to show up 2-3 times a week for 2 years to finish Naxx isn't an easy task even if the fights are.
---
That's the real raiding in Vanilla.
---
\#NoChanges
---
Yup, trying to finish shimmering flats and this one NE druid kept attacking me when I was below 15% health with mobs on me. 
---
I tracked him down out of stealth and tried to fight him 2 or 3 times, that bitch ass just ran every single time.
---
Like I get it's PvP but you have to really suck at the game to only rely on ganking people. I don't entirely mind because it's part of the game but damn dude maybe try a fair fight once in a while, it's pretty fun.
---
Neat thoughts.
---
A bit more annoying to get as an Alliance I find, not many groups willing to do anything but full runs and it takes *forever* to get there.
---
On the flip side we get Bonebiter axe though.
---
REDDIT, WHY CANT I HAVE MORE THAN 1 DOWNVOTES TO GIEF????
---
Yells from the balcony seats: "It's not a race guys!"
---
but he shouldn't be "right behind" cause that might be melee range and the threat required to pull aggro is less.
---
any hybrid class can do that though, shamans aren't special in that regard
---
Again no feelings were hurt. 0/10 attempt bro.
---
You dirty slut.
---
Who?
---
Wise words, I let it get me for a week, now I have to fade back into real life.
---
&gt;  edit: yikes guys i get it i get it a small quest log is fundamental to your experience
---
Good. Now get an addon.
---
If only. The current one is terrible

They were thinking that druid is the 'jack of all trades, master of none' class.
---
They're designed to flow seamlessly between all roles. They are intended to do any role well enough to get a group through content, but not to be as good as that role as the more devoted character classes. Welcome to the life of a hybrid.
---
o that's a secret
---
I just have it bound to the mouse buttons on the top of my mouse, but yeah I doubt anyone will chastise you for not binding it lol
---
You can do some stuff with drus and pals. But warriors are definitely the raid tanks, and the tanks basically everyone wants. 5 man content is prob more open for you, but raiding you can kinda forget about it.
---
Is this at every level? I just got my Warrior to level 17 and I totally forgot about battlegrounds until now.
---
Than I am requesting EU - German - Everlook, please : )
---
Ret pallies will generally define the bottom of the dps charts. If you are a dps and the ret pally is out-damaging you, you aren't doing your job or are severely under-geared.
---
That's not to say that a ret paladin has no place in a raid, but know that you'll need to be incredibly prepared. You'll need plenty of water, food, and any other temp buffs you can get; also know that your primary role will be support. Off-heals, buffs after every few pulls, bubbles on dps that pulls aggro.
---
There's certainly room in a raid for a ret paladin, but you won't be anywhere near the top (or even middle) of the dps charts, even in BiS gear. If you can get in with a guild and prove your worth and consistency, you'll be more of a help than a hindrance.
---
The biggest challenge for a ret paladin is that you bring nothing to the table that a holy paladin doesn't bring, and holy paladins are fantastic healers.
---
Spec for whatever is best at solo leveling for now.  You can heal or tank at your level regardless of spec.  It will likely require different sets of gear.  Switching from a 2h weapon to 1h and shield for instance.  Late game you won’t find many raids wanting a paladin to tank.  Though that is something to consider at 60 more than leveling.
---
TomTom. You can paste in waypoints and things.

Nah it doesn't, just wondering.

This is so nice :) I bet she had a great day my husband and I play wow together too

Oh, damn.  All this time I thought it was a female super model.  I guess this makes me gay.

That's interesting, someone in my guild said the same thing about herself...
---

---
Where did they say layering was only for starting areas? 
---
I was under the impression the whole point of layering from beginning was that it was across the continent. That seems to be one of the main things that differ layering and the sharding tech used in BfA.
---
I could be mistaken though and I've not played WoW in years so I'm only aware of the theory behind sharding; I've not personally experienced it.
---
Goblins are ace for this.
---
I joined an RFK run with my (new) guild. This dropped and I looked to make sure the warrior greeded before I considered rolling since I'm a hunter. He did and then another in the group says "welcome to the big bois"--I thought he was talking to me. I rolled and won! Then they say "we are running this just for that drop--it's for (shaman's name here)". Fuck. I felt so bad! We had two shamans, one had rolled greed already. Of course I had no idea shamans use a freakin' 2h axe. They were super cool about it though and we ended up just running it two more times, where it dropped again and the shaman got it. But shit, I wasn't even trying to be a jerk and I still was somehow. People are gonna get so tilted by Hunters regardless of motive lol.
---
I started playing around when Sunwell came out in BC, and played on Bleeding Hollow, a PVP server, until the end of WoD.
---
I switched to Silvermoon, a normal server, at that time. It was like I had just followed Moses to the Promised Land. Currently on Pagle and couldn't be happier.
---
So if I use a dagger in my off hand I’m guessing my dagger skill will continue to increase even if my main hand is using a sword?
---
I bought a vertical mouse and also use a wrist pillow, those two things together have basically made my hand/wrist pain nonexistent. I also use the time when I’m auto running (or eating/drinking, or anything not using my mouse) for stretch my hand and wrist.
---
I'm not talking about nostalgia, i'm saying its a very good game without nostalgia goggles imo, if you dont like it that's fine. Wow is still the western go to mmo
---
I didnt say that china was irrelevant when it came to mmo culture i'm saying that china has their own mmo culture, they have their own games in their own language which also only people that are in china can play. thus making them a very isolated crowd with little influence on us.
---
If you're a moron, get smart, it's unhealthy.
---
Your call. Either hold onto it for a few months and sell, or equip it and regret your wallet later.
---
To make some gold on it will take a good amount of waiting, but putting it in the bank and forgetting about it is the smarter option. What's it really going to last you... A few levels? More? Then what? In the long run, the benefit of equipping it is small compared to waiting it out.
---
I vote mental lol but hey if it works it works rite?

Good plan.

I never stopped. As long as you don't call an actual mentally disabled person retard I think it's fine.

Sorry -- just had a shaman "need" on half the loot on our run, then he ninja'ed the boss loot and dropped group.  He had no fucking idea what he was doing.
---
He said when it originally came out. 15 years ago. 
---
Now he plays 30 minutes or so a day. 
---
7 days / 30 minutes = 3.5 hours / day
---
I’m sorry you were offended by words. No troll just answering question.
---
Ah yes, ban the consumer attempting not to suffer through a shitty queue instead of just having blizzard the company making shit tons of money fund their servers properly! GOOD IDEA
---
From level 20 onwards you make a good dungeon tank, but generally speaking paladins don't tank raid bosses for a number of reasons, so it depends on what your goals are.
---
Concussive shot and aspect of the cheetah are your best friends.
---
Aspect gives you a 30% (or 36% with talents) speed boost. Yes you do get dazed when hit but if you are kiting, you shouldnt get hit. 
---
As I mentioned on another comment, you should be running side on to get away from the mob. This lets you still use your instant casts like Arcane Shot and Serpent Sting. You also wanna stop when it is safe and squeeze in an autoshot and them keep running. 
---
If a mob gets too close, Concussive Shot and get some distance. 
---
Bind your Aspect of the Cheetah to a quick key (I use Q) so you can enable and disable it nice and quick to avoid getting dazed if you need it.
---
Remember hunters have quite a few nice tricks up their sleeve - they have a melee attack which reduces your threat which works well to get the mobs attention back on your pet if you need to.
---
I'm no expert but this is what I've learned from playing hunter 1-34!
---
Melee weapons? Whatever has the best stats. Melee weapons are mostly stat sticks for hunters. Take whatever gives you agility or attack power. Beyond that spirit for mana regen.
---
Axe spec doesn't factor in much for hunters, so don't worry about it. You shouldn't really be meleeing anything.
---
This is kind of the opposite of what i was venting about
---
Haha most likely
---
Ultimately it depends on what stats you get on your melee weapons. Hunters dont use melee much in vanilla so it's more for flat stat boosts and flavor. Orcs get a bonus with axes but will primarily used ranged weapons and generally only use melee for wing clip to get back to 8m to shoot more. 
---
Also weapon skills are pretty quick to train early on so if you find something you like as you level you can throw 10s at the weapon trainer then fight 10-20 mobs to get your skills up to par.
---
Totems m8. Their utility is unmatched. There is a reason why shamans are the best support class in classic WoW.
---
He closed his inventory which reduced fall damage

Not sure why people are trying to lecture you on what you should be doing in class. You’re an adult, you can make your own decisions.
---
woah fucking grind my man!
---
Oh yeah I was a bit annoyed when it happened but in hindsight it was pretty damn funny
---
I dont use WASD or Q+E to strafe I use my mouse to move my character, and you can angle your model to where you can still use your ranged abilities while running. But you always have to stop moving to auto attack
---
I'll play vanilla FF11 while I wait

Wow - some sort of texture pack would be fantastic.

Definitely yea, there are plenty of people willing to help with quests and leveling and general knowledge
---
I hear that, I chose to work a physical job because I play so much games so I can justify sitting around
---
Yeah I play WoW almost strictly for the pve and raids but I will PvP sometimes, I just wish I had done a PvP server back in 2004-2006 when I had wayyyy more time to play and enjoy open world PvP. Maybe I’ll give a PvP server a go after I’m done with some of the raids and need a change of pace
---
Neatplates
---
ne's dont get any special weapon skills so dont worry about it.
---
it really doesnt matter much.
---
I look at hunter weaps as mostly a vessel for stats, i.e. just use the one(s) with the best stats, regardless of 2h or 1h or type or anything

Classic runs on all of blizzards modern technology, so I’m going to guess that it wouldn’t work.  And also since you would need two active accounts to even try the solo rename method (which I’m pretty sure also won’t work) I don’t think you’ll be able to make it happen.
---
Right now, the only way I think you’d be able to name change is if you’re on a realm you can transfer off of, and have someone else take the name on that destination realm to force you to change yours, but that also doesn’t really help if you want to stay where you are now.

100%     I always offer the quest to people, I invite them and in chat say "inv for Escort" or something.  But if I see you flinch in the direction of the quest giver its mine.
---
Same with quest mobs,  I was waiting at Blacksmith in Hillsbrad when a small group came up, I said "inv for Blacksmith".
---
group: 'What you cant kill blacksmith?'
---
me: '... i can kill it just fine, was offering so we could share credit, otherwise im tagging the mob'
---
group: 'Oh are you?   Id like to see that'

So we killed the apprentices inside, I waited until the blacksmith spawned outside, left the group and tagged it.

I'm not super familiar with what Addon's are nice to have. I know there's one that makes it easier to track my DoT's as a warlock. I think it either makes them larger, or shows a timer on them under the enemies name.

They're usually not very scary by themselves, but coupled with others, they make the group much stronger.  They're also very hard to kill.  The ol' tactic of killing the healer first doesn't work too well when that healer is a paladin and their rogue buddy is backstabbing you.

No but for real. I've been buffing a lot of priests lately and these fuckers don't want to give out fort. What's your problem, priests? When you were level 10 you wanted to fort up every person that walked by. Now you're 40 and you're too good to buff your fellow man?

Awesome good lookin’ out. I’ll take it for a spin once servers come back up.

Using an ability wrong isn't a "made up rotation for chuckles". You've already changed your story from tanking in a group to solo questing. Just admit you misunderstood how it works, laugh at yourself for a second and move on.

When they buffed Gamon in cata I had a hunter invite me to group near the inn and I accepted not realizing why. Before I could figure it out I had that hunter taunt shot spell cast on me and the hunter plugged one into Gamon's forehead.

He shouldn't have chosen a rogue for his little game. I laughed over his corpse.
---
I see a lot of alliance on Myzrael, and the server pop seems to only be high during peak weekend hours. I haven't ever had to sit in a queue. Always groups for quests and dungeons. As an alliance main who's always been plagued by the population difference, I'm very happy here. Server is PST, and in AZ I'm getting about 30ms regularly.
---
They think im a madman with the keybinds, can't really explain lol. What you wanan know?
---
Depends on the stats and the armor type. If it's cloth with int/stam or leather with agi/stam or mail with str/stam...that's generally the makeup people will want so you can probably sell it on ah or city.
---
We'll see I suppose. But seeing how fast retail expansions lose traction, it wouldn't surprise me if people are underestimating the drop-off here as well.
---
(You guys need to see this from Legion. It's hilarious)[https://youtu.be/c6EWYC8uVTg]

No, that's not fair to those that level up on a PVP.  Why wouldn't you just level on PVE then transfer to PVP?  That will never happen.
---
Instagram normies stealing content from Reddit? Noooo....never. Whodathunkit?

They made this possible after MoP I believe you in the past could never go PVE to PVP. I even transferred a toon from PVP to PVE server, regretted it and they wouldn’t let me transfer it back until around MOP/WOD time.
---
Yeah I vendored everything. I turned cloth into bandages to increase vendor costs. And I vendored most of my herbs (I stopped leveling alch when I hit 160 because training costs too high). Just quest and you get so much money from rewards.

Demo roar is good too, to generate aggro. Don’t use maul if you rage starve.

bags currently are wothless on my realm. They are at the npc vendor price in the auction house.
---
furthermore people say that there are only a few items that are usefull as you can get better gear by dungeon and raiding. the so called pre raid bis are pretty much useless because alternatives from drops and quests are just minimally worse than the tailoring chest on 57 and the raids really are not hard.
---
furthermore the bags are useless in endgame too because the best bags drop by raiding

Watching my lowbie tank try to hold aggro with an empty rage bar makes me glad I'm just healing, and not tanking.  =P

Well that's just fucking stupid if you're doing that in general lol.

Something like 'Ganked by rogue east of hillsbrad farm' or '4 +30s questing in yeti cave, looking for backup' is fine.

I’ve encountered that bug. They should reset if you try it again.

---
Me too. I like to Mind control fort people who are chill and questing in the same area as me. But i see someone who's gotten kills on me in spy? It's on.
---
Also it comes back to bite me all the time. So many people will be friendly, and even take the mind control fort... until their friend shows up and they both attack me. Next time I see those people, they gotta go down.
---
Right because someone rapidly clicking their laptop mouse button and keys is somehow less distracting in college.

If he's sitting there playing video games, there's no reason for him to show up in class. It's disrespectful to the people who actually care.

Not hunter pet related, but how weird is it to be able to skin Worgens again?

No it wouldn't be okay but it's just a guild name so I wouldn't bat an eyelid about it. Doesn't ruin my experience or my day.
---
Alliance has humans that start in Elwynn Forest near the city of Stormwind, dwarves and gnomes that start in Dun Morogh near the city of Ironforge, and night elves that start in Teldrassil near the city of Darnassus.
---
If you plan on playing together, I'd suggest sticking to humans/dwarves/gnomes as Stormwind and Ironforge are linked by a tram. Night Elves start on a completely different continent and it's a long run, especially at level 1, so you would both want to be a night elf in that situation.
---
As far as complementing classes, the most beneficial would be having a melee character like a paladin/warrior/rogue/druid and a ranged character like a mage/warlock/hunter, even better would be a healer like a paladin/druid/priest.
---
I never played Horde, so I can't speak much to their starting zones.
---
Only 2.5k? My realm is still hitting 10k on weekdays.
---
thats like being sad for a dog but then eating 10 cows a day
---
You're probably doing fine. As a lock, one caveat is to try and avoid lifetapping when the healer is stressed. Personally, I prefer to make it clear that if I'm lifetapping, I know I won't be putting myself in danger and relying on the healer. It's just common courtesy.
---
If you're pulling aggro, give the tank a few more seconds to build threat before attacking. If you're running out of Mana, use your wand more, and for longer periods at a time. Mana doesn't regen until 5 seconds after your last cast, so you want to cast in bursts and wand for long periods, if you're conserving Mana.
---
Pretty sure Game Mechanics are set to 1.12's patch level. Even though the world isn't.

Has Blizz said anything about adding "new" stuff to wow classic?

I don't know why anyone would take a DPS warrior to a 5-man.  DPS are so easy to get and DPS warriors bring nothing in the way of utility that a warrior tank can't do themselves.  CC is actually important in classic and DPS warriors can't do it except by throwing on a shield and taunting.
---
This one is against ToS.
---
I second this. Wouldn’t take imp heroic strike
---
il be honest, when i started last week, i figured "i'm rolling rogue, but i'm not stooping so low that i'd gank people compltely unware and spawn camp people and generally be a dick" well, that idea failed, generally it's a fair 1v1 and their fun and sometimes the horde will res and try and communicate for a re-match which is cool. But like earlier, if a horde tries to kill me when im in the middle of killing a mob, at half hp, i will kill them, and i will camp their corpse till they ragequit.
---
Nicely written. This is what I've always enjoyed most about playing an undead. That slow power creep while imagining its all coming back to me, but a cold heart gradually takes the reins and I become something else entirely. Something far more powerful than I was before.
---
I could see them adding something like a client side Barber shop or Xmog. But don't see them implementing them the same way as retail in classic. Probably already a mod that would do that for client side though
---
Would you rather there be way too many underpopulated servers later on or occasionally wait in a que? Also i dont get whh everyone has to play those way high population servers...atiesh hasnt had a que since launch day but i still see 10000 people everywhere i go even with layering.
---
As someone that sometimes jumps on for 15-30 minutes at a time to check things/run a couple quests in my downtime, I just rerolled from a 15 minute queue time to Netherwind last night. Medium pop, east coast server, no queue time (yet), and the starting zone was populated.

guys i really need help, after the announcement of the free transfers i might be worried of my server netherwing becoming a non english speaking server because as far i know the server thalnos was kinda the server of choice by the Hispanic/Br community, does anyone related to those communities knows if they are going to change servers or not?

Undeads have sick casting and channeling animations, but Trolls have 5% increased damage vs Beasts and 10-30% Haste buff for 10 seconds that makes you nuke people with AM

If you're looking for a skill up you could even leave the materials on the node. Just tap and run off.

The etiquette I try to enforce in dungeons where there's a mining node is to let everyone have a tap at it for the skill up.

I've had to explain a couple times that you can in fact get the skill up if someone else tapped the node first, but once that got settled it was smooth from there.

Not sure how in-depth you've gotten, but there's a lot of stuff with the pet that isn't super intuitive. Have you researched how to learn the different levels of pet abilities?

Same. Anytime I respond to a LFM DPS, it's "Level XX Hunter. Know how to control my pet and turn growl off, and don't roll on melee weapons." Stat sticks give such a minuscule bonus while leveling, they're not worth pursuing. I'm level 31 and still have a level 8 staff of the monkey.

Using serpent sting to start an auto attack over laps the timer and resets the AA causing you to lose dps. You literally have no idea what you are talking about bud. You always start with an Auto shot &gt; SS &gt; Auto shot because when you start an Auto Shot you start at the last .5 seconds of the cast instead of your bow speed.

Thanks!

Why? You are playing the god class

This was the only purple item I got during Vanilla too. I was leveling as a prot warrior and almost pee'd in my pants when it happened.  Never did reach level cap back then, so this drop may have been my peek vanilla wow experience.  
---
Im glad it showed up on this subreddit,  makes me feel pride and nostalgia. . .
---
This is why I’m Horde
---
I actually really dislike the friends list in classic. In vanilla there was less friction and commitment to adding a friend, so I'd add random people that I grouped up with in quests that seemed cool, etc. Some of these people I'd quest with again, and eventually become actual friends with. But now adding a friend is adding them as a full on Bnet friend across all games, which is a way higher bar of friendship than I (or they) want to commit to for some random group member. 
---
TL;DR - I kinda feel like it hurts the social aspect of the game to lose the old in-game only friends list.
---
Ok, seems like I am mixing stuff up hear. But there are still people, how successfully do this. Though longterm health implications are unknown.
---
But my initial point was more, that I am surprised, that no one toke this race way to seriously and adjusted his whole sleep schedule months in advance. Half jokingly at that. It wasn't meant as an advice to switch to uberman.

I've been in the Warlock's position plenty of times and no matter how friendly I've been with an ally or how nice they've been leaving me alone, I will ALWAYS back up another member of my faction.
---
Unfortunately I'm a morning person.. so even if I take a bunch of caffeine and stay up till 2am playing.. I'll be up at 5-6am wide awake and then my whole next day will be ruined.

Yeah, this too. I call shenanigans.

Realms don't have the gold supply yet for AH to really be lucrative. I'd hold it for awhile or use it.
---
Except youre completely wrong bcause those boots arent that great and warden is full on bis. Warden is 8-10× the price of boots of avoidance on every single vanilla server ever.
---
1 hour is just to cover their ass in case things go wrong. Usually these short morning maintenances don't last nearly that long.

Not to mention all the good philanthropy you could do with just a pittance of your hourly wage, it would truly be selfish to not take such a job

So I’ve been doing this since vanilla but I’ve noticed that autoloot gets messed up sometimes in classic.  This is mostly while in a group.  I pick pocket the mob on my opener and like 50% of the time it doesn’t loot it.  Then once the mob dies I get to loot it twice, first normal loot and then again the pick pocketed stuff.  If a group member has loot, I can loot the pp after they loot.  Is this what the speedy autoloot fixes?
---
I’m a warrior if I was a mage I would use it
---
I like to grind mobs for drops and to properly level before moving to a new zone. To each their own!
---
I dont't always roleplay on a RP/PVP server, but when I do it is always as The Forsaken. I tolerate the presence of my "allies", but I suffer no fools.
---
Lol he’s not that wrong.
---
\salute
---
 I said a *bow*\-string, not a G… \*sigh\* Nevermind
---
I could say the same thing about classic v retail. Point is that RuneScape went back to its roots just like wow did and had a huge falling out despite many people wanting osrs.
---
I agree, I just said not often since I mostly did PvP and sometimes you just can’t stop people getting to you. For PvE I agree there’s no reason to use your melee attacks
---
Oh yeah I forget the US is fucking broken.. :\
---
Or when you specced into it but the crit rate still feels like 10%
---
To be honest I still feel bad about it and I might change guilds.  I feel like they have stopped talking to me or inviting me to groups ever since.  RIP
---
Honor is only good in trade situations. In battle, it's a foolish ideology that almost always results in the death of the superior combatant for refusal to acknowledge something as beneficial rather than cowardly.
---
Whoa whoa whoa let's not get too hasty.
---
Taking the basic gen ed classes that didn't deal with my major we're a waste of my time. I fucked around and did the bare minimum for a low A / high B because to be honest, those classes did not help my professional career whatsoever. As long as he isn't actively disrupting class, who gives a fuck.
---
100% yes , the way classic threat works is weird but using a shout generates threat, demo shout generates threat on each target your in combat with, and battle shout generates threat based on how many people it buffs. If you use demo shout ,stick a Sunder on main target , demo shout, revenge , demo shout ,revenge , you'll hold aggro for days,  still use your sunder or revenge on muntilple targets by tab switching and make sure you dump excess rage (unless transferring packs) using heroic strike. Unless ofc blizzard have changed it from beta but I dont believe they have. I actually havnt had a chance to test it yet as I just finished my mage and now working on my tank and I'll experiment later to verify

That should do what you need.
---
If I'm partied with a mage they better make me water, or they die first.
---
druids can offtank, but they take more damage than warriors (no block, no damage mitigation cooldowns), and it's *really* hard for them to ever hit the defense cap so crushing blow insta-gibs are a bigger threat for them.
---
That said, they are used as offtanks in raids occasionally, but usually only 1 in a 40 man raid, if that.
---
Dungeon tanking though, it's arguable to say druids are the better tanks, just because they have much higher single target and aoe threat than warriors.

Do people still mark in dungeons?  I haven't ran pug dungeons in retail in a long time(BC, little during wraith) but I was surprised none of the groups I've ran with have bothered to mark anything.  I asked the first tank what mark do you want me to sheep and got no response.

thanks

If you can toggle it off, there is no point

It is a realm you can move off of. You get 1 day to move off to the new realm arcanite reaper with the realm whitemane. During that day you can only transfer to the server, after that character creation opens up. I’m pretty sure they offer the transfer for a decent amount of time though, they have said anything about any other time limit aside from the 1 day to make sure you get your name.
---
I’ll take your advice to heart. I really really really want my wife to play WoW with me - both her brother and her dad have been playing since early TBC on and off, so it’s nothing unfamiliar to her, but I’ve never managed to build the right argument and convince her to play with me. I guess I didn’t know how to go about it. 
---
She’ll gladly play Mario Kart with me for days on end and spend hours on Zoo Tycoon though. I might have to pull the Hunter trick for this one
---
Yeah, I agree that it's a fair way to decide amongst friends, but it doesn't change the fact that the aforementioned 7 kinda get a raw deal and may be more likely to vent frustrations :)
---
just take a lower rank, nobody notices the difference. Just don't be the guy who uses lvl 1
---
Great I feel old, haha. They're referring to a game series MediEvil that came out in the 90's.
---
Same, but as a Melee Priest I had to compete with a Rogue for the Meteor Shard. Thankfully I had enough gold to pay him to pass and buy something better off the AH!
---
Lets say you have 2 people die in WC closer to the end. You are out 10-15 minutes now. Because this is how long it takes for them to run back.
---
Many higher level dungeons are even worse. If you are also a feral specced druid, then you can expect people dying more often.
---
I don't know what the problem is to just tank. Druids can tank perfectly well tanks are more needed than healers.
---
You might want to avoid these gimmicky gaming chairs and buy a second hand quality chair like a herman miller aeron or steelcase leap.
---
Mage water is typically one water level lower than vendor anyway. The mage was 28. I'm 36. I don't want his garbage water. Besides, even with the best drinks people don't want to let a priest drink. Drinking 2 or 3 drinks in a row? That's fantasy land. Heck, even I don't want mana breaks to take that long.
---
Mage or priest is gonna be your go to classes.  They are casters, so they have very few instant spells.  Mage have blink, counter spell, and fire blast that are not on the global, but they feel very good to execute them correctly.  So you will not have much problem getting in those three buttons when you need to.  The rest is pretty slow and you get lots of downtime to drink and consider your next pull.
---
Settings/Macros/Addon Saved Vars, are only saved on 'UI close out' (ie: log out, exit game \[using the exit button\], or /reload \[reloads the UI\].

That’s an unhealthy amount of time playing a game tbh. You shouldn’t feel good about this
---
Yeah, ok dude.
---
Took me a second. Nice.
---
I did the egg quest in the barrens. Killed a bunch of mobs around an egg when an undead warlock came and took the egg while I was killing the mobs. He also had another mob tagged in a way that it attacked me instead. Then while he was taking the second egg, I died to the mob.
---
Now I have installed an ignore list addon. Guess what kind of people will never be invited to a dungeon from me?

There are coefficients based on how long the cast is. Generally, the longer the cast the more benefit it receives.

I’m sure this will do the trick. Going to try when I’m home. Thanks
---
Mam, the last 7 plus years over had trouble sitting for more than 2 hours to play a game, even for great games like red dead and spider man. But Wow? Fuck man, I sat at my pc for more than ten hours on launch day. For me, it's not full nostalgia that keeps me playing, but the straight up addicting game play.
---
I mean it works either way haha. But being a scumbag at war is kind of a quality actually.
---
I'd pick the meanest one over the chivalrous any day for this purpose.
---
I've never seen a rogue player who wasn't abusive as shit to other players in PVP, to be honest. The whole class is built to enable griefing and harassment.
---
Yeah 50 players is tough, perhaps not the norm for most friend groups but who am I to judge.
---
I was able to roll on a 'full' realm but just dismiss the queue warnings. Perhaps this wasn't always the case as I didn't load up on launch day.
---
I mean I have a feeling once the hype dies down the queues will get manageable but I don’t want something too low population that I won’t be able to get a decent AV game or something...
---
They can't even wait for the bats to poop. The poo must be fresh so it needs to come directly from inside the guts of the bat.

Spamming SM clears is a great way to make a lot of gold. Run it until your bags are full of greys and greens, vendor, rinse and repeat.
---
As far as I’m aware there are only texture errors when your quest log is empty, once you grab a quest is all works great.
---
Thanks, that's closer to what I'm looking for - but I'm also wondering if there's an option to get that heal preview on the default Blizzard healthbar instead of making a new bar on the screen?
---
I HAVE to attack everyone as a mage, they always hit me when im drinking lol...which is always. Im fire spec so even in 1v2s I can get a few spells off and kill them hopefully with a single crit to the face.

I just left normal r/wow. Negetivity and art. If someone brings up good points from classic and how you could implement stuff /rage retail is perfect attitude comes.
---
Left and here i am &lt;3
---
Fuck that guy, Hunters are fine in endgame. Nothing in Vanilla is so difficult that you only can clear it with 20 mages and no other DPS. People 'gon play what they want to play. Plus if you have a big stack of one type of class, they're going to be gear starved. Especially with Vanilla's pure RNG tokenless loot tables.
---
The guild I originally cleared most of MC with had "too many" healers and not enough DPS, so our first Ragnaros kills were double submerge strats. Life finds a way.
---
Unfortunately this is a double edge sword at low levels it sure sucks but if warrior were to build rage on misses in pvp it would be even more unbalanced. Get the talent anger management so if your in combat you build rage.
---
Nope BT is still 1.0 attack speed.
---
Lol That bites, at least i got to use all the mats i sent

ClassicCastbars for target. You still cannot get a very accurate one.

---
Yea same here. Dinner always with the lady. Weekends with the lady. Nights though I can pretty much get in 2 hours of play time (as long as there are no queues.)
---
And weekend nights after the missus goes to sleep it's pretty much game time all the time until I pass out.
---
Professions on the main skill bar...... you deserve that fall
---
I only start reading when the quest chain starts to be suspiciously long. Like I just found out that some random chain of 15 quests with the same name was me looking for missing Varian.

So, you'd be getting angry the same if the guild's name was "No fat neckbeards"?
---
The casual crybabies already destroyed one iteration of WoW. Either play wow classic as it is or use addons or leave.

As a high person right now all i can say is....nice.

this is the only 1g one I believe

You're not alone! My fiancee and I level together. Priest and a warrior - power duo. :)
---
+healing works based on cast time. You will only get full +healing from 3.5 second cast spells. I *think* it's capped at half healing, so anything shorter than half (like instant cast spells) will still get at least half +healing. I could be wrong on that, but I do know there's a minimum.
---
Yeah I’m not sure it will ever peak that high again.
---
Correct
---
Completely. Ive been shaman tanking with virtually no trouble. Just did SM library at 34.

True, but my guild started with about 35 people on day one. Now like 8 still get on. I really hope once all the "sight seers" have quit, we can merge the servers and have a nice stable population of people who are dedicated and stick with the game.

---
Which main was it finally?
---
Don’t know what an opinion is apparently. I’m political science major. It’s always updated.
---
Should I be using sunder armor in both battle stance for leveling, and defensive stance for tanking? Or, is there a better rotation for leveling that avoids sunder. My typical single target rotation is something like this: Battle Shout up &gt; Rend &gt; Sunder &gt; Heroic Strike &gt; Hamstring at low health if they run, otherwise just auto attack.  Currently lvl 20 Warrior.
---
Honestly, I don't know and there are obviously multiple level brackets so it's not an easy question to answer.
---
I’ve got a red dragon keyboard. It’s small and has red back lights. How would you rank that one? I love mine.

I ran it on my warlock and it really increased my dps
---
No the incredibly loud laughing made me shut it off rather quickly. Also, it’s a 1.5 minute clip which  in this day and age is a very long time.
---
Seen the same on Windseeker. There are bag givers in the Horde start areas, Orgrimmar, and Barrens. Some sell no more than vendor, many are giving away for free, sometimes don't even ask for mats. It's legitimately just people helping each other out for the sake of helping!
---
Skinning, the end
---
I kill rogues. The person rolled rogue to gank. They're the spies of WoW. The cost of your fun stealth shenanigans is no quarter.
---
No rogue *wants* to solo their own mob, it just works out that way.
---
I use target of target a lot and pull/tanking behavior varies **A LOT** from tank to tank and rarely do they mark a skull. So I target one mob the tank is targeting but he swaps to another mob or they pull with range and then swap to the mob they didn’t pull.
---
I get that warriors want to get out sunders but with no real idea of what the main mob I’m supposed to be attacking is... it means I end up tanking a mob.
---
Also, tanks, always target a healer first, then mana users/clothies, then your beefy boys.
---
If there is a mob that heals, or CCs they need to die and typically I’ll be in them for a well timed kick or gouge to interrupt.
---
That’s not a bad idea!!  I just need to find a group that’s cool with farming just for that.
---
Literally in the name sake:) I love running to sfk and going full Viking on all the horde questing in hillsbrad on the way. It's so fucking hilarious
---
Who said anything about the gear? Gear is not the only thing that makes a game rewarding.
---
The guy is lost. He posts something stupid, someone asks him about it, and he offers up his misguided explanation of why he does that, then people explain why that isn't good and now all of a sudden it was all a joke and we're taking everything too seriously. Lol. It wasn't a joke when he said
---
*"It’s a 6 second taunt that im trying to train myself to use. With the high miss chance, which was OPs point, its just an extra step I take to ensure I grab aggro."*

---
Well for starters, my husband and I don't have shitty friends that are "concerned about our gaming habits". We have other gamer friends, who are usually hyped for the same shit or respect our hype for our shit.
---
Second, mornings are for work. My husband works, and I take care of the house. It's like a mutual agreement. Self-discipline helps a lot. I know that if I get all the housework done, it won't be giving me anxiety later in the day having not done it. If the sink is empty, the hamper is mostly empty (lets be honest, a family of 4, its never "true empty"), and the floor is free from child debris, I can relax.

People will say this and act like theve never done it
---
My demon names will keep me playing.
---
First up to bat, my imp Karloz. Pronounced “Carlos” obviously.
---
Next, which was a big shock to me was my voidwalker, quite literally named “Barlos”. 
---
I haven’t gotten any others but I’m really hoping they’ll follow the same format.
---
I let others be but if I've gotten killed while questing or running in the world recently then I'm killing the next horde low level I see. I know they're probably pissed but I swear it's that undead rogue's fault who ganked me 3 minutes before. If he was cool then you could live. Unfortunately for you though, you rolled with allied with horde rogues.
---
I just assumed it was normal to see a meme on FB that's just a screen shot of twitter, that's been copied from IG, that's blatantly pulled from reddit.  It's the circle of memes.
---
As someone who has played hunter at high tier I feel very similar even though the hunter rotation is very simplified conpared to retail ot feels a ton better, you hit so hard with aimed shot and multishot it feels like a sniper. The depth of the class comes from the things out of combat too. Am I going to use a bear wolf or owl? Where do I learn new pet abilities like screech or howl rank 2? How many training points does my pet have? Fast firing or slow firing weapon? Quivers look so cool too. 
---
The only thing i maybe miss is using focus instead of mana but thats okay because my whole world doesnt revolve around grinding the same dungeons constantly to prep for raids before loggint out to avoid world quests.
---
Oh you bet your bippy they do!
---
I was actually annoyed doong that quest. I love the kodos, dammit.
---
What even did I just read? Is this for real? Lol
---
Please don't try to punish players who play the game differently than you. The whole point of an open world RPG is to encounter different type of players that choose to be kind or an asshole. You didn't want them to change the game, so don't try to change the players.
---
I like the Tauren starting area. However the Tauren itself is "different" to play. Their character model is huge and that makes it seem like they are moving very slow when they aren't really. Just like playing a gnome makes it seem like you are speeding everywhere because their animation is speedy. The slowness of the Tauren animation can make it psychologically seem like you are crawling. The size of the model also makes it hard to see in front of you sometimes, especially in doorways.   
---
I'm love playing a Tauren warrior, though. I'm big and badass. 
---
Undead just creep me out. The feel of their zones is like a horror movie and can be unsettling. But if you like being creepy (in a non-creepy way of course), then Undead might be a good fit for you.

I was there the day before that, and it was also a war zone.

I wish OP was right. Arcane Missiles is my favorite spell as a mage, unfortunately it only has 4 cases to be used:
---
target about to LOS,
---
target about to range you and is within health to be killed,
---
target trying to cast with CS down (pushback),
---
threat (frost still rarely pulls threat so not really ever useful),
---
taking many hits (but you really should get out of that position and use another spell)
---
It just can't be a core spell.
---
Warning: he didn’t finish the clip. Thus comment is now invalid. Good day sir
---
Different spells have different coefficients that determine how much of your +damage or +healing is added to the spell. 
---
Part of it based on the cast time — the closer to 3s base cast time, the closer to 100% coefficient
---
The other part has to do with level—spells trained below 34 have lower coefficient than those above that level.
---
So as an example: flash heal won’t get as much of your +healing compared to a longer cast time Heal, which won’t get as much of your +healing as Greater Heal
---
Think that was the problem.
---
But... You theoretically charged and then swapped stances... You made the rage go poor yourself!
---
I've snapped up quite a few think blues to let age and go up with value.
---
basically you want slice and dice up 100% of the time and be able to use your finisher aswell
---
so you open the fight with a 1 combo point SnD to get the buff going then build to 5 combo and SnD again after that you basically alternate between SnD and Eviscerate
---
to be able to do this you need to have maxed out the improved SnD talent  in assassinaton (that talent is a MUST for rogues)
---
Yea it works 100%
---
That Wow crack.
---
Don't forget Sunder Armor
---
They were in classic. I hope we get Halloween next month! Favorite part of WoW.
---
Druid is the fastest to level, full stop, I don't know why people are saying priest.
---
Druid, you level feral, but you'll still be able to heal dungeons without much issue. Then, at 60 (or close to it if you want to spam dungeons for the last few levels for raid-appropriate gear) respec resto or HotW. Druids are the third fastest solo levelers in the game, behind mages and hunters.
---
Priest is solid. I'm maining a priest. They are decently fast, but not as fast as a correctly played feral druid.
---
Heartseeker is going to be great, calm down.
---
Gorgeous.
---
No. There are thousands of possible reasons you were dc'ed, the vast majority of which have nothing to do with Blizzard.
---
No clue haven’t see one yet.
---
It's my shift 2 skillbar at least haha
---
The amount of time you spend drinking is the primary deterrent to efficient leveling. You should be drinking as infrequently as possible.
---
Any news,?
---
Where? Other subs I frequent have it on the sidebar, I don't see that here.
---
honestly, we might acutally lose a few people, who are currently with us because Herod / Whitemane were full, but had friends there.   Their friends take the free transfer to new realm, they re-roll to play with their buds.
---
You just resort to “I’m rubber your glue” style comebacks it’s not worth much so I won’t carry on a empty argument with the mentally ill .This entirely started over you sjw’s fascists pissed off about a guild name 😂.
---
Im having a great time watching classic memes 😁
---
Should probably Sunder Armour.
---
That's why I always hated that system. Ground rules need to be set by the leader b/c people have all kinds of interpretations. We usually do "greed if you're just going to sell or d/e, need if you really want it for whatever reason". But in a guild, you can be more picky and let people need for their class' best stuff and not let anyone else interfere.
---
Around 40 people start getting hernias.. Correct your posture, don't slouch, do core exercises like planks. Don't do crunch/sit ups, they apparently may fuck your shit up.
---
Did you play dps?
---
Not if you solo the quest!
---
You probably feel like that because you’re playing what you originally wanted to play now. The grind is hard, you gotta play what you want and are going to thoroughly enjoy to 60.
---
This batching is just feels like 300ms lag so that you could feel taste of old hardware
---
Ahh, yes, it's not classic unless all sub 12 years old play Night elves. Oh the memberberries.
---
Night elf warriors unite! We might not be the most optimal but we certainly are the coolest
---
You call for war when it suits you little lion.
---
Oh Luna gets the best of the best.
---
Yeah, that's the biggest thing.  If you're interested in raiding as a druid, you'll probably be healing.  Want to heal? Go druid.  Don't want to heal? Go rogue.
---
Personally, I dont think tbc took anything away from classic. Some people say flying mounts, but they were fine imo.
---
Thanks!!!
---
It’s difficult to have an alt. But I have an alt that I am playing with my wife(never played wow before); so I can play with her and not care as much on that alt. Otherwise I wouldn’t of made an alt until I hit 60 and felt like my main was in a good spot with gear/rep &amp; etc.
---
Ah, forgot about pet re-training. Oh well, I'd rather my pets be shaking in an alley somewhere then me out 10 silver.

Wailing Caverns is south-west of the Crossroads, not south-east

Yess I’m on bigglesworth but got a bad name and now I can go to anathema where I got sick names
---
That's cooking AND cleaning combined :)
---
I think others are missing something here. Play how you want, but in general, dots are used while questing, but shadowbolt is  used in groups. Most enemies die in &lt;15 seconds in groups, making dots ineffective (on most mobs). You will go oom, so bring some water before starting a dungeon.
---
Unless someone carries you through razorfen kraul you have to wait till you are about level 27+ at which you would normally run this dungeon.
---
Yup
---
It will hold your place if you are quick enough I suspect they are doing it to find players who are AFK
---
400ms
---
Revenge
---
Definitely use it!! Go grind gold somewhere else!
---
If you're in a PVE group who do you think they are gonna want for CC, a rogue with Sap, or a mage with sheep. If a group asks for CC and you apply as a hunter your going to be laughed at.
---
I am playing right now below 1080p resolution. Since I am playing on an i5-4570 without dGPU.
---
The correct answer is that it’s an enormous waste of time/effort.
---
You're clearly on a PvP server, so if you're going by every levelling guide's build you're going to have a hard time open world.
---
If suggest you build a holy Ret hybrid so you get spell pushback resistance and bigger/more efficient heals to help sustain in PvP
---
Long-term I think priest is the best healer for endgame dungeons etc.
---
I am mostly quest grinding as holy priest, it feels slow, but with occasional breaks for tradeskillng and dungeons when quests are too hard, am now lvl28. I play 3 or 4hrs a day. 
---
If memory serves paladins were also pretty good healers back in the day, and can run Ret-spec to get to 60, then respect healing for endgame. I don't remember how shaman were but we had a good one back when running BWL,MC, Onyixia, I think he was Elemental/Resto.
---
This is really useful, thank you.  I can see how downranking could really save mana when I've got +healing, but I'll skip it for now.
---
asmongold brings shame to the alliance
---
I love MikScrollingBattleText
---
That's what I'm saying. Grob is like Emerald Dream--the biggest and most active RPPVP. How active is the Azjol-Nerub server, for example?
---
It’s absolutely horrible. Can’t re-trap targets in instances, can’t trap in PvP. I’m at the point where I don’t even want to play my level 60 hunter at the moment
---
I’m the same player as you and I jumped into Classic. I haven’t had any major issues or pain points and am loving the game as a troll hunter
---
Thanks, elvui auto vendors greys but didn't give the sell prices in the tooltip
---
explain how, with the way he has already explained how your pet works, you need additional buffs to counter casters?
---
the pet is very obviously an anti-magic pet. that doesn't mean that every single ability that it possesses needs to be a direct counter to spellcasters.
---
This isnt convincing, it just says that **Sword spec** proc resets your swing timer, but Sinister strike doesnt interfere with your attacks.
---
What server you on?
---
Retail took a huge hit when classic launched. At this point in the wow timeline I would say go classic and try to figure it out.
---
it depends on the layer you're in i guess
---
I started using necrosis, but shut off the dot-timers after installing tidy plates. It gives you dot timers on enemy nameplates, making it really easy to see where you need to reapply :).
---
Shut up, fatty.
---
Yep, shaman leveling is basically hitting stormstrike, refreshing lightning shield and trying to use as little mana as possible.
---
I can only assume so, 'cos you're not getting Ice Barbed Spear any time soon.
---
Thanks buddy
---
If you're already bored and looking for more things to do before level 10, you probably won't last long. That being said, grab a gathering profession or two
---
I would say add tbc but have the copy character like in the ptr so you have 1 in classic and 1 in tbc

I dont think wow is a game you should start playing at such a young age, the possibility of brutal addiction is quite a lot higher than if he were  15 for example
---
Agreed.

Loktar Ogar.
---
But it's important to chase away anyone who wants changes as fast as possible to make sure it will not become the majority at some point and actiblizz will decide to add other shit into classic.
---
Which features from retail would you be fine and not fine with them adding to classic? One person's barbershop is another person's Dungeon Finder, so where's the line and who gets what Qol improvements
---
I have just done it at 30 and its still a superior to anything you can get at that level
---
I kind of don't mind that though. If I can spend an hour getting 5 tough condor flesh by god something's already wrong with me in the first place.
---
This can be caused by a bunch of factors. However, [the bare minimum of sleep needed to **live**, not just thrive, is 4 hours per 24-hour period.](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=244885). 
---
Seriously, fuckin' around with sleep deprivation every now and again--while not recommended--is fine, but don't sacrifice your health and well-being by continually depriving yourself of sleep. The vast majority of players will not hit endgame for at least a couple of months, there is no rush. If you are having trouble sleeping, try to to breathing exercises with your eyes closed while lying in bed. This method works for me almost every time: Breathe in *slowly* for 4-5 seconds, counting 'outloud' in your head, hold for 1-2 seconds, and then *slowly* breathe out for 4-5 seconds, hold for another 1-2. Counting in your head for every breath cycle helps to keep intrusive thoughts from taking over, but it isn't a guarantee, so you have to keep refocusing your thoughts towards it. There are other methods, but this is just an easy one I've remembered for years and years and it has never failed me when I find myself feeling restless in bed.

Take loans from warlock/paladin friends and quest on foot past 40 for quest reward money. Farm dungeons and vendor loot.

Yeah i made 10g in about an hour of killing the red whelps in wetlands yesterday while watching a tv show. People love those fire sacs
---
After the first expansion classic wasn't classic, any class changes rolls out to everyone so you no longer have the same "game"
---
Yeah but obviously an extra 55ms is going to be added onto both ends of that simulated lag? It's not like you can magically negate physical distance with simulated lag, it will just make it worse.
---
How Spell Batching effect movement commands? Is movement part of the extra 300ms batch?
---
note: my post here only applies to low-level dungeons.
---
As a tank, I pretty much disagree. It's not a big deal in low level dungeons is DPS pull aggro. 
---
I've been running a ton of dungeons with DPS that don't wait and no, I can't hold aggro on all of the mobs all of the time, but I also don't need to. I've only wiped as a result of people accidentally body pulling new groups. I've never actually had a DPS die to mobs, because a healer healing them isn't THAT much different than a healer healing the tank, and I'm typically able to taunt/mocking blow/challenging shout the mobs onto me *enough* that things are fine. 
---
Basically there's two types of tanks/healers.
---
One type does everything they can to keep the group alive.
---
The other type pouts if the dungeon doesn't go exactly as they want it, and refuses to heal people who pull aggro or refuses to use their taunt, ever. Why these people play like this, I'll never know.
---
tl;dr: press your buttons, play the game. 
---
n.b. this doesn't apply at high level where things can one shot the DPS.
---
AYYAYYAYYAYAYA
---
He needs it too. What’s happening here
---
I don't like those tactics either. But it's not faction specific. There's people on both sides that attack you when you're low of fighting multiple mobs.
---
Yeah now imagine getting it at &lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt;
---
thats a 60 / 40  % split.  not too bad, really.
---
Spirit is a very underrated stat, especially if you can't self-heal!  And that little boost to Int will help you learn to use that staff weapon skill all the quicker ;)
---
Do you skip to the front of lines in real life?  Why is it different for you in a game?
---
Was that a humble brag that you have a level 60 Hunter??
---
I know that feeling. After a stockade run as a tank my unarmed jumped from 5 to 85...
---
agreed!
---
Same, Stalagg is brutal. I’m really hoping that if they offer free transfers off to other smaller pop servers that some guilds will leave Stalagg
---
Sunder isn't really worth it for leveling. You can omit it.
---
Can’t speak for them, but yeah, that’s pretty shit too, although it’s less harmful on a broad scale. At the risk of wasting my “breath,” I can explain. 
---
Being fat is usually unhealthy and yes, many people don’t find it attractive. That’s fine. But women in particular have had their bodies commodified so widely over the years that a guild name like this stings more than it otherwise would. You can tell me that it’s “just a game/joke” all you want, but it plays into one of the many ways in which people (other women included, sadly) judge and value women based on their appearance instead of who they really are. Men suffer from the same issues, of course, but in a much less pervasive fashion. 
---
It’s worth making a stink about, IMO, if only so that one or two people might start to understand how sexism and objectification of women affects people.
---
Dad posts?
---
Are you able to transfer multiple characters? Id like to bring my main and my bank.

A rogue tried to jump me while I was killing syndicate. They had a two level leg up on me.

Here's a tip: Don't try to gank a warrior at full HP and rage. Especially don't use evasion against a warrior with improved over power. And against a tauren with war stomp available that can reduce your dodge to 0 for an execute.
---
That is all.
---
Not having premium perks is glorious.
---
Imagine having a high horse against the way the game was designed to be played
---
Pre-44, you're not really gimping yourself *too* much with 5 pts in Shadow for mana regen and then straight Holy. Regardless of spec, the rotation is largely the same for those levels: Bubble/renew -&gt; HF/MB -&gt; sw:p -&gt; wand.

I think the next quest is Journey to Hillsbrad Foothills (https://classicdb.ch/?quest=493) or Time to Strike (https://classicdb.ch/?quest=494).  Both lead you to Tarren Mill... Just don't recall if one or both is Forsaken only.

---
I'm going to go ahead and reject your ratio.
---
Play how you want.   If you have level 60 based aspirations however, just keep them in mind as you level.  Treat yourself to alt play if you need a break from your main for any reason.
---
Do not be afraid to spot heal as required as ret. You'll be a lot more useful than just focusing on DPS constantly.
---
OK, better not play Cards Against Humanity either then? Or look at anything remotely sexual just in case it triggers some PTSD?
---
At this point you're overthinking it. Downranking only really becomes a thing at end game tbh, and even then its dependent on how good your gear is.  
---
While levelling just keeps things simple and use your highest rank heal. So long as you're smart with your choice of spell and aren't overhealing then you should be fine.
---
Guild bank, barber, and some class tuning so they are all viable I'd be happy to get.
---
My favorite thing is seeing someone ignore the fact I had half hp left and suddenly died of a heart attack and my pets still attacking them so they fight my pet only for me to get up and continue the onslaught.

The epic recipe doesn't come until the AQ quest line for the mount IIRC. I'm not even certain you have to have cooking to get the recipe. It's why a lot of people sell it.

Undead - troll mage. Orc - troll shaman. Orc - troll hunter.

I have a 43 rogue on classic. Honestly, it's going to be based on what weapons you have access to. If you have a dagger that's decent, go for it. Personally I used cruel barb until gnomer, then got toxic revenger which I used from 29 to 39, even in solo.

I think this says more about the Alliance than it does about the Horde

&gt;From there on every single bob I go to loot is completely empty. It doesn't say "Fish ran away" or "No fish hooked", the fishing bob splashes, then opens a loot bag as if I had caught one, but nothing in it.

Southern Barrens, Stonetalon, parts of Hillsbrad, dungeons, you got plenty of options my dude. Don't be afraid to jump back and forth between zones if you hit a wall.

Even tho first time is instant, if the mage only gives you 1.5s to hang around, and you have a 1.5s weapon with 70 dmg and 3s weapon with 120 dmg, u can hit twice with 1.5s weapon and only once with 3s, which is 70x2=140 vs 120, doesn’t this make faster speed yield more dmg?

Yup, had someone cimplain in Wailing Caverns about totem management. He also complained about aggro (which is almost nonexistent at that level anyways), and when we called him out on being a dick he left the group and hearthed l.

Good thing qe had two shamans or else losing a healer may have meant something.

I fully believe WoW Classic will run until WoTLK where the retail team has begun working on WoW2 already which will release after WoTLK Classic. !RemindMe 3 years

You were most likely in general chat or /1 you need to be in something like trade chat while you are in a city where you can type /2
---
things like this chips away at your rep he will lose a couple of people he can play with today for the weapon then he dose somthing else bad and it chips away a couple of more until he is effectivly kicked out of the realm.
---
Apply cat bleeds, swap out and apply rejuv, moonfire insect swarm(if you have it, which I highly recommend), bear form and start mashing their face. Bash if you need to root/hibernate/heal. Depending on the class, this usually does very well. Bear form when you’re high hp is very strong. My spec for leveling is 11 feral and 11 resto for feral charge and insect swarm as early as possible. Then back to feral. 
---
Make sure when you’re gearing up to continue to take some int/spirit gear. You regen mana in form, and you need a fair amount of int to have a nice big mana pool. 
---
Also I am not a pro Druid, this is what I’ve seen people do and what has been working well for me.
---
I'm about 30 and think I have about 10g. I've spent a lot of time and energy while leveling fretting the storage logistics of leveling engineering, mining, and all the secondary profs, while also trying to be frugal and make money from whatever I can. Definitely underestimated how much leveling the profs actually costs in terms of trained skills and lost storage.
---
2581 queue??? That's **nothing**. I'm consistently hitting like 8k every single time i try to login outside of early pre-8m or post 11/11:30pm D':
---
The 7-8k queue has roughly been about 2.5-3 hours wait. 
---
Im really hoping that blizz sends a realm transfer option to my server and other people take the bait and switch over to lower some of this queue time. The fact that the queue is so high makes me feel like I just have to keep playing and can't log off to take a break too... so once i'm in, I'm basically locked in for the whole night x.x.
---
Yes. Warriors are still better.
---
Look into something like chrome remote desktop, just log in @ 1-2 pm from your phone or laptop and check it once an hour to make sure you don't DQ.
---
Takes 5 minutes, literally no setup, just have chrome on both devices and make sure your PC is on.
---
yup! For the quest 'calling the reserves' to be precise. Familiar?
---
While i don't have any regret about choosing a warrior, I will definitely be creating alts. It will either be a hunter or Paladin healer for me. My warrior is currently very hard to level (30) but I'm honestly having a great time. To help you out, try not to look at the class that does the most damage or most heals etc., but rather the class you will have fun with the most. Every class is useful so don't worry. GLHF.

Great idea!

Rerolling on a PvE server is the easiest solution, but if these players are committed to staying on a PvP server the best piece of advice I have for the players who get really annoyed by being ganked is:
---
 ***Make sure you are level 60 before phase 2.***
---
World PvP rewards and honor kills will be released, however Battlegrounds will not be released until phase 3. This means one thing is certain. You are going to get attacked (and killed), a lot.  World PvP will be the ***only*** option to earn honor. Being 60 will give you a fighting chance and may discourage some would-be gankers as easier prey may be available. Instances will be a nice "safe place", but you better believe the entrances will be a PvP hotspot.
---

Gottem.
---
It keeps going, too, until the gigantic payoff that is the end of the Onyxia attunement quest chain. One of my very favorite memories of WoW ever.
---
I could see how you would think that, but slower for mainhand is always better. You have to consider instant attacks such as Mortal Strike (warriors) and Sinister Strike (rogues). These benefit from high top end weapon damage, which is typically a slow weapon. Hence why Arcanite Reaper (3.8 attack speed iirc) is so good for warriors. Also, just because you're within range of your target doesn't mean your weapon swing timer isn't being reset. Warriors will charge in and immediately auto and then they'll have to weapon speed timer. 
---
Since you're a hunter I would highly suggest you get an addon that tracks your weapon swing timer (for your ranged weapon). I've never played a hunter so I don't know the name. Basically, it's a bar that indicates when you can auto again immediately. So you can shoot someone, run until the bar indicates you can shoot again, shoot, and then run some more. Rinse and repeat.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Don’t see the point in being top of the Charts..better have a smooth run than wiping on trash so the dps can be top of the Charts though

---
But you’re playing classic wow and he’s not
---
Oooo, that sounds like a cool addon. I usually keep a written list, but that sounds a lot more convenient
---
Ah! It seems like every class has some reagent for class spells. I don't have poisons yet, but eventually I'll have to carry those around along with vanishing powder. LOL! At least feathers are cheap?
---
i REALLY like the loading screen tip idea.
---
also, if anyone is a guildmaster, maybe put it into the "message of the day" that it is a thing.
---
True. But I have always imagined them more of the same size as an orc.
---
You want a slower weapon because they hit harder. Not just your auto attacks, but some skills as well. You don’t need to rely on casting knockback when you have skills that interrupt and lock out casting. You want to do as much damage as possible to them each hit you get. 
---
For rogues you want a slow main hand because skills go off mainhand, but fast offhand for poison application.
---
It's not my fault it's badly designed
---
Thank you so much for the info.
---
Do green quests, they give same exp as yellow and are easy to kill the mobs
---
If you lock one faction and not the other you end up with far worse than a 20/80 realm because a ton of the underrepresented faction will leave and then you end up with a 10/90 realm.
---
Unpopular Opinion: For me, Classic isn't so much about the hardcore aspect as it is about revisiting the superior old world leveling experience before they screwed it up in Cataclysm. I'd be perfectly happy with seeing all the QoL stuff available including class rebalances, mounts, heirlooms, etc. (But then it wouldn't be classic, so much as the removal of Cataclysm)
---
Not just heals. Battle Shout does it to me it seems like.
---
I will next time!  :)
---
I would probably stick with leather working because at this point herbalism doesn’t seem like much of a money maker.  Skinning is pretty low effort.  Herbalism you have to actively search for stuff.  
---
Let’s say you drop LW and pick up herbalism again.  Are you going to get enough of the low level stuff where you are currently leveling to get it high enough to use when you move up?  Which would put you in a spot of not being able to use it anyway OR going around not getting any exp at all while you level herbalism up high enough.
---
Yeah you bet. It’s worth saying dual wield fury becomes beastly when you get some +hit. 
---
Just insane the dps it can put out.
---
I can see that, but where is the line? Everything can be offensive to anyone. Its easy way out how to deal with reports. First and foremost add it to restricted phrasebook. Also I think if you are offended by any 3 letters you have bigger issues in your life.
---
Whats the UI addon that makes the edges of everything black and removes the bird things from the edges of the bottom action bars??
---
The whole character reservation thing shouldn't have happened anyway. If you based your entire guild/community around getting on a specific server, that's your own fault.
---
Human is better than night elf for PvE because of the bonus racial to +5 swords, which is pretty important.    
---
If you're a meter whore, re-roll and go human, if you don't care - stay as night elf.    
---
Lots of alliance rogues will be using daggers as none of the human rogues will want daggers so that leaves more gear open for you.
---
Battle shout generates more threat as long as your party members are in range to receive the buff.
---
Oh I agree the felhunter is good, but devour magic could use some work to make it better and both paranoia and corrupted blood can use a rework. Explain to me how my felhunter is not more of an optimal antimagic demon than the current felhunter.
---
WHOOOSH
---
Nobody quits, they just take extended breaks.
---
Doesn’t everyone have boobs? I mean I don’t have girl boobs, but I got those deep sexy moobs
---
Don’t really care to start an argument here but do you really think anyone’s gonna remember the dudes name in a week? 
---
Not defending the guy but he’ll prob get away with it.
---
I haven't seen any herbs around, any addon recommendations?
---
Also PvP on retail is a LOT different as you can just fly and almost always avoid world pvp.
---
I love this! I’m going to use it as my phone wallpaper if that’s okay with you.
---
When you think about it, the natural rule is:  
---
1) If it's a green/blue item of little value  
---
Need on it if it's something you would use right there and then. People who can directly benefit from an item should have priority over people who just want to sell it. Greed if you just want to sell it.  
---
2) If it's a blue/epic that is very valuable (depends on level but let's say 30g+)  
---
Everyone should need on this item. Sure it could be a decent upgrade for some guy, but the gold value you'd get from selling this item is probably worth far more to everyone than the stats that guy would get from it. Chances are even if it would be an upgrade for you you'd be inclined to sell it anyway because you can get some big upgrades with the money and still have something left over. Especially if you're just leveling to 60 you'll probably replace the valuable item later anyway, better to save the money. So everyone should need on it.

Thousand needles and shimmering flats have tons of quests you missed out on around 27ish , see if those are green for you . You’re the right level for shimmering flats . Solid 6 quests there with chains that lead you elsewhere
---
Exactly..makes me wonder if they made it to STV....they sound like a bunch of pve cataclysm or later kids.
---
I knew it was going to be purple monster song
---
Nerd lol
---
As long as everybody lives and you did not run out of mana all is good. I've always preferred any heal that is close to the same cast time as the GCD to go back to the greater heal on the tank.

Murlock noises

Log in queue
---
I have zero interest in Raiding, World PVP, BGs and Open World PvE will be my jams.  
---
Right now I am playing a Warlock, Druid and a Warrior.  
---
What future am I looking at with these three classes without Raid Gear?
---
Don’t do it solo then. One or two friends is all it takes.
---
They asked what happened. You told them. Who cares.
---
Do you dare come for me, wretch? I am suggesting how tyrants justify such atrocities. I would never suggest our great lord would spam channels, because that has a negative connotation of his teachings. I only spread the good word, yet we must understand their ways before we can strike back. This world may not be prepared for Hat, but Hat will shine in the light as we all ride behind him. We must find these non-believers and mute them.
---
This is the consequence of sorting by new I guess.
---
You'll want to buy all the grimoires for imp and VW, yes. Specific spells for other pets like seduce for succ and devour magic for FH.
---
People say to use RB on a slow weapon because generally speaking, FT scales better for a fast one. Personally I prefer rockbiter all the way until 30.
---
Hunter pvp is beast master you use beastial wrath and then you win your weapon dont mean shit
---
Hunter just needs a decent range weapon. Youf pet will do the tanking for you.
---
Multi &gt; feign at start of combat, dominate those meters
---
Spirit warrior is bis
---
Definitely feeling that, all my thoughts are classic while im awake. Waiting until it starts spreading to my dreams
---
It frees up s as a keybind.
---
Feline Swiftness, yes I have it, but it’s not enough to get away on it’s own. Also, it doesn’t work in any buildings, and dungeons mobs can typically catch up to me if the team wipes. That’s my opinion on why Sprint is much better, at least it gives me a chance to get out of range.
---
These are what ruined the reputation of hunters back in vanilla. I always had to prove to people that I was not a retard with a bow.
---
I am glad that this time as a priest main I won't have to deal with this shit.
---
Nice. Thanks!
---
&gt;  and ran me off the ship

Can't do that with fear

Gross, I can't imagine Reddit without RES! To each their own, I suppose.

But they all get to keep their precious names!!

Step 1: cast curse of elements (helps mages)  
---
Step 2: cast shadow bolt  
---
Step 3: see step 2 (or life tap if needed)
---
Technically WoW honor is the death of a *non-trivial* enemy faction. If you're killing green and up you get honor (in phase 2), but greys have never been honorable kills
---
Oh I know how to use it. However, read my version of the same spell. It does the same purge/dispel effect but it also frenzies the felhunter instead of healing it. That frenzy means the mage can't get casts off easily at all.
---
Gotta taste that gnome asscheeks before eating it out.
---
Mind sharing your addon files for this specific addon? Author deleted the page.
---
Yup already started a new character in another server, and probably will not play with those peeps/server/guild that I initially join on the full server due to people doesn't wanna change server.
---
Don't get why people keep making these posts. If it's upgrade roll need and if not then press greed. Don't give me that bull about gold for mounts etc. If that's the case I'll roll need on every green because I'm an enchanter.
---
I saw them start to panic as I swatted them with an over power crit. They popped a healing potion but it wasn't enough. Then I used war stomp to stun so I could land the last auto attack.
---
What realm were you on because thats exactly what happed to me but I was eaten whole by the crokolisk lol
---
&gt; Pets use modern's pathing so they just freeze in place until you walk far enough away for them to teleport to you
---
Completely false. Pet pathing is absolutely dogshit awful. 
---
Your pet struggles to consistently hit targets moving without a slow effect on them, and even then it's not as good as a stationary mob.
---
but what if it's written?
---
My heart wants her to be a warrior, just to imagine grandma holding the line against raid bosses.
---
Oh no, poor streamers, now they have to deal with queues to make money playing video games
---
Shamans/Hunter can be a bit of an issue, but aside from purging hots(which is obnoxious) and Scare Beast (which you should be able to avoid if you're smart) I didn't have much of an issue with them 1v1.
---
People who want changes should play BfA. BfA has loads of changes
---
That was my first thought xD
---
for psy1 too :D?
---
I wonder if there are Chinese who have nostalgia of farming in EPL 15 years ago
---
Seeing as he took a picture of his computer, I don't believe the lack of a computer is preventing him from using a computer.
---
He's the kind of person who goes to McDonald's and asks to speak to the manager because his pickles were too small.
---
Oh man, the real life struggle is real. I feel for you, but at least you missed alot of the que shitstorm
---
which one isnt?
---
I would imagine you'd have a mount and riding skill before people are leveling an alt.
---
I dont believe they have released a specific date/time. Just that "they will let us know". I would say prob before/by this weekend tho
---
A large number of classic 'rotations' are nothing more than an elitist invention in order to maximize dps output. Blizz never intended Warlocks to be spamming shadowbolt, or mages to spam frostbolt. I doubt Blizzard even designed the classes around this idea of sticking to strict rotations when they were developing them.  It wasn't until TBC that they fully embraced the idea of a raiding rotation. 
---
Vanilla classes were more about flavor / immersion, and less on efficiency.
---
Thanks, if it gets me to 35 i should be able to do the red quests in the other zones. I have no idea how people level so fast
---
There’s a 28x36 on his society6 page along with a bunch of other prints!
---
I'll say this again, it does not fucking matter whether the weapon is mainhand (can only be equipped in the right hand) or onehand (can be equipped in either slot). Okay? It literally does not matter for my question. I said that I play rogue and I said that my right(main) hand does not have poison on it. It doesn't matter whether I have the mainhand or onehand equipped in the righthand because it's still the MAINHAND. Just how thick are you? This is getting tiring
---
Not a bad idea!
---
This is sick and I’m here for more
---
They wont stop until you stop giving them attention
---
Hmm I remember just double tapping it and it working flawlessly most times. For that vid I set my pet to passive a few seconds before trying the macro, as well as being completely still
---
No idea how you ran out of quests I am guessing you are missing an absolute ton. I would recommend getting a quest addon like questie or classsic codex. First one looked nicer second one works better. Also shimmering flats in thousand needles isn't really until lvl 35-37 so I would not go there yet.
---
Do you want the classic experience or not?
---
That makes more sense to me. I thought you were talking about more than just a few underperforming specs.
---
I feel like its a lot higher than 5%, As a lvl 52, I don't know that I'm even in the top 5%.
---
I can play that game in....1 tap.
---
Gear is like 75% of healing power while leveling. You could respec but you'll have to judge for yourself whether that 25% is enough to put you over the top, and if it's worth the cost.
---
Healing sets are fun to build so I'd just try and find some convenient options and go with that.
---
You are not the asshole
---
STOP IT OR I HEX YAH!
---
I was completely unprepared for how crazy that quest was. My wife and I did it together around level 26 (she's a druid), and it took a heckin' lot of work.
---
Me and a buddy used to plan our evenings game time by using Thottbot in computer class. I'm falling in love again with Classic.
---
DM = Dire Maul
---
VC = Vancleef (Deadmines)
---
To clarify, talents that reduce cast times like Divine Fury do not reduce the coefficient right? Cause that'd be really stupid...
---
Will this also tranfer the guild (obviously not the rest of the characters in the guild) with the guildmaster?
---
This has been my favorite thing. I didnt think that so many people were doing LAN parties but its great!
---
It generates rage irl
---
The lvl 20 rogue quest was damn hard.  And its a quest you need to complete to learn poisons, an essential skill for rogues.  Of course it gets much easier as you're a higher level but when it becomes available at 20, it's hard.
---
Go play retail then, scrub!!
---
That's a good way to stop your heart or shut down your kidneys, holy shit. Drink some water my dude!!
---
Have you trained new abilities? If yes, have you put them out on your action bar? Higher rank of a skill does not come to the action bar on its own..
---
My concern is that people on stalagg purposefully avoided faerlina to avoid streamers. can we expect to stay away from them if we transfer to heartseeker?
---
:) Thanks!
---
I read it, I don’t think it needs the buff, that would be incredibly over powered. I would also like all of our spells to also cause a fear effect but that doesn’t make sense.
---
I just ignore them but you are right
---
I would like a refactor of Outland (not the massive immediate gear spike) to be traversable without flying mounts with new ramps and flight paths.  The classes still had classic wow feeling in bc so not much change needed there.  Would not add paladins to horde or shaman to alliance though.  But I would add the new races sans those classes. 
---
If flying mounts are added give them flight stamina like a fatigue bar in deep ocean and possibly a 15 second combat debuff after dismounting after flight.
---
After bc though they would have to redo classes if they were going to refactor Wrath because this would need to keep the uniqueness of the classes that classic and bc have that was begun to homogenize in Wrath.  All itemization would also have to be redone to keep it more in line with small increased power.  But the map and mechanics could be retained.
---
After that I would do a new expansion called Emerald dream with azeroth and kalimdor having alternate dimension version that had portals to switch back and forth where large cities are in the original world.  Here you could have an invasion of some sort trying to destroy a pristine and brutal world.
---
Brave
---
I agree if they are going to use it and equip it then it's theirs hands down.
---
Questing is prohibitive in STV on a PvP server.
---
Yeah, fuck your rogue tippy toe bullshit
---
Can't see hit chance in classic, same as you can't see block chance for a prot warrior for example.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats - is an addon which will let you see those stats in game on the character pane.
---
Except, yknow other people using spy directly impacts my gameplay experience, not just theirs.
---
I have multiple solutions.
---
1) Remove layering completely on high level zones (though this may be hard to implement technically)  
---
2) Simply add a cooldown to layering, like once every 30min. Would be a bandaid fix and a bit annoying but much better than what we have now.  
---
3) Add a cooldown to xp gain and gathering resources every time you hop layers. This way you couldn't abuse layering for leveling or camping rare items. You can tweak this idea but basically the idea is to target the people who abuse the system. Could keep the xp gain but the resources are really the big problem. Like you shouldn't be able to gather herbs right after layering, period.
---
Have they posted analytics yet for faction balance?
---
Cool! Do you know what the NPC is called? Or where in Darn they are?
---
Certain sort of crowd? Dare I ask?
---
It's also not even the right word to use as an insult here - the hunter isn't being stupid, they're deliberately being an asshole
---
I know my playtime is pretty damn high from sitting online for hours a day while I’m afk. I just use click to move and Remote Desktop to move my guy a little.
---
If you’re on a server with queue times I think it makes sense. I wait hours to get into the game and then I just want to use my limited time leveling up to try to catch up to my friends. I’m not going to start combat with someone if it’s a 50% chance that it will lead to a 5 minute walk back to my body. Even if I win the fight there’s a decent chance he will come back with a friend and I’ll get camped for 10+ minutes. World PvP isn’t a good use of my limited time right now. I’d rather try to be friendly with the enemy until 60 or at least I’m caught up with my friends and then the PvP can start back up.
---
Well not anymore :(
---
Humans have much much better animations and gear looks better on them
---
reckful would be proud.
---
Dont forget to buff their mobs with curse of recklessness! The only reason to get higher ranks of that spell
---
Sunder armour though..
---
You likely have used the word many times while running the streets of Portland destroying property and assaulting innocent bystanders with weapons. I just want to let you know that i will never censor myself to accommodate anyone’s insecurities or soft feelings. Attempting to oppress people’s freedom of speech isn’t on the menu fascist.
---
&gt; But it's value compared to what? We were never going to have the same economy from original vanilla. Players know far too much now.
---
This isn't assured because certain resources have limitations to their availability; devilsaur and black lotus are probably the most famous examples. Its almost immediately obvious there is an economic change by removing those limits (layer hopping to get a new spawn).
---
I waited an hour in the queue to log into the server.  You think I'm gonna log out now?
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure my server during vanilla WoW was actually "low" and it was still perfectly fine.  The community was much more tight knit and we still had one of the top guilds in NA that killed Kel Thuzad.
---
It's probably fair to say the retail game now is geared toward a much different audience than the original appealed to.  Classic WoW's release seems to be highlighting what the game has lost, and the appeal the original still has.  Hopefully, this will result in something which appeals more to the crowd who prefer the original game's design, and goes in a much different direction than retail took.
---
Draintanking is the best way to level since VW past lvl30 sucks ass, can't hold agro at all, and deals less damage than a naked melee mage.
---
And while the imp is viable with Draintanking (because he is an unlimited mana battery), the succubus is indeed preferred most of the time because she doesn't need her mana to deal some dmg.
---
Good question! But since Blizzard wants to remove layers before phase 2 (PvP patch) it shouldn't be an issue on the long run. And for the time being, maybe sometimes you'll end up on an alliance only layer but next time you log on it may not be the case.
---
Every swing has x% change to miss, and your off hand will hit like a wet noodle. 2h is much more efficient and the only way to effectively hamstring kite if that’s something you intend to do, because you time it with your weapon swing
---
Well, duh. It's supposed to be insulting, that's the whole point.
---
Noob here, can u use bandages mid fight? That's a game changer if so.
---
I have instakill hacks and flying mode. also I can DDOS the servers and other even more illegal things that would get police and SWAT involved. I guess I should do all these things because they are options.
---
Im not going to though because Im not a sack of shit.
---
It might seem like everyone is around the same level as you, but the zones lower than 30 are still absolutely mobbed. Especially on weekend evenings, when most of the players are actually available to play. If you are seeing a disproportionate amount of high level players online, it's probably at odd hours or because you're in higher level areas exclusively. Not representative.
---
Sorry for the late reply and thank you. How should I balamce between str and stam? Does one have higher priority over the othe
---
Haha you underestimate the weekend sleep in 2AM to 2PM I'm sure some people pull off.

---
Fear will keep them in line.
---
Fear of this warlock, and what it can do.
---
Those mail pieces are way better than anything they would get from quests until near 50 probably. But they might not even get something for that slot until 60. My rogue is 49 with red defias mask because the only two masks I saw drop I lost the rolls on. At this point I refuse to use the ah to get a new one.
---
Play what you want to play. The game isn't going anywhere.
---
I'd feel pretty no changes tbh.
---
I'm quite new to wow in general but really wanted to do a druid tank even after hearing about it being shitty, but I'm liking it so far.  I really like the micromanagement of keeping aggro.  Keeps me involved and not bored
---
Had to /ignore Ghunt just in case he'd be on my realm.
---
they uso, thank you for your post. I tried that too, but issue still happens. I guess its some weird windows related issue but i cant get the hang of it. I am playing in windowed (fullscreen) too. It does not happen in regular window mode

Why do you assume this is in the US?
---
Yeah, Priest is certainly good.  Decent kill speed and extremely efficient, but if we’re talking about raw speed it’s Druid hands down because of Travel Form.
---
Better than Retail if you're new to MMOs.
---
In Retail there's so much to do (questlines, mini-games, unique expansion mechanics, etc.) that it can be overwhelming when you're trying to learn. You also fly through the levels in Retail, and there's very little challenge until endgame raids - good for a powertrip, bad to learn the game and your class.
---
Care to explain? How is a lvl 60 ret pally not better to bring then a lvl 57 hunter?
---
U sure this isn’t ESO or something?  Please share whatever you’re doing to make your screen look like this.
---
My point was that you had no point.
---
Yeah I guess it can be done earlier if you do a run just for this boss. Though I found the other parts of the quest too tedious when I was level 22-23 and did it later.
---
At least shammy gets SS eventually. Pally has to wait till TBC for Crusader Strike.

YTA. It doesnt matter what his reasoning is behind it. It's not his responsibility to stay your entire instance. We all do instances to get what we want. He got what he want and left. You didnt ruin anyone's rep besides yours.
---
This subreddit is what reeled me in, too. Safe travels, friend!
---
Except the presence of content does not a good game make.  Super Mario Bros has very little content (the original NES title), but people will always come back to play a great game.
---
You're so welcome! It gives your pets a bunch more depth and I honestly find it fun to do, if a bit time consuming. Usually when I play a hunter I take the time once every 5 levels or so to run around and make sure I have all my pet skills up to date. Some will open up at later levels too, there are skills you won't be able to tame an animal for until like level 30+. I hope you have fun with it! :)
---
I rolled 3 alts, a hunter, druid, and a mage, dunno which to level first! Rogue main just hit 25, should I wait to lvl an alt til later so the early zones aren't so fresh in my memory? (As memorable as "collect x/kill y" can be I guess)
---
Went skinning/LW on main, should I just pick another pair on my next alt? Or should I do something a bit more ambitious like dual gathering then switch to crafting/dual crafting later?
---
This is what I'm thinking is likely happening. I'm getting pushed into a horde layer because I logged on later. Also I think the alliance are higher levels on whitemane currently so the curve is skewed.
---
The first 10 levels of rogue are brutal to the inexperienced. 1 dagger, that misses half the time, and every quest mob may as well be hogger.

I’ve been trying to go addon free but holy heck is the quest log bad without one.
---
Do you guys think I would regret rolling a hunter? I heard they are not so sought after in pve endgame and have a bad reputation. I love the gameplay but I fear that I will have a lot of trouble at 60. it feels like every dd class is better then hunters.
---
They're viable, so are druid tanks. Even shaman tanks are viable.
---
But it pales in comparison to the might and sheer raw power that is a Warrior tank. That's all people are saying
---
Where it is irrelevant. First sentence still stands.
---
I understand that, I'm asking how the community would feel. It's a discussion board for a reason my guy.
---
what a millenial post
---
Knowing br players, they will likely do the exact opposite of what you want.
---
Sure, imo these items should be available before reaching the hardest content in the game (dungeon drops, professions, rep gear, previous raids, anything beside the last raid really) so that this kind of gear can be used while progressing through the raid rather than after.

Who they had funneled all their fire resist gear to...
---
i mean 9 times out of 10, it is about who get the jump on the person and the gear they are wearing.
---
a warrior wearing dungeon blues vs a hunter wearing quest greens with the warrior opening up means you are dead, and vice versa 
---
getting the jump on someone typically have a large influence since more likely everyone is in a mix of blues and greens atm tho.

---
I find it amusing how people assume I "oh my I will take a pic with my phone amd upload it to reddit".
---
People are triggered because they are haters. You cant be mad and upvote in the same time, as clearly people do in this comment section lol
---
FUCK THE BNET FRIENDSLIST DEAD ASS.

Do you want kidney stones?
---
Because that's how you get kidney stones.
---
Get some H20 in you, homie.

Why is it generally hunters that behave poorly like this?
---
Mirage Raceway has been added!
---
Slower weapon is better due to instant abilities that make use of weapon damage. Multi shot is the best example of this. Instant cast ability that adds marginal damage to your attack. 
---
The slower your weapon, or more accurately, the higher your weapon's damage range, the more value you get out of multi shot and aimed shot.
---
Irrelevant. Only matters if your the bat in the way of the party going through RFK. If you chilling in the far corner, who cares? You'll live.
---
Nah I've gotta agree with you. People were yelling for more servers before release. Had Blizzard had more of an idea than the community they would've done things to prevent the issues.
---
You clearly lack reading comprehension skills lol.
---
So far leatherworking has been a gold-sink for me and not worth it
---
I love seeing someone give me underwater breathing in ratchet and then i jump into the water and change to water form.
---
In vanilla higher quality directly correlates to better stats at a given ilvl so a blue ilvl 34 axe will have a significantly higher stat budget than a green ilvl 34 axe (worth mentioning that pre-60, ilvl is almost universally equip-level+5)
---
White damage constitutes a huge part of every melee class's (and hunter's) damage in vanilla and because the overwhelming majority of your white damage *will* come from your weapon's base damage range a lower level blue weapon with garbage, irrelevant stats will very regularly be an upgrade over a higher level green weapon with proper stats.
---
For a perfect example of all this, many people might look at [Wind Spirit Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6689/wind-spirit-staff#comments) and say "That's clearly a garbage stat stick for priests only" not realizing that for warriors/shamans/hunters it's a melee DPS upgrade over almost every green weapon for the next 8 levels.
---
Yeah I mean not only is the company I work for 10k plus I literally work with the IT security teams. If I even had a external drive on me eye brows would be raised.

"Camping"

Is it gluten free?

I feel like you could not have missed the point harder if you tried. Am I being trolled?

Also let me know your ign so I can be certain to never group with you lmao.

Why didn't you kill him after?

This is awesome! Lot of people in the comment section need to leave their server for a minute and relax. Not every class is super important. Keep doing you!

Gatherer
---
Haha that's what she said.
---
Uh, yes? Would you have people thrown in jail for saying their observations? You must be incredibly young.
---
You have some weird hot keys my friend.
---
Dropped on my first run. I think it's that type of quest item that drops from the same mob for every player. At least in my run everyone was able to loot it off of the same mob. Loot setting was the default group loot. I guess you might have been either unlucky or maybe missed to loot it on some mob.
---
I always imagine that you beat the centaur up so bad that both of its ears got mutilated.
---
1 shadow priest per raid for shadow debuff for warlock raid members. Really fun pvp. High skill cap. You level with a wand like locks. Dot and wand. Very niche, fun, high skill cap. Chance to be a healer if you get bored dps. Holy is best healer in game. Go on youtube and type "&lt;class&gt; classic Wow" and every class has a 30 min summary video.
---
There was no que
---
Sap, vanish, blind, loot, sprint :)
---
Right now I'm using two pretty shitty green swords. I saved my green daggers, again also pretty crappy just in case I need to switch back. I have plans to go for Cruel Barb whenever I'll be accepted into DM groups. Should I try to get 2 for dual weilding? Or use Cruel Barb and a dagger? Idk
---
If the sysadmin knows what they are doing they block things like games.  I know I did lol
---
No no no, why hardly any love for Anathema! It’s new too!
---
It a crazy good deal lol. I wish I could find some cheap level 15 food too.... 5 silver is insane and I'm a warrior who needs a lot of it
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Someone’s on the way back to retail.
---
A lot of healers tend to ignore me when I life tap haha
---
I like the pain. I love leveling the spec i am going to play at cap. Might not be the most efficient, but at 60 i will never DPS, so i start prot and die prot. I do all the tanking for my group, so it works out and lets me learn the spec while i lvl.
---
I was surprised how quickly it happened. Now I'm spending my work days planning my next leveling session.

Azeroth Autopilot

Layering has no effect on realm population or queues.  Layering is just there so that you didnt have 1000 people trying to quest in the same zone.  So it split people up into different "layers" of durotar, for example.  
---
So you'll still have the same amount of people on a server, but theyll all be able to see each other once layering is gone...
---
Medium is still a massive number of players by current server standards.  If layering were removed right now, medium pop would have several hour queues.  Just pick the one who’s name you like best and run with it.
---
It does seem like alliance are less likely to pick fights. First time playing horde for me and I've only been attacked unprovoked like once or twice. Level 33.
---
I don’t understand why they haven’t tried I know they tried to make a shooter for sc but when blizzard was at the top of the game I would buy anything they put out. Weird that they haven’t tried to branch franchises out more really all they have made is a bad moba and a card game.
---
I’m seeing from multiple sources that after 50 or 60 alchemy, creating lesser health potions is the way to go. However I can’t seem to find any info on where to get the recipe and every trainer I talk to don’t train it.
---
Good luck finding a normal group of people not spamming it with mages
---
C
---
You don't necessarily do that. I mean some people do, but they are no lifers.
---
You are right that you are generally relied on to raid as a certain spec. But, all warriors need tank gear. And if you're not the dedicated main tank, you should definitely have your own fury dps set as well. You respec for progression, or if they offtank needs a week off, etc. Maybe the guild pays for your respec? I dunno, these are questions I can't answer.
---
&gt; **Ackchyually**
---
hehehehehehe. 
---
I do that too. It's my method of training them. Once properly trained, most DPS classes can get by with just renew (until certain end game bosses).
---
I grinded half a bloody level at lvl32 on that quest alone.
---
He is all they eat is boar meat
---
Seriously?! You have made my day, friend!
---
I got a demo version of that game with my PS1, and I probably logged 50 hours on that demo. The real game is simply fantastic.
---
The history function is actually rad as fk.  My brain is too swiss cheese these days to remember that stuff.  Everything else has got to go though.
---
you still have time to delete this, dude
---
I care just enough to mock you for caring.
---
Level engineering too. I can feel you turning to the dark side.
---
also just did this quest and questie definitely did not say these Kodos drop them.
---
I get that some people find annoying to die while of hp, bit pvp is awesome. I made so many friends grouping on high level campers.

Join my organization the Magnificent Anti-Gnome Alliance, MANA for short (it's by phonetics) and not to be confused with other... Things.

i have seen a lot of interesting leveling builds that revolve around impale (AM and TM of course) and then going 31 pts to bloodthirst(some self healing).  Using a 2-h weapon in solo play and then tanking just fine for dungeons.  I know the meta was Arms in WoW 2004, but i have seen a lot of smart analysis about 2h fury for classic.  and yes in this thread, i see virtually no mentions of fury, much less 2h fury (DW fury doesn't take over 2h until later raids/gear, from what i can tell).  Thoughts?
---
See, that's the kind of example that should have been in OP.
---
The example on OP is just retarded, Corpsemaker is legit a good weapon for a hunter.
---
only problem is that I had conflicts with modern quest watch.  I really like being able to deselect quests from the right hand objective menu.  Also, modern quest watch does not allow the quests to disappear if they have not made progress for more than 3 minutes or whatever short duration it is.
---
"this is really a timeline." Sure is.
---
Why would you repost something that shouldn’t have been posted in the first place
---
Oof this is really lame. Hope you didn't waste time to make this.
---
Azeroth will never dump you, friend.
---
That's about what I get too. Wife plays too, but she keeps her time more balanced, whereas I just want to play non-stop.
---
Yknow... you could always.... not watch asmongold if you dont like him
---
Trust me, nothing generates more rage than having 5 spells resisted in a row by a level 23 when you're 28. As a mage, I can't even use the rage. I do need another screen now, though.
---
Get her a laptop lap tray. If she played for hours like that she will hurt her shoulder,arm, and wrist.  Do you care enough?

Yeah, I might be punted more often, but definitely worth it. And unfortunately I'm on the NA servers, but thanks! Hope you have an incredible time in Classic, no matter what class you decide on! :)
---
People who want it changed can just use an addon.
---
I think this is the point people are trying to make. If no melee classes need the weapon then it is more than fair game for a hunter. A hunter should never take this over an enhance shaman or warrior though who will use it 100% of their fights.
---
Hhahahah omg kill him

"I'm playing a game right now on my PC, better grab my phone to capture this funny moment and upload it to reddit - looks like shit but it'll get some kramers"

It was added in a later patch, but yes it was in vanilla. Please use it, it's better for everyone if we all use a consistent channel.

U should never hate on someone like this bro. Understand ur frustration but it will make u unhappy

vurtne ?

As long as hes not running me into mobs and getting me killed thats fine!

Stack of 20?

I suggest Westfall. It's a good east coast PvE realm and I've found everyone to be friendly and welcoming so far. I haven't had any problems finding random groups of people to complete quests with or help me out. Also, no queues. :)

I work night shifts, and spend half my time there now playing wow classic ironically

I mean its 1 pm and there's no queue. Last Wed when I got on at 10 am there was 5000 people in queue for my server lol

I'm a new druid player so I was following Ebnnflow's leveling talent build. I just watched another one of his videos and he said if your a middle of the pack leveler you might want to take more pvp talents so I should probably switch this up huh?
---
You did it. You won. You beat World of Warcraft. Kel'Thuzad just cancelled Naxx because of you.
---
Everyone's entitled to their opinion. Even if it's wrong :)
---
I hope we get expansions on classic but without all the crap, just new dungeons, levels, etc.
---
n i c e

Actually, I have been dumped off the servers about 4 times since classic launch

I once had a guy tell me to roll for a chest in the dwarf starting zone. literally the first troll cave. I just told him to take it. i dont get the obsession with chests
---
33 is fine for sm library
---
So I will get trouble at 60, right? 
---
I appreciate your answers but your basically agreeing that Hunter sucks in PvE content.
---
I see alot of ppl uploading builds for warlocks on youtube 
---
but it's all about talent what is talents when do I unlock them ? 
---
also I think I want to be demonlogy warlock what spell should I buy or use ?
---
I took Tuesday off and came back to 95 emails....wtf
---
I never called myself any authority on what is and isn’t allowed. As you said I had my own opinion on “agreeing to disagree”. And I can have that. And you can follow it or you can’t. But I was just stating, and I’ll state gain, that it’s obvious what you actually mean in that scenario. Especially when I myself said how I feel about such a saying and you said it anyways. You meant to say “I don’t care”. And that’s fine, but it’s better if you say what you actually mean.
---
And a discussion between two people? Give me a break. It’s a forum. Your “discussion” is never exclusive between two people and there is no such thing as someone sticking their nose in your discussion.
---
That I couldn't tell you, but the Healbot bar is also interactive and provides a wealth of benefits.  I typically dont like a cluttered screen but grid / healbot is always an item that I make the exception for.
---
You just swim southwest of Westfall docks until it says you are in Dun Morogh, get naked, and drown yourself. Just did it last night to get my Westfall Druid Aquatic form quest done.
---
I also play on Atiesh, seems like a great community. :) I'm part of a very laid-back friends and family guild myself, but there's always quite a few guilds recruiting and I've seen that guild name come up in chat a couple times.
---
If you dont like how people WPvP, if your not ready for anything and everything. Do yourself a favor and roll on a PvE server.
---
So I tamed a wind serpent on my hunter, and it doesn't have the lightning breath ability. It's not even available in the beast training tab, how do I get it?
---
I wasn't about to attack someone that just gave me a hand, and took off right after the mob I had to kill died. He could've absolutely annihilated me, easily, but chose not to.

I love swag

It will be taught by the trainer. Make sure you're not taking to an Apprentice trainer, and make sure that unavailable recipes are listed in the trainer menu. It's level 55.
---
Spam hamstring on a few mobs to get your weapon skill up quickly.
---
How many of the mobs (Defias Conjurer) are there in DM that drop this? Only 4% drop rate.
---
I won't blame other people for really shitty escort quest design.
---
Hey so here is the key to your VW being valuable. 
---
1) every 10 lvs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 you can buy a grimor from the pet trainer for new torment you need to get these the moment you can.
---
2) your talent build may be wrong best lock leveling spec is odd. https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23852-definitive-warlock-guide/
---
Is the guide I use but basically your first 7 point go in aff (3/5 suppression 2/5 corruption 2/2 drain soul) then you go into demo (2/2 health stone 3/5 increased Stam then 3/3 VW) THEN you go deep into affliction.
---
3) don't over dot corruption + Coa then wand and drain soul at end to proc imp drain soul.
---
Lizzo will die young from fat related health issues. 
---
I don’t know why people celebrate that she is happy with her body image. If she is happy that she will die a lot younger than she could do then whatever.
---
That's normal for a decent chair. Anything less is very often a piece of shit in the long run.
---
This in a nut shell. Also it adds a element of or rather thoughts of, "Ohh crap theres a horde ...is he gonna gank me? Is he gonna gank me when I pull this mob?" And so much more. There's even those that no matter what you do they wanna watch you burn. Hence the Troll I /waved to who dotted me immediately and mind flayed me. I just /danced and /lol becaus I knew there wasn't much I could do as he was at least 10 lvls higher than me.
---
That's similar to what mine looked like before and after having children
---
Yes, WPvP sounds good! It's just too often being at a disadvantage &amp; then you're screwed for a while.
---
It makes perfect sense if you don't like it.
---
Gnomish mind control cap
---
Oooo my realm

Ask the mage and lock I 1v2 camped last night ;)
---
So far I’ve been running the following:
---
Details - to track deeps
---
Bagnon - to merge all bags into one
---
Threatmeter - to check threat levels and know when to go full mongo
---
RealMobHp - to know how much hp the mobs have
---
Questie - to find Mankrik’s wife
---
AtlasLoot - to see what to grind out for decent loot
---
Gathermate - to know where I can pick up herbs in the future
---
A bunch of smaller ones that improve QoL such as flight path timings &amp; to show some useful notes on the map

Thats the magic of reading for you! Haha.

It's called WARcraft for a reason.

---
wow thanks for telling me about this, need to install this bad boy
---
We asked for the original game... Addons can fix that if you dont like it.
---
This is the only acceptable name for this guild
---
Just don't go and hide in the exact same spot you just killed someone from, the addon doesn't make you see invisible rogues it just tells you where you died and who killed you.
---
Made me Lol
---
The fee is so low that the time saved by mailing the item outweighs the fee by 10x
---
I don't recall that as an add-on then. But they can't go around removing API functionality every time someone has a gripe about an add-on. I've not seen anyone, nor myself been, negatively affected by this until now. The impact of removing the lfg functionality is already raising concerns enough since we don't know how they're going to do it.
---
I left that bit out on purpose. Don't want people have don't know that twist to be spoiled on it.
---
Ah ok, didn't know Death Coil was at 42, thought it was some special build that completes at that lvl. Thank you for the information.
---
And this is my favorite part of open world PvP. They can't phase away from you, they're locked in there with you.
---
I'm a rogue and I don't gank anyone that's questing/killing anything. I favor hi-jinks like sapping people while they're eating.
---
&gt; He shouldn't have chosen a rogue for his little game. I laughed over his corpse.
---
If he didn't know to then use feign death, he deserved real death.
---
Been playing since BC, you're out of your damn mind. Retail is a mindless button mash fest and I feel bad if you genuinely think retail mechanics are hard.
---
I believe you can make macros for this (it's what I did in Vanilla).  Can't confirm at the moment, but searching the web should answer.
---
Eh my sleep schedule is pretty solid by now. I was hoping the seasons would change. I haven't played wow since TBC so I couldn't remember if they did or not.
---
*Laughs in warlock*
---
Hardly.
---
I mean sure, both hunters taking a nice melee weapon little in the way of a statstick and warriors taking a bow / gun is assholes, no doubt about that.
---
i wasn't sure why that is being discussed, we are only talking about hunters needing on blue weapons for exactly this excuse, because in their eyes their usage of it in pvp and/or when they screw up is some how more important than wars getting them. 
---
Just because one thing is wrong don't make the other right, both things can be wrong.
---
Could I recommend Sunder Armor?
---
Yeah it's something.
---
baby neckbeard nest for sure xD
---
I didn't believe it when I first saw the video. I had to make a warrior and get him as a follower to confirm it's actually in game
---
Implying cleansing Hillsbrad Foothills of Alliance isn't a meaningful event
---
Such stories of karma, trolling, and general delicious and underrated revenge is a major reason I love Classic WoW. 
---
On a similar note - I was questing in Westfall and saw a chest within a gnoll camp. I started clearing them out (large group, so I had to tag a mob then run away while hitting only him until the other 3 would reset and I could kill the solo mob). As I tagged a second gnoll, a dwarf rogue came in and tagged one of the mobs for himself. I thought “great, now I’m gonna have to strategically pull so I get the chest”. Rogue went for the last mob, and I go for the second group that would aggro if I try to get the chest. At this moment, I’m contemplating not taking the chest so he doesn’t feel like I’m stealing it, even though I was here first. We down the second group, I help him out by healing and buffing, then I wait for him to grab the chest. He tells me “chest is yours, I’m just here for the gnoll paws”
---
So not everyone is an asshole 😄 
---
Chest had white and gray stuff in it though - things I would not mind not looting.
---
Skullcrusher in Vanilla was a great place. I'm glad my current classic realm feels even more populated.
---
Plenty exist
---
Yes you can
---
As a mage with 4x more mana than health, I am very interested in this.
---
&gt;Most of us are on our 3rd 60
---
/doubt
---
&gt; So you're entitled to tell people they are fat?
---
Yes, lol
---
Gnomosh long control cap maybe. One of my fondest memories was on my rogue fighting a taren hunter in WSG I almost killed him when we popped his cap on me and all I could do is watxh as my character killed my priest buddy. It was hilarious.
---
I was really trying to avoid add-ons and run like a purest, but this alone has me rethinking that stance.
---
1. Entangling Roots + moonfire + wrath.
---
2. Oh roots went off? Cat form (with +speed talents) run away/kite.
---
3. Repeat until dead.
---
I read earlier on this sub that it tells you if a player has killed you before. Went to download it all excited and then realized everything else it does. I'm with you - ban this, allow a player history addon.
---
I didn’t know you were able to use master loot on chests, TIL
---
They should have talent for that, you miss an attack, it makes you angry too
---
People who are considered to be “fat” or “obese” by medical professionals are unhealthy.
---
Got any other good ones? I lost all mine :(
---
Nah its gucci
---
Thanks, if the console command doesnt work for me I will use this addon. &lt;3
---
We had this issue with our friends group. Some of us took of work so we can get in early and beat the queues. The others could only start in the evenings. This was in Herod and thus it was impossible for them to get in. We had a lot of back and forth but eventually, we all agreed to start over on a different realm. I'd love to go back to Herod eventually, but for now we're enjoying playing together.
---
Well the best 2h weapon for war in the 18-26 range is the crescent staff from the WC quest so..
---
Healing threat is (IIRC) 50% of the HP healed split amongst all mobs in combat. So if each tick heals 60hp and there are two mobs then you cause 30 threat that is split in two so 15 threat on each mob.
---
Speciesist Technically...
---
Agreed
---
What a Ghunt
---
I wish. They lock our laptops down so we can't install anything
---
Thats how we played
---
That's almost worse. :P
---
It just doesn't predict what will happen with WoW at all
---
Yeah Merlin is an orc, wtf.
---
You mean alliance player right?
---
So you either choose death or lower cost gain in groups, ouch
---
"Look at us, we're monsters that can't stop backstabbing everyone including ourselves!"
---
I feel like it has increased chance to miss...
---
My first death in Classic
---
Thanks for advertising, I'm going to download this when I get home
---
First aid is very useful. Cooking not so much. But if you want to, go for it!
---
my friend had a kid born and hes 51 and took a few days off due to that, idk how
---
Yeah I don't mind getting killed in a 1v1, but when it's multiple people a few levels higher than you its like "don't you have better things to do?"
---
Don't buy equipment off the AH, just get by on what you find off quests/drops.  Don't use a crafting profession, get some gathering professions and sell mats (you can always commission a crafter to make something for you, or buy it off AH at possibly barely any profit).  Realize that gold accumulation with accelerate as you get higher level so getting 100 by 40 is not that bad.
---
My point was merely "don't stress".
---
Shoulders were how you could tell which players were twinks in 10-19 BGs.
---
Why are you ashamed? Eating someone is the ultimate F U!!! in pvp. When I had my UD Rogue I loved to waste my Cannibalize just so the Allie knew I was eating their bones to feed my undead soul.
---
I can only speak for myself but for the RP aspect, it makes the world feel more alive and interesting. 
---
Back in the day when I was first starting the very idea that I could run into a member of the supposed enemy faction but be unable to attack them seemed so ridiculous to me.
---
And structured pvp has never been as fun as spontaneous open world skirmishes.
---
My friend is starting a warrior.  What to play with her?  Anything is fine as this is a second character.  Was thinking paladin or priest.
---
Yeah, I've never been one to PK in any MMO, but the threat of it being there is exciting.
---
yes it is, i made it as a gift for 1k instagram followers and made it available for everyone at [Patreon](https://patreon.com/imadreamwalker)
---
Flex had a couple FR dungeon items and a blazing emblem that staysafe gave him. I don't think they had any crafted FR though.
---
I had money alrdy from my main. Its a very expensive profession to level but if you want to be efficent look up enchanting 1-300 vanilla on youtube!
---
I like to go into ghost wolf and do a little dance for the alliance I encounter. If you can't be peaceful to a dog dancing on its hind legs, then you're a god damned sociopath.
---
Paladin is an amazing dungeon tank, and they're excellent flag carries and spinners in AB. Ret isn't a bad spec as what you're made to believe. 
---
People that say Paladins are bad in any way are min maxers. The only thing a Paladin can't do is main tank in raids as they have no taunt.
---
Otherwise you'll be fine. GO FOR IT!
---
But you dont think that other people with an already created account get priority?
---
Yeah, getting world first by abusing bugs is exactly the only thing they are known for (and now abusing layering for farming), so really nothing notable.
---
No, i dont have the time or mental energy for wow again.  It was great but i cant imagine that as part of my life today.  More power to anyone who wants to enjoy it though.
---
I do this on my orc! The hammocks in the inns just look too cozy to ignore. Remove everything but my pants and belt, lay down and log off.
---
i play classic for the world pvp
---
Currently i have vsync enabled. I am watching the task manager when the issue is occuring. Nothing is peaking, CPU idles around 10 percent, CPU Clock is stable, GPU is around 50%, RAM Usage is at 36%. Usage stays stable when the issue occurs. Both monitors are connected directly to the GPU via HDMI and are set to 60 FPS. 
---
The thing i dont understand is that it will not happen, if the application on monitor 2 is not running in maximized mode
---
Good old Philadelphia. That's city hall in the bottom right

Blaze it

gnomish mind control helmet?

Mage sounds like the douche. Look at the say chat above. 
---
Warrior helped the mage kill some mobs, mage goes full on nerd rage for no reason.
---
Hillsbrad last night was an Ally raid group of 50s with mounts hunting down us casuals down like dogs. It was a massacre.
---
Yes, thank you! Gaming chairs are horrible. Just get an actual good chair.
---
It's afternoon/late morning for most people so yeah there won't be a queue.
---
Let's see what it looks like this evening.
---
If you spec into improved imp,imp I is actually the fastest levelet
---
Also weren’t there level requirements back in the day for lvling profs? Like you couldn’t unlock journeyman unless you were like lvl 10 first, and I forget what level for expert and above the level requirements
---

If memory serves, there were plans for a carpentry class back when they were designing vanilla, that would make things like staves and shields and trinkets, but it was scrapped.
---
Same here. My only complaint is the crazy racism. I remember some here and there back near launch, but general chat is thick with it. I've reported at least a dozen people for saying ridiculously racist things and ignored another dozen for slightly more veiled things. 
---
Why do we have to bring that kinda crap into it? Was that there before and I was just naive or what?
---
Why would you have to do that?
---
I really thought everything was darker. Could also be an issue with previous hardware/peripherals such as monitors. Maybe we used stuff with lower quality or brightness.
---
You want to play a classic game and cut down trees? One game three words ( and a number), Age of Empires 2.
---
Shield does not harm Rage generation, never has, not even in 2004.
---
It wasn’t banned dude, they are making a change to their API. All these things were able to function, right now there is just a circlejerk about “NoT mY ClAsSiC”, which I get. But you have to realize that this was your classic, you just didn’t use addons.
---
Got between 2-4h a day. Its like im treating my char as a newborn....
---
we had extended questlogs in 2005 dave,  the meme is not no-addons
---
I waved at a Night Elf Druid and he spat on me. Was hoping for some friendly Cenarion Circle druid bros. Guess not.
---
The only issue I see is if the addon is making and posting messages in local chat channels.  Hidden channels is one thing.  Spamming local without lifting a finger?  That's over the line.  Carry it a step further and all gold sellers are able to write addons that automatically post messages in every channel.  If Blizzard were to take umbrage over this addon, this would be the angle they come from.
---
As others have said, telling others that you saw a rogue at 40,50 in Westfall is not something that should be banned.  Having that information show up on your maps and mini map without any input on your end is questionable.
---
Thank u I’ve heard mixed reviews from people, have u played ele before?
---
One should be fine, you just need it in main hand. You will obliterate mobs. Fast weapons are good offhands. Offhands are weak, but can apply poison just the same, so a dagger offhand will maximise poison applications.
---
I would stick to whatever spec you've got, you'll do fine dps in deadmines. The spec doesn't matter enough to justify spending gold. If the weapons have comparable dps, use the dagger and backstab.
---
I’m only running a 1050 TI with an I3 7100, but I’ll try it!
---
Why must we use autism as an insult? I work with kids with autism and they really struggle...
---
Will post some more when I'm back at my PC in a few minutes!
---
I know everyone wants to play classic but please don't play during a lecture. It's both incredibly disrespectful to the person trying to lecture you and usually very disruptive to people trying to take the course. Of playing classic is more important than the class just do it from your dorm room.
---
You playing a warrior? The emphasis on the dying part makes me think you're playing warrior XD
---
they have a 12 year warrenty. also if you sit in one all day its well worth the price
---
think of it like your bed mattress, you spend a 3rd of your life on it, spend money on a good one
---
Grind to lvl 10 then go to darkshore. Best 10-20 zone by far. Mobs are easy to grind, condensed. Tons more quests so you don’t need to leave the zone, and clam, dark atmosphere that’s easy on the eyes. Did this as a paladin.
---
Where do you get the books to raise the cap for cooking? Fishing is in STV right?
---
yyyyep. (gazes longingly at sweet, sweet medium pop)
---
Yeah, but why don't you fully skill Clearcasting in that case? Seems a bit counterintuitive :)
---
Yeah that was pretty legit
---
Good gear &gt; gold
---
I’ve played a warrior for a long time and i have no issue with someone needing on something as long as it’s an upgrade and they equip it, i could not care less who “deserves it” more, but i’m probably alone in that regard.
---
I’ll win some rolls on 1h weapons like cruel barb that would be “better” on a rogue too.
---
Western part of Duskwood.  Get the Pygmy Spider quest from the guards in the middle of the zone and the wolf quest in Sven's camp.  You can also get the quests in town to talk to the people out there and start the chains that last throughout your time there.
---
Go to dusk do the starters
---
There was a race? I thought people were enjoying themselves?
---
Had this rogue camping/killing my girlfriend and I in hillsbrad for literally 35 mins until I was finally able to escape. I just don’t get the point like I play arena a lot I’m 2035cr this season so I’m not stranger to pvp but like you don’t get honor or a reward there is legit nothing to be gained other than being a huge dick to the person you’re killing. I guess that’s enough for some people ? Seems childish to me though. Once the honor system is released I’ll be doing world pvp by thanking people 6 levels under me is not what I consider “pvp”
---
I had a lot of great experiences with World PVP back in TBC days but I unfortunately these days I barely have time to play as it is so it is Care Bear PvE server for me.
---
afaik: Game Mechanics are 1.12 for classes, plus they've been downing Rag on private servers since Cata. :P
---
Haha, been thinking of doing the same thing with my old laptop when I head up north for a trip.
---
Wpvp is not a series of battles that can go either way, it's usually just executions
---
I wish this was a screenshot
---
i have known people who were friends and met irl and hated each other cuz it didn't go well, knowing someone ingame is one thing but that relationshipstuff can only be confiirmed mostly till you meet the person you are interested in
---
Thanks very true.  I might have to give it more thought, although i dont mind healing and getting gear might be eassier on a pally so will need think this over
---
lol my buddy rolled warrior for vanilla not really knowing what he was getting into. He generates more rage irl then in game.
---
LW doesn't have many benefits outside a few Pre raid BIS pieces that you'll eventually replace. You should stick with Alch if you want money and stick with skinning, but only to vendor the mats while leveling.  The economy is going to be wonky and nothing will have a stable price until the bell curve is there for level population a demand. 
---
Then either pick up Herb to fuel alch or pick up enchanting/ engineering depending if you want to pve/pvp.
---
It’s definitely not 28%.  You can tell because the things will keep dropping even once you complete the quest.
---
Why not druid then? Can tank/heal and pew pew, running fast before mount, stealth, swim, can shift into animals
---
Guild tabbard?
---
Maybe you should get good at grabbing chests, he lost nothing you lost loot
---
Thank you, I’ve been getting hit with one of these at least once a day.
---
awesome, thank you!!
---
I think it's functionally an internal cooldown of something like .1 seconds.
---
Grinding **is** the classic experience.
---
 Nice!

---
I’d say priest but it’s really up to you. You lvl as shadow and have little downtime w spirit tap, and your healing and ranged dmg shores up the warriors weaknesses
---
"without a table" Is that a rimworld reference?
---
Stam is super fucking valuable on pvp servers
---
Actually, I stress eat. I gave up soda 6 months ago, until some redittor reminded me about my physicality.  Can't kick this tire with givin em up. may as well be fat and happy
---
It's expensive to level it and nobody will buy the gear you can make.
---
So it doesn't proc Nightfall? That's a shame. I was reading that SoR was a great way to force a Nightfall proc.
---
Server and faction?
---
Troll’s blood elixir is low key dope. It lets you see so many more Parry, Dodge, or Missed attacks before you inevitably die.
---
I am sure this will solve the problem... good job
---
It's important to teach your cat about the world.. of Warcraft.
---
Perfect. Thanks very much!
---
Come on man, you guys are being so retarded about this.
---
They had a guy walk around and press spacebar so no one got logged out. You're acting like he was getting on the account and leveling it for them. It would be absolutely ridiculous to call that account sharing. Reckful got banned for playing on someone else's account and boosting their arena rating.
---
Might want to consider dps spec priest.
---
Ye lol who am i kidding right?!
---
You don't need to be able to heal for more. You need more mana. You need int.
---
Snide? Is that your default response, by any chance?
---
Reroll him a hunter. He gets a pet that he has to lvl, bunch of different skills, can use all weapons, tonnes of variety there. Or a warlock - similar concepts minus the use of all weapons.
---
I 100% will be healthier, fitter and a better athlete than her. 
---
Without a shadow of a doubt. 
---
I am about half a foot taller than her and roughly the same weight... 
---
I am without the slightest of doubts healthier than her.
---
yea people keep saying that but I'm pretty sure server cap is not increased by layering. It's only to alleviate the crowded areas like starting zones. Queues should not increase, if anything it will just looks more dense in citites cause even starting areas at that point would have mellowed out.
---
I feel like mage are the new hunters. So many rtarded mages these days.
---
Also asa priest I feel like everybody rolls against me.
---
Priest feels really strong in world pvp to me, especially if you're shadow. Unless they catch you without mana or outnumber you it's easy to shit on anyone who tries to jump you.
---
Fury is the way to go man. I leave every fight with 50+ rage
---
Like actual millions?  How can you be sure?
---
No u
---
Retribution is perfectly viable for all of the things you listed. Since everyone else is talking up the Pally Power, let me give you some reasons to *not* roll Paladin.
---
1. There is a *ton* of interest in Retribution Paladins in Classic, especially on PvP servers. I can't speak for how many will make it to 60, but both of the servers I play on are absolutely inundated with Ret Pallys. 
---
2. While they use 2H weapons and plate armor, their bread and butter is not smashing things. You'll be expected to provide a ton of utility, off healing, and a lot of your damage comes from spells/spell based damage. It will be a drastically different feel and play style from the Warrior. 
---
3. People hate Retribution Paladins, even though that hate is unwarranted. There is still a lot of stigma around playing the spec, even though we've been long taught that they can hold their own in most end game content (even if they're a little more gear dependent then other classes). 
---
Most of my Warrior friends have sought out other pure DPS classes like Rogue or Mage to spice things up this time. Paladin might be just what you're looking for, but make sure you know what you're getting into first.
---
And why should we move exactly? What's the incentive behind it? A new realm for less queue times I'm assuming
---
No problem getting into groups? I guess what keeps me away from the class is the reputation it carried from vanilla, I'm worried that people will assume I'm a shitty player/useless class and won't want hunters in groups (particularly in 5-mans).  
---
Which pet would you recommend for tanking adds, both while leveling and at 60?
---
Lol. I group with my 52 y/o mom and her husband. I'm 25. I feel like a kid again!
---
I sold all the mats (charms and liferoot) for 8g on Sulfurus
---
Needed 10 skeleton fingers in Duskwood for a quest and after killing 20 of them (kills were tracked via a kill quest) I had 0 fingers. I feel you.
---
"Who goes there? I have a rope and Im not afraid to hang myself!"

BMI =/= health.
---
Why the /castsequence?
---
/cast !Shoot  
---
Should work fine.
---
Y'all should roll druid, 3 roles in one.
---
I'm assuming it just marks your current coordinates when it sees the stealth event in the combat log? I don't see how it could actually know where exactly the rogue/druid went stealth only that it happened in proximity to where you were at that point in time.
---
I've never heard of this add-on before. Sounds fucking broken. Holy hell.
---
I've had to wait to log into Benediction ONCE, and for less than 5 minutes. I enjoy the server, lots of friendly folks and the memes in Barrens Chat are typically good.
---
Lots of MAGA and Trump 2020 though. I prefer my shitposts in /1 to be apolitical, but you can't have it all.
---
People have already cleared Molten Core, so...
---
I’m not trying to solve the problem just point out how hypocritical it is to be doing this when everyone was clamoring for an exact recreation of vanilla WoW.
---
Be smart eith your spendings. Its not hard to get 100g by lvl 40:)
---
Holy shit are you actually called stone? Never met anyone else with that name, it’s my middle name haha
---
Sorry to piggyback off your comment, but I went through the thread and didn’t quite find a post that says exactly what it does.
---
What does it do that is invasive and game breaking?
---
You'll have to ask the guild beforehand! Many have discords you can join. Mine are okay with me raiding shadow at 60 if I want. They just need to be flexible and/or confident in you.
---
What will hold you back, even with a guild, is the lack of gear you'll be given as you'll probably be bottom priority.
---
I saw one in ironforge yesterday!
---
Im at: Lvl 15 warrior, 12 priest, 11 druid, 8 hunter, and probably 1g total. And that's after rerolling a different realm on day 3
---
Btw, take skinning and vendor your leather! It pays your bills!
---
I hate when I get CC’d on work that has nothing to do with me and I come back to 160 emails but only 80 of them are related to me and 2/3 of those are just replies to the thread. 💀
---
Ok I just checked on wowdb and they claim it's 9% drop chance which sounds more reasonable but still can't help but feel like it's much lower because I've killed so many Dark Iron Agents and not a single drop :/
---
Man, and that sense of achievement feels real. Like I've grinded for levels and levels, and then for hours and hours to afford my mount haha.
---
Eyy
---
your app is wrong mate, looks like you only need 7 hours sleep a day. not everyone requires 8 a lot of people need less. I only need 7.
---
Kids are pretty good at accidental moderation, especially with parents backing then up... Reality of the situation is the kid will probably play less than the parent hoped they would
---
Actual curiosity here. How does it work then?  
---
Unless it is packet sniffing (aka ShowEQ)  I am not sure how it otherwise be getting the information.
---
Youre alpha, by no means are you obligated to wait your turn in line. Get it quick get it first is always my motto.
---
Downvote. For the Horde.

This is just asmongold pets nothing to see here

Ah damn if only my server had those prices!  Come to Pagle, thx.

Stop telling people how they're allowed to play.

im running a lvl 14 paladin right now and i do not know what im doing. i have a couple friends im playing with so i think i want to be a prot pally because i read thats good for dungeons but i have no clue what to use or spec for. ive been using two handed weapons i assume i need to switch to SnS. help
---
Incorrect maybe.
---
ok. Nooblet here... what is wrong with /wave ? Curious!
---
Hmm pay attention and try you say? What about this killing an end game vanilla boss standing still and spamming frostbolt with his keyboard in his face?  [https://www.twitch.tv/naowh/clip/ShakingFrozenLampTBTacoLeft?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/naowh/clip/ShakingFrozenLampTBTacoLeft?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) If you honestly think classic wow has anywhere remotely close skill requirement compared to end game retail content, you are vastly mistaken and very out of touch. As many people have said before, classic is a grind. Retail is a grind and requires a hell of a lot of skill at the same time, to compete at the level players in the top guilds are.
---
Now imagine WoW Classic would have looked like that. Well, the #nochanges crowd would have whined, I guess.
---
And it is automating ALL of that gameplay for you. Break the fucking thing.
---
I don’t know...  if you help someone and they get mad at you...  it seems pretty rational to inform them that they are a douchebag.
---
Normally, people respond with a ty, not a jab at their social standing on the server.
---
I’ve only gotten mad once, and that was last night in desolace.  I was doing the escort quest and found myself fighting 3 centaurs and 3 dogs at once, I went dire bear form and was slowly getting the upper hand.  Two alliance jump me and kill me.  I was mad since I was already fighting a heroic damn fight when they showed up.
---
&gt; uuuuure it was, not because you googled it and realised I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.
---
Jesus christ youre a typical reddit hero, whose the one twisting shit to fit their preferred narrative.
---
How about releasing more servers. Simple. Stop reaching. Paragraphs arent needed.
---
Yeah, I was going to suggest this too. Limiting the foreground FPS to 60 is a must! Because monitors are only 60 hz anyway (unless you have a special one), so they can only display up to 60 FPS anyway. So, if your computer is rendering at say 100 FPS, you're basically just wasting computer resources and making your computer work harder for something that your monitor is unable to even display.
---
At least, that's my understanding. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong!
---
Quick question as I am playing hunter for the first time: do rare and elite npc's have better stats as pets? Or do all pets of a "family" (I noticed there are different "families" of beasts on petopia) have the same stats no matter what?
---
Being able to buy the best or very close to the best gear at the auction house removes the carrot at the end of the leather working stick. 
---
Also because it takes time and grinding to get the materials needed to level leather working, there is a greater sense of accomplishment when I finally have the materials and recipes to craft a piece of gear. 
---
Auction house short circuits this reward feedback system for me.
---
For every good story that happens that is super memorable there are 4 Ganks or frustrating deaths to deal with (when I played at least)
---
&gt;3 60's
---
&gt;Little investment
---
Ok buddy
---
IMO, yes, Shadow. It makes that 40% of the time so much easier, and as was said above, a shadow-specced priest will still make an effective healer until you really get into endgame stuff.
---
i honestly cant wait till the masses hit STV this is gonna be a bloodbath
---
they're not exploits or they would have been fixed since we brought them up back when layers were first announced and reported them in betas.
---
this is intended behavior even if you don't agree with it.
---
Back in my day the magic number was 1337!
---
*shakes walking stick angrily
---
I'm sure you agree the same with people who drink too much or smoke right?
---
Yea I could understand this is we were all mostly playing on alts in the 20s-30s right now but these are most of are mains atm. A lot of the blue BOE drops are going to be extremely useful for people that can use them and their profitability right now is crap anyways due to limited gold most people have available to spend.
---
apparently you can't
---
Stuns are primary used in PvP, yes. I'd recommend opening with garrote as a sword rogue. Alternatively put a dagger on for ambush, then swap to sword for the rest of the fight. If you are in a dungeon or with party members and a mob is casting, you can cheap shot to interrupt the cast as well.
---
Will be downloading and sharing with my guild, and making it a guild announcement. Thanks so much for your hard work!
---
Not really for raiding though. They'll be far more likely to just invite a resto sham to do it.
---
Has anyone besides APES downed rag?
---
Yooo this is sick
---
My tom-tom doesn't seem to do anything, thought it would work alongside questie but nothing.
---
In this version (1.13.2) are the banished mobs in blasted lands already fixed or one can go there and leave the character in auto-attack?
---
*gloom*weed? I need *doom*weed!
---
Orcs look way better in armor and have better casting animations IMO. Of course its totally subjective.
---
*MURURURUARGUGLGRURLGURLGULR!*
---
Totally agree, only a certain part of the player base enjoys PVP. Friend wanted me to play on a pvp server, but I don't want to roll OP rogue for PVP and I don't feel like dying constantly so I just play on a PVE server by myself. Its better than getting ganked by rogues over and over and over again.
---
Sub 500
---
We all have them, but of course mine is more important than theirs lol
---
Btw the highest crit in vanilla wow was from an ele shaman. Think they just stacked stormstrike lol
---

Literally right this minute? No.
---
I already am. Still need to work / sleep / eat / exercise.
---
Maybe I should start playing the lottery.
---
Extreme waste of time. Idk why this idiot streams
---
Its outside the actual instance. I'm not sure how many, but its defiantly farmable. It's also on the AH for 30-50s on my server.
---
Lock all the way.
---
If you want to dot in PVP and still be effective PVE I would recommend the SM/Ruin build. A bit of a glass cannon in PVP without the Demonology survivability talents but still competitive in PVE.
---
Sure, a lot of people alay classic, but it's also good marketing. "so many people want to play our game they even have to wait to log in! what? yes of course we could add servers anytime we want - but look at those numbers tha get posted on social media/news and generate even more hype!"
---
Finish off duskwood, wetlands, or if you have to, ashenvale. But ashenvale is usually a horde hotspot.
---
Dash is 5 min CD though so I save it for when I'm desperate
---
Did I advocate for those classes to roll need on everything? No, I said nothing of the sort and I didn't touch on the topic of loot etiquette/ethics at all.
---
I simply stated that those classes can make use of everything and explained why (in an effort to explain why shamans are prone to rolling on basically everything just like hunters are.)
---
39 minutes versus four hours.
---
That's what I'm saying, it might be a good time to switch to morning-play for people like us. The following is my game plan.
---
Go to sleep at 9:30 PM, wake at 4:30, have breakfast while checking the AH for short auctions with low bids and then go do a few quests, close the game at around 7:30 and go to work.
---
Where do i sign up

The mistake you've made is thinking your lecturer isn't doing the same thing... zoom in to the picture and look at him yo!

Except none of these will fetch you much of any gold for a long time. However getting geared to make leveling easier is pretty valuable right now since that’s what everyone’s doing.

My favourite is collecting human skulls as horde in Hillsbrad. Apparently, they have to be *pristine*.

"Grog not happy with this skull. Has hole in wrong place. *NEXT*"

I don't think the current Devs want to learn anything. The whole "You think you do but you don't" comes to mind. They think retail is top of the heap, the only problem is its the shit heap IRL.

Paladin need engineering. Keep mining also. Can farm arcane Crystal's at 60 for gold

Kromcrush. I'm Horde.
---
I love that projection so much, I think he is equating fat shaming with extreme bullying to quickly, obviously a broad spectrum exists when it comes to 'shaming' and what is tolerable in a society.
---
If you don't go out of your way to shame people, you're probably doing it right. If you let people be and just accept that their choices are their own then you're probably doing it right. On the other hand if you're fat and start speaking up and saying anything that doesn't make sense from a health or lifestyle prospective, well you just opened yourself up to some fat shaming.
---
Curious why you think that.

ohh i see, how do i get there? also does everyone have to have the scarlet key in the party to be able to go into armory/cathedral?

Come to kurinaxx. The server pop hits high around 7 or 8 Est but never has a queue
---
I used to think this was true about me.  The reality was I needed about a week of sleeping 8 hours to get used to it and then I started waking up feeling better than I thought was possible.
---
I can play at work :) and ive been averaging about 2 hours of sleep. as for my wife and daughter, they play too so its essentially our family time. well my daughter just likes to stand behind me on my chair and tell me to "smash the monsters"
---
this addon sounds great, thanks for telling everyone about it
---
Cheap shot is situational, not your main opener most of the time.  
---
If you are using dagger on main hand, go for Ambush as opener &gt; Gouge &gt; Backstab &gt; Eviscerate, It is basically one shot on almost everything while you are leveling.
---
If you are using sword, go for Garrote, which I don't label as useless, its bleed ticks is really helpful and totally worth, unless you are killing mobs real real fast (thats not my case) with just SS/Evis
---
Doing the Elite quest from SM GY, Vorrel’s Revenge, had the target patrolling out to the rocks to look over the lake.
---
On P-Server she just stayed in the house next to Grandpa.
---
As a Rogue, stalking her, outside to follow her to the docks and assassinate her to get Vorrel’s ring back to his wife felt pretty cool.
---
Of course I went back in to murder gramps too.
---
This elite quest so hard to solo on private even with sap and blind on grandpa.
---
I like to chain pull 5-10 mobs to a player who did something BM and Vanish on top of them.  Even if they generated no threat on the mobs they still tends to turn and attack them.
---
I could see it working. Lumberjack and carpenter professions. It could fill in some of the gaps the existing professions have, like crafting bows and arrows like how engineering crafts guns and bullets.

Mob grind yourself through the pain!  And get skinning
---
O philly.  I live there too lol
---
It does not, but it should be good from level 10 maybe to maybe as high as 40. You just need to feed the pet more pieces of the bread, but that's fine! its free and endless, it'll just take a little longer.
---
Google "gaming PC under 500$" I'm sure there's a linus tech tips video about it and even how to build it.
---
What guide would you reccomend
---
Nope.  Common misconception people perpetuate because of cross server on retail.
---
Fair point
---
That’s what is shown in the picture no?
---
It’s moreso the speed in which it was done, and also having the gear to kill him. The mechanics are simple but simply beating the numbers I thought might take more time.
---
Yeah it's kind of strange.  I'll use Rend or another instant ability towards the end of the timer-bar and then I'll see the white damage number still pop-up despite not having an attack animation.
---
At the end of the day, at that level, it's the best 2H axe for main dps classes. Having a hunter roll on this is asinine.
---

Well his translation was off anyway. "murlock noises" translates to "Mrrrgggllrrrllrlglglgl"
---
 "mmRLRLGLRLGLRLLRLLRLLGGLR" translates to "Mind your own fucking business Brett"
---
Yeah they still give happiness all the same. I only feed my pet once every hour or so one of these and im good.
---
Classic only requires a subscription so it should with
---
Hahahahaha true story. Happened to my brother.
---
I'm going to try this. I've tried similar things but not this exactly. Intrusive thoughts are the big issue for me. I basically have to distract myself to sleep and that takes \~3 hours.
---
Is it really that bad to look at
---
It has nothing to do with field of view.  Spy parses the combat log.
---
If your combat log says somebody used an ability, spy will let you know their name, guess the race/class/level based on the ability used.  The majority of the time it can only say name/class and a XX+ for level.
---
Wives are temporary
---
Thunderfury is forever
---
Get your voidwalker out. Once he gets close after you fear him use Sacrifice. His rage generation will disappear and you'll have a few seconds without taking damage to reapply dots, cast a shadowbolt or fear him again. once you gain a few levels you'll get deathcoil which helps a ton too. Curse of exhaustion will be your friend eventually as well.
---
Wow, everyone is soo sensitive now...
---
No need giving them free advertising. Block out the name at least.
---
Yep. This is the main reason I enjoy it. The world is dangerous. The enemy is everywhere. You lose that when you play on a pve server. 
---
Just last week. My friends and I made the run to wailing caverns as alliance.  We killed every horde we saw which in turn elicited a response fr the horde. a group was waiting for us at the barrens border. 
---
By that time we had two other groups running with us all heading for WC.  The border right was a bloodbath. 
---
Two of us died. The other 3 were able to hide . One horde was camping our bodies so we planned an attack. The other group members hid. Once we rezzed we all rushed in and nuked the poor bastard then high tailed it to the ungaurded gate .
---
Then kept as low a profile as possible while running through the barrens.
---
The run was more fun for us then the dungeon. Because it was us participating in the world.
---
Seek help
---
Just play the game dude. What the heck you need guide for? Play your game or go watch streamers, same thing as doing what the guide tells you.
---
Who cares that your way is not the "most optmized" or whatever.
---
Especially if this is your first mmo, turn everything off, and just tune into the game dude, it's ok to make mistakes
---
Just wait till 60 + engineering. You’ll be able to drop a steamer on pretty much any hunter even if they get the drop on you
---
Try planning and building a twink hunter at some point! I think 29 twink hunters just ate people alive in vanilla
---
This. Exactly this.
---
Might seem like no connection. But if you remove the need for social interaction, you find society begins to suffer; be it in a game or in real life.
---
It's not necessary in retail.
---
The best nutshell as this question is asked all the time.
---
Retail = solo game with really no challenge outside MDI for the .01% elite.
---
Classic = players helping players becasue it's a challenging game. A +1 stat in classic can make the difference between life and death, You need to know you r class and how to creatively use you toolkit.
---
Get on that sparkling water bud, you don't need those surgar dumps. You're not overeating because of stress you're overeating because it feels good, fat and sugar will make your brain forget pain.
---
Literally every little thing you do will help. Sit down and try to set some goals, it might be overwhelming at first but pick small goals and commit to them.
---
You're not alone out there dude, reach out and be kind to other people.
---
I play on a Lenovo laptop I bought new on cyber monday last year for $350.  Classic runs just fine on it, although retail can give it fits.
---
I bet you could find a used desktop somewhere that would run it like a beast - for under $500.
---
&gt;to call you out on the aforementioned lack of insight.
---
Mate if you need every single thing in your life spelled out for you, and googled, then no wonder youre so damn stupid.
---
&gt;Admittedly not immediately, but they have released enough servers
---
HELLOOOOOO????? Holy fuck youre denser than a block of shit. They came with a fix to a problem they created Ok geat. The expectation was that Blizzard would not be idiotic and create THAT PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH. Youre so fucking dumb it hurts.
---
&gt;lack of insight.
---
Yes mate, youd know a lot about that. Laughing. My. Fucking. Ass. Off
---
I have always looked at professions as a way to make money, not gear yourself.

Demonology would help with that lol

step 2: sac void.

step 4: profit.

Which are you on?
---
I feel you. This is the longest 3 day week I've ever had.
---
lmao I called in sick for work to play WoW to only realize I wasn't scheduled for today
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic
---
Don't listen to these people who have no idea what they're talking about.
---
One issue is that everyone in a group is going to gave different levels of time sunk in and pain from the queue.
---
I'm on Stalagg, an East Coast server but playing out of Mountain time and mostly playing later so when I logged on at 11 ET last night, the Q was 20 minutes. That's no big deal.  But for some of my group they are seeing 2 hour queues.  Additionally, some folks are utilizing remote access to their computers, some are not so that further complicated the issue.  No good slick solution for all.
---
Where did you get auctioneer? Is there a classic version?
---
It's  literally been one week. The circlejerk here is astounding.
---
Do you guys honestly believe this has staying power for a year? When all it's releasing is content that everyone knows how to clear in less than a week?
---
It'll have a community that is 2-3 times bigger than private servers. That's it. It's a different world and once people realize how little there is once they're max, they either stay and milk the little content they have, or quit and play something with an endgame.
---
Friendly reminder that OSRS adds content constantly and thats why it's successful. Not because "old good new bad"
---
Engineering and Goblin Jumper Cables...sometimes.
---
Define “acting retarded”
---
I’ve seen that a bunch with my friends. 
---
“Ok I’ve been playing for 9 hours gonna hop off for the night”
---
*logs back on an hour later*
---
I've been thinking it might be nice to buy a timeshare in Mulgore for the summers
---
For sure . My daughter is two and a half. I love her to death and she is my first responsibility, but I definitely have less gaming time now compared to when she was a newborn.
---
We play in a society!
---
I had scheduled 3 days off and then put in for  Saturday. Due to the hurricane work approved it. Had 6 days off total. I'm now back to work on day 2 and wish I was playing. Lolz
---
Oh xd well the more you know lol
---
Filthy acts at a reasonable price
---
Thanks, good talk.
---
Oooh I hope they are still there when I get home. I could use a good yank.
---
Ok, i have done a fair bit of reading and am left with a few questions that your posts seem to indicate you might be able to assist with.  
---
1) What ability do w get at 30 that would lead to TM being usefull? 
---
2) I have heard that 2H fury is great, ESP when you get to 40 and get bloodthirst.  Why the mandatory respecc to MS/Arms at 40? FWIW i plan on playing with my wife who is a Hunter, tanking dungeons and soloing. Sadly i will probably be soloing more than the others. The healing from Bloodthirst i hear is useful.  Plus threat per rage Bloodthirst was touted as the highest (dmg and healing) for tanking. is it just SS/WW/Cleave is so strong in questing? 
---
3) Cruelty is a given, but  the next 5 points can go into UW, BV, or Imp Demo.  UW is pretty awful, and moreso for 2h fury.  BV makes sense - you spend less rage on BS. But i feel like Imp Demo Shout is the best, esp if you're a tank.  Even in solo, i can see where using demo shout is going to be helpful. or.. maybe not? 
---
4) Enrage and Blood Craze - how often are we actually getting crit such that these 8 points pay off? Versus say: improved battleshout 5/5 and improved execute 2/2? or even anticipation?
---
Thanks for the phone lock screen. 
---

If you'll look at the link I posted below you'll notice that you're being a douche. Just look at it and stop acting like a tool.
---
Keep rank 1 spells for as long as possible, that might throw it off no?
---
Hunters could probably get away with same level +/-1 
---
Just find what works for you, there's been times where I grind mobs for half a level than walk over to another part of the map and discover some new mobs I kill twice as fast.
---
    &gt;calling others casual
---
    &gt;not using teamviewer or remote app to     log in during work already
---
talking about casuals, how you doing?
---
ITT: A lot of people who have never used the addon or knows how it works.
---
my pants are saturated with cringe
---
Perry
---
PvE server has its benefits :)
---
That’s messed up
---
You got the right idea
---
You're describing the addon way more than what it actually does. 
---
Things it does:
---
- History of player ganks
---
- Alerts when a player "activates" stealth.
---
Things it does NOT do:
---
- shows where a player is while moving stealthed
---
*laughs in Flamestrike +Arcane blast spam*
---
I appreciate this reference
---
The mine in Stonetalon Mountain with the goblin mining ore... Yeah that place was cancer. A crap ton of normal mobs and then patrolling Overlords.
---
Had a lock roll on +healing gloves against me the other night. He said it was to heal his pet...
---
Honestly I'm not really against even adding new content as long as it adheres to the same design philosophy of classic.
---
After Phase 5 I don't want this version to die.
---
Unless they then go to TBC content.
---
Therefore I'd think QoL changes are probably for the most part fine. But maybe if they are optional.
---
You lack a lot of skills and abilities that help fight warriors.  I wouldn’t worry about it to much until you’re higher.  One game changer is deathcoil which you won’t have until 44.
---
I've been playing on Moon Guard since Wrath and forgot how much I was missing out through not being on a RPPvP server. I thought this guy was going to 2v1 gank me when I showed up to an isolated quest zone alone (I don't trust Forsaken players), but he just stood back, let me drink/eat up, and then pointed to his shaman friend. Had an extremely close fight and sheathed my weapon when I was about to kill the shaman, and got /saluted and /cheered from both. Respectfully shared the quest mobs in the area afterwards.
---
Same crap
---
 Other spawns are from...lol. INSTANT to 3 minutes, near on unbearable at  times, but on not, not hacket..
---
Fundamentally, there’s nothing wrong with retail, it’s just evolved into a different genre of MMO and plays to a different crowd than what it started out as.  Classic caters to the crowd that enjoyed the early years of the game before it slowly changed into something the market dictated, rather than staying true to its roots.
---
Dynamic spawn rate
---
 I mean the guy is playong a Warlock, he's practically telling you he's untrustworthy.
---
Hey this is a bug. Close the game. Close battlenet. (Restart your machine and wait like 5 minutes) and get in the queue again. That’s how I “fixed it”. I was keeping being pushed back for hours until I did that.
---
You know if someone ENTERS stealth. Not if they're already in stealth, unless they use something like Pickpocket, or Sap a player/mob, etc.
---
You do not see WHERE someone is in stealth.
---
Best is subjective, Some like the Aeron some like the Embody
---
The embody is prob considered their most top of the line chair but personally i find the Aeron and Mirra more comfortable, they also breath better so if you live in a hotter area they are cooler. The Aeron has the option of 3 sizes to fit short and or very tall people better. Personally i prefer and own a Mirra, I sit in an Aeron all day at work 
---
also your way off on price, you can get the base spec mirra2 for 600 on amazon, similar price for the Aerons
---
the chairs from  autonomous.ai which are also solid chairs are under 400$
---
No, because they have no reason to announce it. Faerlina is the streamer server. That's where they want to be. They would somehow have to convince all of them to transfer. They also designated it that way so people could avoid them if they wanted to, this would go against that.
---
I always play as a gnome warrior and Engineering is my favorite profession. They go hand in hand. I don't do PvP servers anymore I'm too old to waste time dying.
---
Are you a warrior??
---
LOL!
---
I'm on Grob and it's fine.
---
You know, I've never used it but just reading the description for the add-on it sounds a little over the top. Maybe in practice it's not bad.
---
Thanks for your detailed explanation! Your description of the role of a healer is exactly what was drawing me to this class.  
---
However, I think I have to be realistic with my expectations. It seems most of what you said is related to raiding. I never played during vanilla, so I'm not sure how common it is to raid for a casual player, but I remember when I was playing during TBC, I probably played more than 10 hours each weekend (I was in highschool) and 2 hours/day during the week, and even with that amount of playtime (I won't ever be able to play that much nowadays), I rarely cleared Karazhan, and I must have killed Magtheridon only once.  
---
With the time I'm allotted now, I don't think raiding will be the core part of my experience, so I feel playing a class with which I'm going to have a lot of fun during dungeons and raids, but not much fun outside of that, might not be the best idea?  
---
But as I said, I never played vanilla so maybe I'm underestimating the time a lvl 60 spends in dungeons and raids?  
---
And also, wPvP. You can't do that alone as an holy priest, right?
---
Polymorph hunters and kill their pet. Then leave.
---
Playing Horde in Vanilla/Classis in itself is a sort of dominance, No pretty races.
---
I'm kinda confused, did the hunter attack at all? I saw maybe one spell and an auto attack. Maybe he just doesn't have his melee binds..
---
Can't unsee.
---
Try dotting first then fearing. You do take more damage up front.  However this allows you to bandage or bolt into another fear while the dots tick alway into more bolt spam
---
2 hours sleep over that sustained time will mess you up I'd imagine, I'd be careful.
---
I don't think most people can make time by being able to play at work and only having 2 hours sleep a night though.
---
No, it's worse
---
Yeah I think I will.  I've potentially only wasted two points tryna aoe spec. I might be able to recover without spending the G. Worst case I will have to start farming like a mofo
---
What is the best way to make money out of wool in the auction house as a tailor ?
---
Totally agree, everyone should be kind and helpful to people up front as a default way of dealing with others.  This is the best way to encourage everyone to be cool.   But once someone starts ninja-looting or doing other obviously dick-ish stuff it's not like you can  kindness them into not being an asshole.   Might as well make things painful for them so they might think twice the next time.  In the end if all that changes is that they think I'm a bigger asshole, O well.
---
The 1 hander is less damage so it is slower to kill.
---
If you kite well then you aren't having to eat for either.  That's a wash.
---
That makes the 2 hander better.
---
Anyone that complains about anything but drop rates at level 20 is a bit of a twat tho
---
I started on Anathema yesterday. Havent actually decided what class/race I'd like to play, but I saved some names.
---
in the old days there would be websites with track records, server first for each server, alliance first, horde first.   I am surprised if nobody has set up such a website yet.
---
Stun, Taunt, Righteous Fury + Judgement (grab threat to tank the mob).
---
*Don't be a dick!* :D
---
Make sure you are stretching every few hours.  You dont want to get DVT
---
Ashbringer is the best realm. Boss name, healthy pop, good balance. What more would you want?
---
They're higher-level quests and will grant more base experience, because they're weighted to be of equal benefit to higher-level players as your yellow quests are to you. I've literally never heard that you would receive less experience for turning them in, though I don't know if the experience scales based on your level or something so you'd get relatively more completing them at the "appropriate" level when they're yellow instead of orange.
---
Sounds like you still generate rage when you miss.
---
&gt; Minimap detection
---
&gt; If you can track humanoids then you will be able to detect known enemies by hovering over their position on the minimap. This does not work in battlegrounds and arenas. The level and class of known enemy players is displayed in the minimap's tooltip.
---
You're a beast in cat form if I'm not mistaken. I think Spy does work for that if you have track beasts on.
---
Ashbringer EU represent ! :)
---
Ok that makes more sense. Honestly if you want to pvp and enjoy that side of the game while leveling you are gonna want to take imp stuns and feral charge. But otherwise druids are the best escape artist in the game so you could just run from the unfait fights.
---
What's the name of it?
---
Horde Rogue here. Got jumped by a group of 2 alliance last night in STV while I was killing mobs. Killed them both.
---
Lesson here: **Lok'tar Ogar**
---
73
---
This was definitely a thing in vanilla, world pvp was my main activity.  It simply uses the log. If this is banned somehow, I’ll just continue to use the combat log to do the same...  it doesn’t show direction or distance or anything.
---
Just keep a set of caster gear in your bags and heal dungeons. You can get away without any healing talents for a long time.
---
Can confirm. Back at work and super depressed. I belong in Azeroth dammit.
---
Didn't realize you can play off a flashdrive. I know they require you to encrypt the flashdrive when you want to save files to it but I don't believe it's required in the reverse. Will have to do a little research
---
I know, I tried foolishly anyhow lol
---
Look up Jokerd guide on Google. There's a few people who have summarized his style
---
We farmed live strat extensively with guild groups when I was 60.  Orbs and plenty of blues to disenchant, along with other items like recipes and patterns.  For a group with no stealthy boiz tricks, it was good money farming live strat.
---
It all depends on the player most of the time.
---
Fair enough restos are a dime a dozen - tbh tho if you have an enh in your guild, or that you're friends with, you'll probably just end up putting them w melee dps for windfury because they got a talent for better WF totem. 
---
You can always pigeonhole ppl into playing the most optimal way.. but at the end of the day none of us have cleared content, and a bunch of European gnomes and dwarves got the raid world firsts with a bunch of sub-level 60s wearing greens. I don't think having one or a few enh or eles will make the difference
---
I agree that all the public chat callouts are really annoying, but the mod existed in almost exactly the same state back in vanilla a little later on and has existed throughout WoW since so I don't really see why it would be banned.

30 days in a year?
---
Hi! I was interested playing priest but my boyfriend decided to create one and level a priest before me ... so I want something to complement his class in a PvE setting (so I guess I have to play a DPS or tank???). I’m mostly interested in the concept of choosing the right spell rank to use in the right situation.
---
No We get expensive skill, cheap mounts right from the start.
---
We also do NOT get the Unarmored super rare Epic mounts.
---
All of which was changed before 1.12, so we are getting 1.12 version of mounts.
---
I mean, when lvling very little warrior should be tanking leather gear nor daggers / 1h (unless its a tanking weapon upgrade I guess).
---
unless you run with a pocket healer, you want the extra armor more than the stats.
---
but still, if that is your view, then you shouldn't complain about warriors needing bows / guns, or use it as a counter point, just say everyone should be able to need what ever is an upgrade and move on.
---
No, I was told to never do anything besides yellow as I'll receive fewer exp points for the reward.
---
Is it true if you set Wand to a far off key and key bind it to right click I can wand on right clicking enemies?
---
Absolutely correct. You didn't ask, but even a lower dps mace/sword would likely do more damage than sinister striking with daggers.
---
:B
---
One of my favorite things to do when I played a Warlock back in the day. Make 'em take the durability hit!
---
people: keep on whining about being unable to fd trap
---
me: it works fine
---
people: rage and insults
---
me: uploads screen while grinding with dual trap dots in open world bc my gear sucked at that time
---
[http://i.imgur.com/2DfBf0x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2DfBf0x.jpg)
---
people: that must be a p-server bull
---
me: ... 
---
hunters ... you can't win an argument with them
---
or to go with my old statement ... a lot of hunters are not as good as they think they are
---
meanwhile real bugs go unnoticed bc all the derps lvl with their braindead guides
---
the AiS no quiver fix broke all haste effects for AiS. It only gets 25% from RF and 15% from quick shots.
---
excellent. Been hoping for something like this. I always randomly stop wanding and just stand there for a few seconds before realizing. 
---
 RemindMe! 10 hours
---
agree on all points. I don't like being manipulated, especially when it requires extra effort on my end
---
You can’t catch up sleep up. Missed sleep is lost sleep and if you do this consistently, your health will get affected.
---
I'm not sure about the rest, but later in the fury tree you can choose weapon specializations.
---
Mace spec triggers stuns, sword spec triggers extra attacks, and axe/polearm spec gets bonus crit chance.
---
someone already went though most of the key reasons this is inaccurate but id also like too push one very important thing people forget.
---
pvp, if your on a pvp server your going to get ganked. your going to have to fight people eventually and this means you need a spec that can both grind mobs and kill people fairly easily.
---
this being why frost is so popular (fire is supposed to be the best for raiding as a mage though), you get roots (lower cooldown on the main one PLUS your frost slows have a chance to apply one) and snares aswell as the global mage skill polymorph; which allows for more 1v2 or 1v3 victorys. on top of that you also get ice barrier, it doesnt drain your mana per dmg delt to you and it does still protect you. if you know how to kite ice barrier is a god send.
---
then as you level you get the shatter talent as well as bonus crit dmg. effectively making it so you burst down people more effectively. 
---
early game frost can be a lil meh, you need those talents to really shine but it pays off in the end.
---
that all being said, either of the 3 options is fine. while frost is generally considered to be the best leveling spec, you can play fire or arcane. you just have too accept your going too have a harder time.
---
were all here to have fun, and its honestly insane how much fun classic is. so just play whatever #YOLO
---
they dont have to be useful during day due to their social position, so its all balanced
---
What level are you and what's your dps?
---
It's not huge any more but leather working also allows you to make a lot of the end game resistance gear. Which is important and normally is required by raid leaders 
---
Black Dragonscale for fire resis.
---
The stuff from slithius for nature resis.
---
Red dragon armor was just fun.
---
But I would recommend looking at the end game items and if their something you find worthwhile then it isn't a waste.
---
Love the name...
---
A lot of people are dumping their old Sandy Bridge and Haswell PCs for the newer stuff.  Should be able to find one for $300 used easy.
---
He pre-paid for it.
---
Mm that's hot
---
Every server is active. So pick one you wanna play
---
So some of the nights I only slept four hours. Sunday night I played from 10 eastern to maybe 2 in the morning? I played almost all day Monday (12+ hours) due to having the day off cause of labor day. The hours are easily there.
---
It's literally just 5 more energy, and since you're in stealth you can time it with an energy tick better than running up to the mob - which can make it even more energy efficient. Also 18s isn't an unreasonable kill time while soloing, unless you have very powerful weapons/fighting green mobs.
---
Works just fine.
---
My back though....
---
What addons are you running? Love the look of the UI.
---
Last night i was in Stonetalon... High levs were running through while i slaughtered some harps. Lock just Dotted me and killed me. FUCK. 10 minutes of walking i Respawn no biggie it happens.. about 1.5 mobs later BOOM warrior charges me beats me to pulp till i have to run another 10 minutes! Then when i want to leave because i FINALLY finished i go to kill the fire elements on the way. ROGUE 1 shot me.. Like FUCK OFF played for not even an 1hr and been running dead for over half of it. Its a PVP  server it happens i was more mad cause i wanted to just level lol not by getting ganked.   
---
Although... If i get ganked. then get camped and Grieved its a bannable offence, Kill me maybe get my res and move on... if you sit here and Tbag constantly... and get Res and res and res and res get banned boyo

It's really not that much better than a tier 1 robe.  You'll probably get more use in the long run out of being able to make your own potions, elixirs, and flasks.
---
I’m thinking they are doing this with Phase 2 in mind. It’s the most populated PvE server. Even if we have little or no queue now, when layering is removed, that queue might come back with a vengeance. I expect another round of free transfers as we get closer to Phase 2 to make sure the stable population sizes are brought down to what can be accommodated without layering.
---
20 hours and level 15 is insanely good for your first time playing Classic.  You could get Questie, or Zygor, or use a leveling guide online if you want to go faster.
---
Had no idea this existed, but this explains why a hunter I ran into a lot yesterday would instantly attack and send their pet at me even when they had no vision of me at all. Shit needs to be banned.
---
My first mount I got back in the day I saved for like 12 levels without getting my spell training and begged for the last like 20 silver. It was also on a troll warrior. I think I got the same mount too

They went for 1000g for a very long time on my server.

Yeah sorry I can't look at my game and I can't read that to point out more. Try a quick google search I guess.

No, but you do get lower exp for fighting too high level mobs

Warriors should get first dips on this. We can barely solo a mob one level higher when our weapons aren't up to date.
---
The variance is higher given the high miss chance, but over dps should be similar. 2 pulls is not a sample

I love how you people are ignoring the added, what, 5 steps to upload a stupid picture? No one gives a fuk

One time in vanilla I remember there was a random Ally in Org and I ended up in a group of priests who just took turns mind controlling him and healing him.  Eventually we escorted him out, but it took awhile and he never got to do much.

You're including yourself in society and all society is, is majority thought. You thought is NOT the majority. So if you don't want to live you should check in with a therapist because that is very serious. I can get you some information and help you get in contact if you want?

Good point. Thanks for taking time to explain. I also am new to Rogue’s. Now, I know swords and sword spec is better for single play and new players, but in general don’t I still just use the best weapons I have avail to me? And do I want the slower weapon in the MH? Thanks!

I think we succeeded in finding the not too big but no too small server. Many like-minded individuals here.
---
So then really, a red quest awards the same exp as a yellow one, but relative to the suggested level of the quest.  So a level 10 quest which is yellow awards, say 1200 exp.  However, if I were to do that at level 8, it would seem like more exp, because it was really meant for a level 10 - thus the "relative" part of this.
---
All the idiots calling for it to banned don't even know what the fucking addon does.
---
Dr. Tumblr here to inform the WoW community
---
hehe welcome to classic. All about the grind.
---
He wasn't a chill fishing dude, but in attacking him I pissed off the other red fishing dudes.
---
Oh well, good times.
---
check petopia classic. There's plenty of cats in barrens and ashenvale with 1.3 attack speed. Owls are great, but moreso for PVE.
---
My friends are : warlock , mage , rouge , and priest. 
---
Idk if that changes anything 
---
I’m also not sure we are gonna raid or at least not anytime  in the foreseeable future. So I don’t know if there is a spec or build that is better in a more casual play that we plan to do 
---
Also thanks for the response I’ve never played wow before and don’t want to make a mistake I’ll regret later.
---
Cool, you could also be fat and obese and still be healthy. :)
---
I've been looting chests and then sharing the contents with my party. Guess I better be careful the next time I'm in a group. Most of the chests don't seem to have a whole lot of good stuff in them anyway.

No I get it now.  You guys are morally superior to me and I should be polite to assholes.  Noted.
---
"Im glad you're a dick and have let me know."- the healer.
---
&gt; That is science not myth.

It's science *in mice.* Let's not lose our shit.
---
&gt; I consider any path that lowers the odds of you living longer to be unhealthy.
---
Do doctors?
---
you can't , I would know if we could
---
The game needs future content. You can add content to the game while keeping the game's classic experience. Continuing the same path will simply remove that classic experience. Not adding content will slowly kill the game putting all the time and effort from both the devs, and players who deem so, to waste.
---
Or a mofuckin tv series like game of thrones
---
Fury is the generally accepted leveling path until 40.
---
Vacation + No Family + No responsibilities.
---
Where is your proof?
---
Yep and watched it in its entirety about 3 times now.
---
Perfectly honest, i wasn't like omg that was awesome first time, felt like meh it was ok, and now after a couple more full watches and catching it on repeat, it grows on ya.
---
Take it back!

he's pretty funny, but if in any way you don't like the "tOxiC pRiVaTe SeRvEr CoMmUnItY" that people have been referencing, it's probably best you don't watch.

If you install ShareX it makes it even better. Ita takes over the print screen button and when you hit it, it auto copies the image to your clipboard. Or, you can click the shareX icon and use it as a snip tool that will auto upload to imgur and copy whatever you snip to imgur. It's incredible.

That was added after classic.

That's just big dick energy my brotha.
---
Oh ok, neat! I didnt think it would lock out everyone, but thought maybe it would lock me out for the future. I might sell it then. I have a rez, so the cables are less useful to me. Miiight be worth to learn it and sell the cables, maybe. I will have to look into it.

That's lucky indeed!

---
Is she ok? That was concrete and her head flew backwards towards it.
---
Who the fuck even cares about leveling, the game starts at end game in retail. And btw slower does not mean harder. Leveling in classic might take 5 times longer as you can only pull 1 mob at a time as a solo player. That does not make it harder, its just time consuming. 
---
You say mythic raiding isnt hard. Why are there thousands of 2-3 day raiding guilds that cant even clear the raid before the next one is released? Have you ever even raided in a decently high end guild? Or done any high level m+ where coordination has to be perfected, one missed kick on a mob could mean a full wipe for the group? The skill required in 20+ keys is extremely high. You honestly think there are players in method that arent their on merit? To play in a guild like that you have to be one of the most mechanically and technically gifted players in the world, and not only that but you also need the mental fortitude to grind for months 10 hours a day through content you have no interest in, in preparation for a new tier.
---
What mythic raiding have you done in retail btw and what rank was your guild if you are so informative?
---
That quest can be so annoying, but stealing the eggs on top of the other shit? That's low.
---
promoting good health through weight loss isn't shaming.
---
rejecting that weight loss leads to healthier outcomes is denial, though.

Well, I was just going off of what you stated, which is that you work every day 8-5, and you go to sleep every night 1030-6 (all 7 days). Kind of pointless to say that schedule when it wasn't applicable in this situation. Oh well.
---
It does if you already have a track ability that does it anyway.  Spy helps by giving you mouseover info on the minimap icon.

I guess that answers the question of “Do you guys have phones?”

Here's the rules:  If you don't feel like attacking you, then you better be watching you very closely to see if they feel like attacking you.
---
*Hakeem Nicks laugh*
---
Definitely a lot easier to do that on Horde.
---
AKA while my autoattack whittles down a mob...
---
I don't get why people think they should be higher. This isn't retail where you gain a couple levels an hour or more. You're doing fine. Everyone plays at their own speed.
---
Wonder if I'll ever live in a world without pointless assholes?
---
Had to do a double take, hello fellow Philadelphian!
---
Do you have increased graphics on or is this classic setting?
---
I read that as Crowd control. As if your job was CCing you so they can handle the encounter better.
---
no changes
---
Good luck finding any activities there that are more fun than video games
---
Yeah I made a mistake, I had hit a good amount more and bought all my spells at 20 and then realized I boned myself! Just wasn’t thinking in a classic mindset. I also have a few g on an alt from my AH sales that I funnel over but I consider that still broke haha
---
Haha i was thinking the same, i wanna have "Fun"
---
Is 'Cleave' what they call bum rushing through an instance and pulling as much stuff as possible?
---
You can block them under the social option
---
They never said no officially, but doesn't look good.
---
Just talk to any Inn Keeper! &lt;3
---
Does anyone know of a server for Kirtonos-US? (One of the servers opened on launch day)
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me dog
---
Yeah.. you can block that shit in your settings.
---
Thank you! One more question, I haven't gotten my subscription yet so I wouldnt know, what race can I play with a Hunter? I want to play a race that has an interesting background/starting city. If the starting city is dull and hasn't got any diversity I think it will drive me away very fast. If I get to level 10-20 I think Ill even get to 60 later.
---
It is not. You are mistaken.
---
Yes, Yes, yes. I'm drowning in gold and I buy stuff off AH, I lvld my profs ,I've spent 6g on respecs, I've trained every spell and I'm still sitting here with 6g still at lvl 31 and I've never even sold something on the AH.
---
why make more work when you need not?
---
Yeah, it's alright when it's at or around level dudes beating each other up during quests, but a whole other beast when you get dudes on mounts camping the road outside Astranaar.
---
It's this. Classic was never as difficult as people remember.
---
Yeah, That's more being a dick for no reason
---
Use imp in instances?
---
Am I an asshole if I rolled need for a dagger which was a 10dps increase if I did not know it was a healing dagger
---
No problem there are basic rotations that you should follow as guidelines during pvp encounters. Just be ready for them to change because of many variables. But once you have a good idea of what you need to do you can focus more on what the other player is doing and figuring out, how you can counter it, and what to do next
---
If herbing your way to max level is viable, then I assume grinding is much more so
---
;_; I'm a new player to WoW, and I just assumed all warlocks are jerks ngl
---
For dual wield most likely not but you may be better off searching for the Classic Warrior Discord and going there for resources.
---
I have it installed but I don’t use it on my Rogue, eventually when I make a Paladin I will use it for him.
---
Dumb people actually have higher quality of life because they're concerned with less.

I saw World of Roguecraft. He was dressed like a methhead, had the starter weapon, and was ganking people.

I love soloing elites. I'll do that
---
Daddy, why cant we go to disney this year?
---
well honey daddy used his vacation time to ignore you and sit you in front of the television for a week to play wow.
---
Hell Yeah!!!
---
Queue would still be the same
---
You 100% will have to grind to get to 60, there are not enough quests in the game to get you to 60.
---
It's legitimately Classic, but I am so many magnitudes better and more knowledgeable about the game, its night and day. I think that's all it is.
---
Balance is shit tier
---
Now we can play the game.
---
Whitemane
---
You could put a ticket in, it may be too early tho.
---
Sometimes GMs will free up names that are on low level inactive characters, but since classic has been out such a short time they may not do that.
---
Just go read mmo champ, its a fucking blue post in the feed. Dear lord some of you are insane with your demands for fucking sources.
---
Druids normally level as Feral. (bear to start, kitty after you learn a few more skills)
---
Use your feral spec and just collect Healing gear for when you want to heal 5 mans while leveling.
---
You can level as Balance but instead of being one of the top 3 fastest solo levelers, you'll drop down to one of the top 3 slowest solo levelers.
---
However it's your game, your character, and your time.. Do what you want.
---
Why are you running lower level dungeons that much? Is this upgrade really so important?
---
You used your talent point on frostbolt? Do you mean you learned it at the trainer?
---
Open your spellbook by pressing P and go to the Frost tab. Drag frostbolt down to your hotbar. You can use it for your main attack, it's very good.
---
It's kinda the same w/secondary skills. There are vendors w/books to get you past 150 and Higher up toons will buy them and then sell them on the AH cause they know some peeps can't and won't go get the books themselves.
---
&gt;  I kill every single rogue I see
---
Hahaha... So the thing about Rogues is...
---
Once you hit 10 / 16 you can dungeon grind to 60, it will take much much much longer.
---
Were just passing through. As soon as i got to barrens i teleported to Sentinel Hill with /stuck
---
But they will be relatively the same amount of unhealthiness from the box, was just using it as a constraint that they don't change other than caloric intake for the 5 years. I could added more words to say they stay on the exact same identical routing all day every day, either works.
---
It's Pre-BIS, but honestly unless you're a min / max type of player that shouldn't matter I'm vanilla. You can get by doing all the content without it.
---
Lol that would be hilarious
---
Yep, and you only get the dot if you have the track ability in the first place.
---
I have the same thing. I used to sit in class in high school thinking about talent builds, leveling paths, etc. That stopped YEARS ago. Now I'm a teacher. Sitting in planning period. On reddit instead of grading papers.
---
I just love camping
---
I understand some people need crutches to walk.
---
first of all, i have no respect for anyone that plays on a PVE server
---
secondly, complaining about getting ganked is a huge part of the game.
---
Yes. Some can. That's why my comment says "We're not *all* 15" ..
---
Your first article is about fats not about being obese...?
---
&gt; Like dude it's a thought experiment, you're supposed to make mental checks/concessions for a thought experiment.
---
If it's all happening in your head, it doesn't reflect anything but your preconceptions. You can't make an argument and then just insist that I assume you're right.
---
&gt; If both people had the exact same level of activity but one had double or triple the intake, which would you pick?
---
Why would the ratio matter? I'd want to know what they ate. The body can moderate it's absorption of fats because they're under active transport through the lumen; sugars diffuse simply so there's no moderation.
---
Don't feel like Gnomer or SM?
---
Slower weapon in the main hand. Once you reach [Sword Specialization], you should focus on keeping swords as your weapons, it doesn't matter if you find a slightly better dagger. Even if you dont have sword spec and you find a better dagger, you need to see how its DPS compares, and how its median+top end damage compare to the sword you'd be replacing.
---
Not really sure who is going to roll on a "New Realm" after a bunch of leveled characters have transferred there.
---
i think its like “pet” panel
---
Heirlooms were a band-aid (one of many) over the problem of them making (pre-latest-expac) pointless. People just used heirlooms for the XP boost because leveling was so mindless and felt pointless.  
---
Flying was a band-aid on travel being pointless. When you travel in Classic, there's danger. There's stuff of interest. You might meet other players who need help. Travel in classic is essentially part of the experience. In retail it became a chore so you could get to the next loot pinata. So flying became a way to mitigate that.  
---
Essentially, to 'fix' retail you'd have to drill down really deep into how they destroyed the systems that made the game interesting under the weight of whining from the zero-effort, easy-mode fanbase.
---
Most people grind dungeons.  I like to grind dungeons to 50%, then do some quests and grind mobs to level, repeat.  You'll be grinding a lot especially if you want 100g (or 90g) for your first mount...if you're not a Warlock or Paladin.
---
I like balance to get omen for the free heal. 5 points resto to get the rage / energy switching into form. Then feral after that. But I’m a filthy casual :). Have fun with your Druid. People hate on them for not being the best at anything but they are a ton of fun.

Go up to a smoker on the street and lecture him on smoking first, and then Ill do what you are asking.

Just because confronting someone about their vice/unhealthy living choice creates conflict doesn't mean what they are doing is healthy.

For PvE it's important to note that using a stealth opener allows you to also pickpocket (macro) which is a decent source of extra money.

Just walking up and using sinister strike is definitely faster but pickpocketing is something to consider.

As a rogue, my biggest advantage in PvP is that I can pick and choose my fights.

I may /wave now, but I’m going to cannibalize you later.

u can list auctions for whatever price you want, you don't need money

Beautiful

And your post is a contradiction. You say they can't disable an addon, and then say they can disable an addon. By limiting the API that addon uses.
---
Right back atcha
---
Lmao that’s not even what those words mean.
---
Who knows mate I guess?
---
We are
---
Yes! Visiting a trainer every couple of levels is essential to buy new skills and higher ranks of skills. You will have to pick and choose what skills to buy because buying everything available is cost-prohibitive. 
---
Specifically for frost mage, you want to move away from fire spells while leveling, buy frost spells (and a few Arcane utility spells like food/water conjure, blink, polymorph), and focus your talent points into frost. 
---
Don’t forget to put new skills and higher rank skills onto your action bar because they do NOT automatically get put there.

I know, I am seriously jealous of her right now

I figured it would take more time grinding, but as long as it’s viable I wouldn’t mind it. I would run quest until I got tired of it then go grind.

I was in a party today, and some leather gear dropped. 10 Agi 10 Stamina, way better than my 6 agi 5 stam pants.

I rolled need on it, but the people in the group got angry at me. I'm a hunter, and I'm level 40, so they thought I should only be rolling on mail gear. It was almost an instant party kick.

You list any item for any price, it doesn't mean someone is going to purchase it ( or even have enough money).  
---
I'm this case, he probably listed it as a joke
---
First choose a faction. Look at all the races from each faction and choose what looks cool to you. Personally I think you can’t go wrong with starting a night elf or Tauren. Some people might be turned off of the orc starting zone but others love it.
---
As I've said that you keep ignoring. I've spent gold on AH, I've sent gold to my alts, I've had to buy tomes and I've thrown 6g down to respec. I've had well over 35g by now.

you will tank better for your group having deep wounds, sweeping strikes, and anger management.  none of those are prot talents ^.^

---
Aw, druid bros is the only way to go.
---
Ive been stuck deciding for like the past week. I have mained a lock all through retail, but want some change. So far in classic i wanted to play 4 classes. Druid, Rogue, mage and Warrior.  From what i hear:  
---
Druid is bad. Not a good tank, mediocre dps.  
---
Rogue is pretty good, amazing for PVP. Was think NE but I know gnome is best race for pvp. Im just picky about aesthetics and gnomes look terrible.
---
Mage is top range dps, and i love it for the food and portals
---
War is top DPS in general but  slow to level.
---
I want something quick and easy, but also easy-ish to PVP with, cause im new to PVP in Classic.
---
Breathtaking. Very, very well done.
---
I would happily supply you with Windfury/Strength of Earth good sir
---
Just kill everything on your way to kill everything.
---
Is spending money worth the exp you’d get from like 2 mobs?
---
Well, im sure that some relations got broken since classic launched.
---
I have to sleep 6.5 to 8.5 hours to stop the mid day nap impulses, I'm 31, overweight and take get  happy pills, anything less or more is when it gets difficult!
---
that's close to, if not the absolute best loot he can drop at once not counting world drops. Pretty gud.
---
Not anywhere in your post do you mention marking targets. You have that ability - do it. You can literally go to the keybindings, bind them, and use them. I actually have had ZERO problems with DPS hitting the wrong target when I mark it full a skull prior to the pull.
---
It's a 40% drop.
---
No, if you put the talent in improved frost bolt, it is active now. It is reducing the cast time of all ranks of your frostbolt skill by 0.1 seconds
---
LF any names pertaining to Naruto!
---
US Servers please!
---
Did you swim around spamming the macro or just sit at a central location? I'm on 45th hour of my camp and zero sightings.

They don’t need that much to list. You can list items for whatever you want, nothing to report.

wha?

IIRC you cannot bubble hearth until 34 when you get Divine Shield.

No, I said I'm okay with breaking as many addons as possible. You just got butthurt and inferred the rest.
---
Ohhh, smurtsmurtsmurt.
---
I guess some people just see BOE and think "this is valuable to me as well as the person who actually could USE it", and use that logic to justify needing it.

"Blizzard says "We are replicating patch 1.12". Everybody shocked when they do what they say." Except they have deviated from that with multiple changes. Layering being the most obvious. Also yes I am surprised by it. That decision is moronic. I'm not going to rage quit over it as I'm not a huge fan of raiding. So it works out for me but, it's a very dumb decision on their part.
---
Personally they should have been more about capturing the "spirit" of classic wow like private servers do. Not brute force duplicating one patch and acting like thats the "real" classic. Again though still love the game. I'm just saying this was stupid of them.

The one thing you can take solace in when that happens to you is the fact that anyone who ganks players who are far below them in level most likely have a tiny dick.

Why are you wanting to report someone for using the ah?

Someone is buying or selling gold for RL money. That’s how the gold selling sites get you the money or get the money from you.

I though the transfert would be from dead/empty server to medium pop server but no, they are literally creating new server to empty the biggest one. The hype is real
---
Bis is best in slot
---
If you can't heal almost ever dungeon, even as shadow, up to level 50 then you are not good enough to be a healer. Coming from an actual healer btw. :)
---
Could use some advice from Shadow priests. 
---
I’ll keep this short and sweet. I am struggling to efficiently kill mobs my level or 2 higher. By efficient I mean move from mob to mob with little downtime. 
---
Currently I am usually finishing a job with about 45-60% health and 50-70% mana. The fights also take quite a while. My spell rotation is: Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand. 
---
Is there a better rotation. For reference I played mage in classic so I could just be used to faster kills with better survivability.
---
guess i just havent seen a way to window the map so it isnt full screen
---
Head back to Loch Modan Level until 17 - 18 and then go to red ridge.  Keep in mind the Defias Brotherhood quest if done correctly will send you to lakeshire then back to west fall and eventually to kill VC.  Have fun
---
Thanks I legit thought first comment was a troll, so I go on twitch to download addons for classic and install them the same as before?
---
I didn't play WoW back then, but I did torrent a shitload of anime. They never bothered to block TPB.
---
Hope your not driving around, when i worked at a drive through i took a deep breath for all the pokemon go players having their phones on the by the stearingwheel..
---
Make love, not accident &lt;3
---
Yup. If that's confusing for you check your grammar in your OP
---
I (shaman lvl36) was running from The Crossroads to the Horde outpost in Stonetalon. There is a little outpost on the border and this lvl32 Human Warrior were trying to get past the horde guards. 
---
I showed him a safe passage and we kept running in the same direction together, waving and making funny emotes. During our whole journey I ran past him many times, dropped totems for him to charge so his journey would be faster aswell. I tried using /charge and /point at the totems but this happy fella just kept running. 
---
HE NEVER PICKED UP MY HINTS TRYING TO HELP HIM - so when the time to say goodbye was upon us, naturally I had to put him down for shaming my helpful ass.
---
Stupid human.
---
Whitemane rip lmaoo if that's what the pop servers are like god dam I made a good choice.
---
To clarify for you, I'm saying Blizzard can't disable A SPECIFIC add-on. They can disable parts of the API that the add-on uses, but that would disable other add-ons as well.
---
There's no way to target just one.
---
Y’all taking this RP server too seriously
---
this is asmongold’s mon btw
---
What addon is providing the drop mob/rate?
---
Omg that's fucking fantastic. GoT reference I never would have noticed. 😂
---
I joined benediction on alliance and the only thing I found was chill folks and great meme general chat.
---
Then again this is the dwarf areas lol.
---
That's not how that works. You don't have any proof. Do you have damage values from 15 years ago? Or gold drop rate or anything?
---
I highly recommend learning cooking for the sagefish buff. MoT ftw.
---
Thank goodness for cat form
---
Orc Warlock,
---
now Tauren Druid.
---
In between I played alliance melee characters on pservers
---
Was this on Incendius? If so, I spent my first like 20 levels with this guy for the first 2 days.
---
Paid character transfer will most likely be added, like vanilla. But not pve to pvp
---
A dude did this to me, I spit on his character and proceeded to whisper him.... he knew what he did was f’d up and had already blocked me.  I was furious and couldn’t retaliate at all.
---
the main issue is that things like this happened in vanilla.... to where they swapped the stairs in AQ40 by the first boss to instantly get to C'Thun
---
Stop. I had just begun to forget that it ever happened.
---
Nothing a little bit of rebranding can't fix. Biblo is a name you can trust for your dungeoning needs
---
yea thats kinda TRU
---
I finally got around to watching it a couple weeks ago. It was simultaneously awesome and cheesy. I'd watch more movies.
---
Along with everyone else telling you to communicate with your group, also think of it as training. Even with guild groups, shit can go wrong. Experience with these clusterfuck pugs can be frustrating, I won’t deny that. But they can make you a much better healer in the long run and capable of handling bad situations. A common issue that people run into when always running with guild groups is that they get complacent and are caught flat footed when anything goes wrong. This helps avoid that.
---
IMO, of course.
---
The mana refund on crits is also so fucking good.
---
Sorry, you're right.
---
Not only that but it’s on a 2 handed sword. Useless to both casters and tanks.
---
Fucks me off that they ignore CC as well.
---
Appeal to ignorance fallacy.
---
Yea, I have no words, you don't know how to press printscreen
---
Tanking rando’s is a nightmare. Don’t wait for me to build threat, and then proceed to go balls to the walls dps, pulling aggro.
---
This is why I play PVE..... pretty funny tho
---
Can I get a piece of that booty, as well?
---
Same.  At least she's ok with me playing though.
---
Hilarious. 
---
I had my first huntard experience doing WC the other day. So he shows up and we get started. . .  out of arrows. So he runs back and gets arrows. Then he is back, and he multi'shots all the CC and pulls aggro immediately on every pull. He dies once - now all his gear is broken. He has to run back again. And now he dies on his way back several times. Basically we 4-maned it and it was smoother than when he was in the group. Fun stuff.
---
"Not really" as in, "I won't admit defeat."
---
Let's never speak if this again.
---
Hunter: pet attack that mob by the node.
---
*Casually mining while there's a fight to the death happening 5 ft away*
---
&gt;Ok so there are no better item on this slot until you get an insanely rare item in a end game raid ?
---
The raid irks aren't necessarily "insanely rare." In fact, this weapon is rarer, being a world drop. But until you get into the raids, this is the best available weapon for some classes.
---
Haha I love that server name. I just might have to, I’m so invested on hitting 60 right now only 19 more levels to go.
---
Hey. You’re in my guild!
---
&gt; This is what I imagined every Legolas name variation player looks IRL.
---
I feel like we are the same people on different toons. I got this situation twice just last night as a druid, for the first time.  I offer to party and tank the stuff a GROUP is stuggling with, I've got 3 lvls on them. No reply to /say or /yell. So I just go to the back of the area with the actual quest kill objective, take it and leave. Grabbed a chest on the way out. 
---
4 person group all whisper me mad. /shrug I offered to speed it up for them, &amp; they weren't in any position to take the chest without clearing several mobs. 
---
I think people are just sensitive and arrogant atm. Cuz I had a warrior do the exact same as yours for a chest in barrens.
---
It's a bit like watching someone throw food away. College is expensive in the States and we already have a generation of people in lifelong student debt because of it. This isn't the heady days of 2004. People should have learned by now. Also, these same folks from 2004 want the government to forgive their student debt.
---
Why would I? I'm not wrong. 😂
---
Lmao F. Truth Dagger.
---
Hey, Return of Reckoning is a lot of fun and has a decent amount of active players
---
I’m currently level 29 and am specced feral and don’t have too many problems, just have to drink a little bit more than a resto specced Druid. I suspect it’ll get worse as time goes on but you don’t have to change immediately when you go for dungeons that’s for sure
---
That's .. not old enough. I played while in college .... &gt;.&gt;
---
None has 22222 gold to sell yet. And it would cost so fucking many dollars none would buy it
---
I don’t need to provide proof. You’re the one making these claims, not me.

I don’t think you can’t buy out your own auctions from opposing factions on the neutral AH.

Very useful info, i'll be checking this out later thanks!

You big mad 🤣😂😅

Hunter it is.

This is a handy guide, especially for your first time through:

---
Hey great contribution guy
---
"If you genuinely think that layering is somehow in the same conversation as replicating patch 1.12. I can see why you're very confused."
---
It is in the same conversation. Was layering in the game during patch 1.12? Does it not have a massive effect on the game?
---
"Good thing you put spirit in quotes because that's not a tangible thing to replicate. By this logic Rag should currently be unkillable for the next what? 3 months? Like mathematically unkillable."
---
I'm not saying he needs to be unkillable. However releasing him in his most nerfed state. Seems like an awful idea. I think they should have scaled all the raid bosses to require 40 people. As thats what fans want. 40 man raids. As it is when I have my pre bis. I will most likely be raiding the core in a 20 man raid.
---
&gt; I disagree. Some kids are raised to be fat and get stuck in a fat cycle  before they even know what going on, outside of traditional medical  conditions. Why do you think poorer cities are fatter? McDonalds, taco  bell and popeyes all day. 
---
I could eat mcdonalds every day, every meal for the rest of my life and never get overweight.

Mages

It is.

No they should not

Start and maintain your own subreddit ?
---
 Theres wowhead, not sure what else you'd need
---
What do you think is the easiest/most fun character to only grind with?
---
What anime I's this?
---
&gt; as doing a mouseover sunder deals no DMG and does not break CC!
---
Why wouldn't it do damage? I thought mouseover macros just allowed you to target mobs for specific abilities without actually changing targets. Like healing on a focus target of target of target?
---
I was a prot pally on a pserver. Me and a horde feral druid were both farming essence of water in Felwood. I almost killed him when he was in cat form with ret aura and holy shield until he went bear. We fought forever until we realized with wisdom and light seal/blessing and his bear form neither of us was going to die. A /salute and we went on our way. Love stuff like that.
---
&gt;Other players are using flying and LFD?  That's news to me, seeing as how neither are in the game lol.
---
Is this a troll? I'm drawing an analogy to an argument people make on retail.
---
Spy must be used  because everyone else uses it, just like flyers and LFD must be used on retail because everyone else uses it.
---
Isn't classic based on legion client, shouldn't the old tmorph work
---
Yeah my buddy(rogue) and I(resto druid) just ran RFD. The dagger drops off water boss, this guy needs it which I don't know why he would want it but whatever my friend got it. Then the last boss drops leather int belt, I was like oh sweet def an upgrade. Nope needed and won. 
---
Hate this shit. He said he needed it for his healy set?? Welp guy should've healed if you wanted healy gear.  Feelsbadmane.. 😕
---
&gt; In this really strange vacuum universe you've created, then yes you are correct.
---
There's nothing strange or unusual about it.  I played original WoW when it released 15 years ago.  The entire community has watched for years as hunters ninja'ed loot that their class can't really use -- that's the whole reason they're called "Huntards".   This isn't some random example I'm making up, this is *years of proven history*.
---
&gt; But I think you're really putting words in my mouth trying to make yourself upset.
---
Firstly, I'm not upset dude.  =P   Yes, I'm tired of idiotic hunters taking loot that their class can't really use, but that's about it.
---
Secondly, I'm not putting words in your mouth -- I'm holding you accountable for what you said.  You were trying to justify hunters using all kinds of stuff.  You even cited spellpower as an example.  That's the kind of wrong/misleading information that makes hunters feel like it's appropriate to ninja all kinds of stuff that they shouldn't be stealing from other classes.
---
Absolutely. Un. Readable.
---
lol lighten up
---
Instructions unclear.  Talent tree removed.  You now get one talent every 20 levels.
---
The videos can make it look easy but mage AOE farming is definitely a learning curve.  I learned by only doing 2 mobs at once but still only using AOE spells and trying to make sure I never got hit after the initial 'gather'.  
---
You can't really use mana shield early on, otherwise you might run out of mana later in the pull.  Ice barrier is ideal, but you don't get it til 40, so you have to use your HP as a resource a bit to take just a couple hits to gather them up.  It is definitely a challenge but post-level 40 (with your mount AND ice barrier) is way easier. 
---
Make sure to have your gems all made too, very important!  
---
If you can reliably kill a mob using only AOE spells then it isn't super different to scale it up from one to three, three to five, five to ten, etc.  I think the sweet spot for me to learn was 3-5 mobs, and once you learn the layout of some of these places it's possible to gather much more.
---
I'm not aware of where any numbers are but my basic understanding is Grey gives no exp. Green gives less exp. Yellow gives best exp. And you do not gain more exp for reds
---
1. Burst as much as possible
---
2. Feign Death and pray it doesn't resist
---
Replying to check later
---
Shit man, you’re ripping through it! I’m level 20 with zero rush to hit 60. For me it’s all about taking my time leveling and killing as many horde as possible along the way.
---
Yes but it would require the developer to figure out what is getting caught. They could be catching fragments of lines or blocks. They could even be catching the comments instead of code. But the point would be to force the developer to constantly "reinvent" the code. 
---
It would work like basic security. There would be a way around it (outside of massive methods like API ban) that they developer would need to figure out. Once figured out now Blizzard would need to invent a new way to catch it. And on and on the cat chases the mouse.
---
I like the high elf better..
---
Tough words here but it's important. You can have the best application in the world but if it looks like crap then no one is going to want to use it.
---
I would recommend just sitting down and getting familiar with it. It would make the addon 100 times better. And not only that, but you'll be more proud of it :)
---
Didnt even read your comment after the first sentence. You're the one out of touch lmao. If the game truly started after max level they would just make you max level from the start.
---
Thank you for your feedback, I’ll be sure to take it into consideration for my next post about ques
---
Some seriously rare patterns drop from them, mind.
---
Once you become an adult it's your decision though
---
Well, if you can't admit it, then why would you admit it? King me.
---
With a dedicated group it’s one of the fastest ways to level.
---
I played with my wife up to 25 so far, we just use free for all. She loots regular mobs until her bags are full, then I do mine. If it's a quest drop same thing, she loots until she finishes then I loot. Works out well
---
doesnt that kill you in the process?
---
Is this saying that Ret Paladin holds aggro and is tanky enough as DPS w/o shield to not need a tank spec?
---
I got that shit on lock, pet on passive so as to not do extra crazy dumb pathing and pull. Then attack target on mwheelup and move back to me on mwheel down. Even allows me to attack stuff while using only one hand
---
I think the audience, and their respective tastes and preferences have altered over time. As a result Blizzard has tried to keep things fresh (although my no means have they always succeeded). I really hope they don’t turn Classic into what Jagex did with OSRS and let the community decide through polls which updates the game needs and which ones it doesn’t.
---
Tauren hunter in vanilla, gnome mage in classic 😂
---
You should contribute less you ignorant fuckwad.
---
Mage for aoe
---
Yeah, that's not a argument works. You claim to have proof but can't provide that proof? So I can just say that you don't have any.
---
I /tickle everyone I pass on my realm. I shall be known as the tickle monster on both sides!!!!

There was a raid group yesterday in the charred vale camping my party of 4. I lost about 3 hours trying to get some quests done there and ended up going to wetlands instead.
---
I am so looking forward to nuking those damn hordies when I get my shadow form
---
It’s a joke cause everyone knows ;) not a funny one so I don’t really get all the likes??
---
lol. nobody is pissed off here. But you really want me to be, dont you ;3
---
Great video but the idiots will start spamming "log onto a new server"
---
You don't need the battle.net launcher active to start wow. I'm running it directly from the install path so I never open battle.net anymore
---
I saw Sodapoppin try and gank somebody in Moonglade then got wrecked by the guards. Pretty hilarious.
---
Yooo. Remember Stoya? :D
---
Exactly. It's college. I skipped tons of classes that I thought were trivial, or when I didn't think I'd get anything useful out of the lectures. But don't go there just to play a game on your laptop. It's really distracting to the other students to play games on your laptop in the middle of lecture.
---
Not to mention that most college classes, at least when I went, ranged from 55 to 75 minutes. You can easily step away from WoW for an hour.
---
That gameboy is awesome!
---
For the HORDE
---
Nope. I skip them.
---
He is talking about fear......
---
SMOLDERWEB FTW
---
A bug is not proof that “things are wrong”. It’s a bug, there were plenty of bugs in the beta, which you were probably not there for. 
---
Second, you asserted earlier that Blizzard deliberately made it “different” to appeal to other players, but yet here they fixed a bug that made something harder.
---
So, which is it? Either Blizzard isn’t fixing the issues that pop up to *faithfully* recreate Classic, or they’ve changed the game to make it easier. 
---
You can’t have it both ways.
---
The pressure on classic is even higher, its way harder to keep aggro as a tank and keep people alive as a healer on classic. Just a warning. But I can't help you, I'm just a dps, just wishing you good luck@
---
Agreed, Mankrik is great. High pop, rarely is there a queue and if there is, its maybe 5-15 mins, and that's with logging in during peak hours in the evening.
---
Hmm I didn't notice he was doing that. I figured maybe same level or 1 level less.
---
Lol id love to be arcane my man.
---
do you never wonder why you were socially excluded in school? i feel like if that happened to me i'd want to figure out why, not just double down on it my whole life
---
first time seeing it
---
i have seen so many different variations i have no idea what is good.
---
yeah, i know most of that, at 33 rn, have the right specs and all, and i am getting a load of silk from it so i can level my tailoring for better gear (:
---
You can’t just blame one thing for causing something huge like that, if classic wow was the reason I’m sure it wouldn’t be the ONLY reason, but perhaps
---
hated that movie. humans shoulder pads were way to small
---
This is true
---
Fear can send you off the boat I have done it
---
I'm so confused. Are these people actually arguing that being obese is healthy?
---
Same! Doesn’t seem like an earth shattering change unless you’re a classic PURIST, but even then having a cooler, more detailed looking character model seems like a no-brainer
---
Then have no expectation for the post to be upvoted either.  If you meet expectations, you’re more like to have more upvotes which leads to more views.
---
Thanks! Also for some reason when I type in general chat it says I don’t have permission to, any idea why?
---
Download Auctioneer, it lists the vendor price plus the current auction house value of the item and the mats it can disenchant into in the tooltip.
---
I agree, but tons do and Blizzard is in the business of making money.
---
I’m hoping Classic stays micro transaction free.
---
The opposite.
---
You can still be a decent, compassionate human being even if you're incredibly stupid. So theres hope for you yet.
---
there should be a notification setting in the menu
---
While I fully agree with your logic such rules should be clearly defined before a item drops that warant these. I post in every dungeon group i make that "BOE is always NEED". While there where a few instances where the group decided against it in most cases it was accepted and in the one case where it actually mattered directly used.
---
This is exactly why I’m nervous about any changes being made to Classic. It starts out with a few small QoL tweaks, and in 10 years we just have another retail.
---
High elves doing the nelf bouncy boob jiggle thing is definitely weird on classic...lol
---
Probably Deadmines... Level 20, he said.
---
Exactly! I’m too stoned to want to worry about getting ganked.
---
I can agree here. I did the Barrens on retail and while it took a while, I felt it was done really quick (like maybe a few hours). Barrens last week took FOREVER. I was surprised at how long it took and the pace that leveling has vs retail. I like it better though.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, I know it's important :). But, it is a hobby and I made the add-on primarily for myself, I'm just sharing it so other people can enjoy the utility :). I'll get around to the UI at one time, but right now, working full time + also having time to enjoy Classic comes first :). I would always appreciate assistance though ;)
---
I wouldnt blink and use nova instead to conserve mana
---
They came from behind!
---
Doh
---
yeah because it takes "being good" to use your feign/trap macro
---
* don't fucking pull
---
* let the tank pull
---
* don't try to solo mobs
---
* the tank should be the one pulling
---
* don't target a mob that no one else is targeting
---
* wait for the tank to get a little aggro on all mobs before AoE
---
* if you get aggro, run TO THE TANK
---
Same idea here. I was adamantly against playing a Hunter because of the stigma, so when I eventually rolled one, I wanted to make sure everyone knew I wasn't *"one of those"* hunters.
---
So naturally my character's name is **Huntarwepon Jenkins**
---
I love that it's the middle finger too. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
This is really nice to hear!  Ive bet you guys are enjoying classic more then i! But holy... 14 years and still the same char? Thats awesome!
---
Your role in classic is determined much more by the class you play rather than the spec you play.  
---
Warriors have 2 choices, tank or DPS - it just so happens the fury re-work of 1.12 and gearing made them top tier dps. They were always meant to be tier 1 tanks.    
---
Rogues can DPS, you have 3 choices of spec.    
---
Hunters can DPS, again 3 choices of spec.  
---
Mages/warlocks can DPS, again 3 choices of spec.    
---
It's not an accident that these are the classes on top of the DPS meters as they're all pure DPS (aside from warrior, who when vanilla came out, really sucked at DPS).  
---
Then you get into healer/hybrid classes.  
---
Paladin, top tier healer, can tank 5 mans very effectively, and could theoretically main tank/off tank but it's not ideal, DPS is mostly for meme's.  
---
Shaman, top tier healer, can DPS adequately as elemental in late game gear, enhancement is a meme.    
---
Druid, meh tier healer, but the only TRUE hybrid in the game with the ability to do each roll (DPS,Tank,Heal) to a degree that is decent enough in a raid environment.   
---
Priest, the only pure healer in the game, Shadow gives you the potential to do damage, but never as good as the pure DPS classes which puts you in the hybrid category.  
---
If you reviewed the talents in Holy/Disc you'd notice there is no major abilities you gain that ***significantly*** increase your healing output, they're all small little (albeit noticeable) improvements but it's not like going down the Holy tree gives you access to a heal spell that you otherwise wouldn't have if you went shadow.
---
That is why warriors CAN tank any content in any spec (save main tanking raid bosses), and it is why any healer/hybrid class CAN heal any content in any spec (obviously if you have the gear), you just lose some effectiveness if you are not the "proper" spec.
---
Yea because I haven't always played with 100+ addons. I mean at least the first week I played vanilla anyways.
---
Get a wand asap. You can buy one from a person lessers are 4-6s. Grab a skill as soon as you can. Cloth wearers can go tailor+enchant but those can be hard to level. Herblore is a good money making alternative. I dont play a mage but i know frost allows you to kite mobs efficiently. If you don't go tailoring keep all of your cloth for first aid training. It is super useful. After the wand the next thing is to invest in bags linen bags shouldn't be more than 2s ea. Other than that pick up everything you can, especially grey and white items to vendor for easy cash. Good luck!
---
Shaman: Earth Shock all the things
---
You can get to level 15 with 5-6 hours player tho.
---
It's perfectly analogous. Did you read my explanation? I'll paste it again since you seem to have missed it.
---
&gt;Spy must be used  because everyone else uses it, just like flyers and LFD must be used on retail because everyone else uses it.
---
Both are systems that radically changes the game in bad ways. Both were argued for by people who said "if you don't like it don't use it," and both arguments are wrong for the same reason: it puts the non-user at a huge disadvantage.
---
Few know about it now, but they will as time goes on. The game has only been out a week and will last years. Spy is more than a slight advantage, it totally removes the need to have your head on a swivel in world PvP. It removes the ability to sneak around people completely, without stealth. It changes world PvP dramatically.
---
It's not about the guilds or the players, it's about the knowledge that was available at the time. The Scarshield Spellbinder breaks MC content completely, but it wasn't common knowledge until years after the first MC kill. Now everyone is aware, and the resist requirement that everyone had to deal with on Vanilla no longer exists.
---
That is fundamentally the entire argument; whether this NPC's OP buff belongs in the game or not.
---
You can to an alt, then return the mail within 30 days.

Not a guild, just a channel, you wouldn't even notice.

Using Remote Desktop is not against ToS but using it to access Wow is.  Read the terms carefully.

Barak is the worst Kodobane, maybe ever. When will Barak show us his birth certificate? He dropped a green. Fake Blues!

First, try mobs at least two levels lower than you. They resist your frost less.
---
What a world we live in today. Apparently paying a monthly fee isn't enough for some players. What the fuck? Why should there ever be any additional monetization when they make money off of every player each month. Ridiculous concept.
---
I'm hesitant to tank, not that i dont like it but becasue people are in such a rush that if you dont spend hours researching how to go through the dungeon you get bitched at or kicked.
---
Ya, I know. Was really just trying to get the VC retards in here lol
---
What he's asking about is a feature that was added later where rolling Need on a BoE automatically binds it to you, to deter ninja looters.
---
Holy paladins are pretty darn hood healers. Priests have a better overall toolkit but single target heals... paladin wins

I’m not really talking a lot about the top end of raiding. I’m looking at the leveling process and the beginning of end game.

Papyrus ??

I wrote that as a comment on my curse project for future update already :).

Lol, this happened to me too apparently it happens all the time. Rogue and Warrior rolled need on Venomstrike and stole it from me the only hunter.

It doesn't have stats why the fuck would you need on it?

1g for $3.99. That's about a third of the price last week.

I do like the Talent tree system in Classic over Retail. I feel like I have actual say over my character.

Lol, Yes you can have it both ways. I'm enjoying the game period either way I just don't think it's how it was.
---
I would argue Blizzard made the game eaiser than it was and they clearly didn't do everything correctly as we already know.
---
Like I said, Until proof is provided by either side which hasn't been yet I will stick to my opinion of this not being correct.
---
But why do you play in a PvP server then?
---
I don’t think Classic will get many players into Retail although I could be wrong. There’s a reason why people got excited about Classic, and it’s not just nostalgia, it’s people not liking how Retail turned out.
---
The data is form 2004, the client is the same client used for retail, capable of all the graphical prowess that the retail client is capable of.
---
Upvote for the Fatherliance? 🤗
---
Haha no don't worry I'm not here to kink shame
---
Imagine being a father activist.
---
So u abandoned your friends because you already had 3 days of fun, and you traded these 3 days for months if not years worth of comradary with them?  Thats a shame man.
---
Thank you so much I'm sorry I got busy and forgot about this post
---
I am currently lvl 25 and messing around in the wetlands. Been there for 3 days.
---
Got my fishing to 130 and my skinning is 226.
---
Tailoring is lvl 5 I completely forgot I had it!
---
I wish I would've head your warning about westfall it was painful.
---
I managed to do the deadmines dungeon on saturday it was soooo fun I got such sweet armor! I cannot wait till the next dungeon but tonight I'm gonna continue grinding crocodiles to hit 26.
---
The quest I'm on has enemies at lvl 28 there hard to solo so I'll wait till this afternoon so more ppl are on and can help
---
instructions unclear dick stuck in keyboard
---
You know what I mean though.
---
&gt;pissing off guild, ruining reputation, etc.
---
People who get angry about this are wrong and should be educated. I already had this problem in BFD with a pug. The group leader said I was unethical and that because he had a degree in philosophy he was right.
---
Technically yes, but those generally get swiped by the clothies in the group. Agi 2-handers can only be used efficiently by a Druid or Hunter. So I tend to just pass on the int/spirit stuff.
---
\^ this. In BC it's still pretty easy to wall jump especially if you have levitate. It's how I got the explorer chieve, wall jumping the ridges surrounding the draenei newbie zone (as a BE) so I could get chastised by that tree.
---
That was posted on a brazilian facebook page and has since been deleted.
---
Same, why are people talking about tbc already.  I’m an old school veteran player and tbc was by far my favorite XPac. But let’s not forget what slowly made wow into what it was today. People plowing through content and constantly begging for, what’s next? If we keep acting like this we will again end up with a game made for the few and not the many.
---
Hahah, so do I. Always been using /lick for some reason.
---
There's another thread in this topic where we discussed this. My question was, has Blizzard every actually done this?
---
Not sure, but I think strafing is supposed to be a battleground thing...you can attack while still moving fast. Don't think it's much use in PvE or in grouos.
---
Although...with slower mobs you can run circles around them while attacking, and they won't be able to hit you (much) because they're constantly reorienting.
---
I’m waiting to get my PC set up to start the game, but I was wondering what recommendations y’all have
---
I’m probably gonna be too casual to ever get close to raiding, but I do love the tank roll in dungeons and I definitely want to do some world PvP and battlegrounds when they come out 
---
I’m thinking about a warrior but idk about the time investment. But also I’m not sure it will matter too much for 5 mans
---
Get a trusty healing friend , or take the reins a make groups yourself. :)
---
Yeah I mean believe me I'm no lvl 60 master but once you get rock biter 5 it pretty much always out dps windfury....I still run windfury for the big numbers I like to see but rockbiter is actually so much more dps then any enhance tbh haven't used anything else since
---
What do they have in common? Elves.
---
Glue it!
---
Good healers are always in demand.
---
This is stupid and so are you
---
Dont listen to him that guy has no clue what hes talking about. True faith is bis until aq, the only time you would drop it is for t2 set bonuses with the robe. T1 is trash as hell, the real other option is the strat undead baron robe
---
That's when a good rogue would have anticipated it and used his Gyrofreeze.
---
I have way more respect for the ally that kills me a dozen times while leveling than I do for the horde who run past pvp to tag a quest mob.
---
A lot of people are going to be angry with you for pointing it out, but you're absolutely right. There are a lot of suits at Bliz that don't give a fuck about what the game is or who is playing it, they just want to suck as much money out of it as possible.
---
I can only think of one way to monetize Classic without ruining it, and that is simply charging for created content. Anything like mounts, pets, or boosts completely ruins the game.
---
Wait what? Are you kidding me? He can actually play the game now! What are you on about??
---
I'm surprised you Alliance dogs can even hold a Battle Axe with those scrawny arms of yours.
---
Have they said that they are undecided, or has there simply been no comment?
---
As a tank I agree with op.
---
"We'll just tell the party that we looted it all."
---
Spelled like çrysis
---
This is the PvP mechanics lol like bruh what
---
Its contested for a reason.
---
Ah ok, I dont think my thing is normal though because it's not mentioned in any guides and we tried one more pull and it didnt happen. Your bug sounds worse however lol that is definitely not intended
---
I didn't bring upgraded version of the spell, no. But I didn't really run any dungeons that didn't have casters in them, either, so it hasn't been super useful yet. While leveling dampen magic was super nice, though...
---
Honestly always found some of those moments hilarious, “oh no the lifestealer is growing enraged the continent could be wiped out!” Mappo: *Bonk*
---
“Oh, we’re ok.”
---
Left is okay it's the males that are terrifying to look at
---
You’re not mad...but yet you seek out anyone with a glimmer of a differing opinion and curse them out?
---
Like I've said probably 5 times now in this thread, I don't doubt that it can happen, but it's a bug if it does.
---
Hey, no problem, I'll help if I can.
---
&gt;1) What ability do w get at 30 that would lead to TM being usefull? 
---
Berserker stance. 
---
After that when levelling, PvPing or just fighting out in the world, you'll spend almost all your time there since it gives you access to most of your best abilities and your only other instant weapon damage attack (Whirlwind), plus things like Pummel and Intercept. Yes, you still use Whirlwind when fighting only one enemy, it's instant weapon damage, it's always worth using on CD.
---
After lv30 you'll usually go Charge -&gt; Zerker Stance straight away, so you want TM to allow you to keep the rage with you.
---
&gt;I have heard that 2H fury is great, ESP when you get to 40 and get bloodthirst. Why the mandatory respecc to MS/Arms at 40? FWIW i plan on playing with my wife who is a Hunter, tanking dungeons and soloing. 
---
2h Fury isn't particularly good, it's pathetic damage compared to DW Fury when you've got the gear, and it'll fall to 2h Arms too, it's not a good spec. However, despite that, it's good at levelling pre-40 because until then Arms doesn't have the whole reason you go Arms, the instant weapon damage ability Mortal Strike.
---
Most of Arm's best talents are things that are good when you're a higher level and have good gear, things like Impale, which means that when you're levelling you don't get much benefit from being Arms through your early levels. However, if you do level as something else, you want to respec at lv40 to get Mortal Strike, because it's just that good.
---
The problem with Bloodthirst is that instead of Weapon Damage it scales off AP, which means that while it'll be good later, it's terrible when you're levelling, you won't have the gear to support it. So if you take it when levelling, you're spending 31points to an ability that's going to hit like a wet noodle.
---
Fury only really comes online when you've got great gear, when you're in MC and beyond you have enough gear to support going DW, and you have enough AP and Crit that Bloodthirst and Fury becomes a viable spec. Until then MS builds will outdamage Fury, even in raids.
---
So basically,
---
2h Fury: Decent for levelling pre-40, not because it's particularly strong but because the talents you're taking are giving you tangible benefits, often better than the Arms counterparts. 
---
Arms: Best for PvP and the best for PvE until you've got enough gear to support DW Fury.
---
DW Fury: When you've got the gear to support this you can start becoming the highest DPS class in the game.
---
&gt;Sadly i will probably be soloing more than the others. The healing from Bloodthirst i hear is useful. Plus threat per rage Bloodthirst was touted as the highest (dmg and healing) for tanking. is it just SS/WW/Cleave is so strong in questing? 
---
BT being the highest threat ability is far outside the scope of what we're talking about, that's talking about someone in full raid level PvE gear going into a Fury build to tank. It's viable and yeah you'll get a lot of threat, but that's endgame level PvE content where they've got a lot of gear to support their mitigation and strength, when levelling you have neither. When levelling, just focus on getting good (or even any) tank gear and mitigating damage.
---
&gt;BV makes sense - you spend less rage on BS. But i feel like Imp Demo Shout is the best, esp if you're a tank. Even in solo, i can see where using demo shout is going to be helpful. or.. maybe not? 
---
That's just quality of life stuff, it's just whatever you prefer. Booming Voice is handy because it means you don't have to apply Battle Shout or Demo Shout as often, and if you PvP it's great for helping to shout Rogues out of Stealth.
---
But if you value Imp Demo Shout instead, take that instead, especially if you raid. Someone has to be the Imp Demo Shout bitch, it might as well be you.
---
Basically: None of those talents will change your life, take whichever one you prefer.
---
&gt;Enrage and Blood Craze - how often are we actually getting crit such that these 8 points pay off? Versus say: improved battleshout 5/5 and improved execute 2/2? or even anticipation?
---
Enrage is amazing for PvP and one of the best talents in the tree. Even for PvE it's still amazing. If you wanna get cheeky you can try stand inside cleave range as a Fury Warrior for the enrage damage boost. Your healers may complain though.
---
Blood Craze is incredibly marginal, most PvP builds take it just for the sake of "It's better than nothing", but it's only just barely better than nothing. I personally never take it... Except on a levelling build. When levelling any heal is useful, since you're gonna be just standing around or bandaging for heals anyway, it's about the only time you'll value Spirit as a Warrior, so the tiny heal of Blood Craze is just barely valuable enough that I'll take it on a levelling build.
---
As for how often you get crit, fairly often. You'll be attacked a lot, and you'll be fighting higher level mobs quite a lot, and you won't have any defense nor will you be using shield block. You can fairly regularly expect to see them proc. Also: Worth noting that crit effects do proc off crits that were supressed/avoided by things like +Defense or Shield Block.
---
But whatever, we're only talking about a temporary build that'll serve to carry you to lv40. If you feel like you'd get more value from Imp Battle Shout or Imp Execute, or even Anticipation (this one's more marginal), then go for it. There's no need to min-max here.
---
Yea i figured it out. Push escape button and go to add ons lol. its on the special add on tab in that option. You click unlock and you can move them around.
---
You can go to Wetlands or Ashenval to quest. Another dungeon would be Blackfathom Depths on the border or Darkshore and Ashenval.
---
Thanks! Painted it myself.
---
I haven't seen this in months. I guess I'm okay with seeing it again. It's a good one.
---
Screw that, im gonna go back in time.  Save Bob Ross, and commission him to paint my screen's happy little pixels a nice sienna brown, evergreen green, and titanium hwhite.
---
Yea doctor, I concur
---
Wait a minute. I just checked out your profile...this is THE ChilledChaos? That’s awesome. Been watching your stuff forever. 
---
Glad to see you’re on Classic! Sorry about the bad group.
---
You'll be fine with either dps spec. Talents aren't important for healing while leveling. What is important is gear. Make sure you have a healing set with int and spirit and you'll be fine.
---
Duskwood is prob the best
---
1. Quest give good items 
---
2. Lots of mobs that will drop cloth/silk which you. An either use or sell for $$
---
Relatable
---
Ok but what are you trying to say besides that?
---
metal lol
---
I’ll admit the first 1-2 days were pretty congested but I’m not sure what server you’re playing on if by the end of the first week you were still having to wait for goldtooth+defias spawns. On day 3 I did all of Elwynn+Westfall after work (prime hours) on Herod with a 15k queue without having to wait for spawns. Level 15 with 4-6 hours of playtime per day like the original guy says he has is not at all as impressive as the guy I responded to is implying.
---
If your thing isn’t intended then I’m confused. I’ve run deadlines dozens of times and he spawns two extra adds halfway through the fight every time I’ve done it.
---
Agility is probably better to itemize for early, since it will give you better flurry up time, but both are good really.
---
They're correct. Your playstyle completely changes in a raid and until you do it, you won't be used to it.
---
Yeah definitely makes you look vicious!
---
Almost a trade off, do you want to grind gold? Or grind Dalrends set? (which you're competing with a lot of people for)
---
But think about it right now... You will have to just bank it before people get enough money, which you could just be grinding gold during that time anyways. 
---
And so many people aren't max level right now, you can be an absolute menace with it. Easily just kill people in stunlock lol. Weapons don't mean as much in recent Retail expansions but in Vanilla/BC it would definitely make you hit much harder.
---
Ive done like 5 dungeon runs total. Just questing and checking out a lot of different zones.
---
So you didnt play legion or follow the story at all? Theres a perfectly good reason why we did that
---
Send me a PM and we can get in a Discord of you have it.  I'm a first time WoW player, but loving it so far. (33 Troll Hunter)
---
That doesn't make sense, maybe they're just bad?
---
If u wanna buy gold just do it dude.
---
I’d prefer a wow2 if that was the case. New client. New story in the universe.
---
BM hunter mend pet dispels Novak and polys also pet cant be cc'd under the effects of bestial wrath.
---
sounds like your options are warrior, druin, and paladin.  and perhaps, hunter (pet tank?)
---
Bored at work and was able to parse the time remaining from the WoW Window. :)
---
Interesting, I think it should work for throws too, I’ll test this out tonight.
---
Learn to lead and you can pick who comes with ya. 
---
I.e no hunters to pull and ninja your rolls from everyone else lol
---
Also, thong != dong.
---
Well, it goes without saying that he will have to take at least 2 weeks off work/school/family to get ready for raiding and PvP.
---
But at least it's not leveling that is keeping him from going out.
---
I’m in your boat as well. I headed to wetlands. It’s pretty nice here. If you like elf’s you could do a few quests in ashenvale as well.
---
&gt; they are eating the most healthy plates of food ever created. One of them is just eating at a rate that will ~double their weight by the time the 5 years are up.
---
I don't believe that's possible. There's no rate at which you can consume "the most healthy plate of food ever created" such that it doubles your mass in five years. That's impossible, simply by definition. If the food could supply that kind of caloric density then it's unhealthy garbage.
---
&gt; Like dude you're abusing logic here. 
---
You're asking me to reason from *your* bad preconceptions, but I don't share them, so I can't.
---
&gt; Given the choice, 99/100 people take that 180lb body and not the 300lb body.
---
You said that was something I couldn't know at the time I made the decision, so why would that matter?
---
You can learn core mechanics just fine pre raiding. Some bosses have new mechanics that you'd have to learn in raids but I would say around level 40 your class should start to feel completed and you'd start learning how it goes.
---
How do you make the item appear in the chat like that?
---
In a few levels you can do Gnomer and SM Lib.
---
For zones? You're only real options off the top of my head are Wetlands and maybe Ashenvale.
---
If you download and install Questie it will show all the available quests in their corresponding zones.
---
Uh yes you can get rich. Sounds like you're poor AND biased. You yourself are stuck in that cycle. How does it feel to be unfairly judged?
---
My wife is the same way. I discovered that when I read out loud to her, she falls asleep incredibly fast.  I love reading and I love laying in bed with her so I will read to her every night until I hear her deep breathing. Then I get up and go play games until I’m tired.  She tells me my voice is the perfect amount of monotonous for her. She never remembers what I read because she falls asleep so quickly, so I get to pick the books and pick up where I’ve left off. It’s a win-win for both of us.
---
Does anyone else have Questie, get about 4 quests into each zone and then decide that you don’t like to follow directions? It’s a problem...
---
Take my upvote,
---
uh ha ha
---
Yea, maybe some people never went through uni or it's been a while and they forget, but there are definitely classes that are virtually pointless in many tracks.
---
Hell, back in the day my school had two teachers teaching the same class and I got unlucky. My friend, taking the same course in a different block, had no attendance policy and aced the class while showing up to about 10% of the lectures. Meanwhile mine had an attendance policy despite the professor rambling on for the entire class period about politics (during an election period) and then telling us to go read the text on our own.
---
People commenting on this with no context...
---
These are the built-in raid style party frame you can enable by selecting that option in the game's menu. That is not an addon.
---
To enable them join a party &gt; click the popout menu on the left of the party list &gt; click the "i" icon in the top right and it will open the interface settings &gt; select "raid profiles" &gt; check "Use Raid-Style Party Frames"
---
Additionally to move your avatar from the top left right click on it and select "Move frame" &gt; "Unlock frame"
---
Like I said I have no UI addons installed.
---
probably I should start selling rage potions at mailboxes for a 300% mark up
---
I’m a lv 29 Horde Rogue. I messed leveling up and did a couple quests from each region at my level, is there a guide I can jump into mid way once I reach a certain point? A lot of guides I see have very detailed routes, but most of what they list I have done.
---
I am fine grinding to a certain level if it means I can then jump into a guide and follow it up.
---
For reference I have cleared most of barrens, only a couple south barren quests left, all of thousand needles (except salt flats), most of Ashenvale, a couple in stone talon, all of hillsbrad.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
I was about to comment and suggest crossposting this to classicwow.
---
It's almost like the group of people who can only comprehend a 2-word mantra aren't capable of understanding the nuances, history, or capabilities of addons from vanilla vs. now.  Color me surprised.
---
Yeah I thought as much. When I played retail years ago it worked flawlessly with a quest addon I had and would tell me exactly where to go for each step. I've noticed the arrow for the death location though.
---
Phew ok.
---
They say that when you're a duck in Classic you get remembered for it and may struggle to get into group content in future.
---
Whether or not that matters to you is another thing entirely.
---
Did your mom put a golden star on the fridge next to your name for such a monumental achievement?
---
Your argument is full of fallacies. 1. Autist is what they used to call people with autism, but it was seen as degrading so the clinic field was moved away from it. 2. just because someone in authority(your wife) does not mean that they are correct. 3. you say you would never call someone that to their face, but every type of person is on the internet, so the "this is the internet" comment is invalid.
---
Ok trump lol
---
Kinda depends on the individual, honestly. Some grasp it faster than others.
---
Love when people like you are up on their high horse saying things like "I can't believe you people", "you're wrong sorry kid" and "if you care do research" but then they end up being in the wrong while pulling random shit out of their ass and scoffing at someone asking for a source. Hate to break it to you but you're wrong, kid.
---
Because its where boys became men. In all reality though, wow just inst wow without world pvp, its an essential, core component to the game.
---
She alive if you check her facebook, she has posts from August.

My play time is right at 6 days now as a warrior and im only 49, I'd say he definitely knew what he was doing. I dont tho lol

My GF started playing it too. You shouldn't have to 'deal' with your SO.
---
Dude, you have both Vuhdo and some variation of MoveAnything here. How you gonna just pretend you don't? 
---
Sucks you lost some gold but this is almost certainly an addon causing the bug.

Ninja skills have vastly increased, I know every creaky floorboard like a kid sneaking to play video games at night.... wait that's exactly what it is.

Oh shit, she's the woman that **"swims 8 kilometers a day"**

I agree fully. I didn’t realize everyone would be so toxic about this, I don’t want it either but we should talk about it realistically if we want Classic to continue healthily
---
I hope they offer a TBC

👍

Not a problem if you start the group!

Loving hearing all these stories! This traumatising experience has led to me completing Hillsbrad in complete stealth

Hey there’s like 3 guilds on Old Blanchy that use that exact same copy/paste. Except instead of Red Bull, it’s monster energy for one of them.

reddit justification posts, nice

It's not about the kills in World PVP it's about sending a message.

Someone doing meth is a bigger problem for the community than people playing computer games in class (and a bigger danger to themselves).

I feel like a boat anchor.  I get one hit in before its dead...generating next to no rage.

Maybe your brain will work better if you lose some weight.
---
Wait isa this a joke?  I never played classic, if you mean did I train it then yes.
---
I said it was pointless due to the fact there’s zero reward and isn’t the same post I clearly say when the honor system is rolled out I too will be participating god you literally cannot read. I’m laughing at the fact you claimed to have read my post and can’t see I clearly said I would
---
Partake once honor system was rolled out and there was a point to killing people other than having fun at someone else’s expense. Try actually reading someone’s post before attacking them like a child. The only immature thing here is you. Why don’t you go play with your power ranger action figures and let the grownups talk lil guy ?
---
I actually do like healing, especially in PVP as it's more fast paced and interesting. I kind of like being the "PVP main tank" as a priest and swatting people away as they try to kill me through fear, shields, heals, cooldowns etc. I don't like healing in PVE as much, but I'd rather be able to raid and heal than not be invited at all.
---
This is dumb, there is a thottbot comment dated  [2005/08/06](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9098/scarshield-spellbinder#comments:id=2815727) explaining how this works.
---
Change it or don't change it.  Doesn't matter to me.  I'll be moving through all the content and enjoying it.
---
Teach him an instrument or something actually useful
---
If you choose tank and people don't follow your pace or instructions, feel free to whisper the healer to let the person die to help them learn.
---
If you choose healer, always back up your tank and always heal/buff warriors in the wild. We have a special bond and you must not break that!
---
More content in 2004? Easy, it was EverQuest followed closely by DAOC.
---
Get rid of the ad block shit, it's really annoying
---
Dominos does this but also allows you to change it on the fly. You click  the dominos button around the edge of the minimap, you hover over a  button, you hit escape to clear it or any button to bind it to that key, you click okay, done.
---
I’d like to subscribe to more please

It does take a good deal of practice. People watch it and think mage is just an easy class free level 60 but one small things can ruin a pull and lead to a lot of downtime if you can’t easily reset it. The pull is the hardest part. Once you get that first blizzard down it should go pretty smooth if the math checks out with mana and mob health.
---
Even when you get to 60, watch out for ACTUAL good ret paladins that know how to PvP.
---
Repentance / hammer of Justice / blessing of freedom and a swiftness potion and you are gone. Don't forget we have basically 3 lifes with bubble and lay on hands.

My mum and I used to play wow all the time together. From late bc all the way through legion! Unfortunately she’s lost the interest she had in the game, but I still hold onto those fond memories
---
This is awesome dude! Looks like it'd be a sweet SNES game :). How long did it take?
---
Give the tank time to get threat, only attack their target, multishot only when the tank has a sunder/revenge on the targets, macro growl to turn it off or just keep it off for the dungeon, and keep an eye on where your pet is at all times. This is for a warrior tanking.
---
I almost always leave warriors alone. They have it rough enough as it is, its pathetic
---
The FX system by quite a bit. Spend that saved 50 (lb, quid, euro?) on a nice 400-600 watt power supply. Then down the line grab a better graphics card like a 1050 from nvidia or a 570 from amd.

But in hindsight I think it would probably have been better to black out his name. The point of the post was humor and not to name and shame. So point taken.

What happens when you die? I've never played before

Use TeamViewer to get into the queue ~1hour before you leave work...

&gt; The outcome of the roll is entirely irrelevant.
---
You are right. It doesn't matter. Regardless of if he won or loss he at the very least provided his reasoning. If you disagree then explain to him why and have a discussion as to why he's wrong rather than straight kicking him. Even if this was soley the priest kicking him, the other hunter saying he "Hunter'd the staff" when all he did was roll need is childish. 
---
Int increases mana pools + spell damage if I'm correct, so technically he's also right about the staff benefiting him. Imagine being kicked for explaining your reasoning - I'd bet you'd be upset too.
---
Haha holy shit no it’s not.
---
No it’s because warriors have intercept and we would be stupid op with two incombat charges.
---
&gt; There's no simple way to get rich like there is to lose weight.
---
Simple way to lose weight: Stop eating shit and put every minute of extra time you have into exercise.
---
Simple way to become rich: Stop buying shit and put every spare penny you have in an S&amp;P500 ETF.
---
They are simple, but they require willpower and take time. Outliers will exist -- i.e. extreme poverty and medical issues -- but for the majority of people, these simple steps will make you skinny and/or rich.

There are two notable differences between the Vanilla AH and the Retail AH:
---
1) The listings are ordered by bid price and without a calculator there's no way to determine the unit price.
---
2) Not all listings require a deposit.
---
That 2nd one is really big for making money at this point in the game. If you list a stack of 20 copper ore, for instance, you pay a deposit to list that stack. If you list one copper ore, there is no deposit. *(I don't know if this is a general AH thing, or if it applies only because I'm selling basic copper ore and light leather.)*
---
This also means if you post singly, that it is much easier for you to cancel your auctions as it only costs a 2c penalty per cancelled auction, and you "lose" your deposit of 0c.
---
The first item means that unless someone is using an addon, the AH is a confused jumble that's difficult to tell what's the best deal (even with a calculator) because the items are listed by bid price (which has no relation to unit price).
---
It's perfectly fine.
---
I'm a fury warrior and I'm planning on rolling on every DPS mail/leather that's an upgrade.
---
Sponsorships, brand deals and I think they have a contract internally that states x% of money made on the main channel gets distributed to active members. They had this agreement for the beginning of BFA and I'm assuming it's still ongoing (could be wrong on this).
---
You keep what you kill.
---
Do you get to Mt Hyjal very often? What am I saying? Of course you don't.
---
I am doing what you mention, often I'll send the void to attack a 2nd mob to build that threat while I dot and fear the first mob. I generally avoid life drain or shadow bolts and wand instead, to preserve mana. I have 1361 mana total, Siphon Life and Immolate for example are 150 mana each. 4 dots is 600 mana, a life tap gains 202 mana, I have 700 HP + healthstone + 20 hp pots (from alchemy). Mobs connect to me for about 70 damage every 2.5 seconds, siphon life is 17 hp per 3 sec, drain life is 33 hp/s for a large mana investment. Effectively I do everything I can to not get hit because regaining life is inefficient. 
---
idk, sorry, feeling disheartened. It feels like I am doing everything I can and it's still been the worst leveling experience I remember, and that's having played the original game on release. 
---
I dont have questions because I dont know what to ask :|
---
PLEASE
---
That hit me right in the heartstrings
---
What a fantastic idea thanks. Itll definitely help until I get used to the keys.
---
Almost no one thinks being fat is good for your health - the idea is to stop being sanctimonious assholes about it
---
Your logic is sound and your argument is flawless. 
---
I see no way they can try to argue your point.
---
I always try to do this, but my groups seems to have been in doubt who the tank is, so they all tank
---
I don't ask people about their religion online, so I don't really understand how'd you know you would have met a jewish person that has been offended by holocaust jokes.
---
All the track skills are definitely worth it especially in zones like STV where I hop between tracking quests mobs and enemy players.
---
Get that shit out of this subreddit this isn't r/wow or Facebook
---
It's a cool wave to be on. Though, unlike the original release of the game, there are not millions of people soon to be following. Enjoy it while it's lit.
---
But, did you have fun? Because it sounds like you had fun. I love classic, lol.
---
Just level arms, I still tank things and solo questing is actually doable. I'm tanking as prot at 60 too but I don't want to blow my head off before I get there.
---
No, that's when you started backpedalling, and an offtank is using it because they dont' have enough hit. As a tank we're not wearing the leather hit attack power pieces. Most off tanks aren't prot(then again your MT probably isn't either). 
---
And we're done here, it's time to go back to work, have fun in classic my dude!
---
A healer in my mythic progression guild on retail clicks everything and still pulls purple/orange parses. He's a healer in classic as well, and still clicking away keeping everyone nice and alive.
---
Imagine judging a simple post so harshly just because they play the game differently from you
---
arent wendingos humanoids?
---
He talks about how he's a god and everyone else are suckers as if it's some big joke but when you watch for a while you see that's exactly how he behaves. He makes excuses to take whatever he wants because rules are for little people. And getting what he wants isn't enough. He revels in the emotional anguish of those he is denying. 
---
I'm not saying Asmongold is dumb or untalented. But he is powerhungry and those are the last people who should ever be trusted with any power whatsoever. If he were made assistant manager of a Starbucks he would change schedules around just to fuck with people's lives. 
---
You can hear it in how he talks about Wrath. He thinks that having 4 raid difficulties was worse for the community than LFD because it allowed lesser players to get gear and be able to fight back and prevent better players from running the server (presumably through controlling Devilsaur and Black Lotus spawns and the like). He thinks that without a hierarchy then society becomes chaotic and thus whatever awful things the powerful have to do to impose order are justified.

Mind control hat?

20 for Instant and Crip, 24 for Mind Numbing

Oh you mean nose caffeine?

Would also be interested in this!

I thought that was Diablo?

[THEY HAVE WRONGED US!](https://i.imgur.com/HRB0nDU.png)
---
I’m okay with them not breaking any.
---
The critical strike from axe specialization is usually better than the extra auto attack from sword specialization. Both are good.
---
Fury is good, but not until the end game. When dual wielding you have -19% to hit with your off hand, that's a lot of lost rage when compared to the hit chance for a 2her.  Generally you want to use a 2her for everything while leveling, even tanking. That's because in classic shields block a flat amount that typically isn't very significant while leveling. Stacking stamina and using a 2her for more damage/aggro is usually a better approach.
---
Arms is about having the weapon with the highest top end damage. Typically that means when comparing two weapons at the same level, the one with the slower speed is generally better. That's not always the case though because all loot is different. For example a 3.0s attack speed axe with 40-50 damage range is better than an 3.5s attack speed 38-48. People say slower is better, but what they really mean is higher top end is better. That's because abilities like mortal strike use your weapon damage to calculate damage.
---
Thank you Kanye, very edgy
---
You only need to click attack once then the game will auto swing. A weapon swing timer addon will help you measure this time frame. 
---
I’m not sure if this is the case for warriors, but certain rogue abilities reset your swing time when cast so you typically want to wait until immediately after a swing to use an ability. It also helps to make sure your white hit doesn’t crit or anything that would make you not want to use your abilities.
---
This is my favourite quest line in wow. I completed it for the first time as a highly undergeared mage in early TBC before taking a break from wow and joining again in WOTLK. Something about it just stuck with me, can wait to complete it again!
---
Name plates can't hide lol.
---
Yep, nobody ever listens, and then they get surprised when I bail, because they are having a good time
---
Don't level prot. Don't do it. Please. For your mental health.
---
Source?
---
If your pet has a focus dump it probably won't have the focus to use growl when you click it, turning on autocast makes it start saving focus until it can use it though.
---
ag ee oo p is me lo ve you
---
yea it's great, makes questing so easy
---
Welcome to the internet
---
Im more of a /dance kinda rogue
---
Many people also are scared of tanking. I convinced some warrior who only wanted to go as dd to try tanking.
---
Told him not much can go wrong in a level 18 dungeon as a level 20.
---
He later whispered me and told me he is doing it and that it is working well.
---
Im pretty sure you can simplify this a ton by just using
---
/cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead][] spell
---
and then just add in your shift/control modifiers. 
---
This macro as-is will cast on your mouseover target first, if no mouseover then it will cast on your target, and if no target it will yourself.
---
By the time you can swap I'll be 50 yards away. #imtheinvisibleman
---
Yojamba forever! I always lay down in a bed before signing off for the night, maybe see you in the beds sometime.
---
Buy the first one, then find 2x8GB DDR3 memory modules and replace the memory (memory is pretty cheap). When you get the money, replace the graphics card with something that has 4GB or 8GB  RAM.
---
What’s up with the ceiling tiles? Do you live in an office building? Lol just curious.
---
I dont think groups are going to be as strict as in vanilla because it's probably going to be super hard to get enough people except for the few giant guilds that will inevitably emerge on each server.
---
both are yes.  but however id your enjoying prot stay prot take those instant dounge ques and dungeons level.   but just for reference   ive been taking a both a fury warrior and a resto druid   with no problem at all.  spec only starts mattering for tanking around lvl 45+
---
Thats terrible for the wrists fyi.  She needs a better ergo setup asap.
---
oh! I forgot OmniCC. I'll edit that. Also thanks for your comment.
---
Then why do they like me?
---
Fuck you too, asswipe
---
I'm not making fun of them at all, I was just laughing at a guy who wrote the word 'autist' in a comment and then people whined about it. I didn't make the joke. But it's also hilarious to me how clearly triggered you are about it, lol. Like i'm the fuckwit here.
---
Zandalar tribe, i have gotten like a 30min queue at max but usually the queues are like 5min or not even there
---
I would disagree. What they are doing is looking at their business model and not their customer base. They have other options as stated and they didn't use them because of the impact and negativity it would cause
---
Read Sven story, also cool how his family got Butchered😊 dark stories in Duskwood if you pay attention to details
---
just did this quest and skipped through the dialog because i had done it in the past but i did not know about all thos3 details. really good quest line
---
By that logic, are orcs and tauren the only good races?
---
Not gnomes ☑️
---
Cannot be priests ☑️
---
Once you learn how to replicate a piece of art, all there is to do is to draw something new using the same style.
---
It's totally normal. The 40-50 range was notoriously difficult in Vanilla.
---
I'm not sure, but i do know you can skin them for some reason!
---
Why would an offtank use this over nightfall man?
---
I am not backpedaling. You are trying to cherry pick my words. Why are we talking about naxx weapons? Im talking about the current game we are playing.
---
Gatherlite is an alternative that works great for me, no bugs and you can share data with guildies
---
To  enable them join a party &gt; click the popout menu on the left of the  party list &gt; click the "i" icon in the top right and it will open the  interface settings &gt; select "raid profiles" &gt; check "Use  Raid-Style Party Frames"
---
Leave him. The weak must be culled.
---
Not hanging out with friends for a week doesn't mean you dont have any.
---
I would call them a hacker and report them for having more than 12 characters in their name.
---
Like I said before, I didn't like flying mounts but I still used them for stuff, even as I felt they ruined the game.  I don't like Layering one bit for many reasons, including abuse.  But Blizzard has put players in the position of abusing it or falling behind players that do (a comparison would be a company in the US failing/struggling compared to competitors for refusing to use tax shelters).
---
&gt;One could have the impression that you actually like it because you can abuse it
---
Would you see me using a flying mount in wotlk and say "wow this guy really actually likes flying mounts"?  That would be a silly assumption.
---
If it was a single player game, of course I wouldn't abuse something like Layering.  But it's an MMO where you are competing economically with your own faction and in pvp with the opposing faction.  Blizzard has put players in a situation where Layering is a part of the game, whether I like it or not.
---
It's one of the reasons steroids are banned from sports - if they were legalized, players would feel they were required to use steroids to be competitive, even though they don't want to as it could jeapardize their health.
---
Some of us have jobs.
---
People are finally off their release vacation so daytime play has slowed down. Queues will start up once people get off work.
---
Yo.  Dark.
---
People work and go to school, back to reality
---
Fellow deviant I see. May the light be with you.
---
Right now it is reacting to a spike in subscriptions due to Classic. If it sustains, every 1 mil subs = \~$180 mil annually, which is mostly profit as there aren't further development costs, and that is massive.
---
Agreed!! It’s cool how their relationship managed to encompass compassion and deceit and humor and sadness all in one. Really is an amazing duo.
---
I cant believe no one else noticed it but this dude got to 60 in 6d9h4m20s. 6 9 4 20. 69 420 ayyyyyy lmao my duded yall got trolled.
---
Remember when layering was supposed to prevent or heavily mitigate this after the "exodus"? Didn't even last a week.
---
Now you have layering, mass server transfers, and ques. Sick
---
A decent Warrior ranged weapon can contribute stats. You wouldn’t ever Need on a Venomstrike or anything like that, but a decent “of the Bear” bow would definitely be worthwhile.
---
I think they are scared to get server blacklisted.
---
Warriors are very good but also gear dependent. You can burn through the levels tanking for dungeons though, so you can probably avoid the awful process that is solo leveling a warrior.
---
Hell, any low drop drake was exciting. One of my first flying mounts was Drake of the North Wind. Winning that role while leveling in dungeons was extremely exciting for me.
---
It's not wrong if at the same time you plan on healing. But if the priest is maining healing just let them have it. Your going to cause more drama then what it's worth at some point.
---
Or just say in the beginning I'm rolling on healing gear.
---
Please link guide or make one. I need to play wow at work
---
Travel sucks, but it makes getting your mount that much more gratifying. Epic mount makes you feel like a god.
---
I had someone do that in EVE Online.  Stole a Gistii MWD when they were hot shit, and warped out before I could punish them.  Gloated/linked it in local.  
---
I kept a note of the name and pressed on with my day.  Months later; I was running a Scimitar in incursions, and low and behold, who shows up in the group in a very expensively fitted faction ship...  The FC sent him in to grab room aggro, and me in to keep him up while the rest of the "healers" got into the area.
---
And I kept him alive because I'm not an asshole like that.  But while we were waiting for another area to pop, I linked the item and told him to consider that they are still in a ship because I'm a better person than them.
---
No focus in classic
---
Would be an interesting prospect. If they reset the server every few years so we can always play classic wow, thatd be cool
---
Not sure if high or 12 years old.
---
Now is the time to play then. There are tons of dungeon farm groups rn.
---
I fucking knew it!!!
---
Spirit is shit for warlocks and mages. You are never outside the FSR for regen to kick in unless you screwed up. 
---
Warlocks lifetap, mages evocate/gem. 
---
Paladins and shamans want MP5 as they aren’t often outside the FSR. 
---
Priests and druids are stopcasters who love maximizing time outside the FSR to maximize regen.
---
The Tukui client had a working version from day one
---
&gt; pvp barely exists from a competitive standpoint.  
---
\*stares in rank 14 grind\*
---
Source for what?  It’s just straight up not true. By 1.12 there are tons of quests added that make it unnecessary to ever grind. At all. 
---
Now in earlier versions of vanilla...massively different story for sure.
---
Dustwallow was painful with high quality on, turned that way back down for the zone :)
---
Just disable your adblock on the site and you will be ok

ah, retail, i dont miss it

Print Screen is for amateurs and people with one monitor. Win+Shift+S is the way to go. Pick exactly what you want, cropped the way you want, then Ctrl+V. You can even post it straight to reddit if you like, without putting it on imgur first.
---
The point of game theory is, that these ARE the rules (in human psychology)
---
Oh sweet I'll try this later. I tried the max foreground fps trick but that didn't fix it
---
Everyone in Vanilla that raided seriously knew about this while MC was current content.
---
People who pull aggro before the healer had time to drink mana can GBTR.  (After we told them twice not to do it)
---
/target PlayerName or /target party# (where "#" is the number from 1 to 4, corresponding to their position in the party).
---
Nonsense. Mages should just go in and Flamestrike/Blizzard right away,
---
the addon fieldguide has all class spells and what level they get them at
---
The reason I tell somebody not to do meth isn't because it affects *me.* I don't tell them, "hey, don't do meth because you're going to make my life worse." I say it because I think it would be beneficial for them not to do meth. The scale is different, but the same thing applies. If you're playing during a lecture, you may have a problem. Not to mention, you're distracting people around you.
---
Third option is super old garbage.
---
I meant acceptable for their health.
---
Fantastic reply - thank you.  I should have been a bit more clear and indicate that all those questions were in reference more towards leveling builds.  Raiding has it's own metagame and i'll figure it out then (the hardest part will be finding time to raid with three young children).  I want a build that i can survive well solo-questing, and be able to tank dungeons effectively if not optimally through to about the high 50's. nearing end-game i will no doubt have to re-spec (sounds like 40 is as good a time as any) and can figure it out then, older and wiser.  I'm thinking now about going cruelty-&gt;deflection-&gt;TM-&gt;Fury to 40. 
---
I started warrior tanking in Cata, after tanking Feral in Wrath and prot Pally in BC.  In Wow Classic 2004, i played a gimpy yet fun Druid. lol.
---
Going to take opposite position here, but just for the value of discussion.  My actual position is: depends on situationally.
---
The rogue doesn’t know how much of an upgrade it is, he probably doesn’t see the lack of shoulders on the mage.  He has no idea if it’s minor upgrade or major.  And if he can sell it for several good, that can mean he can buy an upgrade he needs.
---
So maybe he should just sell it to the mage, at maybe even a reduced cost so as to “split the loot”?
---
Saving for when you release a guide 👀
---
The bar at the top, that’s titans panel right? I want something to track exp/hr since I’ve switched to grinding
---
I know I know. It was a joke. When I posted that anyone at gmt -7 or lower would have been in thursday already.
---
The issue is that spirit isn't a needed stat for holy paladins. They want intellect.
---
This is not what barrens general chat looks like...
---
Dude are you serious? 
---
And now you help them by posting it here. 
---
How dumb can you be? 
---
Or maby you are supporting them.
---
This is my first WoW experience. However, I’m part of a pretty large guild that some of my coworkers are in with some chill down to earth people.
---
We’re on Kurinaxx (horde) if you’re interested in trying it out. I’m still in Durotar(lvl 8) and I stream on Facebook Gaming if you ever want to come check it out and see if you’d be interested in joining.
---
A time machine, apparently.
---
holy shit you can tell this one cut deep! Truly though, it's very true most DPS are not used to waiting a bit before blowing their loads.
---
No one knows blame games like healers do
---
The takeaway isn't that WoW classic is the issue.  The takeaway is that the relationship wasn't as much fun as setting giraffes on fire in the barrens.
---
I just recently picked up a newinbox 570 for 90$ and a used vega64 for 280$ off craigslist! I feel like i got away with murder.
---
Plz halp....
---
r/classicwowplus
---
Sure.
---
Is it because they're obese, or is it that the behaviors and diet that result in obesity also shorten your lifespan?
---
If you engaged in the same behaviors but were thin, would you live as long? If you engaged in healthy behaviors and ate a good diet, would you live longer even if you stayed obese? It turns out the answers to both of those disprove the conjecture that it's the *obesity* that's shortening your life, and *that's* a fact backed by science.
---
[Another fact backed by science](https://www.tesh.com/articles/the-beautiful-people-live-longer/) is that more attractive people live longer. Does that mean we should urge ugly people into plastic surgery to improve their lives, or again, is there a confounding effect? Might the stress of day-to-day social interaction in a culture that prizes attractiveness *itself* reduce lifespan?
---
In your view, are fat people also ugly? If that's the case, then don't you have at least a partial explanation for their shortened lifespan that has nothing to do with health?
---
Tried using this macro and found that it breaks frequently. Had to repeatedly stop, delete it and recreate it to have it work again. Got fed up and just went back to the regular toggle.
---
You don’t need escape artist in PvP, the only class it helps you with is mages who will probably still beat you unless you can smash their faces in as soon as you get to them. Dwarves are great because of stoneform. Honestly I think humans are better than Gnomes for PvP...
---
Looks like I chose wisely and my server isn't in either column.
---
If the Brazilians move to Netherwind, no one is leaving Incendius.
---
Right cause it was so easy to pick a server after all the extra ones that they had to open up. That also filled up. Guess next time just have everyone wait 3 weeks to start playing.
---
Damn, man. Moi aussi. Well what actually happened was that I transferred to a nearby community college from university before I inevitably fell into academic probation. Looking back though, I definitely was NOT one of those people who belonged in college despite being labeled by my peers as the smart kid.
---
Mend pet talent dispels all magic effects on pet. Also bestial wrath makes them immune. I'd be laughing as my pet solos the mage that tries this

I'm sure everyone is really grateful for that revolutionary idea, doc.

---
Honestly serious talk, as a developper myself, as user, and just as a smart guy like maybe billions on that earth.. Why is that damn print screen button just does not open the damn tool in windows for print screen, where you could just then crop the image, reduce it, and then copy the shit of it into your clipboard ? This "press a key, nothing is shown, go to paint and paste" thing is the worst user experience in the world ! (yes, even worse than playing boomkin)
---
This is in the standard UI for the game.
---
I set my keybinds onto the action bar itself. So like, whenever I press F1, it uses whatever I dropped into that box on my action bar.
---
Makes it super easy to move spells to another button too. I just drag and drop onto another box bound to a different button.
---
Oh, well either way, mashing it starts auto attack when it is macro'd. =) Try it. 
---
/cast Charge(rank 1)
---
/attack
---
something like that?
---
"infinitely" lol ok man
---
That's not the same thing. If you got to the dungeon early and solod the first pull and a boe blue dropped that you werent going to use. Would you tell the group and have everyone roll on it?
---
Pfft why duel, me and my druid buddy will just go to stv and kill everything i dont find cute
---
Actually i just finished work for the day, i don't care anymore, please feel free to PM your blog posts about this later.
---
Spell batching!
---
This has nothing to do with the guy being a hunter
---
The people around him are adults... they can choose to look at the profs screen instead of some random playing wow.
---
Not really a good comparison. Warriors use nail/leather gear. Paladins don't use spirit.
---
I mean it's only a week, your relationship will survive if you ask if you can obsess over something for a week then dial it back a bit
---
Got in a massive fight for daring to do something on my own.  Enjoyed two nights of WoW.  
---
It’s whatever.  I’m not going to fully ignore my wife for this game, but at the same time I want my time to play.  It basically comes down to compromise.
---
Rattlegore Represent!
---
Though I am concerned about the A:H ratio.
---
well I know what im doing tonight.
---
Yeah if that happened I would just stick to TBC.
---
While I did like parts of Wrath it was definitely the beginning of the end I feel.
---
Go back to retail OP
---
Dick move
---
Rogues are chaotic evil. They see you fighting something, they'll come up and stab you because your name is red. When you catch a glimpse of red and hear the stealth sound, you *know* what's coming, every time. 
---
As a Druid, I try to be more Chaotic Neutral. Am I going stealth to run away or to circle back and stab you? Am I going to root you and then starfire, or /dance? Am I going to sleep the adds you accidentally pulled and save your life, or am I going to train adds onto you just for fun? You just don't know! And honestly I don't know either.
---
I made a shaman because I want to heal dungeons while leveling and end-game. Problem I'm worried about is if it I put my talents into resto I won't be able to quest well. Conversely, if I put points into ele or enh, I won't be able to heal when I get into the 40 range (scarlet monastery, etc).
---
What are you other shaman healers doing to work around this?
---
I don't mind relearning talents at 60 to go full resto, I just want to heal AND solo quest until then.
---
Don't remember twitch channel shilling in vanilla. #nochanges
---
Can you still get to Hyjal? Wall jump physics are different than Vanilla I believe. I know top of Ironforge is (obviously) still possible as OP has shown and I have done it myself. I believe Old Ironforge can still be accessed if you have a means to levitate/slow fall. I also believe dancing troll village is still accessible. But I have not heard of anyone getting back into Hyjal yet.
---
Any criticism at all is met by someone saying this. It's ok to admit it's not a perfect game, it doesn't mean it isn't a good game.
---
Thanks! Appreciate that as the guy selling the third one was really convincing!
---
I think the idea is that it takes 2 druids forever to kill each other. And either one can just run away as the other's only CC (root) doesn't work. So it's a waste of time to engage at all. This might be more true at 60 than at low levels.
---
Where's the image from ? I stopped following the game's story long ago, but I want to see more Sylvanas.
---
Isn't this the opening to Mogworld?
---
How tho!
---
I love how you equate slow leveling with not knowing what you're doing. Not everyone needs or wants to play at the speed of light.
---
It's happened on my Night Elf Hunter too so I don't think so. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one having this problem.
---
This is the most annoying thing for me lol trying to LOS pull and every one of themselves immediately dpsing *sigh*
---
The first one. Do NOT buy that 3rd one lmao.
---
I don't like seeing all these posts about the opposite faction helping eachother
---
More like this amount of people joined an RPPVP server with no intention of PVP or RP just wanted a server where the population was on point.
---
It looks like Dobby and a squirrel
---
Anyone who throws a fit knows itemisation. Paladins don't go for spirit.
---
Do horde ever not attack on sight? When I pass by lowbies I just walk past, if I pass by a higher lv horde I get shit on. Every. Last. Time. Nowadays I just kill everyone unless they’re 10 levels below.
---
This tends to be the logic for modern day mob 'justice:, even if in principle I agree.
---
&gt;Let's get back to you thinking an off tank would use this. Do you know what the proc does?
---
Yes, I do, and your offtank is using it for damage because your off tank is arms. You do understand that your offtank is going to be random arms warrior B who is contributing by doing damage when unneeded right? you do know we swapped weapons during fights right? Do you think warriors who were tanking stayed with a sword/board the entire fight or would even be protection?? That makes absolutely no sense, that's a waste of your time. 
---
Have you ever PLAYED a warrior in a raid? Since fury is a straight up better pve damage dealer spec as we came to learn over the course of time(there weren't a lot of them in the beginning), 2 handeds started falling into the off tanks. Many people who were the off tank would be arms because it required far less gear investment.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I almost went for the third one as the guy was super convincing!
---
I hit 70 agility in osrs because of class.
---
Check out returnofreckoning.com, its a community run private server and they’ve tried to remedy the class imbalance and still make balance updates. It is an EU based server, so if youre an NA player pops will be lower on NA peak time, but I’ve found theres still plenty of people doing RvR and Scenarios even late at night EST
---
Warrior, Mage, Warlock
---
He can’t because he rolled horde
---
Right I forgot about that !
---
/moan is the best.
---
This right here is why I decided to go pve this time around. I don't get much time to play now and I don't feel like spending 30 minutes+ being someone's play thing.
---
Yea I actually thought that cranking the graphical settings from 3 (Classic) to 10 would enable the newer, high poly count models.  Maybe someday.
---
Either way though, I'm just nit picking.  I've been loving it regardless.
---
This will solve my biggest frustration with classic! Thank you for developing it.
---
But that shows that you care enough to make a post about it and tell others how they should feel
---
Sorry but what did the polymorph accomplish? Wouldn't the npc just keep hitting you?
---
Dal Rends, any MC drop, not to mention items like Thrash Blade from Maradon is hardly worse and don't set you back 300g.
---
You look like the least sneakiest rogue I’ve ever seen lol
---
Gz
---
Even if it might be an illusion, I've felt more camaraderie with the server friends I've added doing random dungeons and quests than anyone I've had on btag over the last 10 years.
---
Classic is just as great for making friends as I remembered.
---
Except the issue with that is a lot of players, on both factions, for Faerlina are there because they want to play on the same server as their favorite streamer(s) so going to Heartseeker to some degree is pointless for those individuals. 
---
Free transfers are a great idea but the main issue is the fact that it is hard to get large groups of players to move. I play on Herod and have my core group of friends that I am playing with. I also have a guild of ~40 retail mythic raiders patchwerked together from a couple different guilds on my live server. Then they each have their core groups of friends - It would be virtually impossible to convince everyone to move over to another server and nobody wants to force their friends to choose between one group of friends or another, that is completely contrary to what classic is about. 
---
Unless you open the floodgates and allow both factions to move you aren't going to see a significant enough dropoff on these extremely high population servers because you aren't likely to see huge guilds or communities move but rather small groups of individuals that aren't locked down already.
---
It takes a ton of work / luck to get a rends set, everyone wants it.
---
By the time someone can buy it for a good price he could have grinded out some gold while wrecking kids with the Krol blade. So many people out there leveling right now, ready to be deleted in a stunlock lol.
---
Let me ask you, would you buy a sports car?
---
&gt;46
---
Pfft i wish it was that low
---
haha it could have but it was warrior (Winner) versus shaman !
---
For almost every class
---
Youre just not a plebby 12yo any more lol.  Also we have much more access to store and relay knowledge than in 2004.
---
Which one of the level 45+ players fucked your girlfriend OP?
---
&gt; No. Considering anybody killing Ragnaros instance grinded all the way to 60. The only advantage layering game them at all was it only took them 3 hours to grind waterlord rep instead of 6. Layering, thus far, has had extremely minimal impact on actual gameplay.
---
I'm not sure you can say that as the world first 60 did it by layering. Also while some people are instance grinding. What I see constantly in chat. Is people spamming to invited to a new layer. To either get mobs to repop. Or avoid pvp. To be clear I am not against layering. I am just saying #nochanges was never a real thing. If they were going to deviate by layering. I think they should also have deviated by tuning the dungeons and raids to be harder.
---
Also I don't know the patch he was nerfed in. I just know that by this patch all of the raids had been seriously reduced in stature except Naxxrammas.
---
Not in vanilla, they did add the ability to do it later though. Like late TBC or sometime during WotLK.
---
Hey, you!  You're finally awake.  You were trying to cross the Barrens, right?  Walked right into that Alliance ambush, same as us and that rogue over there.
---
Reccomend making a tab for it.
---
Amen to this. Had a guy furiously clicking away at LoL in summer school. It was super annoying. I just logged on to WoW during my lecture to play the AH and talk with my guildies.
---
Gear is easy as fuck to get.
---
Gold takes a lot more effort. You are talking what, 100-300g? That's an easy 4-5 hrs of farming.
---
This guy gets it.  I’ll gladly pay $25 to spend HOURS of my life having fun instead of in a queue.
---
No, blizzard is making it difficult. He is just doing what he can to actually play when he is paying for a product.
---
Because of "layering" your idea of starting on a low pop is pretty pointless right now other than abiding queue times which won't even be a problem soon. It would have an effect once Layering is removed but right now you'll just have less guilds to choose from, less people running dungeons, less active Trade/AH etc.
---
Wow that’s efficient

It works like windows duplicates. You'll be I_AM_CAPTAIN(1)

I'm not on a PvP server, so don't need kiting that much.

&gt; there are definitely classes that are virtually pointless in many tracks.

There are many tracks that are virtually pointless.

PLACE A FINGER ON YOUR WINDOWS KEY AND HOLD IT DOWN BUT MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO REACH OTHER KEYS WHILE DOING IT SO CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE FINGER NOT YOUR INDEX THAT'D BE SILLY I LIKE TO USE MY THUMB.
---
THEN ANOTHER FINGER GOES ON THE SHIFT KEY TO ALSO HOLD DOWN I USUALLY USE MY RING FINGER FOR THIS ONE AS IT SEEMS COMFORTABLE FOR ME BUT YOU GO AHEAD AND USE WHICH EVER YOU LIKE DUDE I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.
---
RIGHT AFTER THAT AND FOR THE CLIMAX OF THIS OPERATION WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS USE A THIRD FINGER TO PRESS THE S KEY. YOU DON'T NEED TO HOLD THIS ONE DOWN THOUGH, I SUGGEST USING YOUR INDEX KEY.
---
ONCE THIS IS DONE, LET GO OF ALL KEYS AND USE YOUR MOUSE TO DRAG THE AREA ON YOUR MONITOR(S) WHICH YOU WISH TO SAVE. IT WILL THEN COPY THE CONTENTS TO YOUR CLIPBOARD AND YOU CAN CLICK THE NOTIFICATION TO VIEW/EDIT/SAVE YOUR CLIPPING.
---
I HOPE THIS HELPS AND THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME CLEARLY MATE, GOOD LUCK LET ME KNOW HOW YOU GET ON.
---
You could go over to Hillsbrad Foothills or even the end quests of Silverpine Forest for a change of scenery.
---
*Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own World of Warcraft, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.*
---
You think they're going to let you query the classic auction house from an out-of-game API?
---
And this is high effort?
---
im horde side there too! (if I can ever get in the queue at a decent hour)
---
Anyone have any idea what some of the higher pop alliance servers are?
---
I'm not rushing to 60 because I did that in 2004, and all I really did was miss out on actually enjoying the lore and most of the content outside the tried and true levelling paths.
---
Yeah, the fastest way to level is to run a circuit and whack the same three camps of mobs over and over again until they turn green and move on. You're levelling faster, but aside from the bragging rights... Nah. I'm not doing that again.
---
This is why it was important to research beforehand.
---
I avoided Thalnos because I did a quick Google search - before WoW Classic even launched it was decided by Reddit that Thalnos would be a safe Haven for Spanish speaking players.
---
A quick search would've saved you a lot of grief. Just wait for the server transfers. You'll be alright.
---
It's BoE
---
&gt; I wouldn't want to play WoW if I didn't have the freedom to group up with a bunch of allies and storm an enemy zone to wipe them out. I just don't see the point in a massive, sprawling landscape and an axe in my hand if I can't swing it.
---
Sure I want PVP. Again my complain is not about the server having PVP. I am the one who specifically chose PVP. My complain is that the game is made to force your ass getting completely kicked by higher levels, no matter how much they suck ass at PVP, through arbitrary game mechanics.  If it was only the gear and the extra spells they got over new players, they would still be overpowered but at least the new players would have a fighting chance.
---
In vanilla before the wall walking changes yes, since this is a later build.. nope.
---
That would only be good for hunters if they melee a lot right?
---
[Well, we're waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWJX9yUKJeQ)
---
You will have problems tanking raids at 60.* Prot can easily tank dungeons or aoe farm.
---
What did you play before?
---
Herod just now started queueing, only 4 mins at the moment.
---
Keep walking that treadmill lol, you'll come up with any justification to use any terms you want so say whatever you want. I do genuinely hope nothing ever offends/upsets you and you see a reminder of it be a common joke.  
---
Also that is by far the dumbest assertion I've seen in quite a while, are you honestly saying that if a past slur isn't offensive anymore current slurs also aren't? Because boy do I have a lot of words you can test that theory on.
---
I think you mean Dark Lady watch over you... 
---
Heathen.
---
This is why I can't stand PvP servers. It feels like 75% of people on PvP servers never engage in fights unless they're sure they can win, which defeats the purpose of world PvP in my mind. Of course, all of my friends rolled on a PvP server, so here I am.

You know what is boring? Grinding for gold for 30 hours.
---
It'll work for awhile, but not forever.   Pets have a minimum food "level" that must be met for them to eat it and it scales based on the pets level.   So while this will probably work for awhile, eventually, it won't, probably around 40 or so.
---
We came from retail Skullcrusher. Alkaizer was GM TBC through Cat. I was GM while we played for 4 years on Kronos 1.
---
Thanks man! You just gave me someone to add to my camp list then. Add krowsus to your friends list and shoot me a tell if you need any help with anything(or a tank I do that from time to time). Not that I ever needed to add any gnomes to my camp lists, they're all on there as a Tauren they fly reallllll far when kicked.
---
Didn't know there were pets that eat bread.
---
If you have your VW sac and fear them. That will reset the fight somewhat well.
---
Traditionally, rolliing priority goes:
---
1. Ideally suited for this class/spec and will use for a long time.
---
2. Good for this character because of \*reasons\*.
---
3. Gonna sell it to a vendor.
---
The hypnotic blade, for your rogue, is a 2.  For the priest, even if he's under-level, it's a 1.  You can tell because of the spell damage, int, and spirit on it.  Those aren't your stats.  Those are caster stats.
---
He reacted poorly, but you should've asked if any caster needed such an obvious caster item before rolling.  I reccomend going on wowhead and finding a dagger around your level and getting one in whatever way turns up rather than just rolling on a DPS upgrade that might be contested.  There's probably legit rogue only daggers somewhere around that level.
---
Painted them freshly 6 years ago :)
---
Did not expect someone would notice it - I'm flattered! :\*
---
I agree. I tell my students they can chat, play fortnite, sleep whatever in my class. But if they fail my class they 100% know why. They are expected to be adults when they finish school and go to uni at 20y so they should 100% be treated as such.
---
ITT: a bunch of liars or people who are really bad at time management.

Not @OP, but if you are legitimately getting "5 hours" on average, you live a crappy life dude. Change your situation.

Atlas requires modules to load maps. So you need both. Atlas was not loading modules in the Classic client and was updated in the last 24 hours and now works. Now we just need a Classic module with the Classic maps, the second link are the Classic maps as they are in Retail.
---
The Horde has no quest hub in Redridge or Duskwood. Those zones are not comparable.
---
Thanks, but I have an owl
---
And making it more difficult for others who aren’t using unintended methods. Justify it all you want, it sucks for people who play by the rules
---
I healed on a BC server and loved it. Its pressure, sure, but not really. As long as everyone is doing their job, you won't have much to do. For the most part healing is a resource management game, making the most of your mana when you cast, and trying to find every 7 second gap you can to get them spirit ticks.  
---
Tanking I have less experience with, and does require a fair understanding of the fight. Outside of raiding, it's fairly simple with an occasional "face boss away from party" or some other spatial awareness factors. In a way, they're much like melee dps, except when the tank fucks up, everyone has bad times. 
---
Both are fairly easy to learn, and with a video guide or two any boss shouldn't be that hard to tank.  Most problems in raids and groups come from poor communication and reckless pulls. 
---
I think healing feels the most rewarding for the least amount of stress. With a click heal addons, it's a breeze.
---
Teach me your ways!
---
Druids are also a breeze to level compared to warriors.
---
well not me playing rogue solo apparently
---
Replace the word weapon with the actual name of the weapon you want in that hand.
---
Blood craze healing is trying its best.
---
Try grinding on mobs 1-2 levels lower than you.  Way less miss/party/dodges, it's slightly less xp but you'll kill more and have less downtime
---
Where is it from anyway? I see it a lot here.
---
Not much to get, OP is reaching just a bit. He's trying to suggest that the skin for purple eyeballs on Dwarves is exactly the same as the soulstone icon (i.e., instead of drawing some eyeballs, blizz just copy-pasted a spell icon onto the eyeballs). 
---
But its not EXACTLY the same. Its just a black square with a purple circle in it, but the gradients are a little bit different. 
---
Pretty good catch all things considered but definitely a little bit of a reach.
---
Pie &gt; Cake
---
Zug Zug horde is best cant wait to gank that allaince casual.
---
It's still a group effort to get to the chest. If the rogue is able to reach the chest alone, he's free to take it without the group.
---
Anyway, there's no point in arguing this, if you want to steal the chest, you can do it, and if the party is ok with it and invite you again, that's their thing. Luckily when I asked the rogues on my server discord, everyone who responded claimed that it is wrong for a rogue to this, so I suppose I have not much reason to be worried. Of course, there was that one rogue I ran with, but he agreed not to steal further chests when pressed by the rest of the party.
---
Herod? More like, He Rod.
---
Buddy I get it, there are ways server transfers can be bad.  I don't care to hear you ramble on about all the possible negative outcomes.
---
Time and effort is what separates casual from non casual, yes.
---
Four level span where the yellow is I think. 2 up, 2 down.
---
Some abilities can be learned from the pet trainer, but most have to be learned from wild animals that have them by default, and after you've mastered them you can teach them to your other pets. [Here](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php) is a list of what animals can teach you each ability.
---
Yes, and? Why would a Priest not instantly activate a 30 second bubble to block incoming burst damage?
---
3.7k.   60min wait.
---
Depends on the people you raid with.  The more minmax they are, the more likely they'll expect you to be a healer.  Tanking anything more than trash is probably out entirely.
---
Racing chairs are designed for g-forces and a steering wheel. With a mouse/keyboard, your shoulders and arms bump into them and they have zero benefit.
---
I played PvE Vanilla-WotLK. Wanted a different experience for Classic, so I went PvP. I'm having a blast. I got killed by the same Druid like 5 times last night. I think he was salty I killed him first. I'm not there best at PvP, so I was just trying to figure out ways to kill him. Took like an hour to finish the quest I was on, but I got a bit better at PvP.
---
Easy, I live in jewland
---
I'm a perfectly normal person who can take a step back and reflect but chooses not to because this is a reddit post and I don't give two shits. I also love arguing with white knighters because they get SO angry so quickly, even when it's over something so stupid and menial like someone calling a bunch of WoW nerds 'autists'. And people weren't even defending the people who were being called autists in the first place lol. They just wanted to be the word police because someone said the bad word they don't like. Ohhhh god someone said bad word on the internet, ohhhh better start brigading. Bunch of idiots getting baited lol. It got me through the last 2 hours of my slow work day. Thank you for your contribution.
---
I personally wouldn't be using slice and dice for leveling.
---
i've leveled all my warriors as fury in vanilla. perfectly fine for tanking 5 mans. fury has the best uptime. arms if you find it hard to pvp.
---
It actually made me chuckle
---
Ha. What are you talking about? GoT was cancelled after season 7
---
Yup, and I almost accepted it by mistake.
---
S&amp;D is very useful for levelling and dungeons, I tend to not like eviscerate as it’s single target. Slice and dice at least persists to other enemies if built up and increases your general dps.
---
Why shouldn't it be up? it's not like he's advocating for people to actively hate the guy or to blacklist his stream or what not.
---
OP is just expressing his distaste with the way that Asmongold advocated for wow classic but doesn't want to play it like wow classic.
---
Personally I think its a bit much to give out a call out post like this, but hey if he wants to express his opinion and get contested or favored for it its on him.

I’m a 30 priest and ran up next to a 31 rogue attacking a turtle and /waved him and left him alone, no less than a minute later while I’m attacking a turtle he opens up on me. I beat him and the turtle... about 10 minutes later I see a lvl 18 running and gets ganked by the 31 rogue... he just made the wrong choice twice. Camped him for a good half hour before reinforcements came.

A quick Google search confirmed this before the game even released. If people would research the servers beforehand it wouldn't be an issue.

It's more the brand of humor - pasting classic context on top of already existing media. Does a gif with 3 frames count? That's no longer an image, but a video.

Saves so much space on your bars when you combine mutually exclusive abilities like charge and hamstring into a single hotkey.

Found the person who didn't play Vanilla lol
---
Picking fights with Rogues is a bad idea in general considering they need pretty much no gear in classic to just literally one shot most classes lol
---
Get into their dead zone. I.e. 5-8 yards away. Try to freeze them and the pet at the same time and sheep the pet. Then do your normal shatter combo to kill :)
---
This is the same policy we've had for 2 years, long since before anyone involved with /r/WoW was involved with this subreddit in any capacity whatsoever. Additionally telling people 'Classic is not for you' is against Rule 2, and spelled out verbatim in rule 2, and again this has been the case for 2 years as a result of community feedback.

"bad words" on internet posts don't offend me. I'm not emotionally manipulated by someone writing bad things on an internet post about a computer game.

Wall jumping got fucked in Cata, but it didnt matter then because flying mounts made exploration pointless.

There are still incredible sites you can get to without extreme wall jumping. Most of the time, wall jumping was just used as a basis of skill with other "explorers".

You say that, but I've seen people do exactly that quite a few times on my commute to work.

But they shouldn’t? Become part of the eternal queue problem? I play on a lower population server now because I can’t deal with it. My brother logs in at work to properly queue then drives home, timing it to where he doesn’t have to wait. I don’t have that luxury. I don’t get to play with him now. It sucks. The queues would be thousands less if people weren’t trying to monopolize the server space for themselves. It’s selfish. It’s not cool. I won’t do it. Promoting that others should will literally make it worse, and would hopefully force Blizzard to deal with server hogs.

I’m all for gnome killing but what’s keeping anyone from doxing every player that kills someone in pvp?

It's not much of a reach, though.
---
I do quite a bit of game modding, and one of the big things we do to reduce filesize is to reuse textures.  So if the dwarves skeletal mesh has that icon UV mapped to its eyes, it would technically save a disk little space.

However, I'm guessing this is more of a joke/easter-egg than an actual performance optimization.

You need to kite. Shoot at mob from max distance, run away and turn around when your next autoshot is ready. Do this until it's in melee range. Go for 3-4 shots

Yikes

Thank you, very helpful response

Here you are, playing classic, wondering why people don't trust blizzard. If blizzard was right all the time then classic wouldn't be necessary, because retail would be good.
---
Blizzard used to have a record of making good games, but that time has long passed. Wow expansions have been getting progressively worse over the years. And it's not just Warcraft, Diablo 3 was a massive step back from d2. Hearthstone is becoming too expensive for most players since they shifted to 3 expansions per year. Heroes of the Storm was abandoned. I'm not aware of what is going on in StarCraft, so i won't comment on that. Maybe that franchise is doing okay Overwatch seems to be fine.
---
Point is, Blizzard in no way deserves a "they know what they are doing"attitude. Hell even getting classic was something they fought against for a long time. Classic is a great step forward that imo gives us reason to be hopeful in blizzard games again, but they still have a long way to go to get back to their old status.
---
If I can't WoW when I teach then you can't WoW while I'm teaching.
---
Just wanted to add make sure to be in defensive stance when tanking in an instance.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Played it on Vanilla when my bros lended me their accounts, played a bit of BC, then played WoD and Legion on my own.
---
I have lot of nostalgia vibes, lot of random friendliness, I like to buff, heal help other random players.  
---
Didn't remember some quest requiring so much farm, and some other non-existing QoL features but it's not a surprse.  
---
Actually a bit jealous of mage aoe speedfarm, gonna try the Druid version at lvl 40/44.
---
If I'm feeling generous I will also give them detect invisibility.
---
Naah it's just a poor attempt at karma-whoring since the other post about not rushing got lots of votes.
---
I don't think there is any one thing they can do to "fix" retail, but here is a list of things I think would help:
---
remove lfd lfr
---
remove crossrealm
---
revert warmode back to pvp/pve servers
---
remove personal loot
---
remove titanforge/warforge/sockets/allthatcrap
---
reduce the ammount of raid difficulty options, example: just 10-30man raid and mythic (2 difficulties)
---
add pvp vendors and currency instead of randomly giving loot
---
add other ways to grind rep other than world quests, you shouldnt be FORCED to do worldquests...
---
remove flying mounts, so wpvp can exist
---
m+10 should drop gear equivalent or slightly lower than the 10-30 raid
---
m+1-10 is too difficult. let people carry their friends through 10s, like you could in legion.
---
	
---
delete azerite chest/helm/shoulders and just improve the neck talent system
---
I don't think any of these changes will ever happen.
---
? Grabbing the wheel with their teeth? Who does that!?
---
False. Worgs are GOAT
---
I use Auctionator but it doesn't really give tips
---
Let me teach you how to play.
---
First dont panic. Second sacrifice your voidwalker. Third Agony corruption then run Fourth Cast fear Filth get some distance then cast immolate followed by another fear because that fear will then break. Keep your dots up and run around
---
I'm wondering why hes popping all around you
---
Got ganked by a 33 dwarf today because the fucking rougue in my party just stood there. Wouldnt have tagged if id known a pacifist moron was my only help. The other side is if someone in your faction is ganking gank with them especially if they’re in your frickin group wtf lol
---
There will not be an arms warrior in my raids in 2019. Maybe back in the pre-normalization days you did this stuff, but in 2019, a fury warrior spamming anni or nightfall is optimal off tank. Gear investment argument is a joke.
---
Of course I have played in a raid. 2H fury is very, very good horde side. Have you played horde side? Sounds like you are alliance, thinking 2H is so bad.
---
So 5 points disc and then it doesn't matter what you do?
---
Wand spec baby.
---
Sounds like you're just a shit DPS
---
People rushing to 60 aren't even on this sub, they are busy playing instead of circlejerking about what good little casuals they are like the people in the other thread
---
Classic was run on some pretty shit tier computers back in the day I’m sure most laptop/pc can run it even on the lower end. Safe travels friend.
---
What's a PvE realm?
---
This is a little tangential to this thread but totally about how to start playing:
---
I've been seeing members of certain races in other races starting zones as early as Brill. I've seen Orcs in Undead and Orcs in Mulgore. Is there a reason for this? Does Durotar just suck to level up in to make the death-train worth it?
---
I'm about to roll an Orc Warlock (suggestions appreciated!) and wondering if I should get a head start on my /deaths or not. Thanks!
---
Flying up to Bastion (in cata) was amazing. 
---
Flying to BRD and see the mountain appear was also amazing. 
---
Flying around dungeon or raid instances and see the whole entrance look like a snake. 
---
Those are amazing views that I won’t forget.  Running through barrens however won’t last long as a memory for me.
---
You monster frisbee
---
I think I'm going to get the sword. It looks cooler, and I'll be getting Bonebiter around the same time anyway. I'll have Bonebiter as my slow power hitter and the sword as a faster alternative.
---
Why do you care?
---
I suppose it depends how you define 'casual'. Is it time investment or skill? Or both
---
In vanilla, you can be a skilled player but if you don't have the time to grind then much of the end game content is inaccessible.
---
No, Spiritual Healing is only base healing so it doesn't do much and isn't really a must have.
---
k fixing it now
---
Oh ok cool thanks! No worries about uploading but I might play around with it a bit
---
Our kids (now grown) were great farmers for us at that age! Hope he has fun.
---
As I said friend, whatever helps you sleep at night. I didn't expect much and yet here I am still disappointed.
---
They are not doing that at all. They are offering transfers from high pop realm A to low pop realm B, B being a new realm.
---
So I can't transfer where ever I want to regroup a guild that split across servers or similar.
---
Agreed. FD just goes on CD most of the time with no animation or anything happening at all.
---
Pigs, bears, crabs, and wind serpents I believe.
---
Yup the beauty of WoW is that you can play it however you like. I personally love STV and try not to do dungeons more than I need to, but would never fault anyone for doing them since they are great xp and gold.
---
Level 21 ATM.  
---
Yeah not worth putting 5 points on targets.  They die sooner as you say but also, you get diminishing returns the more combo points you apply.  Better of using one combo point for S&amp;D and one combo point for eviscerate.
---
feelin cute, might kill some Alliance dogs later, idk
---
See I think WoW classic should be free to play and use it as an incentive to make people want to pay for the modern updated experience

By far my favorite one lol

To defend the lock you camped or at least play Devil's Avocado -- A lot of time I won't initiate PvP, but if I see it happening, I'll jump in to help a fellow ally.

That was a ''historical'' movie and not a comedy , the director did openly told to viewers that they are racist if they do not accept that the character is black

Dude. No he doesn’t. That’s the default raid ui.

It was all over the internet that this server was going to be a non English server.

Oh yea, the spider leg market is really booming these days.

Andarial. Add me if you want.
---
&gt; You asked - "What if I was engaged in all the healthy habits already and simply gained an extra 75 pounds with no change to my activity level, diet, or nutrition?"" I understand your point, and while there are very (VERY) rare conditions that would allow this to happen, if that is the case - you have other health concerns which should be addressed.
---
And if I didn't? Let's say it wasn't 75 pounds, let's say it was the [30 pounds the average American is overweight by.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-20/tale-of-the-tape-average-american-is-borderline-obese-cdc-says#targetText=A%20man%20of%20average%20height,American%20male%20weighs%20202.2%20pounds.) I'll grant you that a sudden gain of *75 pounds* far more likely represents overeating and sedentary activity levels (and, frankly, probably a physical injury of some kind.) Does 30? Does 20? Does 10? Do you get more, or less sure, that the additional weight is proof of an unhealthy diet and lifestyle the *less* additional weight we're talking about?
---
At some point, there's a margin at which the extra couple of pounds gained by thousands or millions of people can result in a public health crisis of expanding waistlines but have *nothing to do* with chronic overeating by any of the affected individuals, because we're talking about a gain of weight that is *statistically* a very strong signal, but *individually* can't be connected to any particular change in diet or behavior that we know of.
---
&gt; The reality of being overweight - more so when obese, puts stress on your body.
---
Isn't that the point of activity and exercise? To put stress on the body? Don't you get *less* healthy when your body isn't called upon to respond to difficult stimuli?
---
&gt; I can put on 100 lbs and be at the same health level for a period of time, but as that weight continues to put pressure on the body, the health risks associated with that weight will begin to be cumulative.
---
Sure. If we just took a snapshot of you at that point in time, though, would we have any idea whether you were gaining weight, losing weight, or maintaining weight? How could we know from *one* timepoint?
---
Yet all of our measurements of the obesity rate are single snapshots. We just survey some people's BMI and use that to determine how *society* is gaining or losing weight, totally ignoring that it matters more whether *individuals* are gaining or losing weight. If you put on 100 pounds but four of us lose 20 pounds each, would you say our society got healthier or less healthy? Because the *statistics* would say that the society had gotten 20 pounds heavier.
---
The most important thing is pet management. Keep pet on passive and keybind /petattack and /petfollow. If your group does a jump dismiss the pet before jumping.

Mages everywhere are hoping you do.
---
Even with my best friend. I still wouldn't greed. I would need that shit and, then roll him for it if he greeded. However I will admit to having trust issues. The only time I would greed for an epic. Is if I was the last one rolling. Not getting ninja's by some fuck.
---
Just so you know, there is a screenshot folder for WoW even. You can take ingame screenshots and immediately have them in a nice usable form.
---
My point is that if Method had done exactly what APES did, farmed instances for levels and then cleared MC at the level and gear they did, everyone would be cheering about Method's mastery of the game and how great they are. 
---
Instead, since it is a private server guild, we attribute it to their lack of lives/jobs and call them autistic. Its awful. They worked so hard and earned the respect of the playerbase. Stop shitting on it.
---
how can you tell if someone is trying to sneak roll?
---
Ahh awesome, thanks for this
---
People were pleading for it at official forums, but it seems Blizzard said there wouldn’t be “high demand of players” to fill the server.
---
My guild alone on faerlina has more than 500 players, mainly brs. Imagine all the others scattered across us servers plus another fellows South Americans, I think there would be easily ppl gt at least 2 servers.
---
Stop FD while moving.
---
With how much effort my professors have put in, it seems about right.
---
but cant you jump down and just go up the ramp
---
Stalagg, this was my first one. It scared the crap out of me cause I was just minding my business fishing my little heart out.
---
Watch the video again he didn’t even have time, he attempted to cast, it was interrupted and he died
---
You forfeit that right by rolling on a PvP server.
---
Because you're thinking in terms of boring stats rather than thinking of possible interesting stats and build defining ones that could appear.
---
For example you could have a pair of gloves that gives +25-30% Rupture Damage or an amulet that gives longer self-buff duration (think of things like Slice and Dice), items that could completely change rotations that aren't just set bonuses. If you can't itemize well then nerf existing items but rating just makes everything boring.
---
Nope, I'm friends with the druid.
---
Um yeah?

---
Set it to wheel up and down and just sit and wait rolling it.  The moment the spawn shows up you got a tag.
---
how about you click that "report a bug" in game instead of posting on reddit.
---
I'm calling the blizzard support number now to inform them.
---
This is exactly what my plan is. The same group that will help me get the sword at 30 or 31 will be running through SM at or around 34. Also the sword looks way better, so there's that.
---
That guilde name existed on basically every server back in actual vanilla too. It was on blackrock for sure back then.
---
StarCraft the critters blew up if you clicked them 30 times
---
mine definitely knows how to turn the PC OFF...
---
Tell them that it has very bad healing per mana spent, that is why they shouldn't shield someone unless they're close to dying. Flash Heal has better h/m, and Heal/Greater Heal has *much* better h/m, Prayer of Healing needs to deal its full heal to 3 people to get close to GH's efficiency, Renew is between PW:S and FH in efficiency.
---
Especially when they can’t see who it is. World of rogue craft class balance scene hits this perfectly. Rock Paper Scissors. 
---
Warriors are rocks
---
Rogues are scissors 
---
Paladins, mages, priests, hunters, druids are paper. 
---
Warlocks they are mushrooms and over there in the corner. 
---
So paper beats rock, scissors also beats rock. Scissors beats paper. 
---
Then rock hits level 60 and becomes an unstoppable killing machine. And now kills Paper. And would also kill scissors but can’t find scissors because scissors is invisible. And this is called balance.
---
I'd be wary of the using an HP stream for WoW. Techinically you could play, i think, but your overall experience would be crap and i don't know how you'd fair in large cities or parties.
---
No its to discriminate based on race. You can discriminate someone without excluding them.
---
Let's hear your historical Pearl's of wisdom
---
&gt; I get it that it's my choice to partake in it or not, but I'm obviously going to hold some amount of resent towards players that leave me in the dust by running SM Armory all day.
---
Sounds like you want to be a party pooper.
---
Many people leveled up by dungeon spamming in vanilla, especially SM, ZF, and BRD.
---
Then go to class and god forbid skip 60 minutes of world of warcraft
---
Come to Kirtonos ;\]
---
Just wait 'til he shows off his Ice Cold Milk stacks.
---
What? The Barrens is the equivalent of the two. 
---
I'll admit Stonetalon is much more of a horde zone as theres very little quests for the Alliance there.
---
The trick is you  agro with Imp that is standing far away from you then as the mob is running toward the imp you agro it and it has to run to you, the kill times will be faster and very efficient however. Most locks lack the micro to do this every pull making Void much safer and reliable. Plus it's mentally fatiguing to micro every pull for long periods of time.
---
Get a better graphics card
---
The shaman would've had you there if he learnt to purge :) That fortitude buff kept you alive :)
---
Excellent plays! Your warrior pal looks like he/she knows what their doing too :)
---
I agree. Use the wool to make bandages.
---
Can't see many takers given the queue on that server unless its during the day. But best of luck!
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
That guild name has been around since actual vanilla.
---
Gifted gold. Made me laugh IRL 😂
---
Literally the first second he saw the warrior he had plenty of time to prepare for what's about to happen. He saw the warrior and should have sacrificed his void immediately
---
This guy could have just logged out and back in and been fine.  Instead he did a long run, didn't grab any FP, and fucked himself.
---
Shift+click, copy+paste.
---
If It's a situation where shift+click isn't available, I say screw it because it's not worth the extra effort. Legitimately hate special characters.
---
So it sounds like some fruitcake got upset that others have different opinion them him and he wanted to feel “powerful” so he petitioned an officer to remove you, poor snowflake.
---
Leveling 30 level 6’s is the same as 3 level 60’s, right?
---
Isn't that considered exploiting?
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
Better to get faster white hits than have an evis miss or be dodged or parried.
---
That may not be where you're coming from but that's how you're coming across. Not every spec being viable means people who'd want to playa certain way couldn't and you'd rather it keep it that way.
---
Also no, I didn't say you didn't want frost mage to be viable. I don't think I even typed the word frost mage but hey you do you, I guess.
---
&gt;That  Joanna d’Arc  a french national hero shouldn't be played by a black actress , because it's blackwashing, and I was trying to explain why was it
---
Just what I said to other commentator
---
I just call out the horde for being pussies by spamming their /1 for help the second they see an Alliance player heading to or waiting at a dungeon. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yes you can! You dont even need to go deep protection unless you are the main tank and is killing Ragnaros.  
---
If you have a good healer you dont even need to equip a shield for dungeons until like level 40s.
---
Because while the first few points of reflective damage are very valuable (having threat on things you would otherwise have 0 threat on), the more you add the less % increase it is.
---
I agree with this, PvP teaches you how to quickly transition from CC to DPS to Evasive maneuvers and then re-engage with DPS. All of these are needed at a much slower pace in PvE because of its predictability.
---
I enjoy having to actually read the quest tips to figure out where to go but get really frustrated that I might be missing a good quest just because I didn't check the upstairs of a random cottage for a second time after I completed a different quest or reached a certain level.
---
Sounds like a plan. Strength, Agility, and Spirit are all prime stats for you. You can pretty much ignore Stamina and Intellect unless you intend to tank or heal. Just in case you didn't know.
---
When you get good stuff and you start seeing those 400 damage crits on auto-attacks *followed* by a Seal of Command crit, it'll be pretty tasty. With a little luck and some coordination I can top the DPS meter. It does require stun coordination to maximize the damage of SoC judgement though.
---
ooo eagerly waiting
---
no
---
He speaks from the ancient text.
---
Dont watch the musical Hamilton you will have a heart attack
---
I mean, if you aren't qualified for the job, of course he's fine
---
Is leveling as fast as possible the goal of most people though?  Do some people just legitimately enjoy dungeon running more than questing?  Are some people just doing it to avoid crowded leveling zones? 
---
Blizzard already fixed the 10 man issue that did make spamming dungeons way more efficient than questing.  Ultimately it's good that there are multiple ways to spend your time leveling, one of them has to be a little faster than others ultimately.
---
Wrath was bad.
---
You can turn off pet sounds.
---
Imo it has less to do with a large number of people liking PvP and more to do with there not being a ton of people with strong opinions about wanting to be on a PvE server. I see people that rave about PvP servers and people that are indifferent. If you have 9 friends that don't care and 1 that strongly wants PvP, then you'll probably go PvP.
---
I play NElf Rogue, have since Vanilla, and always on a PvE server. Well, this time around, every single friend I play with decided to go PvP serevr.
---
Ok, I'm a Rogue, how bad could it be?
---
Well I hit level 30, moved on to contested zones, and last night I completed a single quest in an hour and a half. Killed a mob, got ganked. Killed another, got ganked. I death leapfrogged my way through the quest.
---
Fighting back didn't matter, it was always 2+ Horde who were at least 4 levels above me each. Hiding didn't matter, stealth blows with that level disparity. Waving, bowing, nothing. Couldn't find a group so I just kept up the deathmarch.
---
Little did I know that my friends had picked the server that ended up having the longest queues as well as a 60% Horde, 40% Ally balance. 
---
Thankful for this Spy addon, being able to mark individual Horde as Kill on Sight, because when I hit max level I plan to show not a single drop of mercy.
---
I had no idea it did that. 
---
I had someone in my guild polymorph an Alliance who attempted to gank him until they rage quit. Funny stuff.
---
Looks like that Confusion skill in Chrono Trigger
---
I really wish there was like a fitness addon that didn't let you open WoW unless you signed into your gym that day. 
---
I was doing so well. F
---
Now I want a Lorem Mrglglllrllglr generator for when I need filler text.
---
This. 
---
BR here too, but I play with American friends on Herod.
---
Trying to do the same thing with the druid of the fang set. Bot having much luck compared to you haha.
---
Can you really call him a hypocrite without knowing him though?
---
The worst that you can take away from this is that he might be a bit ignorant.
---
But I will point out that it seems as if more people get upset when a character’s ethnicity is changed for a white actor or actress.
---
Just toss a pet on the guards and take the node while he greedily rubs his hands.
---
I think Stonetalon is the place to go for tin, and loads of nodes too.
---
SS works once per 30 mins and once your in mid 30’s things start to hit you pretty hard. SS shouldn’t be a factor of your durableness, it’s an oh shit cushion.

Well you have to be situationally aware. I never want the mobs targeting my Imp, I want them targeting me always as I've already dotted up the mobs and they dieing as they are trying to attack me. Some times I'm just wanding them while they die.
---
If my Imp dies, it's time to book it and with health funnell, my Imp really shouldn't be dieing without me knowing about it well in advance and getting away isn't an issue.

Yep books past 150 then Quests past 225.

---
Thank you guys. It seems like the odd time I am cancelling the attacks. Any idea why this would happen? My dude just sits there and takes a beating lol.
---
Sorry, you might not have seen my edit with an actual answer before you replied. The Barrens wouldn’t be equivalent because it isn’t a contested zone. Maybe only by level. 
---
The leveling path that most characters playing take are to Stonetalon and Ashenvale because most undead come to the Barrens instead of staying in Silverpine. While most Alliance go to the human/dwarf and gnome starter zones to level. 
---
For the issue you are having the equivalent would be Hillsbrad foothills, where you will see more alliance than Horde due to what was stated above.
---
could be speed hacking but not sure what advantage that would give him against a lock.

hes moving too fast even for lag

15 years ago i lost my account to keyloggers after using a working speed hack for a couple weeks. it skipped around like that on other peoples screens

Hopefully. We shouldn't need layers anymore.

This brings me back to raiding Karazhan while tethered to my Samsung Blackjack back when Smartphone tethering just came out

Or be the change you want to see.

Already said they would.

He...he has invisibility (Have played since beta and refuse to call it stealth...).   if he respawns correctly there's almost a 0% chance the mage has of finding him...
---
They sleep 18-20 hours a day as a newborn so that's prime time for gaming.
---
I just make myself too busy. In co op right now so more free time than I'll have in four months, but still with a gf, job, two dnd campaigns we play bi weekly, one I dm for, there just isn't a lot of time. Plus whatever other activities we want to do.
---
Wow accountant much =P
---
I liked it because it was a mixed feeling of Thunderdome and Mos Eisley.  I loved passing by and watching duels take place inside the dome.
---
I would have preferred it to have been located deeper into the flatlands to feel more like an oasis rather than right up against the mountains.
---
Remindme! 24 hours
---
Your maths is bad, it's at least 10% since you train on even levels.
---
he is in the camp to the east. not in the stone buildings fort but by the tents and the campfire... he has a long respawn time as we learned last night.
---
Anecdote of last night follows
---
So we pull in a random warrior in our group so we have me 27 Warlock, 28 Priest, and 30 Mage. Forgot the Warrior level, but this dude was an animal that just wanted to be unleashed... kept pulling even when no one had mana, "accidentally" pulled the warlock boss while we were fighting other dwarves... so we called him out finally like "wtf are you doing". He quit the party without saying anything and ran off into the sunset... only to come back with a literal carbon copy of our group... literally another 27 warlock, 28 priest, and 30 mage. so there we are, and we are thinking "fuck this guy who wipes us from his stupidity and then abandons and reparties" so the mage ran through some dwarves and like clockwork the warrior AOE agros the extra dwarves during their attempt to kill and wipe on it. We then have a cold war standoff for 10-15 minutes while we got our own carbon copy tank in and killed the boss. 
---
They had to wait for the boss to respawn, and we needed more dwarves so we start killing nearby camps. I don't know how long it takes... but it is over 15 minutes.
---
I go out of my way to befriend them, not sure if it's out of pity or respect. Half my friends list are warriors.
---
&gt; Although maybe hiding the gnomes is a secret bonus?
---
For sure.
---
Regarding the herbs, there's definitely a lot of blindly scrolling around until the icon to pick flowers pops up lol.
---
I thought this was gonna be the Boogie video.  It wasn't...
---
Getting an add shouldn’t mean insta-retreat though. Imps are the only pet that don’t provide better options for handling adds.
---
don't forget the mom gamers
---
and their kids
---
when did you start playing retail? Which expansion?
---
What do you think of the classic talent trees?
---
gross

I think a few things might be happening:

1.) People are catching up.

2.) Your layer is filling up. I remember getting in with suspiciously small queue times one day, and doing a /who to see no one in Durotar. A minute later /who showed 10 people. Another minute, 23 people. So forth and so on. I was pretty sure I was in a new layer of my own for a second there.
---
I must have gottrn lucky on gear or something, but I feel super tanky on Warlock. Yea. Im not a war. But leveling im watching people do quests and straight melting. And Im running affliction so my HS and stamina arent even that high. All I do is siphon soul. And while solo I pop VW sacrifice from time to time
---
I love you.
---
I didn’t blame anyone. I said that jobs without much PTO are crummy jobs. There are plenty of jobs in the US with great benefits, PTO, and compensation.
---
I’d loved playing Shammy even though it felt like I got passed over for gear and stuff a lot. The huge windfury crits are a feeling like no other and it’s a fun class for sure.
---
No, they don't, but for a big MMO launch, you should do some prior research on servers. And you don't need to be a lurker. And it's not just info that's on reddit. People have to learn somehow I guess, and this is this person's opportunity to learn for next time.
---
Hillsbrad, Stranglethorn, Arathi, Desolace, Thousand Needles and possibly Dustwallow will all have quests for you.

Atlas Map. However it does remove the discovery part of the map

I think I had winamp or somesuch the first time round.

This time I have spotify going.

---
Okay, you give that in N expansion, what do you give in N+1 expansion to top that? What do you give in N+2 expansion without nerfing anything before to top those 2?
---
You dont see how that is power creeping and making balancing even harder? Unique stats and effects work on hard lvl cap games like Diablo II, that even if you have an expansion your max lvl stays the same.
---
Intercept is actually more useful as arms since you have tactical mastery, meaning you can charge to start, then swap to bers stance and have rage for intercept

Not quote as convenient as an addon, but the same idea.
---
Later ranks of cure disease put an over time spell on the target that keeps clearing disease every few seconds so you'll only need to cast it once and they'll be good for ~20 seconds too.
---
Also on mobile. Still if that is true would suck hard. Cause I wanna tank but I don't want to play a warrior
---
My brother
---
I have a friend that's like that.. Decent at games but everytime they die (if we're playing a shooter) or get ganked it's a play by play melt down on why it was bullshit.
---
Perfect weekend!
---
Each his own.  You dont apply 4 CP before using S&amp;D or eviscerate.  You get diminishing returns.  
---
You're better of using 1 CP for S&amp;D and 1 CP for eviscerate.
---
That mage had like 500 hp wat
---
I haven't really had that issue. It's just a few steps to allow Nova to come off cd without taking hits.

For YOUR special character yes. I'm not going to memorize an entire alphabet of á ç ü etc.
---
Steam Link
---
I mean filthy coward!
---
Yeah I’m not sure - even with lag he shouldn’t be able to cover that distance I don’t think. Could be some kind of exploit.
---
As someone with maybe 5 hours of WoW experience total....is it worth playing WoW Classic to get into the game if I'm interested? Or should I play standard? Is it even worth it to really start playing when the game's been out as long as it has?
---
Sameee and I get up for work at 5
---
That's a shame. I /wave at every alliance I see, and have yet to attack a single one of them unprovoked. That tauren life, yo.
---
The same is happening for me.
---
Pools of fish do give fish, and although its empty i still level fishing skill.
---
This is amazing. I do the same thing with food as most encampments have a fire.
---
I'm just asking which "arbitrary" mechanics you were talking about. No need to act threatened man.
---
I had a stupid level 31 hunter roll need on Scarlet Boots (I’m a warrior and needed them). The guy had something like +7 agility + intellect boots already, and can’t even wear mail til 40. I won them thankfully, but the group (all from same guild as him) had the nerve to tell me to reroll with him. I put them on and said “lol”.
---
The default language the horde speaks is “orcish” btw!
---
Dat middel finger doe
---
Can you have more than one pet?
---
Niiice
---
how did you get the controls like that? I use steam link but when i try to set the layout it only offers me arrow keys and A/X/B/Y controller buttons.
---
how do you do keyboard keys like 1-4, wasd?
---
I'm so happy to have to build groups as opposed to having a tool do it for me. There are a half dozen people now who when I see them in stormwind or iron forge I stop and wave, maybe ask how their levelling is going.
---
Pls stop
---
I want to create a warlock now for this purpose, genius.
---
What it about? Im on mobile and it isnt loading properly
---
Gotcha. The person im avoiding doesnt play wow
---
 I was 80 yards away and going the other direction lol
---
I swear those casters murlocs have infinite ranges. I've convinced myself too many times that I can kill the one in front of me and run from the caster afterwards.... nope
---
That depends. If we are talking Naxx gear, Warriors set is an absolute badass, so you would be safe going warrior
---
Gnomish mind control cap....
---
I'd never played a mage before classic and when I found out that blink broke soft cc I was so happy lol.
---
Skinning is great for hunters. You can kill beasts quickly and make a lot of money vendoring skins. Later in the game when the economy beefs up you can sell them on the AH.
---
And Brokentooth is 1.0! Hopefully by the time I ding 37 they haven't made attack speed the same across the board.
---
That's a big assumption.
---
Any chance you can give me the cords to all the flight points so I can make a handy notes for in game
---
I love this so much.
---
Thankfully, your opinion here is irrelevant. People will continue to create and enjoy offensive humor, with or without your approval. You're free to seethe about it all you like; that's humorous in its own way!
---
Thats like saying you can paint with a pencil
---
Ooo that seems like a good trade for PvP. There's so many fun specs I want to try, but the respec costs would kill me sadly. I really wanted to mess around with lulwell. Alas, I don't really have the time to grind out that kind of cash :/
---
You are a tank, that's a gift of its own. Everything else is extra.
---
I'm picturing a cute doge walking around with a computer on his back and now I want a labtop.
---
Go to rfc bro I won’t kill you on the way I swear
---
Meme archeology.
---
Nice one! I wish I had replaced the word cigarette with felweed. Also France with Durotar maybe.
---
Thanks for the inspiration! I think I'll make some improvements on this one.
---
Hunter probably. Although not top DPS, they still have a high skill cap (soloing dungeons, etc) and I don't think they need a ton of gear to do well.
---
So I'm super torn between shaman for the horde flavor or warrior for the tanking (which I did literally zero in vanilla) as an alt here in the coming months... I may just play both and see how it goes, but I'm wondering if anyone with perspective of the leveling process with both could help me with some context. 
---
I'd intend to mostly level the char after getting 60 on my main, a rogue, so I can funnel gold their way. Part of what makes me hesitant to level a warrior is that my main's already a melee class, and it may feel a little too similar as a change of pace.
---
yea maybe a lil
---
The illusion of choice is cool tho.
---
Thank you kind sir for your opinion :) It was a good expansion. Blizzard has said it themselves that TBC is possible, even wotlk
---
Maybe if they translate over to retail, but I doubt there's anything sponsorships to be made for unestablished brands. I could see a couple members boosting their streams up, but I think Jokerd's taken much of that audience. 
---
Highly doubt any sponsorships will happen over anything else in Classic Wow. Maybe method will try to host future raid clear events as 1 day events and what not. 
---
In regards to your first part. The reason no one flew APES out to Vegas is they kinda were nobodies. Only people deep within the private server scene knew who they were and the entire purpose of flying anyone out to Vegas wasnt' because they had a legitimate shot at winning world 1st, but because they bring viewership. It's the reason they flew out guys like Preach, Esfand and Kungen. They all have decently sized audiences.
---
&gt; BuT LeVeLiNg iS pArT oF tHe ExPeRiEnCe
---
Yeah you seem totally non-opinionated, and clearly are fine with anyone playing how they want to. You made your post to shame people for mocking those who are speed leveling, then immediately did the opposite. Bravo.
---
it isn't a good stat stick for a hunter though. they only benefit from the stamina. strength is all but useless for a hunter.
---
Probably the best well known one is the references to Link from the Legend of Zelda in Un'Goro crater.
---
Cant wait for the "did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]" memes.
---
Stand out?  Of what?  
---
Cuz it ain't that grass!
---
I would hope so. People like that don't belong in my guild. Doesn't matter if it's a shitty chest or some good boss drop. The principle matters.
---
For leveling you're fine. 60 might be another story, but I never played a warrior at 60 before.
---
Are you sure you aren't on a na server?  There are European servers.
---
Wow Pro available from the Twitch desktop app.
---
Excellent work..
---
seriously I changed my sleep schedule, been logging on remotely and then preventing my guy from dcing by casting a spell from my phone on my commute home lmao.  it's been a battle.

I said come to Kirtonos and you said that's not a good idea, so I'm asking why xD
---
That's actually a very good study of Asmongold character.
---
*clap*
---
No, the idea is to get Furious and get hit chance gear to stop getting furious
---
If your guild is willing to help you catch up then running dungeons will be far faster especially compared to a solo warrior
---
It only ends up as "makes some strange gestures".
---
Yes? That’s the point I’m making
---
Meh, for leveling I've never seen anyone bat an eye at a druid tank. Dunno about paladin, I've pretty much always been horde.
---
night elf
---
Interesting. I’ll have to give it a go when I get home. I though steammlink was exclusive to steam software. If not, then this is great news!!!
---
I hate to say it but I've noticed that almost every single tank I've ran an instance with can't hold aggro on even a single target, let alone a group... End up having to spam flash heal on mages
---
I'd consider TBC and so on a change...so...nochanges, lol.
---
What server? If this is on my server, I will find them. FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
I can smell your greasy neckbeard from here.
---
I'll just be in a group with people I know. Everyone I play with already knows that if they need rends they've got competition.
---
Endurance, Dodge, and then dual wield specialization is the route I believe. Most of your damage is coming from Auto attacks which is why the dual specialization is good.
---
Have you called us?
---
HUEHUEHUEEUHEUHEUEHEUE
---
*reads guild name*I hope you all fell, died, and had a long corpse run.
---
If you feel like walking, you could do hillsbrad then arathi highlands past 30.
---
You cant judge a whole race on some of them choosing to be priests. We know gnomes are evil and priests are evil
---
He could help you quest. Don't officially group up, and you be the first to attack any monsters. After you've tagged the monster first, he can help kill it, and you will still get full xp for the kill as well as the loot. He won't get any xp, but you will, and you can level up a bit faster with his help. Soon you'll be close enough to him (I'd say, within 3 levels?) that you can then actually group up and officially work together.
---
I don't remember, it was pretty hilarious though.  People kept trying to kill him and we'd /no them.
---
I've just embraced it. I have an Orc Warrior a Tauren Druid and a Forsaken Mage. On the down side they are all lower level. On the up side I can make my own bags, armor patches and sharpening stones.
---
He’s adorable
---
Thank you for making me smile on a wednesday!
---
Fuck em, it’s my computer and my device running on my network, I don’t know how they could detect it anyway
---
We've run a few things, but mostly just to get people drops and showing me the different dungeons.
---
I'm glad you said this. I was thinking this is either my sever or a very popular guild name.
---
Ya, scumbags like that are literally the worst part of classic wow.
---
Maybe? But I'm referring to the 2h that rets and hunters usually get bitch duty for. It can proc a 15% damage increase for all your spellcasters.
---
Bruh, he's a shaman in classic. His combat rotation isn't exactly involved and you don't need to keyboard THAT many utility spells.
---
That kitchen disturbs my soul
---
I hath invoked the name....
---
If you're 32 then you might have difficulty grinding on even level 33 and 34 mobs depending on gear. As a caster you will really suffer from resists - which not only eat mana they also increase time to kill. I wouldn't be surprised at all that if you pull multiple 33-35 lvl mobs you aren't having a good go of it. Definitely try to find things your level or 1 level under if you're just going to be grinding and not killing specific mobs for a quest.
---
But $15 is $15
---
You gotta find people you gel with and want to enjoy the game the same way as you. Most old vanilla players are veterans and don't want slow dungeon runs, so those guys were most likely experiencing vanilla for the first time.
---
I've gotta be thankful my three 3 RL friends who I play WoW with are priest, mage and shaman, and I play a warrior. I pull fast because we've already done them a thousand times before, and they're trivial. Best of luck finding a guild / group, cause those people sound like no fun.
---
What region/realm are you playing on? What region are you playing from? What's your ping to [google.com](https://google.com)? (cmd -&gt; ping [google.com](https://google.com)) What's your ping to speedtest.net?
---
Zandalar tribe is whitch one?
---
Dude. the thread is 4 months old xDDD. But yeah in agree
---
That's because it is.....
---
I never use auction house addons. Pretty common sense. Just monitor the item you're interested in for a while to get a feel of the price. Grab it when there's one that's much cheaper than the average. 
---
Put stuff up with the bid price lower than the cheapest listing so it will appear first in people's searches. 
---
When you keep playing, you'll come to learn about items that sell easily. Linen cloth is one example - high volume, low margins. Common starting gathering materials (copper ore, starting herbs, early skins) are other examples.
---
Call it an educated. The polarization of politics leads to homogenized opinions.
---
I wasn't aware, thank you for educating me. I will aspire to level up to 13!
---
Not true, as long as you do your role very well, you will always get invited, nor do I have any plans on raiding. Pvp / lowby ganking only
---
You should see VWs, because--again--they provide actual utility to unexpected adds.  They have damage mitigation and actual healthpools to help escapes.  And the sacrifice ability.
---
If you're interested in seeing how DOTs can make you less afraid of face-tanking, google 'warlock drain tanking'; I'd recommend not even trying until your late 20's but by 30 it's just so much faster for solo leveling and you can handle things well above your own level.
---
Well I’ve found you def can’t /sit proc reckoning on classic so idk yet how I feel about it.
---
Joke is on you brother.
---
That's what happens when Blizzard doesn't open latin american servers.
---
We, the BR community, spoken looong before launch that Thalnos was the Official BR Server.
---
If you decided to start WoW without doing the minimal research, then it's all on you buddy.
---
If a enemy faction player pulls a mob, then I help kill it, will the enemy player still receive full XP?
---
By the time the target has made it to me I've already hit them with a Shadow bolt and dotted them up. Their health is down to 1/3 or 1/4 by the time they reach me. I don't need to cast anything, just wand them down and let my Imp blast away and they are dead. Barely made a dent in my health and I'm already recovering the mana used. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum.
---
Di molto!
---
What class do you play? As a priest in contested zones I never get below half mana with full health unless I have to.
---
I use this thing called my brain where I attribute characteristics to a name based off my experiences. Then when that name comes up again my brain brings up all the relevant information associated with said name. It’s all very convenient.
---
Try getting in a group so instead of competing with people for the kills you are mutually benefiting.
---
Not everyone will want to group but a lot will.
---
When rolling with a paladin tank wait for consecrate to drop and then give it a second
---
There's a gnome "Tyrion", I'm guessing that's a reference to GoT.
---
VC = Goonies
---
I remember the Blood Elf dance was the Napolean Dynamite dance too
---
Treat them as two separate games.
---
Both are worth playing, and it’s never too late to start. It kinda depends what type of gameplay you’re interested in.
---
Classic is slower paced, and you’re a mere random adventurer in a giant world that needs help with different tasks. It’s more of a traditional RPG in which you explore and discover new things, both alone and in groups when you find people nearby working toward the same goal. It’s more of a maze and a puzzle than anything else. Better suited to those that enjoy grinds and don’t get discouraged when frustrated.
---
Retail is much faster paced. You’re now a “superhero” and max level is really when the game starts. It works as many other games work nowadays, you play the season. Every new season everything gets soft reset and you start over with the new content. Better suited to those that enjoy the instant gratification some games provide.
---
As for challenging dungeon/raid content, you will 100% be most challenged in retail, as long as you aim for the highest difficulties.
---
I’ve been playing benediction since I started last week. Never played wow before and I’m enjoying it. Yet to have a queue time ever
---
Well what are we really discussing then. Everyones subjective limit of complaints. You might think the first example is fair someone else thinks its a given, and is not fair to complain about. Where do we draw the line? It seems to me this post is as much mindless complaining as anyone elses. And I dont mind it.
---
Thanks for the info.! I had no idea.
---
At this point you could have finished it
---
The hardest part for me was the Shendralar rep.
---
Join a group and do it in Stockades. warrior, healer, 3 mage / warlock and you can destroy
---
Take the alliance we horde are snug at home lol
---
It's weird on the one hand its kind of griefing... on the other its super awesome.
---
Sounds like an amazingly immersive minigame
---
Yeah I found a clip

You can mind control someone, have your group buff them, heal them, and then throw them in the lava.

Krol blade = sports car
---
Banking Krol blade for a while and missing out being able to wreck most of the current population and being killed more often and not looking as menacing and everyone will have an epic mount shortly after you get one = 98 Mercury Sable with 250k miles.
---
Very happy about Chipskylark, May his teeth stay shiny forever
---
Increasing capacity is increasing layers. Only a moron doesn't get that.
---
Wait, so you're telling me a mount which costs 90g is almsot 400usd? 
---
I should sell my gold holy fuck.
---
DM
---
&gt; I think one of the main reasons to go to another starting zone is so you can get exalted with that faction quicker for their mount.
---
Ah, that's what I was thinking. How much does this matter if that's what you're trying to do? Is it that any bit helps or is it a huge chunk? And do you know how much more effort it would be after doing this, grind-wise? Thanks.
---
How did he have time for all of that? All of my non-static casting time is spent drinking in deadmines so far. I've even got a solid amount of int, at 1700 some mana level 21
---
Honestly the game is always either competitive or cooperative especially when the population is so high like right now. Either party up with them or it’s killsteal or be killstealed
---

It's normal to manually roll for unusual or good items.
---
Fuck alliance dude. They think they are the good guys acting all high and mighty. But I don't camp their 20-30 zone killing them. They sure as shit camped hillsbrad. Just because I'm a zombie, doesn't mean I'm the bad guy.
---
Im lvl 41 and still a bit over 20g short :(
---
Leveling enchanting was so damn expensive &gt;.&lt;
---
Almost all of them that advertise in general chat are inexperienced, even if they say they’re a top tier active raiding guild.
---
One of the next things I'm going to add will be flight masters as well as trainers/repair/vendors. I didn't extract that data yet though.
---
They'll receive % exp depending on how much damage they did. This is true for all players, not just enemy. If a friend kills half your mob for you, you'll get roughly half exp.
---
I'm a warlock. I have several ways to sacrifice my pet for survival. My favorite is letting it sit there attacking a couple mobs while I run. Once I get far enough I get my soul shard back.
---
I dunno man, all that info was so unofficial and this is also unprecedented to have all the americas together. I wouldn't judge someone for assuming a server is English speaking when other languages and SA as a whole has always had their own dedicated servers.
---
ignore them and report them, that's all you can do, i've already done it to about 25 different people
---
thing is i doubt they're even selling much gold, they're most likely just the ones that straight hack accounts via keylogging when you go to their site
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
Time to corpse run to badlands so I can have a flightpath option if I miss zeppelin! (Even though waiting for Zepp is prob faster hahah!)
---
Yeah after looking it up I realized there was a server named that. My mistake. Perhaps I’ll make another character on that server. What’s your char?

It always worked in reverse on my sever weekends crafting mats plummet because people playing more undercutting etc. then during the week they’d climb.
---
Well red and blue are the colours of up and downvotes so, it would make sense.
---
What ui are you using?
---
I have a physical list of alliance that if I ever see again once I’m 60, I will grief then to my hearts content. Loktar ogar you level advantage abusing scum!
---
chests are normally different. if you loot like the parrot off a random defias that's yours but if it's a chest that anyone can loot, you roll for it.
---
WAit.. we can use mana?
---
When I played healer on a private server I usually reminded the group at the beginning that it was vanilla , I need to drink. Then said OOM every time I ran out. If they complained about dying I reminded them about drinking and said to scroll up to see when I went OOM.
---
It was rough at low levels with bad groups but over time it got better. By the 50s most of the bad tanks had switched to DPS and would side with me on the rare chance things went wrong. It will get better, just gotta push thru.
---
What server is this juicy action on? I may make a horde and hunt gnomes as well haha.
---
Depends. Dungeons, maybe if you're geared enough, but the harder dungeons probably not. Raids definitely prot.
---
I remember attending in ingame wedding in Winterspring. Don't remember the exact location but it was near Frostsaber under a giant lionking-esque cave.
---
You go to the client and download wow classic. I’m really sorry if you think that is a hard task.
---
Play with a bunch of friends and watch them progress through and enjoy all of the content while you suffer through grinding level 3 boars.
---
Gnomes are just shitty Dwarves
---
Gnomeregan should have wiped them all out
---
In ‘07 it was the most casual of the existing MMOs. 
---
No xp loss on death. Dear didn’t permanently break.  Personal mounts. Leveling via questing.
---
Those zones are right next to our capital. Where as only the NE race is anywhere near them. Couple that with most night elves choosing to run to SW or IF rather then level in the NE zones and you get allaince low zones. This says nothing about the server and a lot more about geography. Basically in real life. If this war was happening. The NE's would get there ass kicked because they are alone and isolated. There placement on the map makes no sense lol.
---
As I said, it feels worse even if the system is technically better.
---
ElvUI. It has bartender, bagnon, and scrap built in. And it just makes a much cleaner UI.  
---
Questie   
---
DBM   
---
Atlas Loot

Before I start raiding everyone in my raid while be required to have Omen Threat Meter and DBM.

We could explain it but you seem pretty content with being retarded.

Mind control cap potentially.

A level 34 gnome warrior on Kromcrush tried ganking a lvl28 mage yesterday outside TM, he thought he was gonna just roll him. Except I was approaching from behind to kill the warrior already so the mage just nova and I destroyed the warrior. The mage /spit at the warrior, then laughed, then waved goodbye. It was funny AF cause this poor warrior went from confident to probably shitting his pants in one swift moment.

As a priest, what should I put my points into for leveling? Right now I’ve put them into shadow, but I didn’t know if I should put any into Holy or Discipline.  According to a build I looked up I should put some into discipline, but idk what order I should spec in if that makes.
---
&gt; so I whispered my friend for an invite and slipped into another layer.
---
I don't even know what this means. Can you elaborate?
---
yes please i would love to play wow on mobile
---
Download the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client which is required to play all blizzard games and has been for nearly a decade, and download classic wow. Don't forget you need to resub. The download is about 4.7 gb
---
Druid is a good choice if you want the option to tank. Hunter is easy leveling but many people don't like them for groups. Good hunters are great though, so its an option. Mages and rogues are almost always wanted in groups. There are other options if you like to heal.
---
This is what Classic is all about.
---
For the Alliance!

Weapon damage is all that really matters anyway for leveling. I just bought https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13033/zealot-blade#comments for 3g and the int doesn't bother me one bit. I'm just happy I replaced the level 19 blue I was still using at level 32 because all the quests that reward 1h swords are horde only.
---
That's quite the wall of text for someone who doesn't want to be angry.
---
Once you have a subscription on your battle.net account, you can play wow classic. You'll need to download the battle.net client first (https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop) From there, install the battle.net client. Then make sure you only download WoW Classic. I made the mistake of downloading the regular WoW first which took forever.
---
Just wait until phase 2 hits and there is a real reason to jump people, then it'll be real
---
Yeah...
---
I will never miss Expertise and Hit Rating.
---
Horrible advice 
---
Save this. You’ll replace a weapon within like 10 levels anyways. This thing is worth a ton in the long run
---
My momma called me a fattie and told me to move my fatass to gym, it worked.
---
In today's world yeah, but in 2004 vanilla they were the coolest. The pet ai was quite good for the time and was enjoyable and immersive.
---
In 2019 though, super lame.
---
Oh, I forgot that was removed in Cata.
---
The problem is that it's not pre-BIS, Dal'Rend set is.
---
I'd say make new alts man, try out every class if you want. Getting to level 18 isn't that long, and I'm sure you'll figure out which one you want to stick it out with.
---
What happens in Moonglade stays in Moonglade.
---
Ping battle net tru cmd says 33. 33 would be fine if stable
---
Except for that it spams channels and gives a huge advantage in world pvp against rogues and druids....
---
Don't you have cellphones??
---
You're at least 3 levels too high for DM, Stocks will be good for a few levels still.
---
My girlfriend watched me do the whole escort quest while waiting for me to come off the PC. She was pissed. Got to watch this asshole all the way to Ratchet from the Northwatch area.
---
&gt; I don't think the answer to that is to give in to consumer culture. Unfortunately, the only solution is to eat less and move more. 
---
[Since 2003](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/upshot/americans-are-finally-eating-less.html) Americans *have* been eating less, but there isn't a country on Earth where people are getting any thinner.
---
Why do you think that is? Also, if you wouldn't mind - why do you think [American pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets-obesity-dogs-cats-health-animals-1359969) are getting fatter? More sedentary lifestyles for dogs and cats? Why are [all laboratory animals](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9194579/obesity-animals) getting fatter on consistent-calorie controlled diets? Why are even [feral, wild animals](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2010.1890) getting fatter? And why are all of these different populations getting fatter at the *same rate* that the humans in North America are?
---
I dunno. Does that impact your confident certainty that you know "how people get fat" and why it's happening, at all? It certainly impacted mine. If you're no less certain you have a handle on the obesity epidemic, can you explain why that is?
---
&gt; It's a structural problem that requires personal effort to change.
---
If I'm making a point in these posts, its to reduce your certainty that the answer is simply "personal effort." I think the example of doctors indicates that "personal effort" isn't going to be *sufficient.* It certainly hasn't moved the needle in the last 50 years of trying, even as Americans *are* eating fewer calories.
---
&gt; However, many FAs and HAES spokes people make money by telling people that there is nothing unhealthy about being fat
---
Do you genuinely believe the "fat acceptance" industry makes even a hundreth of what they're making in the "fat people are ugly" industry? Set that aside for a second - if [we know that educating children about the dangers and causes of obesity](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/) just causes them to bully fat people more, bullying that typically results in weight *gain* by the overweight and obese, then is "fat risk education" actually a helpful public health intervention?
---
Perhaps it's counterintuitive, but it seems obvious to me that the purpose of "fat acceptance" is to promote healthy weight loss in the overweight and obese by reducing the stigma around the condition. Why do you believe that's not the case?
---
&gt; You did, multiple times, throughout this thread.
---
You must be thinking of someone else's posts, or you didn't read mine carefully and with an eye towards comprehension. Pretty common on Reddit.
---
Yeah I've been noticing when I go to the Moonglave that the moment I'm spotted by a NE they completely freeze and stare right at me. Pretty tense moment and I just jump away while spinning.
---
Yes. Ignore all the min/max folks who say you have to play a certain way. Play how you want. You learn along the way.
---
high elf 🙄
---
I’m leveling a warlock in classic (never played one before) and I plan to put a lot of focus on PvP once it’s out. I’ve never heard of SL/SB build before, are there any guides out there I can look at?
---
What about a War tank main needing an off spec 2hd weapon against Shaman who would equip it on their main in dungeon and have it be an immediate in-instance gain?
---
I am still salty, I suppose.
---
I should have been clearer - Chests and dropped rares (Green/blue/purple) have established rules in place for who gets it, either by mechanics or etiquette.
---
For a rare item, everyone is prompted for the need/greed roll so that determines who gets it fairly.
---
For a chest, everyone needs to roll for it to determine who gets the chest (And even if there's a purple BoE perfect for your party's warrior and you're a rogue, you get it).
---
White items are different because everyone gets a 'turn' at looting corpses, this essentially acts as a 'random' roll for white items. I've always considered this to essentially be a 'random roll', otherwise you'd have people rolling on every single white that dropped.
---
Molten Core is ridiculously easy man, just join any guild full of people with 10 fingers and you too can eventually wear epix
---
Woah, went from 0 to 100 in an instant. Since you played WoW at some point he was assuming you knew how the Battle.net launcher worked. It's literally just change the drop down from WoW to WoW classic and hit install, that's it. No need to insult people trying to help you.
---
This is how WoW 2 could be.
---
I went to the fucking client earlier today but the only option I had was installing all of the WoW stuff and it's like 60 gb. There is no option for just WoW classic for me. Sorry for just trying to get some clarification, but I'm glad to see the wow community is still as horrible as it used to be
---
Your doing pretty well for a rogue. Yes you could be going much faster. However leveling can be like raiding. By that I mean the people leveling faster then you. Are able to do so because they practiced leveling. In the same way some people practice raiding. Don't be discouraged, you  only have to do this once. So theres no ryme or reason you would be an expert at it.
---
Hunters dominate in PvP and are completely fine in PvE lol
---
Not kreenig, but we had a full party last night and had Verog stolen THREE times!!! We just gave up ..... My SO got him while I was trying to get centaur bracers, and he said there was no one there, but as soon as I need the head people star coming like crazy.... Gonna try and get it as soon as I get off work when the server is less busy.
---
I tried using Bagnon, but hated trying to find stuff.  Switched back to Ark Inventory which I used back in my TBC/WOTLK days that lets me set up custom filters that separates everything, which is pretty nice.  How does Inventorian compare?
---
I'd add a weapon swing timer for warrior.
---
Thank you, appreciate it!
---
We need ray tracing on wow!!!
---
If principles matter enough to follow then don't they also matter enough to examine to make sure they aren't themselves shitty? I don't believe this one qualifies. 
---
I think a much more useful principle would be to not to assume a right to something before it is in your bags or you have negotiated with everyone else involved so they recognize your right to put the item in your bags. Then it would be much much more difficult for anyone to take something that you believe belongs to you. What is it that you like about the principle that you have ownership of a chest in the open world that you are still working to have the chance to open?
---
I dont wanna be the guy that tells people how to play. For sure, if you wanna swipe a chest out from under someone I guess go for it. It's kinda dickish but it is just a game, just dont expect people to help you out when you've done a thing a lot of people frown on is all.
---
(My tone here is calm and just chatting, I'm not trying to argue any one point. Hard to get that across through text sometimes)
---
Hmm.. I was sure I've seen other subreddits using other colours.. Looking around I'm not seeing it now..
---
A solid choice.
---
Is that a Star Wars UI
---
I'm obviously aware of that, but I can see them way before they even consider opening on me as no one goes MoD when they level.
---
Download census plus classic and run a scan yourself, will take about an hour depending on server size. You might be able to find someone who has already done it on the server subreddit or discord if you're too lazy to do it yourself.
---
Which isn't too often in leveling, which I'm assuming OP is asking about.
---
It's for everyone and anyone lol.
---
Everyone should play classic. It's wow before it turned into a cash machine and a slot machine full of gambling at grabbing your wallet.
---
Jokerd will be irrelevant. People will flock to APES streams on every phase release.
---
"It's the reason they flew out guys like Preach, Esfand and Kungen. They all have decently sized audiences."
---
My point is that their audiences are about to explode. Monkeynews' already did.
---
From the golden age of wow
---
Riding a slow ass mount taking forever to get around is boring
---
That's a great mace. Perfect stats for a warrior. However, I would recommend selling it. Gold is very scarce right now. You will need 100g for your level 40 mount.
---
Remindme! 4 hours
---
&gt; thousands of upvotes,
---
From my experience in so many other subs, I find that useful, educational, thoughtful often can be greatly outnumbered by vapid, low-effort.
---
Take theorycrafting, for example.  I'd love to see theorycrafting here (in a general sense, despite it all being all mathed out 15 years ago), but I guarantee that such a post will not garner as much as a low-effort meme because of the niche/smaller audience that appeals to.
---
One might say 'votes indicate popularity/demand for that content'.  I think that is a short-sighted recipe that will actively encourage the end of many subs, based on that content being noisy and tiresome, over time.
---
I'm okay with "No Memes" for #7, but I'd heavily disagree that that means "NO FUN ALLOWED."  I think that is a disingenuous consequence of a wording change.
---
I’m on Incendius and about to do the same... I can not justify 1-2hr in queue when I get off work. Last night already had a couple friends just refuse to log in. So your words speak to me. Lol.
---
Shit, saw shadow brain went warlock.
---
“Ugh undead are the coolest looking class” fixed it for you.
---
Where **I** draw the line is where I get annoyed by it and mute you in Discord.
---
Idk what I'm doing wrong, but I can't find a mining trainer who'll train me *apprentice* mining. I'm certain I only have one profession (I just unlearned skinning to make room for mining) and I'm certain I'm talking to mining trainers. What gives?
---
man you are cool
---
The first thing you do is create a character, you will need to choose three things:
---
A faction, Alliance or Horde. This will determine where you start, who your allies are, and who your opponents are. Ultimately there is no 'right' answer for this, just choose the side you feel you align with the most. The only big difference is if you play alliance, you can be a paladin, if you play horde you can be a Shaman. 
---
A race, depending on your faction, you will be able to choose: Night Elf, Human, Gnome or Dwarf if you're alliance, or Troll, Tauren, Orc or Undead if you're horde. Each race has different racial abilities that make them better in certain scenarios. Just read up on the racials and if they fit your class, then go for it. Most of it is pretty intuitive, for instance gnomes get +5% intelligence, so if you're playing a rogue/warrior then gnomes probably aren't ideal. Taurens get +5% hp, so any tanky class benefits greatly from that bonus.  
---
A class, this is arguably the most important choice as it will determine how you play the game. There are 8 classes in total for each faction: Mage, Rogue, Warrior, Druid, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, Paladin (Only alliance), Shaman (Only horde). Mages/Rogues/Hunters/Warlocks focus on damage. Druids/Priests/Paladins/Shamans can heal so they're very useful in dungeons. Warriors/Paladins are tanks that take the bulk of the damage in dungeons. Some roles aren't too fixed, so something like a druid can tank/heal/DPS depending on items/talents, while others are very fixed so something like a mage/warlock/rogue will never be able to heal or tank. 
---
When you actually get into the game, there will be lots of tips, quests and guides to help you out. If you ever get stuck, just hit "Enter" then "/1" to talk in the "General" chat. Ask questions and people will be more than happy to help out.
---
There's some nuance to each class in Classic. She will rise above.
---
Is it as fun when you're not in a group, though?
---
Gotcha, not too bad then
---
Oh my! No wonder I keep cancelling it. DERP!
---
Thanks, that really helps!
---
We're not far from actual toasters or potatoes at this point.
---
Can we get confirmation of this becuase.... I think it's wrong.  I think exp is always split evenly between party members if they are close enough/helped with the kill.  If someone else tags a mob and you help kill it I'm not sure you get exp.
---
Because they will be able to control the market on rare herbs/consumables, forcing you to pay more for them.
---
This. Thank u. For the Horde !
---
I prefer the horde, and undead can't be hunters, and, imo, have the most interesting early horde zones, story wise. The Barrens is just an incredible leveling zone. 
---
If you go alliance, no matter the race you pick, I'd *highly* recommend doing the human zones because, imo, it's the most compelling 5-30 leveling experience, story wise, in the game.
---
I attacked a rogue 5 levels above me. He killed me, but God damnit my stance on rogues is clear. If I see you, I'm going to attack you.
---
Why would they spend that epic mount gold when they could be saving for a Krol blade?!
---
-----------
---
And I know we're joking here (even though I'm definitely a sports car kinda guy), but your point A to B 90s car is nice and while you're for sure saving tons of money...It doesn't really matter when getting hit by a soccer mom in a huge suburban who's texting while drinking starbucks.
---
There have been huge safety advances over the last twenty years. You can still be plenty sensible with money by getting a lightly used toyota or something. Which will be much safer, much better to drive, more fuel efficient, and will likely not cost anything in maintenance, all which offset a lot of the money savings.
---
There's a reason most people don't panic anymore when you hear someone got in an accident. In the 90s you'd be in the news, but now it's more like, 'ah crap, hope the insurance process isn't too much of a headache!'
---
All this said, my first car was actually a 98 Taurus and I did love it lol.
---
I would never need to vendor. This is more in reference to twink items that are in high demand to be sold on AH.
---
Regardless, I would never need without the parties consent on what we are doing with it and I will always go with the parties decision. 
---
In your example, I would also consider this a huge upgrade and the person who needs would get.
---
I suppose I am thinking of a scenario a +6 agility dagger BoE dropped and a hunter wanted  it to replace a +5 agility +2 Stam sword. It bugged me he was upset, as I felt someone in the group could use the gold they’d get from selling on AH then to optimize his dps by 1. It’s scenarios like this that make me think needing is best to avoid drama.
---
To be faaair, the website often asks me to login. Then I have to take out my phone and call my personal assistant to ask. Might as well just take a pic.
---
You're not helping your case lol
---
I don't pay anything for them, I go pick them up.
---
Eh what?
---
If theres literally *anybody*  behind OP then its kind of a dick move.
---
Aoe is 100% faster, but you have to be good at it, and specced for it. All my talents are for mana efficiency, damage, and threat reduction. People think they can just aoe without devoting their entire build to it. I've hit 500 dps on a pull at lvl 41. I've had so many groups just as you described. If you want good aoe dps you have to build for good aoe dps.
---
using evis at 2 combo points is wasteful. why would you link a picture of the talents instead of a link to the build page?
---
I’m at a loss for words.  Here I am, at least another person playing wow, and a priest at that, not understanding my press issue, over pressing buttons in game, happier for seeing this macro listed. 
---
Thanks to OP for posting it!
---
10 times more players.. 10 times more mats needed ... be happy that there is going to be a bit more  of stuff... once layering is gone and people will want to farm  its going to be hell and you are all going to cry that there is not enough
---
This is why I'm not playing on the big popular elitist streamer servers.
---
We spent 4 hours in wc, no one left, no one got kicked
---
, Lots of laughs.
---
Fast, lets mention something bad so we can forget about GoT again...
---
What could be so terrible it...  
---
~~Warlods~~ Garrisons of Draenor
---
If it's solely a DPS spot. Hunters are not even close to your first choice in Raiding.
---
This. The cost/damage alone makes it worth it. Add the disarm and it's amazing when soloing elite mobs.
---
I see out of all the replys, you only took the time to comment on mine :)
---
Well what in the fuck is that on the left?
---
What server?
---
I remember getting Meteor Shard on my rogue back in 2005. 
---
Granted, I didn’t get a single other dagger, EVER, until Scarlet Monastery. You know your luck is bad with weapons when Hypnotic Blade is actually an upgrade for a rogue.
---
Other people couldn't steal your stuff when you died.
---
[deleted]
---
Classic has no blob shadow (at least on higher settings).
---
Where should I go next at lvl 27-28 as horde after stonetalon ashenvale and Hillsbrad.
---
My Characters name is Zenitsu
---
After Season 6.
---
Don't buy anything on AH. Sell everything, don't let your bags get full because you're leaving silver on the ground. Sure it might only be 1-2s but do that for a quest or two and that's a couple gold down the drain. Train skinning and skin and vendor everything. Don't buy high ranks of skills you don't use.  
---
This may or may not get you a mount right at 40, but it will get you close. I was at 75g when I dinged 40, you need 90g for training+mount as long as you're Honored (you should be).
---
It's [MUI but the classic edition](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25225-MayronUIClassic.html#info). The aura addon is broke though. Still waiting for a fix for that.
---
If you're on Kromcrush, hit me up! I'll make your SM experience a lot better.
---
Nice username
---
Will this work on iPad?
---
Maybe.... me am that kind of orc
---
yep, my warrior tank is only 27 but there are already 4 people on my ignore list that I wont group with. 3 dps and a healer from various dungeon runs. Not that it matters much rn with the server populations as high as they are but when the crowd starts to thin out in the 40s and 50 and theyre looking for a tank, I'm one less that they'll have to pick from. 
---
If they keep making a nmae for themselves as jerks, that could eventually put them in a tough spot.
---
Does Windfury properly work right now? I don't seem to get the visual effect when it procs and no increase in atk power on those 2 extra hits
---
Makes perfect sense in the context of "Flame retardant" - makes something burn slower, so you can actually have time to find your extinguisher and spray it like a madman at whatever's burning.
---
It's Star Trek but with more dwarves
---
What do each “phase” of classic contain to the best of your knowledge? I didn’t know there were different phases till today. I’m extremely excited for BG’s but want the full scope of each phase. Thanks in advance!
---
Yes
---
TBH the hair style on the left - with the M-shaped bangs - look pretty animu to me.
---
I show mercy because when I get soul link they can't beat health regen.
---
There is a huge difference between a skilled hunter and a non skilled hunter. You will be able to tell pretty early on like any class.
---
As far as dps goes, they are partially gear dependent and optimized oddly but they can easily hold there own in raids. PVP my favorite class other than shadow priest's and rogues.
---
Each class has their limitations.
---
*clears throat*
---
**YOU'VE BEEN LIED TO. YOU'LL BE SAVING WSG GAMES ALL DAY BE CASTING SCARE BEAST ON ENEMY DRUID FLAG CARRIERS.**
---
**DUELING IS A DIFFERENT PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S CLASS BASED; YOU'LL EAT ROGUES ALIVE ALL DAY, BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE GOING UPHILL AGAINST WARRIORS AND MAGES, FOR EXAMPLE.**
---
It isn't but you're free to spec any way you want to. Delaying the bottom half of combat talents by 2 levels isn't worth 40% crit on a single attack. It's an entirely wasted talent on anything that doesn't require you to be killing constantly. Get it after AR when you can be farming for mount gold in your 40s.
---
Back in 2004 I rolled shadow all the way to 60, it’s not worth the healing bonuses for the groups, when you feel useless playing alone.
---
I'm a new hunter.  Who is that cat?  (Am horde also)
---
Definitely had this happen to me too.
---
How dare he!
---
And btw where the fun in corpsecamping some nub if you dont expect him to rage a bit behind his monitor ;)
---
Same here wtf. Where do i get the ray tracing addon.
---
No. Transmog wasn't introduced until Wrath
---
At this moment I am just happy to have good old WoW back and will deal with it fine like I did before.
---
That second guy is questioning if he shouldn’t have accepted that guild invite
---
If you want a class that can play solo then yes I would roll dps, specifically mage or warlock. 
---
Most people don't need to play solo though.
---
Guide in the comments
---
Try this macro. /castsequence !shoot, !shoot  
---
It will let you spam a little better without interrupting yourself as much.
---
They run around raping and pillaging the low levels in the area.
---
Fewer commitments and fewer life experiences so we are content with unstimulating things.
---
I would like to be friends. I too am a wife that has weird mods on the Sims 4.
---
Are you dumb? Both factions are made up by the same assholes.
---
I thought it was 40g for level 40 mount?
---
Bear in mind that Blood Elves existed in Warcraft 3. They're not a TBC invention, they're already part of the lore by the time of World of Warcraft.
---
Seriously. 
---
&gt;It's not an easy thing to hear that you can spend your whole life devoting it to health and still be unhealthier than an overweight person, but it's a fact.
---
Thats fucking comical. It's so in-your-face absurd.
---
//&gt;Be me, get regular exercise, always drink daily recommended amount of water, eat healthy a majority of the time, no drugs, no smoking, occasional drink, no binges.
---
//&gt;Fat fuck that doesn't walk further than their fridge to get leftover Popeyes is somehow "healthier" than me.
---
With reason then
---
Damn 50 days played. She really took her time and enjoyed the leveling experience. Good on Asmongold's mom.
---
I was joking, I don't really care either way lol
---
Bruh you leveled to 27 as prot? That’s hardcore
---
Updated with guide
---
You're both stupid lol.
---
I'd imagine they would need to account for farming professions, too, such as mining nodes and herbs. But honestly it's a tremendous amount of work to implement something like this when you have to account for so many different types of drops. 
---
The quicker and simpler solution would be to implement a cap on layer transfers per hour, which I think would work just fine. Dungeons could still be run without impact since instances have their own servers, although summoning someone who has exceeded that cap might not be possible. I see little to no reason why this couldn't happen.
---
I found the inspiration for "Do you guys not have phones!?"
---
Aside; well done.
---
American Pie in today's world would be considered mansplaining, oppressive and politically incorrect.
---
This post isn't aimed at you. It's the top 20% getting squeezed by the top 1%.
---
Yeah man, class balance was so terrible. Why play WL when Squig Herder does everything you do but better and at range? Why olay Disciple of Khaine when WP gets to do more healing, damage, AND wear a higher AC? Why play Magus when... You really bring nothing to the table at all and Sorc and BW exist. Why play Marauder when... You're basically relegated to being a melee Sorc via mace arm, with less damage and less survivability.
---
EA Mythic ruined that game, their touch is a toxin.

You ruined the oregasm

Does the paladin reckoning build do well? Does the /sit macro work? Is it viable for leveling at all? 
---
Looking for some guidance, I'm currently loving my Holy spec'd paladin because it's awesome for group play (which i really enjoy) but have watched guides and what not that said to go reckoning spec at level 32 ish. However, none of those guides were actually 100% sure whether or not the /sit macro actually works. Help please

I still have my old computer in the basement, I’ve been thinking I should pull it out and see if I can’t get screenshots off of it

*I CAST SWORD*
---
Frostbolt and fireball are core abilities you're going to be using them all game as the majority of your spellcasts
---
Thought about that too. But this post isn't going to go anywhere so I said fuck it.
---
I would sell it on the auction house. The other posters seem to be neglecting the swing speed. This weapon is mainly for a feral druid.   
---
Generally speaking, as a warrior, you want a slow 2handed weapon &gt;3.100 swing speed. The reason for this is that cleave and overpower do damage based on your current melee weapon.   
---
The slower the weapon, the more damage output it puts out.
---
Or just get rid of the layers and turn on balance transfers.
---
&gt;Why would they spend that epic mount gold when they could be saving for a Krol blade?!
---
Epic mounts are forever.
---
Also I will probably get the Toyota next time I have to spend money on my car. I live only a mile from work so I don't drive a whole lot anyway.
---
Okies nice one, how do you extract the data?
---
I just want to clarify for everyone concerned: I'm doing my post grad at the moment and am taking a first year psych course to make up my last 2 credits. It's also before the lecture actually started and I didn't actually play during. 
---
Thanks to all those who voiced their concerns though it's true we should keep our commitments in focus.
---
PvP server means in most areas, an enemy player can engage you whenever they want (excluding beginner areas and capital cities).
---
Normal server means you'd have to specifically flag yourself for PvP before anyone could attack you.
---
If it spammed channels, it'd be a banned addon already.  Addons aren't allowed to spam public channels, regardless of what they otherwise do.
---
This is the equivalent comment of the person at a birthday party who sings at the end, "and many more..on channel four" it's not really funny the first time and just gets worse the more you hear it.
---
You absolutely can still get to Hyjal, wall jump stuff being different or no. Plenty of people did in beta.
---
That shit is time consuming to make. I only give loved ones cooked food. I don't feel bad for classes that can buff giving out buffs when it literally only costs them MANA that regenerates over time!
---
"Where you going"
---
I actually kind of enjoy searching out items in weird places and such for the stats and abilities I want, mix and matching items where I go.  Not every "higher level" item will be an upgrade, if there are specific stats you want you have to plan out where to find those (especially leading up to BWL).  Eventually just the stuff in the raid becomes the best and nearly every upgrade is in those, that is when it becomes more stale to me.
---
Head to the opposite faction starter zone. 
---
Put demon on aggressive and stay. Get far enough that it doesn’t despawn.
---
He’s obviously talking about the only visible addon in your photo
---
&gt;Cause druids can escape everything.
---
Not daze, fuck daze
---
I had this problem so downloaded directly from the developers site and that worked. Outdated addons has to be enabled.
---
A lot of people cannot control themselves and make alts  
---
Now is the time or you will regreet when you get into wow in 1 month
---
What UI addon is that
---
His wife was torn to pieces and he's afraid of what he might see. He needs to know if she made it out alive, but he can't handle what might be waiting for him there. So, brave adventurer, Mankrik sends you.
---
Ah I see, I already knew combat in Retail is trivialized in comparison but, not to that extent
---
I remember back in original beta they did a patch and they removed the murlock noises and everyone threw a bitch fit and they literally like 2 days later did a special patch to put them in.
---
Wow classic servers are actually broken into multiple "layers". Each layer is a continent wide copy of the server with a certain number of players allowed into it. There may be 10,000 people online for instance, but it will be broken into multiple "layers" of 2000 people. This has been a highly controversial method of increasing the player capacity on a server and blizzard has said they plan to turn it off before phase 2.
---
If someone invites you to their party, you will automatically be phased into their layer or their particular "copy" of the game. People have been exploiting this fracturing of the server by having people who are confirmed to be in different layers alternate inviting them so they shift between layers.
---
This has been most notably abused by AoE farmers who will clear a large pack of valuable mobs, then immediately be invited into a new layer where all the mobs are still there to functionally farm multiple copies of the server. I used it to avoid being camped, because while 4 people were chasing me my friend inviting me caused me to leave that copy of the server and enter his copy where they are no longer there.
---
Thanks.
---
And you will :D
---
Gods and deities, the "light" or just another source of energy from Azeroth herself. There's a lot of "magic" and such in Warcraft lore. Even undeath is another form of that. It's crazy but pretty sure it involves all the Titans, old gods, and that stuff.
---
Try to find a guild via other means. Not just randomly accept an invite. Huge guilds are not better. I would advise looking for a guild via Reddit or the wow forums or something. Or just join someone’s guild you liked levelling with.
---
It does not work.
---
vanish
---
Be happy that you have that feeling. It's a lot healthier. Some people can go for days and not feel that feeling. I was like that in my teens, could go 10+ hours not feeling hunger or like I had to stretch. Now I feel ill if I play more than 2-3 hours, I also feel super disgusting if I don't do something irl productive inbetween sessions.
---
I want to be terribly concerned. There's so many people playing of all levels. A week later, starter zones are still busy.
---
And druid is close to last.
---
I'd put my point at 30 into blade flurry and wait until 31 to get the 5th in dual wield, but yes.
---
Sorry why do I care about your opinion?
---
Attention everyone, I have sad news. Just last night, my trusted guild member and fearless leader, Hat, was chat banned for saying a single "Hat" in Tirisfal Glades. Blizzard is against the cult of Hat, who we willing and of our choices choose to follow his teachings; We must show Blizzard the error of there ways in opposing the innocence and kindness of Hat.

I have a family of MD and its kinda silly to see how the average redditor reacts to energy drinks. Dude chill, taking a fucking paracetamol is way worse than drinking all this redbull in 2 days. (at least if it's only once)
---
I have never played wow before the last week, I was using AAP for a few days till level 15, but it killed the game for me, I was playing a game of following the arrow not actually playing. 
---
Once I turned it off and just used questie the game really opened up to me and now I’m having a blast. 
---
Of course this only applies to someone who has never played like me, if you want to speed run then follow that damn arrow till the big leagues baby
---
ohh boy, you aren't the only one. I remember reading wowhead on my blackberry in class.
---
I think it's 1 gold for the respec.
---
Either just delete the character and spend a few hours grinding the levels, pay the gold or just put all future points to frost. 
---
Just means improved blizzard is 2 levels later. 
---
Maybe just run with it as you will respec at 40ish anyway
---
If you leave anything in the chest, it won't despawn and will get other players to waste time fighting towards it. D-bag move if he didn't leave them intentionally for you.
---
*Scans badge, goes directly to the planet fitness massage beds, pulls out laptop plays wow*
---
But it’s still not worthwhile running those specs at all. And those that still do have to put in way more effort than necessary to make them work, and even then most folks won’t even take them into a raid group/BG group because of their spec.
---
Like try to tell a PvP team you’re a ret pally and watch them not answer lol. Now tell her you’re holy (but will really you dabble in the ret tree) and you’re in.
---
What level does the skill tree open? What button do I press to bring it up?
---
I’ve leveled 3 different characters, two Into their mid teens, one to 25. I’ve been contested on quests with each character, although not as harshly as my first to 25.
---
Guess you snowflakes can't take a joke, huh? Cool.
---
imagine non ironically rolling a braindead corrupted brute who can’t even close it’s mouth. Imagine being a chronic mouth breather. Imagine being an orc,
---
Gold selling has far more impact on the server's economy than what layering ever will.
---
I favor peace literally never. I have charged at skull leveled rogues walking past me because they have no right to spare my life when i'm so god damn ready to fucking fight KILL ME DAMN YOU!
---
Lvl 48 with a little over 4 days played. Just under 100g, that's after buying my mount.
---
You following me?
---
I'm a ffxiv player so when chests do open, the loot is either random given out automatically, or it's placed as a need or greed roll. Needs only being accessible by the class that can actually use it and greed being for everyone else. Wow classic has been jarring in that one particular aspect amongst the other, very fun ones.
---
Really? It says:
---
"Players may be required to change their name upon reaching their destination"
---
Where did you read that you get to keep your name?
---
Is energy spent on the blink? Can any physicists answer this?
---
No way dude. Hunters are one of the slowest classes to 10, lol. Only then does it start picking up.
---
And we thought undead were the intelligent ones
---
There are still shit loads of people at lower levels. I used an addon that looks at the population on my server and the middle of the bell curve is around lvl 20.
---
There will also always be new people and people re-rolling/making alts.
---
I didn’t actually get into vanilla wow until a year after it launched and made it to end game and rank 11 PvP.
---
Don’t let streamers (who are all tourists btw and are just here for the views) fool you into thinking it’s a race.
---
Thanks for that link, that was a really interesting read.
---
When I saw the cost to fly from Menethil to Iron Forge, I decided I'd rather kill myself.
---
Yeah, I don't know what the gold farmer scene is like right now and their pricing, but people were willing to throw down $100 for that 1000g. The same people would often have 3 or 4 1000g BOE purples so you could tell who the rich kids were lol.
---
You’re flagged. They aren’t.
---
Self control....
---
WHAT CAN I DO FER YEH?
---
Damn I need to use pots then I die so much as warrior
---
STOOOOP
---
That's what I'm saying, including high elves at all in wow was either an oversight or a goof that they had to then explain away. 
---
Where we last left high elves, their universally recognized heir and ruler renamed his people blood elves in honor of their fallen, to have individuals or even groups be like "nah we like the name high elf" makes no sense. That same guy and all his people were then declared traitors to the alliance and were being held for execution in the dungeons of Dalaran before escaping. 
---
If "remaining" in the alliance (or more accurately joining the new alliance after said alliance repudiated Garithos) was an option the blood elves would have done so out of necessity. 
---
It's not like Kael'thas left the alliance, its more that he got his ass punted out of it.
---
dude, I am Brazilian. I have played on an english speaking server for 12 years now, absolute choice. I learned english, assimilated jokes/culture whatever to befriend people. 
---
Your typical brazilian will never do that. They have a guetto mentality. If they have to learn ONE word, or listen to ONE thing you have to say, they will refuse, because in their heads thats being submissive to US people.
---
And yea, statistically, brazilians are toxic players, the whole lot of them. I abhor the thought of playing with them, and I am... them. So trust me when I say Thalnos is a pretty crappy server right now
---
PvP flag
---
Yeah, let's get him!
---
Request for Zandalar Tribe (EU) please!
---
So everyone that plays WoW must strive to be a rank 1 PvPer and must have every spell hotkeyed. Got it.
---
Hmm I usually go for Miss, Miss, Parry Dodged at normal speed but I can see how I can miss more hits by using more S&amp;D in my rotation!
---
Thank you! I don't understand the point of that though but I guess I will just move all my stealth abilities such as pickpocket to that action bar.
---
World pvp is basically being flagged out in the world all the time.  It means a member of the opposing faction can come up and kill you at any point.  On a pvp server you can not turn this interaction off.  On a pve server you can.  If you want to do world pvp on a pve server then you can flag yourself for it.  That’s pretty much the main difference between the two.
---
I thought Recount didn't work on Vanilla?
---
Stop saying clan you child
---
Come to 1k needles, everyone here alliance and horde are there to avoid stv it seems. I've been /waved at by 70% of the horde here
---
A 40% crit chance on your first sinister strike while leveling is absolutely worth delaying a few combat talents.
---
I see this kind of text in fortnite subreddit alot, are you sure you aren't lost?
---
Pet in the party getting the buff? Idk :/
---
I played WoW for twelve hours one day last week but nobody tells me every chance they get about the negative health impacts. That's the difference. Y'all don't ever shut the fuck up about fat people.
---
This is how need/greed is used. Need if you equip it, greed if you send to an alt, sell for gold, or use for RP gear etc
---
Wowhead was so cool. Everything you need to know.
---
Reference (here)[https://youtu.be/0Wrw3c2NjeE] - maybe it’s not as widely viewed as I thought.

This. I got one spam and immediately checked that box

Kek
---
Even on American servers tho, I’ve hard to learn some/wanted to learn some. Wasn’t a big deal
---
By the time he did that he was an evil bastard, and the high elves didn't just want to let an undead monster stomp into quelthalas and defile the sunwell
---
I tried downloading and using some add-ons but now my in game menu and character selection screen don't even show the add on button. I've deleted all the add-ons and even tried reinstalling the  whole game but still can't get it to appear... Does anyone know how to fix this?
---
z perl
---
I completely agree. Considering the fact that we have the option to make the graphics look significantly better than they did in 2004, I agree that the new models should have been optional as well. I don't know how much work it would be, but I would love it if there was a check box or something in the graphics menu.
---
You’re absolutely fine to keep playing. It’s a very slow paced game and there are certainly tons of people you’re ahead of. 
---
I took a few days off work and my main goal was hitting level 12 and working on engineering/mining. 
---
I might suggest joining a guild. It helps to have a network of people u can ask questions to and a lot of people will be inclined to help you, if it’s an active guild, which is likely since classic just released. 
---
Hope that helps but don’t feel hopeless! The game is going to have many people leveling alt characters so you’re sure to run into people to quest with.
---
There are three types of territories: Horde, Alliance and Contested.
---
If you are in your own territory e.g. Alliance (or Horde), you will always be safe in Alliance (or Horde) territory unless you turn on your PvP flag (/pvp or attack a player within 30mins~). This is true for both PvP/PvE servers.
---
The difference is when you get to "Contested" territories, on PvE shards you have to activate your PvP flag in order for someone to attack you. This means you can quest in Ashenvale or Wetlands and there's no way any horde will ever be able to attack you as long as you don't flag yourself for PvP.
---
On PvP servers, you automatically get flagged for PvP in contested territories, so you can get attacked at any time by the opposing faction.
---
Any chance I could get a link to a working trinket menu addon you're using there? I've tried 3 versions now with no luck somehow, while all other addons work flawlessly.
---
ohhhhh, i had no idea. thanks
---
Meanwhile I hit 30 in 3 days and I'm losing the will to live.
---
No problem man, yeah that’s exactly the use of it. As you get higher levels you’ll get more stealth only spells
---
I’m saving all my Twink items to do exactly this. Investment 101
---
Just hold this agony and corruption as I walk away
---
This, wtf? 1 dungeon run is enough to say it's a negative experience? I've been corpse camped (killed 5+ times consecutively) probably 20 times so far. I've been kicked mid dungeon just because someone wanted their friend to come. I've had a group ninja a BoE for a friend that they wanted to get, and I farmed the dungeon about 30 times for it. And I consider this an average experience.
---
 You win some you lose some. 1 dungeon, this guys in for a hell of a ride.
---
Oh, you mean Deep Space Nine!
---
It's how they do (or used to do it) in retail. You were able to turn on and off the new models.
---
True all the way.
---
Its how it should be.
---
No attendance here and I was there like 30 minutes early. Post is just a joke but people gonna have opinions I suppose :).
---
But the iron giant sacrifices himself 🤔
---
In hillsbrad there is a farm that is the major place to finish quests, you can aoe grind pretty easily there and can get cloth - it is super cheap on the AH as well though
---
Same level as me but you got there a full day quicker. Well done.
---
Turn up your Sound Channels.
---
Can you rename guilds?
---
Im a Latin american player in the Incendius realm and even my latin american guild does not speak spanish in there, neither do i lol
---
Seriously I pay for my landscaping rofl.
---
I’m wondering that myself
---
Group today asked me to use sunset armour. Unbeknownst to them I was it just keeps missing
---
2 points isn't that bad. Swap over and start using the frost guides.
---
Respec when you need to later on. It is not that big of a deal.
---
&gt;I will ever only wear clothes I made from leather skinned from my own mob kills. For weapons, rings, amulets and trinkets, I am only allowed to wear what I loot or bought from vendors.
---
Meet Skinletics, my leathetworking-locked ultimate ironman.  After recently maxing my retail account, I decided to up the ante - to forge my own journey from scratch.  No quest rewards, no auction house, but this time I can't leave the Barrens. All leading up to eventually taking on one of WoW's biggest challenges, hitting level 60 in less than 6 months.
---
I've always mained a rogue, and plan on leveling a shadow priest after I hit 60 for pvp. I have too much of a guilty conscience to play a rogue like everyone else. Sure, I'll participate in world pvp and everything, I just feel way too bad if I'm killing someone trying to level up.
---
Plus, that graveyard is REALLY FAR AWAY.
---
Some are, but only because they smell like cabbage.
---
My cat passed away this past weekend.  We had her for 15 years.  Im 24 now, so you can imagine how devastated I was.   I took Tuesday off work to play the full first day of classic wow, and ended up spending a lot of time with my cat - she would sit on my lap, rub my chair for attention, jump on my desk. I never thought that a week later she would be gone.  They are really good companions - I hope you develop a great, loving relationship with yours.  They are only here for a part of your life, but you are their entire life.  Cheers.
---
Auctionator or auctioneer are nice auction house addonss
---
I never said you don't want a slow main hand, but Fury doesn't have any instant weapon attacks regardless.  The only instant attacks are all independent of weapon damage.  It doesn't matter like it does for other classes.
---
Oh that makes sense, thanks. i think i'm going to switch to a non pvp realm because all the zones with quests for my level are just full of horde and i can't do anything, like i'd fight them but its groups of 3 when theres 0 alliance its weird
---
Pretty sure blizzard didn't anticipate the popularity of classic and expected most people to come back to retail. They were serious about "You think you do but you don't." They were not prepared for this kind of a response at all.
---
Was in Thousand Needles today killing mobs and questing with a few Horde earlier today. Neither of us attacked the other. It felt so refreshing to have a mutual, unspoken respect for each other. To the friendly horde in Thousand Needles on Herod, your heroism will be sung for generations to come.
---
/salute
---
Then came Skyrim...
---
Could we do this somehow on a console?
---
Agreed. I was a very hardcore player in wow vanilla. I started my Warrior journey again and just recently decided to sit it out this time as hard as that decision was, it's for the better.
---
Despite the fact that you’re horde scum, you’ve made the right choice. Back in the day, DPS would either wait for the tank to get 2 sunders up or they would use only single-target DPS onto the tanks target. 
---
There was also this weird thing called CC. But I might be misremembering...
---
Wrath and later expansions have conditioned players to go nutz with the AoE. It’s making Classic tanking more difficult.
---
But why are you putting so much blame on the specifically, in a vacuum? I just get the feeling it's easier for you to think this way than to be compassionate and help them. Or to at least have the mindset to do so.
---
Excuse me but what add on do you use to get the portraits in the center like that? Thanks
---
I Need money.
---
You're right -- nice catch.
---
My only other guess is that the eye texture (the small image that decides the dwarves eye-color) was supposed to have a transparency mask that removed the black, but the mask didn't render (or was accidentally omitted).
---

Is this an out of season April fool's joke?
---
Prime que time in que window, they are hoping people make snap decisions.
---
Just wait until you get into the stance change macros that auto equip shields for shield bash and spell reflect
---
So this sounds like it was written to prevent services like GeForce NOW and some of the other ones that have cropped up from hosting WoW.
---
This also would not be considered “third party” as the TOS is between you, and blizzard Activision.  Youd be the first or second party in the agreement(I believe, IANAL). There have been similar loopholes with game cheats where you are forced to add to the code and compile it yourself, making it your own software.
---
Valve is not hosting your game, you are, you’re merely using steam link as a control scheme.
---
If you went ahead and paid me $20 a month to run WoW in a VM and provide you access to the VM, that would be against the TOS.
---
But can we play wow in lecture ON meth? 🤔
---
As someone who recently developed wrist issues from not taking care of my wrist while gaming, that was one of the first things I thought of.
---
Yep except for the one tiny miniscule difference that the mountain takes massive effort and conditioning and WoW is done from a chair in a house.
---
Something was wrong with my game because I left it for 3.5 hours at least and I was at the same spot. I restarted the game and then the queue moved along quickly and I got in.
---
You just have to learn how to control your agro. I recommend installing an agro meter. That will let you know how close you are to pulling a mob. 
---
At your level tanks don't have all of their AoE moves. That means it's harder for them to hold agro on multiple mobs. To be honest give the tank a bit more time before you AoE but at your level it's going to happen if you use blizzard or flamestrike.
---
Difference is you're showing some hot undead cleavage
---
Ptch black movie theater vs a well lit class already filed with screens and bright lights.... ok

The AH is actually a gold sink.  The fees disappear from the economy.

Blizzard should be known for never being prepared.
---
your safe word is \*stop\* ??
---
Stalagg, affliction.
---
The issue isn't you. The issue is your group immediately trying to slam ass when you pull. Unlike in retail threat is actually kinda hard to maintain in classic and it's possible to pull if you just ape out.

We all do, bubby.

Ok, tyvm.

You are definitely whining. But the free transfers start "soon".

They may have hit the number of servers they need. Netherwind just hit med pop yesterday evening. It's been such a shitshow it's going to be difficult to really tell until people stop queueing up and log into the other servers instead.

And not everyone wants to heal dungeon

Oh... omen threat meter

imagine replying to 2 month old threads

You sum this up pretty damn well. When I read the OP my first thought was, "I can see what they mean."

Now this is a guild i can get behind

If I had my way I would make judgment of Justice taunt and exorcism have half dmg half Mana cost but work on everything thing.
---
Very nice
---
Vanilla didn't have lighting, water or shadows like this. It can be quite the contrast to the old vanilla textures and low polygon models.
---
They honestly need to upgrade all the graphics and just keep the core gameplay.
---

If it's anything like Vanilla it will be skewed in the Alliances favour. Horde had smaller but more organized pops. Time will tell though, since ATM most of the pops are kinda concentrated in low level areas ATM.
---
I have so many stories i keep talking about what me and my friend used to do in wow. So many great memories.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
Anyone know of an addon that replaces the default classic UI with the improved retail default UI? It is very similar to classic but looks a lot cleaner.

Exactly, ffs look at the number of servers they made for name registration.

Not whining at all, just very annoyed with the current situation.

thats a very important part, a point to point vpn used by RDP/steamstream/ect is NOT allowing a third party server to access any wow infomation.

Layering only prevents people being able to see another player until you join another group, and get put into their layer if they're not in your current layer. Layering has nothing to do with what AH prices are currently at. Yes the OP stated that several guilds could farm and over saturate the market when the

Sounds like the people you were with were the assholes, TBH.
---
I wouldn't kick somebody without saying anything, that's shitty retail lfg behavior
---
Maybe BRD or upper/lower black rock spire? Point being is you gave him false info on fire spec because resistances are a thing in this game now which will greatly impact your damage and if your shit damage you will get booted from groups.
---
Pardon?
---
Rage just gets transferred to you IRL. The universe is balanced.
---
Not to sound like a dick, but you have to learn to deal with it if you are going to be pugging. It's going to happen again, and again. As long as you didn't purposely fuck up for being careless or not giving a shit then just realize you grouped with a bad bunch and just move on. There will be assholes that will ninja and laugh in your face, there will be leaders that change to master loo without warning and take all your shit. You'll be kicked because their friend wants to come. That's just what happens in this game. There is a large sense of community in the game and tons of nice players, that is true, but when you venture out to group with unknowns you never know what you are going to get.

how did you get the old school water back?

Great point. I didn’t even know about the addon until today, and I bet it was under blizz’s radar ad well.

*licks your ear while you’re trying to sleep*
---
It’s self-control, bro.
---
Whats mp5?
---
wow if only there was someone who warned about THIS EXACT THING three months ago
---
ahh okay i did not even know that was a thing!
---
He has more important shit to do. Like figuring out how to play WoW Classic on his phone. ^^^/s
---
beautiful read
---
I am not asking to change the class, I just want to get advice on how to tank
---
Forcing myself to go to get off after like 50hrs over the 3 day weekend I had was a fight, but I had college and work.
---
definitely lag as it happens even when im far away and just entering combat
---
QuestWatchFrame. Hold alt to move
---
You realize WoW is an mmo  and not a skill based game in any way right? More time invested generally means a stronger character, so if someone has played more than you they have an advantage in power.
---
Plenty of people still pay others to mow their lawn. Had some kid make his own business with everyone on my street as his customers.
---
That is super helpful, thank you for clearing that up. now if only i can figure out how to make these dang controls work...
---
Works great, thanks! :)
---
I was in the cave but couldnt open the boxen :/
---
31 now
---
I just wait till i get my mount and try again
---
It's funny because cleave actually only hits 2 targets and makes for terrible aoe damage.
---
Thanks sir
---
That doesn't let you see the data yet tho, right?
---
Please, netherdrake took work.  So much god damn work.
---
Or to be safer from gankers and so you can pick and choose your fights 
---
As a rogue before honor system I don’t see a point in starting trouble
---
No Way...

---
After level 10, hunters are using their bow/gun 99% of the time, Their melee weapons are only there to provide bonus stats, and hunters do not need +15 strength.
---
if you chose a class with heals you'll pretty much be 3 people, 1dps/heal, 1dps and 1tank.
---
If you chose a mage you'll be aoe grind gods
---
just off the top of my head.
---
That's great advice.
---
You will too. MCP isn't something you typically level with. It's more like an end game consumable.
---
Why would Blizz care when a third party addon is causing it. It’s not their fault it happened and they shouldnt offer you a free reset. Update details.
---
Hope you or your broker adjusted for STI in a &lt;10% turnover by Q4 or you’re completely fucked anything over base pps lmfao.
---
Clearly. Your original comment is stating basic ass warlock strat that anyone can figure out. Dot and fear, no way! What a crazy strat! That's some rank 1 glad stuff right there buddy. Then you get massively triggered by an addition to your comment lol 
---
Oh and rank 13 just means you afk grinded bg's. Not sure who you're trying to impress with that statement. Quite literally anyone can get rank 13 if they play the game enough.
---
Thanks, gonna switch out the gloves for this
---

Is the 1 percent crit worth more than 4 agi and the other stats?
---
What is your solo rotation you are using?
---
Awesome thanks for the information!
---
How did you get my combat logs?
---
Missing lower jaw master race.  I have yet to meet another undead with their tongue just slappin around , i love it .
---
You can switch back and forth between stances.
---
Is it stupid to have one Alli mage and one Horde hunter? I want the experience of each side and I also like both gnome mages and enjoy the hunter. Might roll a shaman or paladin as an alt down the line.
---
Just feels weird since my mage COULD give a hunter on the alli side gold and such. But Hunters and Mages happen to be good at making gold so I figure those would be the two best starting classes for each side to set up further alts for some better success.
---
Bugger off.
---
Soon, you will regret it.
---
Thanks for the info! I do have a wand but it’s not as good as that one, so once I can I will do that quest!
---
I would punch a baby if it meant my wife would play with me.

Welp, not in sweden. But hey, America is America, where people try to make a career out of something said in drunken stupor.

same IRL, I'd imagine, he makes money playing video games, and a lot of it, don't get me wrong, i'm jealous as fuck
---
Alliance side I find low 20s to be really tough. Redridge/Duskwood/Wetlands +dungeon quests is too many
---
they can have fun with their fire hazard campfires while we sit in front of our cozy brick fireplaces.

Shadowmeld and wait for some sucker to come and aggro them then ninja it

Me a Warrior and my Priest friend fought our way into a mine in Silverpine.. a guy comes up and starts mining my tin... told the priest to fear the mobs and I took the second harvest of the node.. buddy who tried to sneak the node got mad at me.
---
Thanks for the advice! Should I get the 5/5 as quickly as possible?
---
Thalnos is full and has queues and isn't getting a fresh server.  I don't see why this is so hard to understand.
---
A bad name among who? I was in the back row, the lecture hasn't started and I am playing it with earphones. The only person who knew I was playing was my friend next to me and she had a laugh too.
---
is there a Side by side comparison? I didnt even really notice the retail ui was that much different other than the calendar.
---
I pretty much said that
---
Its Details.
---
The fact this is on an RP server makes me wish I had time to RP two gnomes in a trenchcoat pretending to be an elf.
---
You guys all have phones right?
---
All of my wpvp experiences so far have been like vanilla: groups of higher level (4+) players end up destroying me or I end up winning 1v1 against people around my level. The former is whatever, I usually laugh unless it's some dumb shit like killing me while doing an escort. The latter is my jam though, those 1v1 skirmishes are super fun. If you don't wanna deal with this then just play on a pve server, there's nothing wrong with that and you can still queue for BGs when they come out.
---
Hes really just desperate to come up with a reason to hate gnomes. They are just so cute and cuddly, how can you be mad at them?
---
Perhaps you missed all the comments on here saying they have the issue with no addons installed?
---
Hunters have a bad reputation for being noobs, dating back to original release
---
Obviously not every hunter is a baddie but some people aren't great at discernment and condemn them all, sorry for that
---
Send the Imp to his death against a bear, grab the Peacebloom, leave the useless little fuck to his fate.
---
Good reminder. Arcane will be where most of the dps comes from in that build, but I probably won’t be able to support it mana-wise until BWL anyway.
---
Can verify. All warriors deserve wisp form.
---
Context here goes a long way tbh. I just posted for the joke :).
---
This was the first epic I got back in vanilla. Some cool dude just gave them to me and I was in awe. He said “it’s cool man, it’s just funny money” and it stuck with me ever since.
---
Worse is both rolling the same number and the other guy gets the loot.
---
yeah women are shallow because they care about height xD
---
You think they’ll add those to the game too? Maybe the next expansion, yeah? Rumor has it Illidan is coming back.
---
1. No, not really. It gets a little better once you have shadow form but really you're just a crappy warlock with no pet. 
---
2. As a priest, disc healing is waaay better for pvp. Shadow is ok, but just not nearly as good as other classes, mainly only used for mana regen. But dispel, pw: shield and heals are extremely good in pvp
---
Opps race, brain fart
---
A same level warrior killed me when I had just tapped to regain a full mana bar. I proceeded to camp him until he spirit rezzed, 4 run backs to the middle of STV later.
---
Fuck you
---
I'm a priest healer bro. Look at the flair.

Steamlink paunches steam in pig picture mode. You can then exit big picture or alt+tab to access the rest of the computer as if you were using a remote desktop. I actually did this a lot to stream netflix before I got a PS4 because I didn't have a smart tv or other means of streaming netflix to the living room.
---
No you don't.  Not when somebody else left one swing left.  Played vanilla ever?
---
one answer that was not given to you and as a fellow rogue player is in my opiton the way to go is to  create a macro for your sinister strike (or backstab) : 
---
 \#showtooltip Sinister Strike   
---
/startattack   
---
/cast Sinister Strike  
---
start training yourself to use the Tab button to target , its saves time over clicking and its much easier to find a specific target when theres a lot of aggroed enemy
---
then you can just spam your sinister strike and it will auto attack
---
also as a rogue if you are waiting to have the energy to then press sinister strike, you are doing it wrong. you basically want to mash that button ( #2 for me) all the time so that as soon as you have enough energy it you do a SS, sometimes there is input delay/lag before you see the energy on the bar and then cast the attack  ( same reason a caster can start his next cast .5 seconds before his current cast is over)
---
What about blue eyes, white dragon?
---
Pretty sure there is a difference in armor stats between cloth and mail armor.
---
It's before the lecture started. I didn't play during it's all good.
---
While well known Blizzard still intends to ruin those of us already or NW with their migration
---
Lower level dungeons you can heal however as you progress to later dungeons, you will have a harder time healing then your holy and disc brothers.
---
Shadow priests in vanilla are pvp priests, most of the stuff they can do can eithe be covered by a holy priest or warlock.
---
In pve you may get spots as a dps as you can help increase shadow damage but I don't believe shadow priests do well in vanilla pve as (I was looking to confirm) they do not restore group mana, which I believe happened for them in burning crusade, which is when they really shined as they became portable mana batteries.
---

I posted below you can actually use a USB OTG cable to get full mouse and keyboard functionality, or pair a Bluetooth m/k

What do you think would have happened without layering?
---
I don’t even know what you’re talking about, sorry :/
---
If you have a subscription and click PLAY from [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), you shouldn't even see a login screen when the game launches.
---
How is it gatekeeping literally in the slightest? It sounds like OP was being slightly pushy about doing a faster run without having asked anyone else.
---
Wait this is GENIUS. Even for ganking, although that’s a little dirty
---
Yea, I do this too. Wife plays alongside as a hunter. At this point though she never seems to have mana issues
---
Theres no misinformation. It's a fun build
---
If you want to experience both factions, you'll have to start from scratch on both at some point. No reason for those classes to be worse choices than any others.
---
That happened to me last night in RFK over the mail helm. If it was the 2H i would've killed myself instantly...
---
Lol, not worried about getting fired but worried about the ban??
---
Pick the talent Wand Specialization first and once you have 5 ranks into that, then pick up Spirit Tap and max that talent out.
---
You want the best way and you can afford, with the wand talent you will do more damage with wands than with spells.
---
Place Power Word Shield on yourself before a fight. Pull the enemy with Mind Blast and cast Power Word Pain right away. After that just wand like no tomorrow until target is dead.

Same thing happened to me and we realized it’s the snakes and critters in there. In our group we had our Druid and warriors using demoralizing shouts and roars. It’d hit the snacks but wouldn’t kill them and it was what was keeping us in combat. Make sure to kill those critters
---
What are you using to get that over lay controller??
---
Open a ticket about your ticket, so you can ticket while you ticket
---
I play undead priest and I feel the same way, a mother fucker dedicated his whole living life to prayer and discipline and to gain health back, I eat people?
---
That was also a huge upgrade for the hunter +15sta +6agi is nothing to sneeze at. Every class always have better use of stats than hunter except bow. He wouldnt be able to roll on anything at all anymore. That's just stupid.

I'm a big fan of /fart before and after I gank them. Nothing is more embarrassing than getting farted on after dying
---
Strange, when I was studying medicine papers at Uni we had multiple classes reiterating how incredibly bad it was for the body to be overweight, and the damage being done by the slow, constant accumulation of body fat.
---
Guess it all got outdated in just a few years though :&lt;

what lvl is arathi highlands?
---
I don't know how I found out about the Ctrl Click back then, but I do remember being a Huntard who chose his gear based on how it looked. I didn't really look at the armor type, the armor value or the actual stats. If I could wear it, I would, as long as it looked cooler than what I was wearing.
---
I did this earlier today, /cast !shoot, stops it being toggle-able. Makes life easier.
---
I used to pally tank endgame 5mans back in 1.12.  Fewer wipes than I had healing pug warriors, though that says more about pug skills back then.
---
Timed strat is probably out of reach without some raid gear, though.
---
"balanced"
---
I remember waiting a year for the shaman "rework" only to find out that we basically never get it, we got a half ass garbage one, someone told the shaman CM to get hit by a bus, it sucked https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shaman-class-overhaul-moved-to-tbc-bus-shock-incident/168403

So yeah they really didnt do a good job of balancing

There's a "new meta" that many players seem to stroking eachother off over, and that is dungeon spam. These people want to get to 60 asap and that is their only goal. 
---
You made the unfortunate mistake of getting into a group who wanted to run the dungeon that way. Try to find groups who want to do dungeons the proper traditional way and you'll have a better more laid back experiance.

My fondest memory from vanilla was joining an RP guild of paladins who took me on this quest, illy in character. :’) good times.

This time I’m rolling Druid. Their class quests are pretty meh, TBH, but I’m really enjoying the ability to change forms.
---
Lol her name backwards is karen
---
I like the way you're sexualised but not overly detailed
---
look at his profile, its pretty sad
---
I would bitch at the kids playing startcraft keeping high apm but I have no issues with this. I would much rather watch you grind mobs than learn about world.
---
i will try that,  is it just called fastloot?
---
♪ Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind...
---
Sure they can. They just need to save more than they spend. It's easy.
---
How are people able to bitch about this too? It's good news, and they're doing it the right way.
---
I'd still play it, but I'm a MtG, Path of Exile, DotA, League of Legends player so I'm used to new content / balance patches drastically shifting a meta. Good players will always adapt.
---
Yes, rogues are great, but only if you'll also be doing some solid pvp where they really shine. They are great dps in raids but not as valuable as mages or locks for 5 mans.
---
EVERY class has places it is more or less desired. Make your decision based on which is most fun to play, you'll get groups either way.
---
Let’s look at it this way. People who play video games and are conditioned for the grind will still find it tough and exhausting but can get it down and feel proud of the effort 
---
The gamer equivalent comparison would include someone already conditioned or athletic Climbing a 12k’er, that’s what I was going for. 
---
Someone that is mildly athletic can climb a 12k’er first try, but it’s hard and exhausting. Besides some soreness though they won’t encounter much trouble, but it is still dangerous, not enough water, food, or too much weight to carry with less oxygen. 
---
A conditioned gamer will get to 60, but it is exhausting, it’s 11 hours plus grind some times, there’s soreness, but you feel accomplished after you are done. (In terms of just getting to 60 quickly)
---
Someone who is new to gaming would likely quit at level 20 or 30 because you aren’t leveling every hour or less now. So you have to get past the mental fatigue and keep grinding. Which is exactly what you have to do with hiking. One foot in front of the other, keep trekking, take breaks when you can. Get to the top, see the view, than hike back down. 
---
Not all new gamers would quit early, and the accomplishment isn’t in terms of physical conquest, but personal goal conquest. It’s just something I felt when you see people playing the first day of release and playing for 24 hours straight. It’s that kind of stuff that needs preparation and stuff.
---
Honor? It's a video game lmao. Roll PvE if you don't wanna get ganked.
---
Reporting someone for this is just sad though.
---
So no one is going to notice that the numbers turn out to be 69-420?
---
This is some serious alliance skill. You all are very good to flee. Every alliance player I try to kill flee. Even if they are higher level. Just what the fuck. Why didnt you fight back? Die with honor rather than live without. 
---
This is war and you are hilarious. 
---
With my 2 friends level 31, we killed multiple groups of 3-4 alliance player with an average level of 34. Most of them flee when we arrive so it turns to a 3v1 or 3v2 match up, but we finally find the coward toward the alliance guards. Pathetic. We still try to kill them and sometime suceed before wiping by guards.
---
God I want to play to get void elf heritage, but after playing Classic its been hard playing normal again for some reason

Just copied your macros and they're working great,  only trouble i had was with the Cat macro, where i would just cancel cat form and recast it, instead of casting prowl.

The stances used in this one is incorrect and do not refer to Cat Form, which is why i just looped on recasting cat form. Change the \[nostance:3\] and \[nomod,stance:3\] to \[nostance:2\] and \[nomod,stance:2\] and it works fine.

as my guilds healer, they usual let me have dibs if i REALLY need it, but i am so sorry the rolling system wronged you haha
---
Oh that's a shame. Maybe it's a good game but I'm new to MMORPGS and I'm not so sure if I will enjoy it, that's why a free trial would be perfect. Even a free trial of 2 hours to test controls and basic combat would be enough.
---
You need a CD/DVD reader. A relic from ancient times. Ask you elders for one. They migth have one somewhere, next to other relics of ancient times. Like a floppy disc reader

The worst is when youre doing a drop quest in a group.  And once one guy gets his he drops and the party leader adds someone else who also needs the drops.  Get a chain of these and you feel like youll never get there

Pretty bad that they kicked you wiyhout explaining. For all they know, you could have been checking to link items and call for roll

Where are you farming 100g in 10 hours?

New Talents/Skills = new builds/rotations become viable = old items might fade in or out of popularity

oh trust me...ive been using fear very creatively
---
You wouldn’t happen to know how many layers there are per server? Probably varies for full to medium servers, but do we have rough numbers?
---
ohhh i think i did notice that once when i looted a box that's pickpocket only
---
They can be frustrating but overall I really enjoy the dungeons of old.  
---
Some of them like BRD, Sunken Temple, Strat, etc are a zone/region unto themselves and warrant multiple visits, with lots of little secrets to unfold.  You don’t really see this anymore.  
---
I can definitely see how some folks would get bothered by this, especially if they have played a lot more retail where they’re basically dungeons on rails that you fly through, but I find it refreshing, and they’re one of the reasons I have come back.
---
yes they are , but until you reach like level 25 ish its going to be a pain to level up a rogue , if you pull more then 1 enemy you will more than likely die but as long as you can avoid that , its easy peasy ... spam sinister strike , use eviscerate , bandage up , repeat
---
or they have 4 ppl oon the way.
---
my buddy and i won a 2v3 in shimmering flats, 5 mnutes later they had the whole gang

lol. a lot of the time at work i just sit here at a computer. its a shared computer so cant install/download anything. but i could do remote desktop easily lol
---
I always ask the tank beforehand if I can put my growl on autocast. So if he loses agro, at least the mob will turn to my pet and not to a squishy. Sometimes, they wont mind, especially if they're masters at agro. And I will turn it off by request.

Just b.c you never leave the computer or do anything doesn't mean everyone else does the same.

I can only find information about free character transfers from overpopulated realms to lower pop/empty/new realms, do you know anything about free character transfers from low pop realms? I'm concerned that if I pick a medium/low population realm it will be a ghost town in a few weeks.

Then stop perpetuating the myth that being overweight doesn't damage your body, or that fat people arehealthy.

Chest loot is usually pretty petty, if I see other players nearby I usually let them have it. Sometimes I ask if they got anything good. Sometimes I get to it first and share a potion.

Play how you wanna play man. You don't have to follow a guide. I'm playing a warrior and planning on leveling as fury once I hit 20. Every guide says Arms spec is the best but I really couldn't care.
---
The truth of it is, getting to 60 is going to take a long time regardless of your spec. It can be made faster but why sacrifice enjoyment of your class for the sake of leveling 10% faster?
---
And the corpse in the background lul
---
Eh, for ganking it’s not like they won’t know someone is there. I think in that case it would be better used fearing them into other mobs while dropping dots on em.
---
Thank you bro! I really am!
---
If you care about PVP at all in my opinion you have to main Orc. Hardiness their racial passive gives them a 25% chance to resist ALL stuns. This is in addition to the base 5% chance granted to all races: giving Orcs a total of 30% stun resist chance.
---
CC wins fights. Hardiness is almost impossible to turn down.
---
That being said every race has it's own niche. Maybe you care more about asthetic than PVP.
---
&gt;  I just get the feeling it's easier for you to think this way than to be compassionate and help them. 
---
Who said I'm against helping these people? The first step to helping someone overcome a problem like this is having them admit there is a problem and take responsibility for that problem. You will not fix overeating by blaming your problems on genetics, society, etc. You fix these problems by taking control of your life and realizing that you are your own problem.
---
icy-veins.com They have everything
---
It's bad advice because you don't know what you are talking about and giving bad asvice. The system requirements of a game doesn't mean if a pc meets those it will run the game good. A $250 laptop could hardly run a browser game let alone wow classic.
---
&gt; In other words: this "feature" costs inventory space, time and quest log space. And it definitely wasn't around in vanilla.
---
Always keep a low rank frostbolt on your bar. Keep them slowed and kite away.
---
Wouldn't you put the orc on a lower layer and make the center of the 'frame' transparent?

How long have you watched Asmongold for?
---
Just need on epics in dungeons, if someone is actually gonna use it let them /roll after.
---
My favorite thing is getting ganked by a full party, but that full party has to quest where you died. I just spawn and run in as a Priest or Warrior and fear them all like a ghost that's come back to haunt them.
---
Sometimes they even get feared into mobs and die.

German servers are pretty full at the moment, with the biggest ones having long queues during prime time. They keep opening new servers though, and also brought free transfers for one of them, so if you want to give it a go, pick one of the newer servers that isn't full yet. Seriously. I'm on Everlook, one of the initial few servers, and my group and I log into the queue hours before we want to do dungeon runs via remote control on our phones.

THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED, IT WAS MOST INFORMATIVE. SAFE TRAVELS, FRIEND.

The lighting engine in this game is fantastic. I really loved playing on a 1.12 client on pservers to get that true vanilla look, but this is an acceptable change.

Yes of u went arms spec. If not just stay in defensive  and use blood rage and walk in. Pop a rage potion if you need it on a big pack and you are on cool down or rage starved.

While levelling don't even worry about armor or hp stats. I tend to wait till I'm a level or 2 over the dungeon minimum to tank and being human using swords is a massive massive help.
---
But are you leveling as a healer it's harder to quest when specced into healing trees at least for me
---
Oh i know that, its just I didnt know if the skills in that tree would make such a minor difference vs the other two/I would make questing more frustrating for myself by going that route
---
Hey man you made it this far lol. Have faith!
---
Combat is the go-to for leveling since you aren’t in stealth all that often. You wanna just be grinding along, picking up mobs with minimum downtime. If you prefer the class fantasy and big openers, feel free to go sub. It’s just not practical for leveling since it’s hard to backstab solo or find decent daggers that keep up with your level. But that’s the beauty of classic, pick what you want!
---
5/5 wand, 5/5 spirit tap, 3/5 focus, 2/2 imp pain are the core talents. After that you can basically do whatever you want.
---
As would I brother, as would I.
---
That's why the trick is to actually go to bed with them, but then train your brain to wake up at 3-4am so you can sneak out
---
I still have nightmares of the SL/SL locks in BC. Jesus those fuckers just didn't like dying.
---
I'm impressed you are able to play disembodied. If you could teach me that would be awesome! I'd let my body sleep and play all night!!!!
---
I’m a holy pally so I’ve only had trouble with all undead and troll rogues and shadow priests Tauren leave me alone
---
I'm nodding yes to my PM's retarded requirements, but mentally i'm in the Barrens.
---
True, I just didnt know if I would hardcore handicap myself to the point of it being less fun to play
---
Yup warlock chiming in here too, this has been perfect rotation for me as well.
---
&gt; Literally the first second he saw the warrior he had plenty of time to prepare for what's about to happen. He saw the warrior and should have sacrificed his void immediately

In the original release, windfury proc animation was very very subtle.

Seems like you didn't play in vanilla if you think any of that sounds implausible.  Servers weren't that big.  You ran into the same people all the time.
---
Thanks for the info! Definitely checking this out.

Better than 98% of wow streams!

Cringey twitch slang in wow...sad!

Even better do this:

    #showtooltip Rend
---
    /startattack
---
    /cast Rend
---
This is correct.
---
Yep! [This has been a blizzard thing from their RTS days.](https://youtu.be/n8H2MWHfqDA)
---
I would drop skinning and go with Alchemy.
---
Leatherworking is full of recipes nobody wants, even yourself – the recipes that take the leather you have are for 5-8 levels below you, and you usually have better by the time you can make them. It's the worst tradeskill from a money perspective, except for Enchanting (unless you take Tailoring to go with it, and then you still lose out on AHing the cloth you collect).
---
Alchemy will help you level, basically turning you into a 2-3 level higher version of yourself (assuming you use elixirs regularly). Also there are a few recipes that are always in high demand, and making and selling a lot of those will generally mean Alchemy makes you money, not loses it. Alchemy is the worst tradeskill from an endgame perspective though, since except for a few very rare recipes anything you make can be made by someone else and traded to you, and you miss out on the BOPs that are found in Tailor/LW/Blacksmith. Herbalism can be a timesink as well, though certain herbs will always be in demand. It also is of less value until your server economy matures, since the high-value consumables you make will be lower value simply because there is less money sloshing around.
---
All this exists?
---
Yup. Dodge this spot.... that spot.... skip the 4th stair from the bottom, etc. Can do that shit blindfolded now
---
250 dollar laptops do a lot more than they used to.. Classic wow on lower settings can be run on most current generation PCs and laptops. I for one think his advice was a lot better than your advice.
---
I hate to break it to you but it probably will always be a thing now. The only reason it won’t be is if someone’s farming a specific piece of gear
---
Did you stay in the forest, killing boars?
---
Bags and buff don’t line up. 2/10
---
"/s Fuck off." Is an appropriate response. Had to say it to someone who tried to sneak a chest I was working towards. Fortunately, they backed away.
---
I would go 5/5 spirit tap and then into wand spec. I agree with above to respec shadow at 40. What level are you now?
---
I am not sure what the hell I just watched
---
Its what keeps DOTA so fresh all the time
---
it's names is **ELVUI!!!**

Yeah mind flay mind flay then wand

Thanks buddy!  I was wondering about this the other day!

If you want to experience the game from both sides, why not? They are great solo classes

When you're pet is bestfriend it literally doesn't matter what level of food you give, you rarely have to give it anything unless you die a lot. Even then, food doesn't matter this much when you're pet levels up and loyalty is high.
---
You only have to feed it a bunch in the beginning.
---
yea im not 6'5" lol, i thought they were fine, i have a friend who has one and loves it but hes like 5'8" they do have a taller back so it may work for you more vs some others
---
why cant you?
---
Yeah I don’t remember those being in classic
---
Brilliant! I've followed and look forward to more! I'll share as much as i can 👍

Download that and then it’s pretty straight forward from there.

[Lesser Magic Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11287/lesser-magic-wand)  is a 11dps Wand at level 5.  Sells on my server for about 5silver. That’s nutty, just so you know.
---
A warrior can get [Axe of Orgrimmar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15424/axe-of-orgrimmar) after doing the quest chain to go into RFC, which they won’t do until at least lvl 13.
---
But at level 13, a priest can get [Greater Magic Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288/greater-magic-wand)  which does 17dps. Add points into wand specialization on top of that, and you’re wand alone is doing over 20dps.
---
Wands are stupid good for casters, and especially priests early on. Is it a little boring? Yeah, it can be. But it makes you very mana efficient, and allows you to never have to stop to drink. If a mob breaks your Power Word: Shield, you tank the damage and wand it until dead, toss a heal on yourself, start on the next mob. Nearly zero downtime, unless you go ham or pull like 3 mobs.
---
I thought they already did it, considering it's 4:00pm and no queue.
---
Why not just roll on pve if you want to play like this?
---
That’s why I solo those ones. Otherwise I’ll party up quick. I like my xp and not sharing. But I gives that makes sense with my flair XD
---
nice

Ah, if only even half of partners could be evenly matched in desire for that.

You probably shouldn't be using multishot every encounter. Some abilities only call for specific scenarios.

I have an Asus ROG G531GT and it runs classic fine. I can go up to level 10 and get around 100 FPS. It has a 9th Gen i7 and a GTX 1060. I think any laptop built within the last 3-4 years will run Classic Wow just fine. I paid $850 USD a few weeks ago during a back to school sale. It retails for $1000.00 USD. SO not sure what it would be in your country.
---
Not like we havent seen this coming
---
doesn't that defeat the purpose though? i mean.. i get where you're coming from... but lets keep classic, classic.
---
This is why, back in the day, we had a STRONG hatred for the other faction. This is also why stormwind and ironforge got locked and we were handed a cease and desist order, Do.Not.Kill.Our.Lowbies.Or.You.Will.Suffer.
---
It's possible to meet women through WoW. Stay hopeful.
---
There are 6 priest help questions on the new page. Google a guide.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
As a night elf Warrior he's going to die a lot.
---
Well, I’ve got a consistent headache even after medicine on this day, so I’d say it’s going pretty... zzzzzzzzzz
---
uh the AMA! i'm pretty sure the blizzcon panel mentioned it too.
---
I imagine there must be someway to build a macro, that has me announce to the group that I am charging, charge to %t, cast demo shout and then switch to defensive stance. Any chance you know if that is possible?
---
Do you have antialiasing already turned on?
---
Turn off all anti aliasing and set render scale to 100%. *Then* crank it up. It's like a much better way to handle aliasing, but it's gonna hit your performance harder.
---
 Some people roll need on every Blue BoE that drops, and especially any Epic, because it's always the assumption they'll be sold, not used. 
---
I don't play like that myself and I don't like it, but it makes sense, and if everyone does it, there's no risk of a ninja. 
---
The rule used to be that if you need on a BoE you equip it straight away, so everyone can see you're legit. That's how I still play.
---
Had a similar thing yesterday in SFK with  the +12 spirit staff : the hunter rolled it against the priest and won. The priest was really about to leave the group if we didn't keep the hunt but I managed to keep him with us because of the perspective of cloth loots later on. Damn what a drama.
---
Ever go back and read your own post history?
---
Yeah, thats the dumbest fucking cringiest shit Ive ever read...
---
Technically, your crutches. Not mine.
---
Lmao I mean I dunno about gay but I'm not a fan of most retail content. Just my OCD going a little nuts than one class is missing lol.
---
It doesn't matter if they practiced or not, lol.
---
Think about it like this. Do you think it would even be possible to down any raid boss post cataclysm with characters that weren't max level, and wearing quest greens? Even if you practiced it for years?
---
The answer is no, not even close. Especially not the end boss. They practiced, they are good players, but the content is also very easy. 
---
OP is also talking about dungeons, not even raids. Every dungeon in classic is hilariously easy compared to any mythic dungeon in retail. Don't get me wrong, i'm loving classic, but it is in no way shape or form a difficult game.
---
Not in classic. But back in retail around WotLK time, my friend was in the same guild as someone on his wrestling team without them knowing. He said one of the many ridiculous jokes our coach would say, in guild chat, and they hit it off from there. 
---
Your situation is much more "the stars align perfectly" which is crazy cool. Like what are the fuckin chances.

Is felweed another name for devil's lettuce?

I had a friend in vanilla WoW that was top dps as shadowpriest most nights in raids

Maybe everyone else sucked. But my discipline- fear ward spam dwarf, enjoyed keeping him alive
---
When i first started playing WoW in '05 i had a ton of fun rolling alts but didnt get very far
---
In TBC i played only one character and got alot done but didnt have much fun
---
Then on PServers i played all the characters, got nothing done, and enjoyed the game like a noob again
---
Guess which ill be doing on WoW Classic
---
Bro who cares? Just move on and stop making alts to evade bans.
---
Never apologize for being helpful during a hurried poop.
---
How can you possibly know the material of the flooring from this grainy video?
---
Thats how I have been playing my priest.
---
Got the mandatory Wand Spec and spirit tap then put a couple more points in Shadow before going deep Disc for leveling. On a pvp realm certain skills become much more viable while leveling.
---
I will leave the cookie cutter builds for 60.
---
Because the axe is an icon and axes are more commonly good, so you don't mind speccing for it as much. Also, I'm leveling an orc, so the axe is strictly better for me.
---
Or stonetalon mountain if he's horde. And never stop pick pocketing humanoids

Then I shall ask : do you carefully chose your dress each time you use reddit ?

Nice to know, couldnt find the trainer so I thought it wasnt possible! Thanks
---
They don't need to resealth.  They just heavily out damage you and apply crippling so often that you can't escape.
---
It's not that hard to only sleep 5 hours a night for a week. What is hard is not doing anything else but play WoW for the rest of 19 hours.
---
Nope. 
---
Is what it is. Will balance out after P2.
---
You're a moron.
---
Personally as a healer, I just search for 4 dps at this point. it is way smoother.
---
Everything you said minus the higher res UI are already Addons. Nobody is going to make them into one addon.
---
UI thing probably won’t happen either, too much time/effort for a couple players’ visual gain.
---
oh wow. i didn't experience that!
---
waiting hours for a boat, only to miss it then having to wait more hours!
---
lmao frick the alliance
---
I'm not arguing otherwise.  My point is that broken tooth isn't massively better than the other pets out there.
---
Who. Cares.
---
A lot of us still think hunters are fun to play.
---
I don't see any leveling happening for a while without layers. STV is a hell to try get any kills in as all mobs are dead 24/7.
---
Lmfao  im a gnome rogue.  2 horde players at least lvl 40+ were running through loch Modan and they stopped. I did a dance for them and they both spit on me and laughed, I was just a lvl 16 or so lol
---
Yeah that's enough internet for one day thank you
---
I remember sitting in a CS lecture while the guy next to me had a bot farming his character through the ogres in Tanaris for him. I was jealous.
---
I actually think this would be cool as I've seen what the Old School Runescape team does and how the community votes on what should be implemented. There have definitely been some controversial updates but mostly I think it's a cool idea to add new content to these games.
---
Rerolled a 32 priest, I'm now a 25 mage 
---
I wouldn't be able to handle healing in raids it was driving me crazy enough at lower levels
---
Obviously the newer models are good, but I actually prefer the Classic models because they're more true to the Elves from WC3.
---
They're all pretty shitty.  10% more mana here, 10% cheaper there, it doesn't really make or break you at low levels.
---
Do you have some chat window tips to share?
---
Thank u so much man. I jist was worried I missed something... and I did. Twitch bought curse and made more.
---
For something so simple it really is special. STV is like a BG, Shimering flats is the arena.
---
Lol are you new to pc and pc gaming? A $250 might get you through the starter zone with zero ad ons and nothing else open on the pc accept wow
---
Tuen off the auto follow camera
---
This doesn’t sound right. I’ve healed dungeons without dealing damage and gotten xp. Got a source for that?
---
I have a sub $500 Asus laptop and it's runs Classic perfectly. You need next to nothing to run classic. If it was built after 2004, it'll run it I think.
---
I'm with you man. Another hour left at the office then I'm playing my first severl-hour-long WoW sesh for the first time since Sunday. I am SO excited. Only it's almost 100 degrees outside so there's no way I'm wearing sweatpants.
---
I just said you melee every mob mostly... Having a good weapon can save you if your pet dies or you get adds. Dead zone is real.

What do you mean in the short term? They have been dropping since wotlk

This is really cool! So ELI5. How do I make this script run as an addon?

https://i.imgur.com/d5pMuz2.png

My friend group did the same. Just plenty of moving around and energy drinks.

If steam has to run specific streaming software, and it can tell that WoW is what’s in focus, Agent probably has the capability to be trained to tell if you’re doing this.

“Ours is a cycle of hatred. Alliances forged and broken. We have paid the price for sharing this world, and we have forgotten what makes us strong” - Sombody who’s right.
---
it was, but that never happened though. You can jump players in all zones right now &amp; with the help of low lvls like posted in the img you can jump infinitely to farm mats.
---
More likely a multiboxer than a bot. Blizzard is tectonically ok with those.
---
Eh at lower levels it goes faster if a dps just rips aggro amd kills it anyway. As long as they aren't butching about it I think it's fine to just bust a nut on the mobs.
---
I don’t really like the BoA part personally but would love something like 200% faster rested xp gain once you have a 60. All your other points I can get behind
---
That's exactly what I have been thinking about the whole day. 
---
Yours is great too, imagine the low level awkwardness if one of them tried to sell the coaches jokes as his own
---
My server is on the list, and starting zones and regular zones are both not a problem.
---
I think you are just an entitled shit. Welcome to classic. Its not for everyone
---
Reputation scales pretty largely to your level (for questing) So I would say its a considerable chunk and worth the death run if the mount is worth it to you(it definitely is for me). It takes quite a bit more effort, time, and gold to reach exalted later on.
---
Ah the music..! Right in the feels 🥺
---
Yeah, I definitely agree to this. Whenever me and my friend kill someone in a bullshit way, we say things like “this guy going to write complains on wow forums now” which even thought of it makes us laugh.
---
You CST? I’ve been gettin on at 5 CST everyday with no queue (also level 30, dunno if blizzard gives priority based on level)
---
I've hit greed in that situation before multiple times. You just communicate with the people in your group. I was in a group as a Hunter with a Mage (?) back in the day (might have been Wrath?) just killing shit in some random zone when a BoE epic dropped. I checked with him before rolling if it would be an upgrade. It was something he would actually use and I couldn't, so I let him have it.
---
There have been other similar situations since then. Sometimes the other person even goes "Nah man you roll too" and we both Need. It's not difficult to just communicate when it drops or set a rule beforehand.
---
If you DO decide to both roll on something, always do it as Need so the other guy doesn't fuck you over though.
---
I try to set aside 2 hours a week for raiding with friends, and on weekends I'll play before the fiancee wakes up and make breakfast play when you can it's a game and now that vanilla is back it won't leave
---
Comes down to you as a person. Do you easily get addicted to things? If so then probably not best to play. For example i've been drinking and smoking for about 9 years now and alcoholism runs in my family. I however haven't had more than a couple beers for a year and have maybe a cigar every 2-3 months. In moderation everything is fine.
---
You heard her, fatty.
---
Yet you still die. So you know it’s coming but you simpletons still drop like a bag of anvils. I suppose you have to quest wearing bike helmets and aren’t allowed to use forks to eat your food.

Whats the point of Arathi Highlands as a solo Alliance player? Its labeled a 30-40 zone but I've been there twice as of level 37 and I've only been able to do like 5 quests there. It's so sparse besides a couple of elite quests I can't do alone and I'm not sure if I should just ignore it at this point and move onto Dustwallow/STV into Tanaris and Badlands
---
Hey man, some people care how their character looks to the point where if you aren't happy it starts to detract from the experience.
---
I used to do this on Quel'danas in BC.
---
Not sure if you actually can buff anyone after using MC on them, though... your action bars are replaced with theirs. You legit lose control of your character and fully take over the new one. 
---
When I used to do this I had my pally buddy with me. I'd drop MC and he'd buff them up.

I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.

No, I already have that. It lets you browse what specific bosses drop (and I don't think it gives %s anyway). I want something for when you have an _item_ and want to know what drops it, and how often. Preferably on a tooltip, but if I have to look it up in a separate window, fine.
---
It *sort of* works. Leeway is the thing that is stopping it from working as it should but it's still possible to hamstring and kite something, assuming it's base speed isn't crazy. It's nearly impossible to properly kite something like a Plainstriders that has high movement speed but it works well enough on humanoids that I have minimal downtime between pulls, as I should.
---
Better than I initially expected. AKA within 15seconds of launch. 
---
Random fact OSRS can barley run at 50FPS on it so that is why I’m concerned 😅
---
The horde are a plague on this land and must be purged.
---
Clearly it matters enough that you don't want transmog implemented.
---
Because it costs money? I think they do this on retail.
---
Twinking, RP-gear, someone with more gold than time who wants to shitstomp mobs quicker, someone who just doesn't know better, someone who thinks they can sell it even higher.
---
This is a cool idea.
---
If it’s an RP server it seems like it does generate rage for warriors.
---
Not the dog bro

Haven't played wow in years and want to give classic a shot, have the servers died down any or is there still a huge que to wait just to get in?

I'd love to see the one in Stonetalon Mountains where you help a troll with some things and he kills 3 night elves in cages and the wisps leave their bodies and leave the cave!
---
Retail is too much about the destination(reach max do content). Vanilla has hardly any sense of urgency, the journey makes it. It feels like your RPing even if your not. Retail is over saturated with "graveyard" xpacs. They been talking about level squishing, classics success is pretty much going to solidify that. Lets hope they do something good.
---
I've gotten really immersed in my warrior the same way you're talking about. I feel like going to the trainer is a treat, and I get these new abilities or learn to do the ones I have better. Quests make me feel like I get sent on these adventures where I have to travel to far away places to learn valuable skills and usually get nice equipment from the adventure. I like feeling as if this is concrete too. There's an end to classic, and you won't reasonable meet the end of it. It does exist, though.
---
Seriously?....
---
and if you only sit in the Goldshire inn as a night elf with no clothes on you can bet they'll know that too.
---
Oddly enough I couldn’t ever get this working on shadow because of the port 0 thing with steam but I could use my home PC.

Go away

What? Those things have nothing to do with eachother? You can think whatever you want, I wont really care much, but I don't want tmog in classic no matter whay you think lol

Because it wasn’t in Classic.

So it shouldn’t be added. 
---
Simple concept.
---
If that was the case, killing alliance would be pointless.
---
My exact words.
---
Did they leave that in classic? I remember there was like construction signs and shit in it
---
Meh good on them.
---
Don't be jealous and salty.
---
It's only not fair when you aren't doing it.
---
I use 1080p and when I turned up the graphics, it looks a bit better, but it's so hard to see anything. When I realized how many (interactive) features get covered up by grass, I turned it back even further than default (3) down to 1.
---
You'll get stomped at level 30 if your on a PVP server there.
---
Don’t worry about it , likely won’t affect you if you’re casual and not 60 yet
---
They're projected time is about accurate, from what I've experienced. I also play at whack tines so who knows.
---
Know what gives good gold? Quests.
---
Icy-Veins just posted an article on the most popular classes currently. Not sure how accurate it is. They have Warrior, Mage, and Rogue and the top 3 followed by Priest, Warlock, and Hunter. Druid, Shaman, and Paladin are the bottom 3.

&gt; We intend to open the free character move service in the Americas region at 4:00 p.m. PDT (7:00 p.m. EDT) today. We will begin with transfers from these two realms:
---
&gt;FROM | TO
---
---|---
---
Herod | Earthfury (new realm)
---
Skeram | Earthfury (new realm)
---
&gt;We will be opening free character moves for the remaining realms that we previously listed here 469 as soon as possible.
---
Then dont complain
---
The level of you not caring knows no limits. Please, continue.
---
Yeah idk, I'm try really hard to "get" this game. But it seems to be nearly solely pvp focused. Which to be fair I got roped into a pvp server by friend of friends.
---
Killed a few low levels today in the middle of the tunnels on my run to badlands, just to even it out that you didn't get em.
---
I’m constantly shocked at how lame /r/classicwow is, I thought this satire was funny
---
I went wand spec, then to mind flay, then healing cast time pushback. Now I’m bumping it into disc for spirit buff. 
---
The only thing holy buys you is reduced cast time on heal, really...  that’s a big trade off for leveling. 
---
Go healing spec at 55 and dungeon crawl your preraid bis pieces...
---
You’re limited to 5 per hour, if you’re doing fast runs you’ll have a lock out which will stop you entering.
---
Btw why is WOW classic so much more popular than modern? Does the classic version just have more balance? Do the newer versions not stack up?
---
Sorta how someone prefers playing older COD games to new?
---
\*\*holy shit\*\* i think you're right!?
---
There are no options beside classic+ or TBC, so it's a fair guess that they will pick one of them.
---
How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way
---
No, youre not its just a lazy list
---
If you had an old addiction that killed your life in the past don't do it again simple as that just don't play. I knew lots of people who lost everything went on welfare and stopped showering for months to play back in vanilla. Don't be one of them.
---
I dispell it immediately after they cast it on me and they get the hint.
---
How many times had you done that dungeon that day?
---
I live in West Virginia, I’m lucky to get 4 mb/s down on most practical downloads like steam or WOW. I was on a hospital public WiFi in the video, however I have played on LTE, with varying success
---
try finding sungrass in feralas or hinterlands, its straight up impossible.
---
And how would transmog or a barbershop ruin your treasured classic experience?
---
Alright, let me see here....
---
Hmm... uh huh... 
---
...Doing the maths...
---
...Calculating...
---
...carry the 7...
---
...checking math...
---
Ok. Got it!
---
By my calculations, seems like you're a twat. 
---
Math checks out.
---
What everyone is saying is, sell the staff once BGs are out and people have twinks
---
Depends on the hunter.  I won this on a greed roll, and I smack the shit out of stuff with it using melee weaving
---
/r/fortunecookies
---
Check out the console port, its an addon that makes playing wow with a controller very doable.
---
Seriously! Traitor.
---
Team up and travel with a group. That's part of the fun.
---
Right. It’s an archaic rule. I doubt it’s enforced, and even if you were auto banned, you’d certainly win on appeal. Just saying it might get detected
---
Everybody saying sub isn’t for leveling... my ambush chunks almost 2/3 of at level quest mobs health, then ss, eviscerate, dead.
---
And another thing: any leveling "DPS" warrior not willing to tank his own dungeon is a f'ing coward and needs to reroll. Just my opinion.
---
If you find npcscan. Let me know i want it too

We have just opened the following new realms in this region:
---
Realm	Type	Timezone
---
Arcanite Reaper	PvP	Pacific
---
Earthfury	PvP	Eastern
---
Heartseeker	PvP	Eastern
---
For approximately one day, these new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.

---
We have enabled free character moves for select realms to offer you a way to move your characters from the most high-population realms that have extended queues. In this region, player-characters at any level can now move:
---
From	To
---
Herod	Earthfury
---
Skeram	Earthfury
---
On the realms above, free character moves can be initialized from either the character select screen or the queue screen.
---
We expect these free character moves to remain open for the realms above through this coming weekend. Please note that restrictions apply:
---
A character cannot move if the character:
---
is a guild leader.
---
has active auction listings or bids.
---
has mail.
---
You may be required to change your character’s name once you’ve reached the destination realm.
---
You cannot move a character to a PvP realm where you already have a character belonging to the opposing faction.
---
This is a one-way, irreversible move. Blizzard Customer Support cannot monitor or modify a free character move.
---
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.

I just gave up on the low level barrens quests with named mobs. I ended up doing all of silverpine and coming back for the stonetalon and camp tj quests.
---
Please stab them minimum 3 times.
---
Yep that or to get a clean farming spot without other players.
---
I’m not a fan of the gnomes so far lol
---
Let's be real, there are a lot of improvements that people would like.. but its the combination of all of the improvements over the years that has taken away some of the charm of the game. 
---
I personally would love LFG. Even if it was just all of the same dungeons that are in Vanilla, that would be a huge improvement to me. Not Looking for Raid, just LFG for instances. Dungeons are probably my favorite part of the game and I get like 2 hours a day to play.. with how hard it is to get a group, let alone getting to the dungeon entrance and then running the dungeon.. I don't know if I'll ever be able to run one!
---
Ewwww lol
---
Ummm...Stalagg and Faerlina to the same server shows a distinct lack of understanding of the playerbase.
---
Stalagg is the overflow from Herod, which was the anti-streamer server and they linked it with the streamer server. Nobody is going to go, especially when some of these streamers start getting streamed sniped and transfer to this new server. 
---
Stalagg needs it’s own dedicated transfer server and these transfer servers need to come with a promise that if population severely diminishes Blizz will merge it with the parent server, or else most people aren’t going anywhere because they don’t want to be stuck on a dead server.
---
Poor kid.  Gonna grow up as Alliance scum... can us honorable Hordies give this child an F?
---
I have 58 hours of sick time and 40 of vacation for the year. I'm really considering wasting a lot of it on this game.
---
A proverb from my step dad: “a job ain’t worth having if you can’t make $10k a year poopin”
---
You're going to lose a lot of traffic this way, just so you're aware.
---
I downloaded an update to questie yesterday because it was starting to malfunction. Has been working fine since.
---
You're right behind me in Q
---
Only what their currently playing or by simply asking.
---
Looks like a miss generates plenty of rage.
---
By all over what address you meaning. Mine jumps between 110 and 50 only if I have vsync turned off. I turn vsync on at and 60 with no drops so far. I have graphics set to classic though at 900p with shadows on medium. Mines just a 13" macbook if that's helps.
---
Well the open world chests, it's fairly obvious when people wait for you to engage so they can nab it. They refuse to work but want the paycheck. Now those are just jerks. I'll cast a gypsy curse on them and move on.
---
I'm more concerned about those doing it in a group setting, I.e. during dungeons. Or rogues claiming the chest because "lol you can't open it xD". Such behavior goes against the spirit cooperation and lands people on my shortlist (ignore actually as there is no shitlist). You can't trust people whose greed shines through for a mere chest with anything else, that's a certainty. Besides it breaks social norms and damages group cohesion. Don't need that. Shun and exile. That chest belonged to the group, not some greedy shithead. Roll for a fair chance at it.
---
Their racial is great for pvp but damn they look stupid
---
Specs arent everything is what you dont seem to understand, yes they may make life in a few raids easier but as a fire spec I still have every frost and arcane spell I have trained in at my disposal at all times, I can still cast frostbolt as a fire spec *gasp* (just a bit weaker than a frost specs)
---
Cute cat! However may I direct you to r/wow? I see you’re on a flying mount and this subreddit is for WoW classic
---
The best way Imo (this close the release) would have been to take gathering professions and just sell everything on ah.  You can make some good gold from peopel trying to rush profs
---
Hunter is fun when you get your pet at 10.
---
wouldnt do prebuilt anything, computers aren't hard to build at all. they're just like an expensive puzzle.
---
I guarantee that the amount of money you'll put into a prebuilt will get you a wayyyyyyyy better PC.
---
Also, classic can run on pretty much anything. I play on my laptop and get 60 frames
---
Then you realize feral charge for cat form was added in a later expansion. D:
---
I played pvp warrior through at least half of vanilla so I had all those macros.  I did forget that spell reflect isn't in classic though.
---
That’s the drawback for me, cant stand the asthetic of those short bastards
---
Like seen on the chat, I was told to need on said item and then equip it, not by the priest, no, but their guildmaster as I learned later on.
---
Like I said, I’m not saying it’s difficult. It’s just that it’s not a fair comparison, it’s not even the same number of people in the raid. Then having years of practice does take into account when people are basing the fact that the boss is downed within a week of release. You can use other forms of argument and I would probably have agreed with it, but it irks me when someone uses this argument.
---
Also, mythical are hard, but are normal dungeons hard? Classic has only one difficulty, and it is already more difficult that your average dungeon. Mythical are just addons soley designed to be more difficult, so it’s hard to compare also.
---
Can you tell us to what realms please?
---
You can tank any dungeon as a warrior in fury/arms and up til maraudon you can just 2h cleave things for more dps and fast runs. Its been a blast
---
ok that looks better. idk what I was doing wrong, but I am not gonna go back and look either. people should be able to figure it out based on what I presented.
---
Here's how y'all fix the issue.
---
Make your own group, invite nothing but casters.
---
Keep doing quests and pick up EVERYTHING. Gray vendor weapons around the 40s start selling for nearly a gold and quests will start giving you more currency.
---
well thats annoying then
---
Grinding beasts at ur level in a densely packed zone with good respawns and using skinning nets good gold.
---
You need 64 gold if you’re exalted. Plus 20 for the training. Farm mats and sell them. Also you probably won’t have a lvl 40 mount until you’re in your late 40s maybe early 50s
---
How do you even function ?
---
If you’re looking to expand, hit me up.
---
I can see why you went by phonetics.
---
Make a macro that posts in general and looking for group, that way you just have to hit one button instead of typing over and over 
---
Secondly, /who is a very powerful tool
---
You can /who westfall and get a list of 50 people, you can even add parameters if you’d like to look for certain levels or classes
---
I usually hit the macro once, wait a min or two before hitting it again, and while I wait, I /who westfall and start messaging any and all warriors within the level range I want, and if that doesn’t work, try some of the other classes that are also more than capable of tanking!
---
Good luck! Make sure to add the people that didn’t suck afterwards, build up a list of people you could message again! You don’t need to battle tag add them, just regular add
---
This will inflate the market making them cheaper possibly for rest of us? Yea bs tho
---
You sir need to eat a snickers
---
I rolled alliance for the first time ever on a vanilla server, fought a shaman last night a few times. As a mage, thought I'd have an easy time of it. 
---
Rule number one as a mage vs shaman: don't let them get anywhere near within melee range!
---
You are a good person
---
Thanks for writing this guide!  
---
I wanted a more direct way to run WoW classic. For me, running the WoW launcher just seems to open up the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher, which still requires a few more clicks.  
---
I found a launcher on github and a discussion where they added it.  [https://github.com/dafzor/bnetlauncher/issues/22](https://github.com/dafzor/bnetlauncher/issues/22) 
---
They recently added the ability to launch WoW classic directly. I haven't gone through the entire process with the controller, but I can definitely get the steam overlay, so that's promising.
---
Hope this is helpful to anybody else trying to do the same thing.
---
Should roll horde imo
---
Queues are good. It means Whitemane will last forever. Long live Whitemane!
---
Just remember to have open space!
---
Remember the original rules of engagement: if it's red make it dead.
---
Probably the person who gets physically ill at the sight of a guild name.
---
Nothing. Welcome to hell
---
From (Mostly) Solid 60’s down to jumping between 60 down into the high 20’s mid 30’s. Then at 9:15 everything back to solid 60’s
---
Give or take 10 or so min,  it'll take Pretty close to 83 min..

---
I know a little bit about the current research about obesity.
---
While your not wrong, that is no one can gain wait without eating, there are conditions like diabetes type 2 and various hormone problems that can make the body preferentially gain weight. Basically alice eats 8 kJ and feels full of energy bob eats 8 kJ and feels hungry and fatigued because instead of metabolising it to atp the body is storing a good chunk.
---
Still they're not super common, however it seems like your average person begins to experience something like an addiction as they eat more. So Alice eats a meal of 3 kJ and goes "omg I'm stuffed" Bob eats the same meal and despite having a large excess of energy at the moment feels powerful cravings to eat more. Unless Bob is actively counting calories he's unlikely to be aware that he's eaten a lot and may even believe he is under eating. Also Bob will likely gravitate towards high macro nutrient foods to satisfy this which in the western world usually means foods poor in micro nutrients so he's likely to end up with some deficiencies that result in poor mood, attenuated mental clarity, and a resulting difficulty being active.
---
Quitting addictive behaviours is hard and shame doesn't seem to be a very powerful motivator, we have tried it with everything else and have shifted strategies as it tends to just make problems worse. Now we target smokers with aspirational messages about how rapidly they will begin to get healthier, alcoholics with messages of sympathy and understanding coupled with support programs, heroine addicts with supplementary chemicals and institutions etc etc.
---
To be clear, being fat is terrible for you, there's no situation in life where being clinically obese is a good thing for your body and it will shorten your life and make it markedly more unpleasant to live. But the hand to extend is the one of support, not a slap.
---
I mean shit man, we all struggle with some things. I've kicked cocaine, started and maintained exercise habits, and obesity but I still smoke (well vape now but I'm sure it's still terrible for my lungs) and I've tried quitting so many times with the longest stretch being maybe 6 months. You gonna tell me I am a terrible person? I'm just a person, and I'm lucky enough to have a life low stress and supportive enough that I've been able to find success in all the other areas I was screwing it up.
---
If anyone's struggling with weight is reading this I'd recommend you start counting calories (it's tedious but it's the only way to know what you're eating) and come up with a rotating weekly diet. It's varied enough you won't get super bored and you put in all the tedious micro/macro nutrition work once then you just need to spend your energy sticking to that. Also there are some stupid hacks to increase satiation like eating off small plates/bowls with smaller cutlery and dishing up a meal in 2 halves so have a "well I've had seconds" subconscious thing. Including a few entirely plant based meals in your weekly plan can also let you eat a very large quantity of fibrous food that will fill you up a fair bit which can be enjoyable.
---
Your just giving shitty advice that’s all. Play how you want but don’t give shit advice to people.
---
lmfao
---
B*ch I'm a cow
---
Not Low Effort If Its A Dwarf
---
Or sometimes they may want to roll on the same gear you will and had a cloth class coming as another option.
---
For heals, why not use a mouseover? Then you can target the mob (rwad dps) and heal the tank or heal your choice of dps. 
---
I have almost all my helpful spells on a mouseover macro.
---
Get yourself a Julie's dagger made. It's the best tanking dagger around I believe. 
---
Good on Vael at least.
---
Call the police!!!!!

Rolled a Troll mage but I’m moving severs and was wondering about the Alliance starting area
---
Pretty sure agi only gives shamans crit.
---
Enjoy the queue then. 😂
---
Flamelash?
---
Why? SM was my favourite dungeon from vanilla, of course when I get the chance to run it again I’m going to. Not a fan of those “cleave groups” though, takes the fun out of it.
---
When they drop group the buff goes away sadly
---
He meant Sunder armor, but with his level/gear, the enemy would Dodge/parry or he would miss.
---
There is a max xp and max shared loot range. It's about as far as the minimap covers fully zoomed out.
---
Turned 30 today and finished all of ashenvale. To celebrate I guarded the road at Maestra's post for an hour so satisfying as a Warlock to dot up levels 20-28.
---
Go away troll, stay if you actually want to discuss it like an adult.
---
I tried to gank a priest 2 levels lower than me as a mage last night. They just stood there healing, and when I realised I wasn't going to be able to out dps them I just /waved and left. I had a good laugh and I hope they did too.
---
I've also found healers seem to be much better supplied than they were in vanilla. Possibly because some the balancing made them a bit easier to play by 1.12, and everyone knows they will be in demand for raids. At the end of the day, play what you enjoy. Tanks will likely be the only slot that continues to have undersupply issues. I've rerolled Druid atm so I can tank/DPS on the way to 60, and then maybe switch to heals if there's demand for it, otherwise stay feral.
---
As Horde, if you have a mage with all the major ports, you can make an okay buck idling there and selling portals and water/food.
---
&gt; Yeh I haven’t gone that far yet still keeping them separate but I see the appeal but mah 10 rage lol.
---
The key to combing charge and hamstring is the fact that there's no situation where you can really use both. Charge is available in combat only, you can't cast it while in combat which is when you're most likely going to use Hamstring
---
Mage Shaman Lock...and DK?
---
Fun fact:  
---
\*\*/moo\*\* on Tauren will actually moo.

Its the only race where that emote has a sound/voiceline.

I’m sorry I feel I’ve let you down!!! But I can’t go there anymore!!! No no no.  It’s over!!! I have a crowbar on the wall in my office.  It’s a wow classic stopper in case of emergency (no sleep no work no anything but playing wow)   I’ll smash the living shit out of that alien computer if I have too.   I’m ready dammit.  This time it’s my turn not yours fucking blizzard.  Lol ⛏🚬🥃⚰️
---
Okay
---
Sounds like a plan, I’ll give that a try, cheers!
---
Are you kidding?  I laughed out loud at it.  Would've been boring without it.
---
They are each ideal in their own situations. All the classes I listed have different optimal specs depending on the point in the game, on the exact role you're meant to fill within that class, etc etc.
---
Of course there's going to be non-viable specs, but people seriously underrate the amount of choice you have for talents in vanilla.
---
8 days too late, still valid? C:&lt;
---
You know, like 'it's the biz'
---
It's the business. Dunno why these other guys are trolling you.

The things people spend their time debating on this website is absolutely fucking asinine. It's wonderful.
---
That's a bit overkill for classic lol. My buddy runs classic on a 350.00 USD Acer with an i3 and Intel HD integrated graphics card. He gets around 40-50 FPS. I'd say spending 700.00 GBP should get you a pretty decent classic experience.
---
 I'd rank Druids and Rogues over mages myself.

Basically, you need a .toc file (contents in the link, ctrl+f toc) and a lua file (this is where you put that script). Put the .toc file and the .lua file in a folder with the same name as the .toc file. Thats it. More in depth explanation is in the link or can be easily googled.

Lots of tin in 1k needles.
---
Power nap and it's not so bad... lol
---
Hunter probably has the highest skill ceiling in the game.  And I wouldn't go mage imo, if you want to pew pew then just go ele shaman which own in pvp anyways.
---
Haha no, let me clarify... who are you?
---
Thanks for this, I couldn't remember what that add-on was called
---
Contrast that with mages who at worst occasionally get treated like vending machines, a small price to pay for the increased desirability in groups. 
---
I personally always enjoyed exacting revenge on rude and unobservant party members by porting them to BFE.
---
Respect the laptop! I have an older generation of the Omen, still runs new games 6 years later.
---
I’m in need of an upgrade soon, but Omens are such a great value for money
---
Yes. Yes we do. Watch your back.
---
After 1-30 quests are fewer, more grinding mobs are necessary
---
Very cool
---
Not if he's against a hunter. Those bastards can literally track you down.
---
We are in the same &lt;Guild&gt;
---
I wish blizzard made +18 servers or something so you can have guilds and fun character names like this without getting the "your character/guild has been flagged for rename" there's so many fun names that could be had without the PC patrol out and about. Even in current year some people have a sense of humor.
---
I would really really like this, esp for herbs :)
---
Just some guy who gabked your guild members and they were forwards who ran
---
What I like to do is make the toons. Get their rested maxed, then work my way around all my toons until I get normal XP. Repeat. Sometimes I get into a class and play more than usual but I usually go back to alternating toons.
---
Saaame. It bugs me not being able to mentally go oh new highest crit heal. Us heal bitches gotta keep entertained somehow.
---
I was in a meeting and noticed the Battle.net launcher open on my bosses computer. He 100% plays at work. (But you can do that when you're CEO I suppose)
---
When I get home tonight, I'm going to try to do WC on my warrior. I'm arms right now, but I do some dungeons. I don't really have a good two hander, so I mostly use sword and board. You think the staff is really good for an arms warrior?
---
It’s always been so difficult explaining to people that the Horde isn’t ‘evil’...
---
7o m8. Honestly, my dream game is something like wow/dark souls/ eve online all mixed together
---
I thought of this after I had already posted. People were already chewing my ass because I hadn’t screenshotted.
---
Siiick

---
You'll have to add WoW as a non-steam game.
---
What addon are you using for the item information?
---
*cries in dwarf*
---
Not really. The gold sellers are out and about. 1g = $3 USD on my server. I don't think anyone will buy 1000g but there's a lot of it moving around already.
---
Wonderful tool! Today I collected a solid chest that is not represented on your map, is it supposed to be exhaustive?
---
you should gnome better than that
---
Maybe I'm wrong but I think it blocks casting the duration of the wand attack speed. Which is almost always longer than the 1 second gcd. I had a really slow wand on my lock and noticed it was easier to get my syphon soul off when I switched to a fast wand.
---
Ik it's more to fuck around
---
Getting a healer? No. Getting a competent healer, yes.
---
When you pull big groups. Most I'll throw is a renew on the dps, they should watch their threat or have some way of healing themselves.
---
My focus is to keep the tank alive.
---
May as well have just stayed at home tbh.
---
No, and I doubt they'll add it considering that's one of the more commonly cited things people hate about retail (and I agree, it shouldn't exist).

---
Whatever will I do? QQ
---
60/40 and fair is debatable though. 3/2 is what I think is close to the inflection point where people in the minority will start transferring, shrinking it further to 2:1. Look at Shazz when it launched. With the second last survey the Alliance was 40%, and with last survey it dipped below that.
---
I prefer either 50/50 (e.g. Mograine), or 55/40 at max. Even as a Horde, because a balanced server is a must for the full Classic experience imo, regardless of affiliation.

Oh man those do bring back nostalgia.

Can u kill the people outside?
---
Is there a specific reason you dislike focus? I always felt it fit the class a lot more, and its one of the only things I actually think are not worse in retail right now (the other one is that I think tar trap for the slowing one is way cooler, though I kinda miss the ice patch of the frost trap)
---
Also, IRC, hunters were meant to use focus but in vanilla beta there was a lot of issues and they swapped to mana.
---
Fine by me! Lol

Getting to 40+ on my warlock and getting the warlock orb + death coil is whats done it for me.

You're about the right level for dead mines.  18 is probably the lowest level I'd go.  It's great for xp and the quest rewards area good as well.  Plus it's really fun.
---
I feel you have the quest to collect the mining cards let the group know bc that's done outside the dungeon and is normally skipped.
---
Lol same exact situation here.
---
You can get to 15 in a day of playing on a day off. If he had no job and got to 15 in a week he wasn't trying very hard
---
And you know you’re first how?
---
My guild chose a tabard with a feather (how can you look tough/cool with a fukin feather on your chest ?!) picture on it And The color scheme doesn’t match and looks awful.  I hate the tabard intensely. 
---
Should I refuse to wear it or maybe quit the guild?
---
So stockade pauldrons drop you wouldn't let the tank have? Seems like a sad self centered way to play the game. I love getting people upgrades but I play healer and tank so I do a lot of runs where I don't need anything.  if there only was a way to see what would happen if this type of attitude is repeatedly rewarded by blizzard. Just saying.

My hunter is a cook and alchemist, I bring da buffs!
---
Originally NE Male Hunter, now NE Female Hunter. Lesson learned
---
I think they have a couple things that make them difficult or uncomfortable to play at a high level. I’m sure they’re GOOD,  you just have to play it expecting certain annoyances like the melee leeway and having to constantly keep your pet fed.
---
Mate I ran this 6 times trying to get it. Gave up coz I lost 3 rolls on it. 
---
Ended up leveling enough in there for SM Lib and landed a staff only a few dps below this. 
---
Going to wait till 37 for ravenger now.

I know it's not much and it's only level 30, but I've been practicing trying to get better at my druid and I was really happy with how this fight turned out.

---
So what you probably mean is that hunters have the worst range dps at end game raids. 
---
Relax. Yuloull quit long before then, the kind of mentality that cares about this shit.
---
i don't get it
---
And also why does it matter if you make a new character. Most people aren’t gonna bother you till you’re 20/30 anyway
---
How’d you do this?
---
Thank you for the replies everyone.  I stick with alliance.
---
are yes, horde enjoy ganging up 4v1, but when it comes back to bite them, you truely are masters at running away
---
Best thing to do after some pvp though. Heal up on their corpse.
---
The problem is that it really damages immersion and the uniqueness of items.
---
People always see the shining armor of the humans and cheery faces of the gnomes, paired with the nice shiny blue banner of the Alliance and automatically assume "good guys" due to tropes.
---
Both factions are pretty morally grey all things considered and I'd be hard pressed to say there is a "good" or "bad" guy, honestly.
---
I have a laptop with no graphics card and a super hardcore gaming PC and it runs almost the same in both (tearing and a bit lower graphics on laptop but you genuinely cant tell easily)
---
She... She knows warlocks have fire spells too right
---
They are very strong in pvp. They don't fall off end game but other dps classes get buffed in the late late end game.
---
Built in Stormwind
---
&gt;I believe Old Ironforge can still be accessed if you have a means to levitate/slow fall.
---
That jump is insane. I tried it three times in my WoW playtime, and the first time I freaking made it. The other two times I just missed it and drifted to my inevitable demise. It's like a 1 degree window or something silly.
---
Not really. Everything in classic is just locked behind time. Retail has actual difficult encounters. Modern dungeons are harder than every raid in vanilla.
---
That’s really weird healing gear
---
I ran past a dwarf named bigswngdkk. He yelled at me “want to hold my dwarven handcannon”? I laughed at that one.

The french see Merlin the first time. (Circa 1300) "why is that madman waving that Baguette around?"
---
Up until level 10 a couple mobs is fine. Then it's like a cliff and all of a sudden a single mob is all you can take. I remember thinking until 10 that warrior wasn't too bad then oh my god.
---
yes my horde bretheren let us vanquish the alliance scum known as the Gnomes (also what server?)

I literally use 3 hotkeys leveling a shaman. We're basically auto attack bots while leveling as enhance.

What’s this from anyways.

It’s hilarious tho

Not at all. I’ve restarted my toon a few times now and have been shocked by the number of players in starter zones. Honestly, I wouldnt be at all worried.
---
Mother of god.
---
Can someone help me, I've made a WOW starter account, but when I try to get into WOW Classic it says 'active game time required'. Does WOW classic not have a free trial?
---
But won't you be weak for the entirety of the game?
---
Would it be OK if I did that using phone pics of my screen instead?
---
&gt; Charge is available in combat only, you can't cast it while in combat which is when you're most likely going to use Hamstring.
---
I think you meant to say that charge is only available outside of combat. But otherwise exactly on the money
---
More details like what server, what guild ECT..
---
Ive only had an alliance to level 55 so I didn't know but that's sick

Wants to show off his cat. Adds classic to it. easy
---
I ran to the gravestone and died upon it rezzed and fast as hell completed it then died again took rezz sickness in tarren mill and took an 10min break :)
---
And here I am hitting level 13 thinking I actually accomplished something lol
---
Regarding gathering and mob grinding...due to respawn rates being significantly faster than vanilla ever was...and whole layering system...it is far far easier now to farm for the mounts.  So take advantage of this while you can!  It'll never be this easy
---
Where did this drop for you? I got the wall of the dead to drop from a sea spray water elemental on the coastline of feralas. I figure I will hold onto it and sell it later on, I would do the same in your situation! If I got Krol blade though I would instantly equip it as I'm a rogue :b.

Woops, Charge is only usable out of combat. Pairing it with a combat skill with a macro makes sense since the keybind is otherwise idle while you're in combat.

this is great! thank you!

I did the same, you'll also notice corpses at the tombstone from other people who did likewise
---
&gt;you hit so hard with aimed shot and multishot it feels like a sniper.
---
Back when NE Shadowmeld broke on spell completion instead of spell cast, this was fantastic. 
---
Stealthed aimed shot to start a fight with someone who didn't even know you were there. Good times, good times.
---
God, if you listening, HELP!
---
I need help have tried my hand at WoW a few times a hunter here, a Druid there a sprinkling of a Ckeric or two, with never any real success in the game. I ended up actually getting a lot of anxiety trying to get this game down... difference now is I am actually playing with some friends to help me out along the way. With that said I have no clue what to play. They are playing Horde so my first pick of paladin isn’t an option. So what do you guys recommend for an experienced noob?
---
I think it's as simple as joining a group of another player in some cases. I see people in chat all the time asking for group invites for layer switches.
---
Erased your original post and I'm the one who played myself? Nobody believes you. Look at the other replies if ya don't believe me mate. PS it sold for a cool 3g so get rekt noobie. thank u, next

I just completed it, but im a hunter and had a friend that helped. So to escape the guards you will need a distraction. Maybe dying at the grave helps. When ressing, immediately complete the quest. You complete the quest by clicking the gravestone, then quest interface comes up.
---
Thanks for the really helpful tips :)

I'm over here getting that 3d acceleration but when I up the advanced options.

Helcular's grave is at 52/53; reached easily by skirting the river to avoid SouthShore guards - his grave is the first you'll come upon once you reach the graveyard. Helcular rises from the grave - no need to stick around further to complete.

WoW TCG was so fun.  Unlike Hearthstone, Heroes in WoW TCG had different abilities, specs and even professions!  There were quests, equipment like weapons, armor and trinkets.  There was even stuff like quests and locations.  I really miss that game and I hate that it died out.

as if hunters dont already need everything smh

Hunters are fine, they just don't really scale as well as the other damage classes and will hit a roadblock. They just start off fairly strong and then everyone else surpasses them.

Professions are designed for the most part to level with you, so if you need to raise your level go to a previous zone and farm mobs

The copper bar is noticeable bigger than the tin bar, tin is only used for making bronze, so the dwarven standard ingot cast is sized to be the right amount of tin for smelting bronze when using the dwarven standard ingot cast for copper.
