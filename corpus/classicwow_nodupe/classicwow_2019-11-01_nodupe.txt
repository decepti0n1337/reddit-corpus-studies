I feel this way playing an ele shaman, TAKE MY TOTEM BUFFS
---
---
---
Never done DKP, but it seems fucked in the sense that you’ll waste points on shit you don’t know if anyone else is gonna bid on, and if your guild has a bunch of one class they need to work wayyyyyyy harder to get points because they have way more people bidding. For example, mages. Like you’re gonna get screwed on gear no matter the system

[Is this](https://imgur.com/a/jQEzpaG) a good raid composition?
---

---
This is my guild right now, we're 8/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia, we have new people, Pserver people and we have done two MCs and two Onyxias , the first one with like 10 pugs, the second one with 3 pugs and next week hopefully with no pugs.
---
I feel like we're too slow, this is my first time raiding in Classic but AFAIK MC should take 2 hours, it takes us 2 days. We raid from 8:30 to 11:30 two days, on our first raid we got 5/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, on our second raid we got 6/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, that was mostly due to people not having Aqual Quintessence and having people go out mid raid, then getting them in, it was a shitshow and we tried to do Domo with like 30 people and didnt work out, our strat wasn't the best either and was based on Pserver info.
---
We have some full Pre-Bis gear but most are 50% and some have like 10% Pre-Bis, we also have some MC gear thanks to the two 8/10 raids that we have done and we arent using consumables, next week they're obligatory and we're doing loot council and all that because we finally have a core but im wondering if our problem isn't that but actually that the composition is garbage, i mean i've seen videos of people doing speed runs with like 20 Fury warriors, we have 2. I've seen top end guilds with 1 druid and we have 3, locks do basically no DPS but we have 5 for Garr. Does my guild have a future?
---
Why stand and do nothing while the tank is still fine? Or you want the priest to begin spamming heals once the tank is at 80% so they’re OOM every single fight? 
---
I’ve never had to precast a heal in a 5 man dungeon. It is not necessary at all. And for consistent pulls, you down rank and use mana efficient heals instead of spamming flash heals. 
---
I didn’t even watch the clip but complaining about a priest sitting to drink at 50% mana and then starting to heal when the tank is at 50% health? That’s all fucking normal.
---
Fake! I mean just look at that squid-looking blue guy! Think that's WoW? Not my WoW at least!
---
That's all you need on current content. Even Nightfin Soup is overkill IMO. On a standard 2 minute MC boss fight, Nightfin Soup is worth exactly 192 mana.
---
In later tiers, Flask of Distilled Wisdom and Night Dragon's Breath will be mandatory in addition to the others.
---
&gt; I legit came close to gquitting last week when they gave pereditions blade to a rogue who turned up just to kill Rag using half greens and carrot on a stick over me who has been to every single raid kill so far. Yeh sure it’s a team effort, but don’t waste BIS gear on a guy who hasn’t been online since then. 2 only kills and a full MC wince and he hasnt been on for any of them.
---
We had a person guildquit because in a group of 7 mages and 3 locks with 100% attendance he didn't win mageblade.
---
Some people just think they're SO MUCH BETTER than the rest and clearly they're the special snowflake who would show the world 1-button spam frostbolt.
---
the system as defined by the game has one flaw and that is that it rewards laziness. the need/greed system means that a player who doesn't spend the cash on say a libram or a boe upgrade or a dm book gets to roll need while a player who took the hit to his wallet to improve his character performance has to roll greed. that's not fair. that means that it would be sensible to equip unenchanted gear for dm runs in order to fake need for librams. bad system.
---
I don’t bother cause I can never remember if I’ll have to use my Authenticator lol.
---
There's an exalted trinket that turns you into a timbermaw.
---
not required, but nifty
---
Well I had enough money, and was kind of tired of using thrash blade, and watching dalrends not drop.
---
Show screenshots and videos of supposed mobs that don't have thrashing (hint: A LOT OF MOBS HAVE IT) using it please. I don't address unsupported claims. 
---
&gt; Also, there's absolutely no way that mobs are supposed to be storing thrash charges then unloading them on the next fight, this is 100% not working as intended
---
Let me spell this out for you. Nice and slow. Because your reading comprehension is clearly sub par. 
---
THAT. IS. NOT. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. That's not how the mechanic works. It never has. There is no evidence of that. What happens is, someone kites, or stuns or otherwise gets out of hit range for a mob with thrashing. It stores up the thrash hits. And then, this is crucial please pay VERY close attention. 
---
They while still in combat with that same person. catch up. and deliver all the thrashes at once. 
---
Now, combine this with spell caching. And you get some wonkiness of spike damage. 
---
But again, as confirmed by the blue post. This is working as intended. Not sure why you are arguing with me.
---
What addon is that?
---
Is that a space cow and a she male? Man I hope these leaks are fake
---
I love your Playstyle of hybrids. It's how I love to play them too
---
I love you both
---
A night elf wearing white-face???? This will never fly in 2019
---
I really really wouldn't grind felstriker. I've run UBRS triple digit times in vanilla+classic and I've never seen it drop.
---
Wasn’t this just removed for a reason?
---
Spirit tap, Wand Specialization.
---
5/5 holy specialization, 5/5 Divine Fury, 3/3 inspiration, 1/3 blessed recovery, Holy Nova, Searing Light 2/2, Improved Healing 3/3, Spiritual Guidance.
---
In the holy tree Spiritual Guidance is what I'm shooting for. You get some damage talents, and healing talents. 
---
Disc, Improved PW: Shield, Improved Fort, Inner focus, Mediation, Martyrdom1/2, Mental Agility, Divine Spirit.
---
What honestly makes the build for me is Spiritual Guidance. I'm level 49, and I've got 254 spirit unbuffed. That is 64 Spell Power from that talent alone. When I have spirit scroll, food buff, spirit tap, etc it just gets better.
---
Oh yea, Level cooking. Well Fed is an easy source of spirit.
---
Nobody tell him.
---
Dude sounds like he deserved that thing for sure, seems really dedicated to the game.
---
But the content is still technically accessible via LFG/LFR. Even if it's a different "version" of it. 
---
It's easy to say "but that doesn't count!", but it does to a lot of people.
---
&gt; corrupt LC confirmed
---
Not arguing for or against but according to OP it was a roll between 2 enhancement shamans.
---
Hardly corrupt if you roll it out.
---
Magic!
---
Imagine going for rank 14 as enhancement instead of elemental.
---
i hear Activision is gonna partner with Mountain Dew and Doritos to get us double XP codes
---
Why are you so determined to put this entirely on him? Guilds, especially those with Loot Council, need to be transparent about loot. When something is given to somebody it should *not* be a surprise to anybody.
---
This is why we just use DKP to be honest. Raid more, get more. End of story.
---
Username checks out.
---
What if i was 60 in the first 2 weeks and don’t want phase 2 yet?
---
Dude, my shadowbolt crits for over 600 at lvl 40, and that's without CoS and being aff spec. A 3k health mage is going to get annihilated by a lvl 60 one. I'm looking forward to BGs at 60 running sac/ruin spec. Yes, I will get deleted quickly but those crits tho.
---
&gt; Apparently everyone else wants some socialist regime.
---
lol
---
I cs'd a shadow priest and got feared :/ I died...
---
I second smoking some weed but either way
---
took me 521, so your getting close :D
---
&gt; How do we know that's true?
---
We don't. We just know he's so wound up by missing the loot he would gquit and post a crybaby post on their discord. 
---
All fair to care about loot, but if you would actually gquit because you didn't get that 1 item then you probably should reconsider playing a team game.
---
Ok.
---
I'm not whining -- I'm encouraging it. :)
---
TSM
---
Problem is that people who rolled on PvP servers are generally fine with PvP. But there's PvP and there's "fuck you for thinking you can play this game".
---
That said, complaining won't do anything. Sadly though what will happen is what happened later in WoW - world PvP as we know it will be taken away as people get tired of those abusing it and stop playing.
---
It's a shame but it will happen, followed by all those same people complaining they can't PvP any more *and* blaming the people who didn't want to log in and be NPCs for them to kill.
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
If the only reason you were raiding was because you got to see raid geometry and boss models then I guess the existence of LFR is a problem. Nobody who's looking for real raid content needs to do LFR, and the rewards raiders are after ALSO aren't available in LFR. It doesn't count because it existing doesn't make any difference to a raider.
---
Most of the time when I hear complaints about LFR it's from people who have no idea how tertiary LFR really is in retail.
---
I was positive that I'm the only one...
---
Dude same age and i am king of dps!My pvp reflexes did slow down but i think we just need some practice! Don't despair  practice, reading guidies and asking guildies questions in a nice manner will help   !
---
Believe in yourself dont stress in advance its just a game
---
"Hey Guys, fuqwad here, so I found this great farming spot where you can make 400 to 600 gold an hour. As you can see I got some vendor trash and a Staff of Jordan dropped. Don't forget to subcribe and like my video."
---
I'm horde on Morgraine. Pm me the name I'll ske sure he gets killed a few times in your honour. Even if you're a gnome.
---
This is one of those quests you do within the first five minutes of a concluded server restart.
---
&gt;Yeah and if you're pugging this you should expect you won't have optimal groups.
---
You don't need an optimal group.
---
&gt;So perhaps don't go in with DW Fury spec on because your favorite streamers are doing it.
---
Yeah warriors are going to dungeons DW fury because they are fury for raiding and sword and board doesn't generate enough threat in PUG groups where mages are casting before the warrior gets a single global off.
---
&gt;Ah the optimal strategy. Were they pugging or were they a group? Because if you're pugging you probably shouldn't take risks like that when you don't know the caliber of your pug. 
---
Pulling two packs that deep into strath UD isn't a real risk. Every group I've ever been in with two mages has pulled multiple packs.
---
&gt;That's great. We can respec. I do it twice a week. 
---
Why would you burn 100G a week just because of wannabe streamers that don't pay attention? In that situation you'd still have died as 2H Arms.
---
&gt; You keep referring to this video specifically too when I'm talking in general.
---
The general example doesn't really change. If the healer is raid geared you can pull like that. If they aren't even preBIS you can't. If the DW Fury tank never uses defensive stance they aren't really tanking. But that's an issue of bad players not a bad spec.
---
&gt;Many healers despise having to try to keep up these DW tanks in 5 mans.
---
Lots of DW tanks are bad tanks. But lots of healers are also bad. If I was playing that priest even with the distraction I'd still have saved the tank.
---
&gt;But be reasonable and expect the majority of people aren't playing at a hardcore level.
---
That strategy isn't hardcore. That's the majority of groups on my server. If the tank hadn't been pulling multiple packs on my server the DPS or the healers would have whined about the pace. If you try and do pulls like that the first moment into the instance that is dumb. But they are obviously deep enough for everyone to have a feel for the performance of the group.
---
I'm a mage right now, but I would probably choose a rogue to mess around in pvp. The whole idea of being a pain in the butt to alliance in stealth seems really fun. I would suck at it for sure, but it would be a blast!
---
Jokes on you, Hunter gear is a myth.
---
Really? Is there a video explaining this?
---
PUNY INSECT REQUESTS OF "LF TANK THEN G2G" ARE NOW LIMITED TO 4 PER HOUR
---
Aside from BGs it's just never been part of the WoW experience for me, and I like it better for that.
---
You actually can haha
---
This is a conventional flex, I assure you.
---
I feel like holy pally is just the best though, you get all the same utility and you heal as much as the other classes.
---
Source pls.
---
Did he win a roll, or did he actually get given the item without rolling? If it was given, what was the reason?
---
They're pulling your legs dude.
---
Warrior because it's so slow to level. I have mained warrior for a decade but I just can't get myself to create one in classic. I still remember the struggle.
---
I mean, that’s a different scenario to what I explained and the OPs post though. If there’s 10 deserving people putting in effort and you complain then you are an asshole, but in OPs situation you have a guy who just isn’t putting in any effort to help the guild out be given the best item in the game.
---
Fury tank &gt; no tank at all.
---
Can anyone comment on the state of world PVP on a typical normal realm? I got fed up with getting killed while trying to level (limited game time) but I like the idea of being flagged for PVP at 60. Am I likely to find a mix of horde scum who also turned PVP on? I don't know what to expect.
---
Oddly it's faster
---
isn't this the reason why dkp is a thing?
---
Dafuq did I just watch??
---
Haha! Every... Single... Time.
---
I tried to get Dal Rends so many times it became a meme. I'm full bis outside of HoJ which i've done about 25 times and its just not fun finding groups for on my small server. Anyways, I set up a group and let someone else take lead who I now know to never trust with critical thinking. The lead asked me if he should invite a pug 59 rogue. I said, no, do not invite the pug. I get to the instance and the pug is there and I thought it was unfair to kick him. Sure enough, dal rends drops and he wins on his first UBRS run (from his words). 
---
A week later I won Brutality Blade, though.
---
i dont think people here understand how much of a meme sulf is.
---
if youre a big boy you farm and pay for it yourself, not crowdfund it.
---
Being squishy, using manashield and not blocking all indicate he's in arcane raid spec. Not much u can do in pvp with that
---
Why would a warrior want that?
---
i mean its way faster
---
I am comfortable with progress resets after 2-3 years.
---
But BFAs resets every 6 months is just too much.
---
I do this when I don't want to get up and look for my authenticator.
---
&gt;And you can't just change your looks.
---
Oh god yes. Thank god there's no transmog.
---
There should be a TSM button in ur crafting menu
---
I did the same when I saw that, was great
---
You'd have a priest maybe as healer. Paladin, Warrior tanking. Leaving 2 dps which should be plenty as you'd also be dps'ing.
---
Thank you! And that I did know
---
Pretty much any class can farm them just as well, you just need a lesser invis pot for 1 pack of trash, i can normally get 25-30 of them per hour, plus killing tinkerer just to kill some time so i dont hit the cap. So the only difference between a druid/rogue/mage is not needing a potion to skip a single pack.
---
Some of those pre-raid resto spots look interesting.
---
1) Mindsurge over robes of the exalted
---
2) Insightful Hood over Clever Hat
---
3) Demonic Guille (DMe ring) over the LBRS ring
---
4) One mindtap trinket+ Reed. No second wind even though Mp5 is greater in less than 2 minute fights. They didn’t even suggest second wind before Dire Maul.
---
Some questionable choices I think.
---
Edgy.
---
If they added TBC they would 100% give us flying mounts. It would be like giving us WoW vanilla without the old Honor System. Love it or hate it, flying mounts were a TBC thing. And I firmly stand on team hate it.
---
Getting Vanish made rogue leveling so much better.
---
I do this because I put the mobile Authenticator on my account and on my guild wars account but it’s my old phone number and neither company will let me reset it so fml huh
---
&gt; A 32/8/11 paladin spec and pretend to be a retribution paladin in dungeon groups
---
But you're not a ret pally. You're DPSing as a holy pally because even you think holy is better.
---
What is 3% crit on 4 of them worth to the raid?
---
I have nothing to base my judgment on besides what this guy posted in Discord. The guild might be fine, might be shitty, I don't know. All I do know is the post was written by someone who takes the game VERY seriously. And if you're going to be that serious about loot, you should be just as serious about selecting a guild that respects and rewards your dedication.
---
There will always be new guilds forming and new players playing. To say that no new progression guild will start mc in p3 is not even close to true.
---
Fun as hell though in PvP.  But I'm a ret paly so what so I know about fun right?
---
Idk, internet / server speed is one of those that should have been upgraded with the screen resolution. Casting sweeping strikes + cleave is the funkiest thing I’ve ever seen, where the second hit of the cleave gets put on the next batch—it’s like an auto attack delayed by half a second after it hits. 
---
2004 okay. 2019? Away with the lag.
---
None. Because levelling is half the fun.
---
Monster condoms and magnum dongs
---
You could simply take out actions from players who aren't in your faction, which wouldn't disturb the PvE part and solve the PvP problem, but the question is if they want to actually do it.
---
More guild drama. Not my guild, not my problem.
---
You want to prove Blizz wrong, unsubscribe. Your subscription is the only reason they're spacing out the phases.
---
Oh for sure.
---
Also, where was Kai on the night of the murder? Why does no one remember seeing him after 9pm, right around the time our victim went missing? Why did he have lipstick on his collar?
---
If all this stuff is true, it makes sense to get mad and quit, but if this is how he quits a guild I'd love to see what happens when he resigns from a job or breaks up with his S/O.
---
&gt;Thalnos US
---
Must be hard locking down an empty server 🥱
---
Some people just have to complain about every post here. Typically they don’t even read the whole thing properly
---
From all their complaints it seems they take their satisfaction from subtly abusing people they don't like because "nurses run this shit."
---
"I used a larger gauge needle/catheter than strictly necessary and then jiggled it just to fuck with him tee hee."
---
You can do something similar with Distract if you don't have imp sap.
---
My guild on Thalnos did that last night too!
---
There's nothing more annoying to a healer than a dps trying to be the offtank that no one asked for.
---
Sounds like he wants to be in a hardcore guild wjere everyone runs at BiS with meta talents. Not everyone has fun doin that, its fun to try shit out. Find a guild that fits you better, instead of throwing a fit when you dont get ur way.
---
Thats the point, you need to be pretty well geared to pull off this style of tanking and have a group geared enough to support this method of tanking.
---
Water is free to make and you use 1h buffs just to save time. If you give people 30 min buff they not gonna complain. Also, those things help the group. Opening a chest so other can loot it does only help that person.
---
Do non skinners roll for leather from the dead mobs? Do non miners roll for ore? If you have the skill, the mats are yours, isn't it?
---
And that's why being a rogue is the best
---
I would blade flurry+Evasion to quickly kill 2 mobs. Was a nice burst every 5 minutes.
---
Good to know
---
Or worse, in retail you (somehow) come across a situation that is a little tougher, so you think a bit, come up with a plan using a unique aspect of your ability....and then it doesn't work, either because Blizzard intentionally barred that method as an unacceptable method or that the game is just so janky now that it's hard to predict how certain mechanics will interact.
---
true. 
---
still, its future proofing for when blizz totally does tbc classic, right guys?
---
I get this too. Only on Classic though. Scared the tar out of me the first time.
---
The truth hurts so bad.
---
Why is the raid taking so much damage? Unless you are including overhealing...
---
Does shadow resistance help resisting fears from Warlocks?
---
Goldmansacks
---
Same here. I've tried everything...
---
Best part is that that guy looks just like the dude from South Park and uses potions in mc...
---
It’s pretty cool to see other players take wide paths around you just to avoid you hoping they don’t catch you at a bad time
---
Warrior is the only proper answer
---
Leveled one in vanilla
---
And leveled one again to 60 in classic after playing a hunter to 41.
---
I just love pain and suffering apparently because ontop of all this I'm also a solo player and play a warrior alone.
---
Ret paladin.
---
People act like right clicking, blasting anime music, hammering of sit down, fat crits, bubble heal,lay on hands, lol cant 1v1 me,bubble hearth, rogue gear is ret gear and judgment ass is boring.
---
But what every
---
I betcha 5 gold that the one dude in the friend group on the LC was bitching and implied to the rest of the LC that they would all leave. That's absolutely corrupt. And the guild lead should've seen that coming
---
That's why if you see a friend group joining your guild or raid, then you better make sure they're easily replaceable or there's gonna be some trouble eventually
---
I guess I got lucky. Due to transferring to a new server (heartseeker) I was in one of the first groups to hit 60. I joined the only guild with other 60s, as no guild had transferred yet. 
---
Server went from low pop to consistently high pop over the next month, with several guilds transferring as a group, 
---
I’m still with my original guild, full t1 set. I only need Ony items right now, but I still raid just to help out the guild. 
---
We used full DKP with reserved items only for the primary tank. This was told to everyone before the first raid and it’s worked out very well. Thanks to some luck the tank was nearly fully kit in just 3 raids, so it’s been full DKP since. We can down ony/MC/rag in about 3.5 hours with a pretty healing-heavy comp. 
---
I guess it’s just luck? We also closed recruiting before raiding even started, and the toxic players slowly left over the course of the first month. Feels good. Most of us are leveling alts while we wait for phase 2.
---
I do this every time
---
I had no idea this was so common.
---
Or the fact that it's only really maximally effective against a horde of enemies all attacking you, but it doesn't increase your survivability either, so it can be a very fine line between enough mobs to do decent damage and few enough mobs to not kill you in 5 seconds...
---
I hate when you go afk, and you get kicked into the logging screen....
---
It's burnt into my monitor
---
A warrior of the opposite faction
---
If TBC comes out before 2021, I'm going to shank a gnome.
---
It’s pouring here in Michigan as well. Good day to stay in and play some WoW.
---
Speak for yourself. I'd take an insta 60. - Don't want everyone to, but I sure want it for myself!
---
Yeah there is one for classic, I found it, but it doesn't really do anything not sure what it's supposed to do, can't see anything =/.
---
Oh, don't let tanks get onslaught. Let your fury warriors get that.
---
The story of MoP was pretty bad(especially how Garrosh was handled) and I just found the Sha boring.
---
For me personally, I live in Japan as an English teacher, and some teachers have a specific "English room" for English classes which is also your office. So, you are away from people all the time and if you don't have any work to do, which is CONSTANTLY, you can just play games. We also often don't have classes in the afternoon or maybe one class so pretty much every english teacher leaves early lol. It's the easiest, cushiest job ever, but like any job, there are some downsides.
---
U should also practice it with a friend in duels so u can get the hang of it before trying it in world pvp
---
If you need ghost mushrooms: do dme jump runs. You find a lot of them
---
lol what?
---
I definitely do not know the reference.
---
Even those PvP ones look a bit sketchy. Why are they suggesting necropile boots and magister cuffs? Is there seriously nothing Mail or even leather worth wearing over those? Ya necropile is a good Stam set but trash otherwise. A mail stam set would be just as good if not better.
---
I like how all the info is laid out...some of their choices though are at least questionable.
---
the alliance are there... didnt you see the bones nearby?
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
I would also love to know the answer for this
---
So you don’t know where your money is?
---
I'm very wrong then
---
If you thought any lengendary loot was going to anyone when Kai was on the loot council you clearly ain't played wow long. Not a single fucking soul on this earth ever got anything over a council member in amy guild or any server. This game is rife woth entitled pricks and if you want to ever see legendary loot first in line you better make your own guild...
---
Always
---
Arms looks cooler, ergo, your opinion backed up by evidence and facts is invalid and unwelcome.
---
Mortal strike!
---
Fury warriors are nerds with small utensils.
---
Source: am a fury warrior.
---
Elfs for Hordes? Come on, nobody is gonna roll that!
---
FD resets your swing timers (melee and ranged)
---
I think I’ve perfected my setup/spec for this. Deep combat swords with prep, gnomish cloaking device. I can solo every boss: Ribbly, pugger, and fiery enchant guy; do the circuit including 12 coffers, and never not have an escape through vanish or cloaking. Only thing that ever kills me is vanish bugging so I consistently have to use two vanishes.
---
Abso-freakin'-loutely.  I also hate the way it defaults to retail in the launcher.
---
Just the way it goes ..... There are a ton of healers
---
That's the attunement I remember! Alliance version isin't the same
---
True. And while the point is 'to go back', it's also to get it right and not introduce things that turned people away last time. I wouldn't just want a repeat where everyone starts leaving when they get around to Dungeon Finder. :/
---
The tank melted. But tbh any decently geared healer can keep the tank up if they paid attention to the run properly. Just my 2c
---
But you could do that with anything, even in MC runs you could just not equip your BoP gear, win a need roll on a piece and then just vendor it after, if it's all about getting anything you can regardless on whether or not you need it then that's a perfectly fine way of doing things.
---
And it's not always the case that someone has took a hit to their wallet, just because someone else gains something doesn't mean every one has lost something, a caster dps can roll need on a caster dps libram, a melee dps can roll need on a melee dps libram, ect ect that system is totally fine, just because someone could need it to cheat other people doesn't mean everyone should constantly cheat each other by needing everything that drops, that's a solution that's just making the flaw the solution.
---
I wouldn't feel cheated if someone needed something to use, that's what entire loot systems work off of, I would however feel cheated if everyone started needing everything because they want to line their pockets for no other reason than 'it's only fair if everyone cheats', if I'm in a group with someone that needs BoE's for money then I'll avoid them thereafter, because there's no fun playing a MMO if everyone is only looking out for themselves.
---
Doesn't it just periodically check to see if one is targetable?
---
&gt; anyone else
---
I think you'll find it's everyone else
---
Cue Cyprus hill.
---
And few tanks
---
Wait is this right? I'm 99% sure mine defaults to classic, will check when home.
---
It does? It's been a few months now and after I played classic once it's remembered every time
---
You mean they have had a lot of free time on their hands. 95% of people playing the game still have things to do.
---
he ain't wrong
---
Literally doubling your damage output with a single upgrade makes you feel insanely powerful.  Leveling from 30 to 40 with this is by far the easiest time leveling a warrior will have till 60
---
But the loot council decided to put it up as a roll instead of giving it the most deserving. Can you imagine not giving first bindings to tanks instead of rolling between all warriors and rogues?
---
Wait till its starting to rot and post again for double karma
---
Also blizzard scales terribly
---
Amazing... Some people take this game WAY too seriously
---
I absolutely support this, but wrong sub :P
---
but the priest who dispelled first didn't actually dispel the MC. his somehow went through to the buffs or am i reading it incorrectly
---
I think most needed is tank&gt;...................&gt;heal&gt;dd. (For dungeons)
---
Big difference between it being obsolete every expansion and it being obsolete 6-7 times per expansion.
---
Not to mention the fact that naxx gear is better or equal to t1 in tbc.
---
Horde locks are touch without salv, their dps is pretty capped. Not sure I have a great solution for that. Make sure they are the right specs, with the notes about destruction and demology, I am a little bit concerned if they are actually am/ruin or ds/ruin (the two real raid dps specs). Alliance warlocks even now can and do top dps charts (with full consumes and PI). 
---
There are definitely some issues with comp, but nothing fatal as far as I can see. Make sure your druids aren't all HoTing of course. Make sure your groups are good, not like you have in the image. Make sure melee groups have WF etc. You probably do that, just making sure.
---
I think it's fine to be slow in MC at first and as your group gets more comfortable and better gear, you will get better and eventually clear in one night, then in 2 hours, then maybe faster. You can't really expect a bunch of randoms to emulate APES and just walk into MC with greens and only 2/3 of the raid at 60 and just one shot every boss with no deaths in 2 hours. MC is pretty easy but it isn't THAT easy. If your guildees are discouraged and want to be hardcore competing for speed clear times, though, there may be some issues.
---
I feel the same thing on Heartseeker. Spamming LFG for any of end tier dungeons and it sometimes takes hours, if at all. 
---
When Dire Maul opened there six other priests sitting in the east doorway with me coz no one needed us.
---
I do the same thing every time I accidentally click the ~~logout~~ back button.
---
and sometimes it's just a game, and if someone (who isn't an actual child) spends more than ~10 seconds thinking about it in real-life terms, like justice or recognition, they should take back and take a really good look at their life. 
---
There are things in life that really demand sacrifice and passion and thus warrant such concerns, stuff like this means one isn't engaging in those enough.
---
Waaaaaaater sucks, it really really sucks!
---
Get ursius from winterspring. He looks baller as fuck
---
LC was a thing in 05?
---
Probably a browser issue. Try a different browser.

Even the game is telling you to

From what I have seen on the posts from this subreddit, world PvP on PvE servers is pretty much non existent at this point.
---
A lot of the players on PvE servers that are at the endgame have complained that there is no real PvP option that doesn't involve getting 3-4 people to attack them first.
---
All day erry day!
---
100% so I don't have to out it the authenticator number
---
&gt; We have 3 people who are equally deserving. HoR has no value to progression, so we’re giving the deserving people an equal shot.
---
Psh, the real big brain move is to never use the bnet loader at all. The true classic experience!
---
Actually, when I try to log in from the main screen it says *account not found*, so I actually have to close and relaunch -.-
---
Yeah 95% of people won’t be High Warlord either.
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
Why?
---
Still better than Cc.
---
I'm not quite sure what's my username and password...
---
everybody wants to top the dps meter while disregarding that some synergies help the overall team dps
---
the classic experience!
---
If calling someone out for coming across as rude is gatekeeping then fine, I'm a gatekeeper
---
Only from the perspective of game-mechanics.
---
It depends on the dungeon. Scholo and Strat UD/Live don't have much/any good tank loot, so only feral druids and fury warriors join those dungeons. 
---
Also, don't waste time advertising yourself. You should be PM'ing other people who are looking for people. Everyone I know and seen simply post 'LFM [Dungeon] [Run type]' and wait for whispers to come in.
---
I mean, it's a game that no matter what should come at best 2nd to a persons real life responsibilities.  I've missed raids because I had to work or things that take priority over WoW. To say this other person,  who could be trying their best, should have a 0% chance of getting it just because you no-life wow and they might not be able to is pretty selfish IMO.  Get your head out of your ass and respect the rolls like the rest of us.
---
Yeah, surely rag would have submerged with most people lower than that..
---
Who knows their password
---
Is that the way the groups are organized? If not, it looks completely fine. 
---
You have lots of mages, that's great. Try to get a single mage to go for the crit debuff, then have the rest go arcane/Frost. 
---
Resto shamans provide the same utility as enhance, so don't worry about that. Get windfury going for melee classes. If they want to drop mana tide just have a raid leader switch them fast.
---
Your locks should be doing decent dps, figure out what their struggles are.
---
4 prot warriors is too many, have a few switch to fury. Your number of rogues makes up for the lack of fury's. I would switch one or two druid to feral as an off tank and melee buffer.
---
Group buffs are typically group only, so maximize group buffs.
---
I really hope that's not how your groups are actually organized. 
---
You have lots of locks and lots of healers, maybe try using one as shadow.
---
You guys realize there are limited debuff slots? Make sure they are optimized.
---
Honestly, everything looks fine. Try to figure out who is playing bad and help them play better or consider replacing them.
---
First one to affect the target I should've said, but you're right it's not the first priest who cast. 
---
Long story short: Don't have two people dispelling the same MC target at the same time.
---
I also play games at work. My job is mostly waiting for people to call in in need of roadside assistance between the hours of 12-6. Not a lot of people on the road that time of night.
---
Yeah i keep seeing a guy in my groups, orc shaman, OneFish and TwoFish, nice enough guy. Dont entirely see the problem unless youre getting hit by this guy and his 40 accounts..
---
Lol if you cant handle pvp reroll on another server or change factions.
---
What does this have to do with classic wow?
---
None.  I can’t imagine the learning curve of having a 60 with all of their abilities without having learned them coming up.  Obviously it wasn’t earned the “natural way” but I just felt fake.
---
Try running out of the building sideways, or strafing a bit when you get outside. The game is lazy about updating your position when you're moving forward (updates every couple seconds), but does it instantly when you strafe. It's like this in retail, too, unless they changed it since wod. 
---
This is separate from spell-batching.
---
Get the bear talents, forget about the miniscule armor bonus and just go full threat
---
Depends when you went. At 8pm server you didn’t come through searing gorge for a few hours.
---
Zesty clam meat had me dying.
---
Lotta guilds are run by no lifers and WoW is their life. Don’t forget this game attracts some serious low lifes.
---
Motherfucker, you want me to *TYPE MY PASSWORD*?! LMAO try again, Blizztards.
---
Blasphemy. #NOCHANGES
---
This is too real. Then they get an app that can use your biometrics for a login so you use it and it makes you put in your password again and you only get 3 attempts before you have to call their customer service line to get your shit reset. Then they get pissy because you don’t know your account number, because you just login online to find that out and then you have to be giving your social security number and some magic pin that they can’t tell you how many numbers it is, but you need to know because you only use two pins ever and you’re like, man, I don’t even want to know the payoff amount anymore. I’m just going to throw some amount that is 10 to 50 dollars more than the payment I’m used to in this account and let these assholes figure it out if they want to get paid. 
---
Moral of the story: Never let the dealer figure out financing for you. Local-ass credit unions with their bullshit web services.
---
I think it's kinda BS, but I'm very biased since I'm a hunter. Only we should be able to see people from the enemy faction not directly in front of us! Not to mention it makes aspect of the beast even more useless
---
Oh ok. I only learned herb for DM e. My priest buddy got mining and enchanting.
---
I'd say all-mechanics.
---
What do you mean?
---
The 60 never even fought back. Player controlled npc
---
&gt; Never get between a dedicated NEET and his loot!
---
But HE deserved it!!!
---
Yeah if I had your reading comprehension level I’d come to that conclusion as well.
---
People dont like that one human is able to click one button and kill them at instant speed.
---
The problem is the bosses in lfr have less abililties and nothing you do matters. If you're playing lfr you're not decursing, you're not CCing, you're not using cooldowns, you're not dodging aoes, you're not doing any of the things that make raid combat entertaining.
---
LFR sucks because players who don't know what raiding is like (Or at least who haven't experienced modern raiding) run it and think that this is what raiding is, but LFR is nothing like a real modern raid. The visuals really are the only similarity. But why would a new or returning player bother to try normal after the unrewarding and frustrating experience that is LFR?
---
kid thinks ganking is pvp
---
It’s savings until it’s spent
---
I mean if you know Kai, then have him tell his story. Everyone here isn't picking up any torches and pitchforks over this, they are just stating their opinion for the dialogue "as is" seeing as the OP didn't say one way or the other there really isn't much else to go off of. It's pathetic to not believe something based on nothing.
---
The hero we need
---
yes! i agree! :) i added the Humor flair cuz this was just a funny moment in wow. i think people took this abit to serious! LOL but yes no was expecting that pull right after the boss as the mages needed more mana than me! and if i really expected him to die THAT fast i would ofc PW:shield
---
Oh god who's phone is this?!
---
I think you are missing the point. There is a difference between having to be on guard and not being able to do anything at all about being outnumbered in ever zone all the time. 
---
Out of curiosity, what is your server/faction?
---
Yeah thats what I said. You said the game should not be catered to those who can barely play it. Those people make up the majority. Which is what I said.
---
This is why I use a password manager. While it doesn't auto ever got wow,I can at least look up the info on my phone.
---
Thos is because every single account I use had a separate, randomly generated password. Said manager isn't easily accessible to others either
---
It would have gone to the reliable enhance, but the shitty enhance managed to force it to be a roll since he’s on LC.
---
I mean its the truth isn't it?
---
Another one along these lines is “Shitcunts”. It’s also used either endearingly or to describe a bunch of useless mongoloids. Pay close attention to context here.
---
It’s crazy how virtual currency corrupts people so easily.
---
Meeting stone*
---
Ive got maybe 10 rares and 1 epic over weeks of farming. Epic was the poopy ass shaman shield that sells for 10g and it dropped off scarabs.
---
In the process of helping a friend do the same and it's hard, especially this far from release.
---
Number one thing is to organize and run successful PUG MC and Ony and recruit off that. Get people some loot and show that you're competent/organized/fair/not a dick etc. 
---
Recruiting in trade/general before doing the above is an excercise in futility. People aren't going to join a tiny guild based solely off your words.
---
Another thing you can is log in to retail. OP says he played until WOTLK, so it’s reasonable to assume he has a level 80, which is plenty high enough to solo vanilla dungeons and see how the mobs patrol, where they’re located, and get a feel for the layout of the dungeon.
---
I took a very long break from WoW and forgot most of the dungeon layouts. I’ve used Retail to familiarize myself with BRD, DM, MC, and BWL (for the future) and it’s helped with leading groups tremendously.
---
Oh really? Somehow I thought it was a guaranteed skin.
---
Come to think of it, if it was a guaranteed drop, it wouldn't be that rare or valuable.
---
Thanks for telling me. Now I can tell myself that most likely I didn't lose anything.
---
I have noticed this, too.
---
Pshhhhhh a honest rogue =p
---
Oh ok, yea in that case, only letting the tank die is a pro move
---
I remember the last time this was posted.
---
I don't know, but as soon as they announced DM was coming out in a few days, the price went up. People were complaining about in trade chat and stuff.
---
Dude a gnome singing little people would be hysterical !
---
Did the naxx encounter ever happen canonically in vanilla? Like why did they just re use it in wotlk?
---
how about you take the time to make your own raids and then you can make up whatever rules you want
---
&gt;Ret paladins are most useful when you are in shit group
---
Noted.
---
Holy shit I thought I was the only one
---
Ah a fellow MRE connoisseur.
---
I've maybe seen 3 people flagged for PvP on my PvE server. I killed one. I even have a screenshot to prove it!
---
Shaman. Seem to be the most sought after class on my server. I could probably even do totem twisting enhance
---
Could be saving for epic mount
---
I joined a guild called Savages in Alliance Incendius and I genuinely expected the worst. They were working on forming their raid 2 group and I had to wait a few weeks before we could go to MC. I stuck around, met a few of them in discord, and just did my best in raid. I have been playing this game for a long time and after mythic raiding and pushing mythic keys I found the classic gameplay to be quite relaxing. I performed very well, I loved chasing pre-bis but I never really did dungeons with the guild. People had their groups and I was mostly pugging and often struggling to find groups to do anything. Turns out they gave me priority in benediction for being around the longest and so far I have gotten t2 helm, t2 legs, onyxia trinket, and t1 shoulders. They helped me run a few live starts to get gold for my hide of the wild and a rogue in the guild spent 3 hours killing elites with me to farm my eye of shadows. 
---
People can be surprising in positive ways. They have been very nice to me despite barely playing with me for the first month I joined.
---
Stop with that *helpful advice* already. Why would anyone do that if you instead can make a reddit cry post that will change literally 0 things?
---
Ret provides literally nothing, unlike ferals, oomkins and shamans
---
Bad trolls hate logic I get it bro.

I just want my T2 helm and Trinket from Ony already...my guild runs 5+ shamans meanwhile pugs struggle to bring 3. 
---
I could give two shits if someone reserves the head, I want the loot I need.
---
The reason people make PuG groups with the head reserved? Because people join them so why the fuck not
---
Not sure if the game loads fast regardless, but with an SSD this option is a must.
---
Also if the mob parties your attacks it's doing more damage to the tank, so you're making the healer's life harder too.
---
This has a total Leroy Jenkins vibe to it and I love it lmfao

If you’ve got the money buy a Kang the Decapitator, I used it from 44 to 60.

No one is logging in from the login screen. It's not secure.

Which is why I said "You are completely right"
---
You are Right. You are not wrong. It is not negated. Congratulations on your mage, hope you are enjoying it.
---
This is independent of the fact that the point was missed.
---
God forbid people pvp you on a pvp server
---
This isn't even a little relevant to classic! Ugh.
---
But that's what BiS means tho. There is only 1 true BiS, the other items are placeholders until you get your Best in Slot.
---
I honestly expect mostly replies like his, and I kind of get it I guess. The game is the game, but it is hard not to imagine a 50/50 server would be so much more fun!
---
Or just bop the healer
---
I gotta be honest. I felt this way initially but by now the magic is gone. I logged on retail and I just loved by moonkin combat so much more than wanding as a priest. I will likely not go back to retail thou since I need to catch up on so much stuff that I gave up.
---
Played since original beta 2004 after being a huge Warcraft III fan. I haven’t subscribed in about 2 years and am back.  It isn’t just nostalgia. It is one of the greatest video games ever and so pure and fresh in its original flawed form.
---
It’s also ran on the bfa engine not the classic engine
---
Your mental gymnastics are incredible, you truly belong on this website.
---
A majority of the player base is not people who can barely play the game, any realmpop website will show you that each server has more level 60s than any other level which is already different from Vanilla where a majority of the players never made it to 60.
---
The game has been out for two months, anybody who isn’t level 60 isn’t relevant and shouldn’t be treated as such. If you’re okay with paying a prolonged subscription for a 15 year old game then that’s fine, but waiting six months for the honor system is something even you can understand is foolish.

It’s super easy to take down multiboxers. Besides I don’t kill people unless they attack me first, no sport in taking down Simone my own level.

What is the name of the add-on?
---
Ok
---
Lol wtf. This just happened to me. Just started playing from a 6 year break
---
Tons of utility in pvp I’m the main healer for my raids and I chose pally to be pvping
---
Thats all i care about, as long as im a pain to kill im cool with it. I dont care about punishes for attacking me. Thank you.
---
&gt;I don't want to be that guy but casualisation is what made WoW shit in the first place. Let's not do that again. I am all for responsive combat, but not at the cost of the massively increased skillcap that emergent gameplay brings.
---
Please stop being so rational man.
---
First 2 weeks grobbulus (rp-pvp west coast) had queue times. This lead blizz to open more servers one being Deviate delight (rp-pvp east coast) where some people transferred off grobb to DD.

Something like that?  Will put you in caster form on a regular press, Cat form on shift, Bear form on alt.  Will switch directly from Bear to Cat or vice versa in one keypress.  And will powershift if you press the form you're already in.
---
You'll want the /cancelaura lines if you have those talents.  There's a bug that causes those talents to not get applied if you shift directly from Bear &lt;-&gt; Cat or powershift.
---
If you can't buy the ticket, you can't win.

It takes 10,000g+ to craft the hammer. If he couldn't afford 50g to respec to a halfway decent raid spec, there's no way they could fund the hammer.
---
Pretty sure you can’t do this.
---
I started in Vanilla as  NE Rogue. Then mained a NE Warrior throughout end of BC and beyond. I'm probably going to go Horde this time around and am wondering what everyone thinks about the east coast PvP servers including RPPVP. I have no real life friends playing so I'm just looking for a good community.
---
Still waiting for Titans to drop for me, refuse to buy the recipes. Enjoy your steady gold.
---
Looks realistic to me
---
As a hunter who raids with a ret pally, more ret pallys please, seal of wisdom makes me so happy, it's like an almost unlimited mana, so good
---
Nope, works for me.
---
Two factor authentication? More like Boo factor authentication. Amirite?
---
I did BRD to 57, LBRS to 58, and Strat to 60.
---
Get that tank to 60. Gear up in dungeons. No one wants you for raids. Those raid tank spots were taken weeks ago. Respec to dps or gtfo.... :(
---
Mine is named Banxie
---
Technically speaking, yogg is dead on retail but still alive in classic.
---
You have full permission to repost any of my stuff and claim the karma as long as my twitter tag is still in the image :)
---
Since my normal reddit usage is so lurkery the sudden influx of things to post actually has me breaking the self-promo rules so I need to either massively increase my shitposting in other threads or just post the images to twitter and let someone else make the reddit posts.
---
I did the same with a worgen mage. I liked the human appearance, but it reverts automatically in combat. 1% crit wasn't worth hating my character's appearance.
---
Agreed even a 100ms window would allow most of these interactions to happen. 200ms if you want to be certain they do. 
---
What people fail to realize is that your actual latency is stacked on top of the artificial spell batching which just makes everything feel awful.
---
If they dont remove it completely it should be atleast halved of not quartered.
---
Yeah theres way more levels 1-40 then there is 60. Shocking.
---
thank fucking god I’m not the only one lol this post hit me like a train
---
A month ago:  Remember how great WoW used to be?
---
Today:  *And here comes the drama.*
---
That's what I was thinking. I haven't done that yet since I thought it got consumed on cast, not on hit. I'll do it tonight though, ty.
---
You also can use Soothe on animals!
---
Yeah but what’s your name so I don’t have to group with you
---
Do hunters need on every drop?  Do rouge's pull on every sap?  Does everyone hate gnomes?  Glad I am not alone on this.
---
Chase
---
Of course. Daggers are amazing for fury warriors. Especially with edgemasters
---
Yes, the best PvP healer is a bad idea on a PvP server.
---
THEN WHO WAS PHONE?
---
If all this guy has said is true, I basically shared his position (priest, disc to holy, though) in a guild on WoD and Legion. And there I indeed had priority over the other priest (who would not abandon disc) and over all the other healers (mid you, one of them was the GM/RL/LM).
---
I can't imagine how pissed I'd be to have priority in fucking Classic. Thank God I'm only at level 40.
---
The issue doesn't lie with people farming it or its droprate, it's because people are hoarding them for when it really becomes useful. The lotuses are here, just not for sale.
---
BOOK
---

---
GRUDGES!
---
&gt;:(
---
And youre now on it too
---
I read up on online guides as well and thought I could de-aggro the pet while I kite Simone. but I couldn't. So I improvised on the spot, I spent all my mana on slowing/stunning Precious and just auto shot Simone. But of course I made sure she's  always OOM. Neither of them hit particularly hard so I even swing in a few wing clip onto Precious when both Scatter and Concussive are on cooldown. Managed to kill her on the first attempt.
---
Good luck, fellow hunter!!!
---
Thanks. I didn't know to look for phases, so now I know.
---
Ahh, someone who likes to be **told** what to do. I like it.
---
Definitely not the only one. Also, with the possibility of keyloggers, they have a harder time getting your password if it's only clicks and not typing in your password every time.
---
Depends on your faction. 2h fury is much more viable for horde with windfury.
---
The entire point of making your own group is so that you can dictate the loot rules, that's literally always been the case with pug raids. You join it knowing there will likely be restrictions so you take the 10 seconds beforehand to ask what's on res.
---
And that website only shows peoples data that have uploaded that data. Its not accurate.
---
But there is also the best way to farm them.
---
Here's how you do it:
---
You should have 2 Greater Nature Resistance potions and a big mana potion for each attempt. The potions aren't needed, but they are a helpful crutch.
---
The pet will NOT despawn. It is totally possible to trap Simone and kill her pet, but it is much easier to trap her pet and then kite them both. 
---
Wait until shes at the northern part of her route, near the hot springs. Drink one Greater Nature protection potion before the fight so you have your pot CD. Place a freezing trap (for her pet). you can hit her with concussive so the pet reaches the trap first. Then you kite her around the smaller of the two hot spring lakes (use Aspect of the Cheeta). The pet will eventually catch up, but you can kite it easily with concussive.  Any time Simone tries to cast, hit her with Viper Sting (it must be max rank). And that's it. A few laps around the pond and she should die. Feign death at the end and the hound will leave.
---
Oh you dont? Allright let me call mr j allen brac and let him know that they should release p2 now.
---
My bad. I’m such an idiot! I thought I read in one of your comments that it was Elvui. I reread your comments and am baffled that I thought I read that somewhere!
---
Sword on an Orc. Nice.
---
Ah, good to know you didn’t look at the graphs at all because they don’t count level 1s.
---
Also there are more active players at 60 than inactive levelers, but I guess that doesn’t help your narrative either.
---
Replying to you hurts my head, have a good one.
---
It’s fine. If you don’t wanna pug ony find a guild that lets you roll on it.
---
I mean, if a tank doesn't mark then 99% of the time their focus will be whichever mob they shoot/charge/faerie fire.
---
Mine still works, original battery. I need to know what kind of battery they use for that. Clearly better lifespan than a phone battery.
---
Man you Redditors really like that joke huh
---
I still don't know my password or account name which I should type in. Bnet is only way I can login.
---
You do realize the item was rolled on and the poster lost the roll? 🍥
---
I mean, its not the guys fault he could roll the item. He got opportunity and he used it. The problem lies in a guild and their 'council' that both shamans are worthy. That's all.  
---
Don't hate the guy that won it.
---
Looking to raid mc tonight as feral. First proper time in the place really. Will be doing mostly dps in cat. Currently at 4% hit with blue shoulders (Spaulders of the Unseen - 22 agi, 7 sta, 4 int). Also have a green quest reward with another +2 hit on it. That would put me on 6% hit.
---
I know hit is important but should I still swap the blue for the green? I'd still be over 25% crit and 760 AP either way.  Please let me know.
---
If you don’t do this please stop playing 😂🤣
---
Sold it for 240g, I'd kill to be the one that bought it for that cheap.
---
The fact that twinked out toons will still get facerolled by 60s? Twinks kind of suck in wPvP
---
You can also curse of recklessness to make them hit the rogue harder
---
Wowhead is the only database that includes them, so it's hard to notice.
---
Paladin got the scariest combo in PvP . Bubble+Hearthstone is unbeatable
---
Haha, I'll put this where no one will find it! I'm a genius!
---
2 days later: fuck, where did I put that? I can't find it. I'm an idiot.
---
I was really curious what type of job allows that lol of course it would be nice to have a job that pays you do to nothing! That’s the dream xD
---
Ya fuck Yaanny
---
Then you spend 2h forming a pug and leading it. Half the people in ony pugs haven't done it before.
---
All that over 1200g. That's why I love wow drama.
---
FUCKME
---
No but mages op Nintendo nerf.
---
How convineint people forget mages have counters, too.
---
more pathetic than searching for other ppl comment history? 😂😂😂😂
---
have fun on 4 mc normie

Why? Less competition for rEaL-LiFeRs like yourself to farm rEaL fLoWeRs

Demand &gt; supply. I had my arcanite bars well before the dire maul announcement. I can’t speak to individual servers
---
You can also get more from the shoulders in MC.
---
I’m thinking it probably splits threat. I might try having the main tank stack with melee. Or the warlocks who always do do much threat.
---
Oh theres way more level 5-40s. Shocking. And that data isn't even accurate.
---
What levels?
---
The reason he got sulfuruas.
---
what realm is this? blast him
---
it's waaaaaay better than the popup though, since every time I got one I thought I was being invited to a group. Unless I'm actively talking in guild chat I don't even notice the notifications for blocked invites in the chat window
---
Yall might have been the guild outside mc down there. Every guild after y’all didn’t get through.
---
I can speak for myself here, i am in ome of the most dominant guilds on Herod Alliance and we are mainly a pvp guild with world pvp (40 man raid) at least once a week. Though we do pve for the loot obviously.
---
Absolutely not
---
Bubble hearth is the biggest Fuck you Horde! That you can do
---
It's better than a dwarf rogue stone form vanish
---
Laziness? I've always wondered as well. It always made tbc seem like a side story.
---
Bingo!
---
Perfect for aoe farming, dungeons, and only thing keeping you from being unstoppable in pvp is lack of imp cs. Still got blocks barrier and shatter.
---
As for raid you could respec if u want bigger numbers, but the content is so trivial it shouldnt be necessary
---
Like 100 times by now. Never seen it.
---
uh-huh
---
If a heal and a damage ability that kills a character through their current health land in the same tick, the damage hits first.
---
So you "heal" them, see the mana spent, but the person dies and your heal never lands on them.
---
It works , and when i get On tomorow , ill show you how
---
&gt;even easier pve rotation
---
Yep, 2 backstabs, SnD, backstab till SnD is about to fall off, backstab till SnD is about to fall off, repeat.
---
Nah you are just wrong AF
---
It’s cool. Probably most of our pvp knowledge is from Bgs anyways
---
Didn't know that. Regardless, the person I replied to said "in the launcher" so I doubt they meant the tray icon.
---
Lucky. Mine still works with original battery but somehow fell out of sync with my account. Stopped playing for \~2 years or so and ended up having to reapply the auth to my phone.
---
Someone’s mad they live paycheck to paycheck from McDonald’s while my mommy runs out and gets me tendies so I can farm lotus in my undies, haters stay mad
---
Theres more level 22-23s then 60s on Faerlina.
---
I hope you're right, look forward to the post!

Isn't that basically what black mageweave leggings are though?

---
I'm 2H fury because my guild doesn't give a flying fuck and I do it because why yes... Yes I will gladly take that 2H weapon because rogues can't use it and we already have 10 people ahead of me for loot. Oh we don't have paladins to roll against me for Ret meme spec? Happily... It is mine. Mwuahahaha
---
Yeah, it's a bit late (or a bit early) for April fools jokes, but here we are.
---
Could you explain how I’m wrong?
---
On two layers the spawn timer was 1:30-2:30. Now, on one layer, it is exactly an hour.
---
Because I would need to convince all of my friends to re-roll also, and doing that makes the problem even worse for others which is likely how we got to this point. Additionally, this is meant to point out the larger issue of server imbalance and the problems it causes.
---
I am guessing you are on the more populated faction on your server and can't relate at all, which is why you won't tell me.
---
Yeah I mean lorewise. Iirc they used it mainly because of how few people got to see it.
---
especially when you are killing shazzrah in 20s, that's when I'm most fun!
---
While the faction balance on your server is unfortunate, you can't really fault people on a PvP server for attacking someone of the opposite faction.
---
No they can be whatever you want as long as you fill the group. If you can’t fill a group then ya something has to change.
---
What's so scary about it?
---
I personally think BC or wrath was the best system. More spells, better rotations, but the world was still dangerous.
---
That said, I love classic and will be perfectly happy if that's all we get.
---
Accidentally shot at one of the mobs for the Hunter quest in Un’Goro, which I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to do, then the guy messages me “reported” like a 12-year-old. 
---
These are grown people lol never gets old
---
Go PvE or keep crying.
---
I'm surprised you took holy shock for the damage, originally I took holy shock with the idea being that it gives paladins something they lack, an instant cast ranged damage spell (judgement is basically melee) which is helpful for pulling as well as finishing a fleeing enemy.
---
The thing is that it's just so unbelievably inefficient that I don't think it's worth it even with that utility, its mana cost is absolutely ridiculous and its healing and damage are a joke, then as if that wasn't enough it has a 30 second cooldown so it's not even a meaningful DPS increase.
---
As soon as I got hammer of wrath which effectively fulfills the ranged finisher role way better than holy shock does I felt that having a ranged pull just wasn't enough utility to justify how shitty it is.
---
If you're planning to go deep in holy then you might as well take it, but if you went that deep just for holy shock it's not worth it imo, you only need about 21 points in holy (to pick up illumination and divine favour) to heal effectively. Obviously if you want to be an optimal healer you can pick up holy power too but for a hybrid build 21 points is all you need.
---
:,(
---
I know my login info and it just doesn't work... Fuck maybe I don't know my login info...
---
Moonkin and ele shaman can hit pretty neat DPS values for 30 seconds.
---
The sustained matters.
---
:( I didnt know man
---
Sure I can. Just did it.
---
But in all seriousness, I am not faulting them. I am just trying to point out that these severe imbalances lead to a large swath of the population having an inferior gaming experience, which is kinda crappy. I wish there was a fix that everyone liked.
---
Yup.
---
I don't really plan on raiding anyway
---
Your best option is to reroll else where and leave them standing around with no one to kill.
---
Just like i said. You can see in the weapon skill table having a 7 weapon skill difference brings you to 5% glancing. Thus +8 skill being the cap for glancing.
---
So neither is really free, both have pros and cons. Weird.
---
I completely agree here, it would have been on the list if I made a list of "awesome things rogues do" but I'm not experienced enough with the class to write such a list. 
---
Casters are often annoying to tank properly and deal so little physical damage that armor or block doesn't matter much at all. I'm just glad it's handled and isn't fucking with the healer.
---
I gatta ask. What is your server/faction?
---
Just switch servers. They’ll have a pretty gay time circle jerking themselves once everyone rerolls elsewhere
---
Nothing. It's really useful for security. 
---
I was just making a lame joke based around PC's (accurate) statement that it was inconvenient. 😁
---
Yep, ours got locked with a password after some cunt started mass banning people for no reason.
---
If you like to eat and watch tv while you play it’s pretty awesome
---
Yeah it's active but when I'm joining the group it's usually me sitting in that party and waiting 30 mins for them to recruit other parties. Again I was doing brd arena/anger runs so I can imagine people who needed gear from that has already got them.

Hey now, warriors with Lionheart helmet may show it off. Also you can also look at weapons if they are orcs.
---
Thats my plan, ty
---
Really? This shit is one of the most annoying things in the game lol. I'm going to try strafing, thankyou.
---
resilience ruined pvp
---
Fuck you, don’t tell me what to do.
---
&gt;but there is a difference between PvP and getting absolutely rolled over and over again so often that you aren't able to progress through leveling.
---
There isn't, though. That's world PVP. It's unfair, unbalanced, and that's why many people like it. If you want fair fights wait for BGs. 
---
Like you said man, it is what it is. It sucks but Blizz isn't going to force people to roll a specific faction in an effort to balance things out. Your only option is to either find an Ally dominated server, or just re-roll/transfer to PVE.
---
Now that you mention it tbc should have come after wotlk, story wise.
---
Lol get downvoted noobie, hunter is infinitely more difficult than druid in classic. Literally every expert says hunter takes a lot of skill and has the highest skill ceiling.
---
Well then you would be fine and very welcomed as a tank
---
Only difference between retail and classic is getting BiS on retail is near impossible and just grindy has hell in classic.
---
There's really not that many min-maxers out there. Not in retail and not in classic, it's an overplayed card for when you fucked up and can't own up to it and like to fall back on.   There's absolutely nothing wrong with taking it easy and joking in group runs, pugs or guild, there is nothing wrong with silent runs. Everything you have said that makes the game great was present in retail and was present after dungeon finder, every shitty thing that you mention that was in retail is present here in classic as well. The only difference was it happened at a much faster pace in retail.  
---
If you took all the communities of WoW and see all the complaints of dungeon finder those you would think there is a gigantic group of  altruistic people and it shouldn't be a problem it has, but in my experience its these medium-rare player who are usually the most toxic of the communities, they remember the small acts of good because its so far and few between.  The "elitist" group are usually the most helpful, I have rarely met someone who is a "min/maxer" who wasn't willing to explain or walk through something slowly with someone when asked or spend a bit more time to help someone with something.  
---
Maybe talk less and act more.
---
As an ally who play pvp serv. I would suggest you to move to a pve server cuz I love to kill every horde I see and I wont give them any chance. I'd do it as long as they're there and this is how I like to play wow. And there is a lot of people like me in both faction. Your letter would just make me go harder
---
I don't know why there is so much misinformation in this threat indeed. This is the correct answer. A pet with screech will give you the least downtime in between killing mobs.
---
&lt;3
---
Indeed.  Everyone should have one!  I think I understand a thing or two about lame jokes :D
---
It 100% doesn’t affect xp whatsoever , my buddy on a warrior tags 4 mobs at a time I throw a renew on him (60 priest ) then smite / mind blast the mobs till they are dead ... and repeat!  currently he is getting 85k/h in  EP killing level 53-57 elites
---
A true hero
---
I would think that this isn’t really the case on Horde as Ferals don’t get wind fury?
---
What is your server/faction? I am asking everyone but nobody wants to say.
---
You sound like a worthless scrub who should play retail, worthless trash.
---
Has anyone experienced phantom Power Word: Shields in groups with a priest? I just healed a group through ZF. During the pyramid fight, as I shielded party members, the tank also got shielded. This happened twice, wasn't a UI bug as the tank saw it on his screen too.  Curiously, my Grid setup couldn't track the duration of the cast, leading me to think it didn't come directly from me.
---
But the holy paladin cant dps. A ret/holy hybrid can do both.
---
I'd argue that "pleading your case" to most LC would basically just be begging, which probably wouldn't help you.
---
The way it's worded makes it seem like the decision to roll it was a last minute thing honestly, though it could of course be different
---
Exactly this.
---
[WHAT YEAR IS IT?](http://www.whatyearisit.info)
---
Same here and the lfg channel is is absolute cesspool at night
---
these children don't WANT fair fights. that's why they're rolling 4 deep on an unbalanced server in the first place
---
in short: you're asking for empathy and understanding from the wrong type of person
---
Why not go feral?
---
Why should an entire guild drop its entire bank on making a PvP weapon for 1 player?
---
Every time.
---
I didn't even know it asked for your authenticator at the login screen, I have not logged in there since before battle.net existed
---
Hey I am on DD alliance. It's not just horde theres just too many healers. It's seriously easier to find a group as dps. I'm currently leveling an alt dps and sitting on my priest at 56.
---
Cries in Gandling EU, 25g each
---
I dunno, I didn't really enjoy it when I was leveling in feral. I prefer casting/healing. (I know, "why bother playing a Druid then?" but I've dedicated so much time to this character.)
---
So so much faster
---
People weren’t lying when they said balance is bad
---
I'm talking in raid scenario.
---
No, not laziness lol...its because literally 99% of players didn't get thru it and they wanted more players to experience it without it being trivialized.
---
yes
---
Go feral lol. Leveling like that sucks.
---
Just reroll or transfer. It sucks that imbalanced pvp servers exist but take control of your own destiny my dude. Horde Faerlina since you asked
---
prototype
---
Get good gear
---
I don't have any definitive answers, but in my experience the people that play during the day typically the ones that have a lot more free time (Obviously there are exceptions like graveyard shifts), and invest themselves into the game a lot more which can create some nasty interactions.
---
On the other hand, it feels like people that play mostly at night are typically coming home from school, work or other responsibilities and likely aren't going to be as frustrated because they only get a little while to play the game, and unless they're already pissed off, they probably are too busy trying to do something to be toxic.
---
I'm just gonna say I'm your polar opposite
---
Sounds like a corrupt loot Council and shitty guild environment, also that kai dude sounds like he didn't deserve eye.
---
Guess we have our priorities different.  If I was a NEET devoting my life to sulf I would 100% have that convo beforehand.  I would also feel fine if I didn't care enough to have said convo.
---
At the same time maybe he just assumed he would get it and was blindsided.
---
Also happens on pvp
---
We just had a mage gquit over not being able to roll on mageblade. We’re a loot council guild and had 4 people roll (basically the people with perfect attendance who have put effort in to get full pre-bis and have continued to preform well).
---
The dude who gquit has the ZF staff and had made only half the raids (we’ve been raiding for over a month).
---
I just find it pretty funny that someone who spends 3h every single day  on WoW on average is seen as a casual - that's the only point I was trying to make. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No judgement however anyone wants to spend their free time - I just find it remarkable that on this sub that is what a casual player looks like to many people.
---
Get a leveling partner.
---
Bragging rights are a very helpful recruiting tool.
---
I like how you blocked out his name every time except when you whisper them
---
You can say that about literally every piece of gear
---
Mage. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
Oh man that’s a little disappointing. But hey, esch has its playstyle I guess.
---
Same damn issue. Even if I did, I'm too lazy to type that shit.
---
Why is this petty shit getting so much attention?
---
Same here on Blauxmeux-Horde
---
Also legit would not be able to login without the app.
---
Day time wow is for questing and grinding. Night time is for dungeons.
---
Is that good or bad I'm dumb
---
this is why our guild reserves the right to loot council items and we have a list of things we send them that we'd like to get if it ever comes down to a point of contention where a new guy would get it but we need it.
---
Maybe you would enjoy lvling an alt and doing all the quests you missed?  Rogue pre-bis is spread thru all instances BRD and up so it would be a reason to go to them as well.
---
I know I'm late af but is this really faster than the drowning off the coast of dun morough to avoid the wetlands run? Seems like it's about even between running from astranaar (or even further if you're still questing in darkshore) to barrens versus waiting for the boat then autoswimming south from menthil. Plus then you're right by Ironforge vs being in westfall
---
God forbid people want to actually do something other than pvp every time they log in.
---
"Anyone interested in trying a fury/slam spec?"
---
It happened lorewise. From Wowpedia:
---
&gt; Kel'Thuzad was the last encounter of the dungeon Naxxramas, implemented in the Patch 1.11, and was the end game boss of the original game of World of Warcraft. He was ultimately defeated by the players, but does not die. As a lich, he may reform using a magic item known as a phylactery. Had Kel'Thuzad's phylactery been destroyed along with him, Kel'Thuzad would have been defeated forever, but some things do not happen as they should.
---
&gt; The quest [60R] The Fall of Kel'Thuzad describes how the player, who likely wanted to destroy the phylactery, is manipulated by some mental force to give the phylactery to Father Inigo Montoy in Light's Hope Chapel. Something very unusual was going on there, and the Argent Dawn reported that the phylactery did not reach their hands. A traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn absconded with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.
---
either, but it's better to use lookingforgroup or lfg channel depending on what your server uses.
---
Hmm holy paladin heals or ret pally dps.. whih would most prefer?
---
I'm sure they cant have horde or alliance just running the opposing sides town, which will eventually be what happens. But it's the 2nd time around, I hope people will venture from the travelled path more this time.
---
Yeah the benefit of a 31 pt holy build is pretty minor over a 20-0-31 build
---
i remember them saying they werent going to mess with the loot tables in MC and just allow all drops in there even if they were added in later patches.
---
Not bummed out, but yeah 50-60 went way faster than i imagined. Looking back all of the leveling process went fast but i guess that happens when you already know the grind spots and quests.
---
He gquit in a rage.
---
I´d keep my eyes open for another guild tbh, a guild that allows that in their raids is bound to end up in some clown fiesta.
---
OP explicitly said “in dungeons”
---
or u can just pop evasion and burst the courier with adrenaline rush then vanish after it dies lol
---
It happened, there was some kind of story about Kel being rezzed though to account for it coming back.
---
As long as you are wearing a dress and healing, yes.
---
Hey, did you by any chance find an English community for retail on a Taiwanese server? I have been looking but had no luck. Made some characters and asked in general chat. no luck there either.
---
You're secretly a warrior main
---
You just dont know it yet.
---
REPORTED!
---
That's actually a good idea, thank you. Now I just need to make new friends, cause my usual ones quit Classic. hah
---
Feral.
---
Play at night if you're a solo player
---
Play during the day if you dont like being alone.
---
Agreed! Just a lil meme (also just one word). Have a good one my man ✌🏻
---
Everytime
---
How do you have so few buttons on your action bar at level 50?
---
I don't want to go feral just to have to respec in 10 levels lol
---
The world still was kind of dangerous in BC but it became a cakewalk in wrath
---
The answer is play on a pve server, getting ganked/camped/griefed is part of pvp.
---
yep, an alt was what I've been considering.
---
I am very aware of their strength, but then again, as you can see yourself I am getting a bunch of mixed replies to my questions. It doesn't give me the best vibes, not gonna lie.
---
For example, it's universally agreed that, say, Warrior is the worst class for leveling, or... Mages are the best AoE farmers. Whether Hunters are actually decent and competitive though, people continuously give me different replies. Not to mention lots of people are telling me the FD mechanics are working, then more people telling me they don't. I'm conflicted.
---
Did you know: 2H fury can do just as much dps and alleviate loot competition, even on alliance

Nope.

His name is clearly Ezèkiel
---
Havent gotten there yet, what am i supposed to not do?
---
you shouldnt even be able to roll
---
that's not saying you arent valuable
---
that's not saying you wont get loot
---
but you get what you put in
---
if youre super busy but attend every single raid and have the appropriate pots, food, etc, you should def be getting equal chance at loot with those who do what you do
---
but if someone else does all that, but also gives the guild a bunch of stuff because they have no-life and play 24/7, they prob should get priority on specific items
---
likewise ppl who play less than you and raid less should have less priority
---
remember, duplicates drop
---
that item you want that goes to mr. no-life could easily go to you next
---
but it doesnt make sense to reward those who contribute less
---
I 100% understand life keeps you busy. I 100% have no problem in you missing raids or providing less, as long as you try and do well with the hours you do have. But you sure aint getting priority on the first drop. You get to pick up the 2nd or 3rd.

it is not hard but it can be EXTREMELY long and it's not even unnecessary, it's complete overkill for the current content

This came up in my guild last night and there's a warrior that primarily tanks that was adamant that it's a warrior weapon. I have a feeling that if it drops for us we're going to potentially lose a few shamans.
---
I’m just a layperson but I would expect the opposite. With too much time between ticks there may just be a massive batch of events trying to execute at once.
---
It wasn't until MoP that the daily grind became something you could "fall behind" on. TBC dailies were never like that, the only real problem was how isolated the areas were from leveling content.
---
I mean, I mark it as a win if a pally is willing to waste his hearth on me lol.
---
username check out
---
It is a status weapon and an advertisement for the guild.
---
I’ve ben leveling as feral. Gesr and talents are tank oriented.
---
However, lately I’ve been getting some int gear because I might respec to healing. 
---
Feral leveling is easy, and as a tank you find groups in a blink of an eye basically
---
This blew my mind. True. Things you want to do, not things you have to do. Damn. It's sad the state of the retail game.
---
"You weasel fuck"

It took me a month to figure out that my username was my email

Due to the odds at the time it was much more likely that the moon landing was real rather than fake so i don't know why you just assumed i thought it was "shot in a studio", but even if i was, that would still sound so much more sane than saying the earth is flat beyond the overwhelming amount of evidence contradicting that statement.
---
ya, i just realized that now, but it's a lv.1 rogue on one of dozens of server, so i'm not too concern.  a lv.1 rogue selling a 150g item threatening to report me for laundering money....that's why I couldn't believe how stupid the situation is.
---
One guy in my guild already has around 800 of them... Thats all he does...
---
I switched mine to my phone when classic released because of battery concerns. Got mine when Wrath was announced.
---
I mean, why would you ever join a raid if its garenteed that you wont get loot?
---
I’m just saying that DKP is the best solution. Just saying.
---
Shaman in my guild was out server's first R14. Hardly needed any raid loot. Ran in his pvp gear. Dropped WF totems as part of the melee group and spot healed.
---
The guy was a field general. Turned the tides of hours-long AV battles as soon as he showed up. He ran WSG premades with his brother (frost mage) and blew teams out.
---
And he never asked for an eye.
---
There are tons of posts here with the answer. We mages have tested it.
---
Yea cus I don't want to get up and grab my phone to deal with the authenticator and sms.
---
I like this idea, but revered as it has no reward at the moment. No need for the cooldown.
---
it was even better before battlenet, no email, weak passwords
---
Jokes aside it is actually just faster and easier. Otherwise I have to type out my password and then for some reason it'll want to authenticate. Or I can alt+f4, click a button and I'm back in.

I honestly wasn’t expecting a response because my first comment plainly states you’re looking for an add on so you can just be another mindless bot

That's only true for alliance.
---
This post aside, it's lazy of Blizzard to not improve the clipping on headpieces.

Even though people joke about it, you'd have decent success finding this on RP servers. They tend to take city defense as a bigger thing, especially once Phase 2 comes and people actually care about honor.

Run ulda for the sword and go sword spec. Makes the 40s a breeze
---
I'm not the leader and i'm new to Classic but usually i stay in the same group as our tank because i'm SM/Ruin, shamans give Windfury to rogues and our 2 fury warriors, in certain fights our leader moves a shaman or two because of a totem that removes fear or something like that. 
---
The locks are 2 SM/Ruin and 3 DS/Ruin, we put CoR, CoS, CoE and Agony for the 2 locks that dont have a curse assigned, everyone uses corruption too. It's not that the locks do ''no damage'' but compared to the rogues for example are really far behind and i think that's just a class thing, right?
---
Yeah, some shit is useless until later on (Thunderfury for example) but you can still get the pattern/requirements for them.
---
Interesting. I'm on the smallest Oceanic server haha might have something to do with it
---
I joined a loot council guild 3 weeks ago. I knew 0 people. We have 7 warlocks, and I was the 7th to join. For the first 2 weeks, I was raiding as a trial and got no gear. I was told this going in, so it was no surprise. During that same 2 weeks, I ran events with guildys, ran UBRS spams to help get 8 raiders reeds, did countless jump runs with the guild, etc. I made my presence known and did what I could to help where I could.
---
Last night I ran my first ony/MC clear as a raider and not a trial. I was awarded my t2 helm for being lock dmg leader on ony. I was also given the opportunity to roll on my BIS neck against only 1 mage, because we were the class dmg leaders on rag. The loot distribution has been completely transparent from everything I can tell.  
---
There are undoubtedly corrupt LC guilds. This is not always the case though. At the beginning of every raid, our guild has everyone not on the LC roll, and the lowest roll joins the LC for that week. Officer chat for the raid, full weight vote for them, the whole 9 yards. It can be a fair, transparent experience if that guild is willing to work to make it so.
---
I have decided that this is for me also haha

It's always funny seeing people like you break down. It happens the same every time. When they realize that their ideas can't compete the switch over to pretending like they were actually trolling the whole time.

when I first started playing, I had 5fps max in Tirisfal Glades and item icons were glitched

Ahh Intel Integrated Graphics 845G

I did it at a point where noone was running brd yet.

Anyone know where I can get a basic elemental shaman stat weight for pawn for classic? It doesn't have to be a perfect one, just something to go on. 
---
I tried googling but can only find retail pawn strings, even with refined searches.

The answer for tank pet is always Owl.

そちらこそお前どこまで馬鹿事いうかしら？恥ずかしく無いね？
---
Don’t worry, I am embarrassed for you.
---
Once you're 60 you'll have a bit of an easier time casting/healing but leveling Feral is just better. Grinding out the last 10 levels as Feral and then going back to whatever you want is worth it imo.
---
\[Spy\] *Beeep!*
---
I dropped my hunter. It is vital for PVP
---
Just go motw/ns spec till you have no need to solo farm/quest anymore, as many druids will tell u it is the peak jack of all trades build as you can literally do everything at an above average level. Then u can switch into your build as its optimized for HT spam for PVE, while also been respectable at balance PVP. Although I’d spend the points differently in the balance tree but that’s just personal preference and context. GL

I actually do this as well! Thought I was the only one rofl!
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself. I already gave irrefutable examples so you had to dance around the issue.
---
Same! I had to zoom my camera into first-person and look straight at the floor navigating only by the minimap.
---
I did this in IF/SW and Org/UC as well, but after the patch where they enabled linked AHs, I did all my AH stuff in Darnassus on my mage, which made my life a lot easier.
---
Haha, i do that
---
If you see a lvl60 hunter battling with an elite demon, don't interfere or get close or you both will die
---
ive also seen a video about lotus farming from a guy who plays on a 1 layer server and he said the spawn time is always 1 hour whereas commenters were saying this is incorrect (because they played on layered servers probably). He had over 250+ when making the vid so he is well informed
---
As enhance shaman, I told my guild /if/ I ever got it. (Big if, cause I personally feel I don't deserve it anyway) Id totally be wearing it every raid and weapon swapping for fights. 
---
Extra buttons just to have it on my back whenever we run around...
---
Yeah WW axe might be the most rewarding thing if your retail experience was LFR and arena skirmishes
---
To bad this company sucks dick. Same I loved wow
---
Any tailors have a problem crafting multiple items in one click but not leveling up after the first one? Just made 5 runecloth belts which should have been 5 levels but only the first leveled up.
---
Start your own groups. It's a lot faster.
---
/who 55-60
---
Start messaging tanks first. As soon as you have a healer and tank. You'll be in a dungeon in no time.
---
It's easier as a tank obv. But I do this on my bear. Message healers saying I'm a tank.
---
Get into groups in about 5 min
---
It's a running joke in my guild about how terrible my luck is. My highest roll before my guild switch to LC was a 26.
---
Side note. Even if I "Tank LFG" it takes longer than making my own groups. I also do this on all my alts. It's faster than advertising. But you should use both
---
Loooooool you dumbasses. Not only did you lose a great player but you gave an insane weapon that could've helped your guild immensely to someone who probably won't even use it properly.
---
It's laurel.
---
And now the vast majority of current EQ guilds are all DKP. Too much drama with LC to feed so many mouths with such little loot dropping.
---
Classic will eventually realize this lesson, just gonna take a few years and a few iterations of servers.
---
Dude, you’re nasty. We have to finish the run with you smelling like poop the entire time?
---
I'm too lazy to click the remember username button on the login screen. It's easier to just do this.
---
They have the item listed for very expensive. Noobies who don't know prices wil buy it to sell
---
Well there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece: a headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian influenza variety
---
Yes, it was actually relevant back then too. The goal was to get tier set bonuses on your "core" so they can carry the rest of the raid.
---
Nowadays we know MC gear is pretty bad and offset pieces are the way to go for most classes so LC is actually pretty stupid to use these days.
---
Main problem is that you don't have any talents that really help you in solo play.  You said you don't really use Cat form because you don't have talents for it, but you don't have useful talents for your caster form, either.
---
If you're set on playing balance, I'd pick up Improved Moonfire, Vengeance, and Moonfury at least.  Drop Improved Wrath/Roots and either Imp. Thorns or Natural Shapeshifter.  You'll still have Moonglow and up to 21 points in Resto for all your healing needs.
---
Dont disrupt the circle jerking dude
---
I haven't opened bnet in over a year. Blizzard's best days are long behind them. Now is a good time to find a new game or hobby and try and wean yourself off the nostalgic teat.

Can you link your healing logs for your last rag fight... I wanna see what a non bad priest who doesn't use heal as their first option looks like.
---
Which belt for healing as a holy paladin?
---
10 intellect, 8 mana per 5 seconds

or

17 intellect, 11 spirit

He's probably pretty happy not being so self-righteous and just enjoying his hobby!

This happened to me for the first time every yesterday, too. Was flying over Stonetalon then suddenly, *Poof*

Anyone else prefer the vastly easier way to log in or just me ?

Do what you did back then. Research. Find ways to make it easier.
---
Thanks!

Moonfire is terribly in efficient, especially when spammed.

Yeah, sounds about right. You seem like the type of person who would walk around constantly gasping for air.
---
You're not alone in that feeling
---
*Ackshually* there are two Alliance flight paths in Feralas, one on the island with the main town and another right on the border of Thousand Needles. However there is no Alliance flight path in TN so I guess the one on the border counts as that, even though it is technically in Feralas.
---
I'm clumsy and don't think I'd make it. I never jump unless my pally friends are with me. And, I always enter from Searing Gorge unless I'm flying in on retail.
---
I got mine in 2009 when I was hacked and it still works.

What color is the Runecloth Belt text in your Tailoring window? Orange means 100% chance of a level up, whereas yellow has less of a chance, green even less, and grey will never give you a level.

Doesn’t matter too much. Once you hit 60 you are going ti respec to remove dark pact anyways.

I'm a warrior in almost full BiS raid gear, including Bre.   My white crit could kill him...LOL...
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying, despite it being the top of BiS lists fuck grinding that shit.
---
Switch back to feral, even if it’s only for 10 levels. Those last 10 levels are a lot of /played. Going resto is fine for dungeons but I wouldn’t make the switch until 57 or 58 when you can do Lbrs, scholo, strat.
---
I'm also alliance skeram. Upfront, I have no plans on leaving. An even balance would be ideal, sure, but I'd rather be the underdog than not. I've played on severs where I was in the majority faction and it's much worse for people who enjoy to PvP. However, I feel for people who are still leveling and don't have a ton of time to play. It's not about git gud or go pve crybaby...it's about being camped in an unwinnable situation.
---
My only advice is to stick it out. Most of the population is 60 and it's much better at that level. You have more control over the engagements, have more backup if you're running something, and there aren't anymore ganks from players 15 levels higher than you. You'll still get killed at a flight path occasionally, or run into people camping an instance entrance, but it's no longer unwinnable. You also have the opportunity to turn the tables and do the same to them, which is so much more satisfying after leveling here. It's a target rich environment for someone who likes to PvP.
---
*In pre-BiS, or specifically on trash.
---
Tbh i feel so bad for guys like him. Putting actual effort into making the guild better but he will never see the profit of that invested time because the inner circle of officers wont give a shit about that. The hubter we gave the leaf on the joined guild run(rolled highest,no lc) just left after a week, that was a huge reality check for our guys.
---
Imagine typing that slow...
---
I went pink haired female gnome... I don't know, the thought of a tiny pink girl gnome tanking Ony is just hilarious to me.
---
If the stuff he started about this Kai, I think the LC did a really shitty job
---
Because your server is still layered.
---
Ony GFPP is wasted
---
I soloed it with a priest by dotting the courier and just run. The guards will drop aggro after some distance, but the courier will chase a little further because of the dot. Once the guards drop aggro, the courier is dead meat.
---
No, all during Vanilla we were aware of the dark portal and the Blasted Lands and Draenor. And during TBC we were aware of the growing threat in Northrend...
---
No I got it. Just don't see the humor in basically responding to a month old thread by basically calling two people dumb.
---
Oh, aren't you so funny.
---
Not at all.
---
Took me 1 death anyways. Luckily I got far enought to get a rezz right away :)
---
Get a decent guild lol. I got 14 hours at 60. I got full pre-bis but shadow damage neck from vectus. FINE, there are a couple of not optimal green pieces lacking 1-3 shadow damage. And i did farm the Dire Maul:North staff of ogre magi with my main. But it's an alt, if the complete set lacks 10-15 shadow damage i don't care.
---
Point is, get a competent guild and start farming the gear pre-60.
---
More whining.
---
Vendor spec dream
---
Haha yeah
---
Ya this is a pretty good summarization of what you should prioritize on. Very clean and without fluff.
---
You literally took all the talents that don't help you deal any damage and then wonder why you don't deal any damage then when people tell you to respec you don't want to....
---
I guess quit the game?
---
Care to point me to some of these "tons of posts", then?
---
What do you like doing?I'm personally a shaman loyalist and refuse to level an alt. I've thought about leveling just cause they're super op. But I don't wanna go through the whole neckbeard process.
---
Pvp or pve?  And what does your guild or group need?
---
I said I don't want to respec to feral because there's no point when in less than 10 levels I'll have to respec back again anyway.
---
I followed a guide online and it said this was a good build for healing.
---
For priest I think it may be the best farm for them actually, with consideration that they are going herbalism ofcourse.
---
I work at fedex and our part timers are on-task 95% of their shift.  Mind you this is a physical labor position.
---
Oh no, I know what you meant, but Im just hoping that its not as prevalent as on the subreddit.  Ive been waiting to jump into classic and am now feeling the itch is too much to ignore, so I started last night, and at worst its just very quiet.  Few people talking, at least at 2am 😋.
---
Hoping as I get further in, people talk more and the majority are civil
---
PvP mostly, but would like to dabble in pve and dont really have a guild/group
---
You can by pulling your inet connection.   
---
Login afterwards and you're in the air a slight bit further down the route. Slowfall on Mage/Priest and you can dismount from flying mounts at any point. Worked in vanilla aswell btw.
---
I don't think this particular issue is spell batching. This happens all the time for me but it also happened on pservers
---
You do realize someone can be just out of school or recently unemployed and still be a Neet, right? Neet isn't necessarily someone who didn't do shit for 10 years after high school and even then social skills have nothing to do with that, just laziness.

Is the beige name him too? Thats the only way id see that scam working as it worked on me in runescape with a useless item before they were removed "Dragon Nails" or something, literally nails of a dragon, guy said he would buy them for a few mill, im like its not buying dude "ok just put like 10m itll auto buy and I'll pay you whatever it is", it buys for ten mill and he logs off. I bought *his* dragon nails for 10m, played like a sucker. Least on this youd see his name as the seller unless its a alt. At that point youre just fucked for being a nice guy and trying to help some lazy guy out for some reason.
---
Mage is the best class. Unless you’re horde, then shaman is the best
---
Tether to my car it’s on my att plan.
---
I just like gear funneled into me
---
I mean my question is what did you do while leveling? You dont even need to neccesarily be feral to kill stuff. It will take longer for sure but you can just starfire &gt; moonfire &gt; insect swarm &gt; cat form and single target it down just fine. If you respec to resto it will be even weaker, and you should just only do dungeons at that point.
---
It takes time to mount a proper defense. We raided stormwind with 4x full raid groups of 60s and killed Bolvar, and there were only 10 ally at the back trying to pick off people. We eventually made our way through the tram to ironforge and about 15 minutes after arriving, we got wiped by multiple Ally raid groups that had time to form and coordinate during this time.
---
They would have likely started calling for support when we first rushed stormwind, but it took them a good 30-40 mins to organise and make their way to ironforge.
---
It just takes time, and sometimes its not worth fighting a overwhelming force until you've got enough support.
---
No.
---
2 backstab SnD is mathematically incorrect.
---
2 backstab, adrenaline rush, backstab to 5, snd is the correct play, and once you're at the 30s slice and dice it's self-sustaining, you will always hit 5 combo points off backstab before snd falls off.
---
You are wasting energy by popping SnD early, and that reduces your backstab damage long term. The 1500 or so white damage you gain up front costs you 4500 yellow damage or so in the long run over the course of a 2 minute + fight, due to the fact that you're unlikely to proc the 40% chance 25 energy refund on relentless strikes, meaning you're out 2 full energy ticks on the next backstab, and the one after that, and so on, and that loss of energy increments by 1 tick for every time you renew a 2 combo point SnD.
---
Maybe something like a druid that offers different play styles would be good for you. You can switch things up without starting over. Also no one plays druids so you can get in a raid a geared up fast.
---
Why would I respec to feral when in less than 10 levels now I'll have to respec back to resto?? That's a waste of what little gold I have lmao.
---
imagine not avoiding battlenet crap at all cost
---
I don't know what my login info is to be fair lol
---
To decide - pick 3 you enjoy, roll 1/3 stick with the roll.
---
To stop playing alts - dont make any, not even a bank alt. Cant play something you dont have.
---
ZG in Phase 2 confirmed!
---
    Nah actually if you make the group, you set the rules. All that matters is they are disclosed upfront, and that the owner and people who join follow them.
---
     Everything else mentioned is superficial, you can chose to not group with them it is that simple.
---
&gt;I'm early 50's and it just feels like I'm slapping everything I fight with a wet noodle. It takes me almost all of my mana and pretty much all of my patience to kill one thing even if it's my level, where as I watch literally everyone else kill things with little effort and move onto the next in the time it takes me to kill one thing.
---
You mean gloves? Ancient Core Leather Gloves are +5 dagger skill
---
They are definitely going to do BC and WOTLK
---
Shatter was never removed, it's been baseline for frost mage for ages now, there was a fantastic combo that used comet storm + pet nova for a massive shatter aoe burst that people used at the start of bfa
---
So lemme get this straight. 1 guy did all the work, felt he deserved more, took it and you're upset?
---
No offense but you and your guild master sound entitled as fuck.
---
New human who dis?
---
Go and get the seperate client for classic (icon that is).
---
I have one for each client type and it opens each respectively.
---
Perhaps thats why.
---
Wait it is an alt? Why don’t you give him weapons/pots/gear etc to make it smooth?
---
Yeah the second I opened the image I laughed my ass off
---
I mean we have one side of the story from the sore side of the events taking place. Maybe this other guy is around on alts or who knows we've only got colored view that is certainly biased. Idk it could be true or trolling for all the info we have currently.
---
Why not both? I have an elemental set in my bags and a few items surplus for stuff like this (fire res, short fights so less mp5 etc).
---
The content scaling to your level in BfA is immersion shattering too
---
One is admitting to abusing the reporting the system. The other is....not...
---
I used to get that too, but the issue was that I linked a new email address to the account and that new email is what I used to log in to the battle.net app. I just changed the email address at the WoW login screen to my old email address and it works fine now
---
Yours still works? I had an original one that stopped working years ago. Switched to mobile authentication. It's still much easier to just log in from the blizzard launcher.
---
Can you make one for mage please I’m struggling with the rotation
---
I kept forgetting my shit so I made a word doc on my computer with all of them. Then the only password I need to remember is my lock password.
---
Yeah but there's literally zero point in me respeccing to something I don't want to play (have absolutely 0 interest in tanking) just to respec again in a week for what I actually need?
---
Yea, Ive tried that. eventually the urge to reroll just takes over. I actually do have it down to 3, but cant deice between them
---
on normal trash pulls do you also use SnD or just spam backstab?
---
Yeah he has no kind of commitments in his life and can play 24/7 (as shown by him planning to go for Rank 14) basically ensuring that if the guild was playing by 'Who is the most committed' rules then everything goes to him, haha.
---
OP are you ok
---
Just like in real life, any server you pick will have good and bad guilds. Shop around a bit, find a guild that has some chill people you get along with, hopefully with quite a few members around your level so you can do dungeons and stuff together.
---
I don't, sorry, should be the other way around so, moonfire + starfire spam. I was writing this quick.
---
I don’t think it needs any of the things I listed. But trust me, there is a lot of opposition to the idea of a barber in classic (I’ve posted about it before to a wall of nochanges tears).
---
Form your own groups.
---
Horde skeram here. Screw you alliance too. I don’t roam in gangs killing alli but I’ve sure seen you guys doing it in hilsbrad/stv/thousand needles with 60s killing me whenever they can in other areas. No horde ever help when I ask either.
---
Ahhh we have different experiences then. I think with the sparse classes it just depends on the raid. We usually have like 2 maybe 3 locks and one maybe 2 hunters. Hunters would be the close second behind locks for us
---
Lol ty for the laugh, at least its material, got my cats and ps4/switch so it could be worse;/
---
Listen dude, I like that you are having fun and thats really great.
---
But you don't have to justify your fun. Groups objectively better just having main dps classes do dps and hybrids do healing or tanking. You can have fun and its awesome, but don't spread misinformation.
---
I have a 60 pally on a pvp server and really enjoyed leveling. STV was so fun. I’d run around helping in all the random fights I’d come across turning the tide many times with what had to feel like heals and stuns that came from nowhere. I’d say go for it. Prioritize your weapon and you’ll be good.
---
None of those things are exclusive to ret.
---
Wow thats so rad! They stack?!?! So 40 energy/15 rage when power shifting?!?!
---
People don’t want to tank.
---
Doesn't you calling me out require you to make an argument first?
---
What do you think about putting 2 points into sword spec instead of reducing evasion/sprint cds and having swords to switch to for trash?
---
Yea mostly talking about office drones.
---
Goodluck actually being able to aoe grind on a high pop or full server. Always like 5 mages frantically trying to pull a single mob or two at the same farming spot right as they spawn, just waiting it out until the others leave.
---
Plenty of raids have dps warriors. Tanks are hard to come by because a minority of people would rather tank.
---
I worry about this as I level my enhancement shaman that I plan on totem twisting with. I worry that getting gear, as well as finding groups to do the twisting with, will be difficult. Especially dungeon groups, because even though it becomes a large damage boost to have a totem twister, you don't see my damage high on the meters so it feels like I'm not actually doing enough, and that people don't feel it.
---
That’s why I duo my warrior friend so he doesn’t die :)
---
I put in my correct information every time and every time it tells me the account cannot be found
---
Not sure if being sarcastic.
---
&gt; Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.

Phrased another way, when close to a target, you don't necessarily need to be facing them to cast.
---
He didnt do EVERYTHING. He did work yes but other officers did as well. People have jobs. He didnt so he was on all the time and people saw him mostly. But if you're going to join a guild only to pull people out because you decide you contribute the most then fuck you. Should have just made his own guild from the start instead of pledging to a guild then splitting it after.
---
Fer alas Gnolls ( I think they are around level 43 ) are really good ( around 73,58) there are 5 packs of 4 and loads of singles, If you start down one end and work in a circle you get a good rotation going + Mage weave for First aid if you dont have a healer, next is Ruins of Ravenwind (40,12) , Loads of harpies (lvl 48-50) really good xp and loot. We stayed there till 53 and then went to Felpaw Village in Felwood , Mobs there are tricky they do some damage but there is Loads of them. Once 54-55 Cant remember exactly we hit Black rock Stronghold in Burning Steppes that place is really good also, at 55 If you have a good synergy with the lower level character Tyr's hand in EPL is super good 53-57 elites , easy 80k + xp/h . Hope this helps
---
&gt; Healing as enhance contributes more to the raid than defending the farm as enhance.
---
ftfy
---
Nice
---
Not sure if you're angry at yourself or turned on.  Either seems appropriate though.
---
Warriors are also the highest DPS class in the game, especially come Naxx. Mages are very close, and being ranged has many advantages over melee, but once you hit 20% warriors pull way way ahead of every other class in damage.
---
Also, tanking is hard and stressful in vanilla.
---
irrefutable examples of something I was never arguing against. I think it's rather sad that you don't know what the word "enough" means. You didn't take my advice about learning what it means.
---
Woo! Finally, someone else might
---
Reality is often disappointing.
---
Yes and no. Class redesigns were a regular part of Vanilla, it was always a work in progress. There really is no good reason why a Paladin shouldn't have a taunt for example, one of the biggest oversights in Vanilla IMO.
---
BC had a lot of good changes to hybrid classes to make them actually feel like true hybrids without just filling every role as good as a pure class.  But they went WAY overboard after WotlK, giving everyone everything for "balance" doesn't feel like good RPG design.
---
Oh look, another little bitch like the guy in the OP...
---
One of the few modern updates that I accept as an improvement.
---
Personally I'd say druid, since you can DPS or tank or heal if you have the gear, all as the same spec as feral. As long as you have int and spirit gear, you can heal fine while leveling, and tanking is just fine as well. Your open world questing strength is also very high. It's maybe not as afk as Hunter can be, but still pretty easy.
---
i spawned this guy right there as well, purposely so exactly this would happen.  Was hilarious.
---
Ah, a fellow Runescape player I see.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think you can remap the camera movement in-game. But if you are really desperate about having the middle mouse move the camera, you could remap your mouse buttons with 3rd party software that came with your mouse, if it has some. For example, you could remap your middle mouse to Mouse1 and vice versa, but it would be a huge hassle having to middle click things to target/interact with.
---
GIEEEEEEEEEEEEEF!
---
Nice! How long did you play for and how much data did you use?
---
I've given you lists of things you should be embarrassed about and you've yet to give me anything. You can say whatever you want but your actions speak louder than your words.
---
Because too many people are too used to retail, and have no idea how threat generation works in Classic. They think they can just go all out straight off the bat, while the tank is struggling to put sunders on, and wonder why them and the healers keep getting agro. Tanking is a real struggle when you have to deal with dipshits....
---
Just use iMorph
---
Or illness, depression, lottery wins...
---
Leveling as prot early is SLOW. I suggest going ret until you get seal of command, then holy to consecrate then delve into the prot tree. You jus tempt have the killing power in the prot tree so if you are soloing it will take forever.
---
I've actually seen it in an apes alt raid. Was surprised how when it's not the main raid it's whatever.
---
Kai you fucking dumbass stop winning good items
---
T1 is better in every situation, simply because it has 1 % hit on it
---
Im new to wow. I enjoy classic but as someone who has never really found much fun in grinding dungeons in MMOs, I'm getting a little bored. I'm a PvP guy sonim just waiting as patiently as I can for BGs. Have considered making a retail character just to play BGs.
---
You tank in DPS spec, it's a non-issue and actually better for threat
---
Funner.
---
I'd say an equal shot is about the minimum standard. Which you don't have, as a single player fighting a multiboxer. 
---
Breaking news: Man with 4 characters shocked that people won't 1v4 him unless they actually have a chance of winning
---
There are never 2 equals and yet I think rolling is fairer than favouritism. Ja
---
It absolutely should be criticized. The mask can be farmed extremely quickly and is the easiest pre raid bis piece to obtain.
---
Ignoring all the other extra stats 1% hit is already going to be more valuable than 8 sp
---
&gt; I dont care about punishing people for attacking me.
---
Reck Paladins are pretty good at that too, if you decide to go that route.
---
Well, if we're calling non pre-bis pre-bis, I agree it is very easy to get.
---
They've outdone us Scots. Luckily I understood the post as Aussie, haha.
---
No, there's actually too many healers

If it's that easy, then do it yourself, with whatever loots rules you want. If other people want want to join reserve runs, that's their prerogative.

Thanks for the input. Not a big fan of druid. I have it narrowed down to mage lock and rogue
---
i explained what i meant by using that word, but i will retract the word "extremely viable" and say it's possible, has been, and will be done successfully, but not better than classes with more to offer.
---
Not for raids when starting out. Geared yeah sure. But at this stage you don’t have the gear nor the healers have the gear to spam like mad.
---
How is logging on a couple hours each day ‘not any effort’?
---
I have no idea what you are talking about, half of what you say is absolute nonsense anyway.
---
Need at least one buddy to tag-in while you sleep. That toon has to be logged in and getting kills all the time, no downtime except for server maintenance.
---
Would this be better for the balance tree portion?  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxcMxs](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxcMxs)
---
He’s just high guys leave him alone
---
I do this too lol. Whisper Priests if they want to start a group and heal. Once we got heal/tank, put "LF3 DPS" in LFG and then we full in a few min.
---
anyone can use a skinning knife or miner's pick tho
---
you gave me a list? You should start being embarrassed about that lol!
---
How do you people make the same fucking post every thread?
---
Every time, because otherwise I need to re-authenticate. Ends up being less time to clsoe and open again on a pcie m.2.
---
Rogue or mage because of the sheer utility.
---
I made a balance druid leveling guide you should check out.
---
Let me know if you have any questions.

---
Well he threw in some pretty hard facts. So either the guy raging is an extreme liar, or it makes sense on what he said. I would've straight up taken a shaman out of the raid who is enh. skilled while healing. There wouldn't even be any discussion. I would tell him to come back once he is healing skilled and then raidkicked him. 
---
So a guild with such a low amount of control who believes they can do a loot council is pathetic. We are a DKP guild and have more control over our members and look more into how they are doing.
---
Wow is dead
---
Female Undead: Bankshee
---
There’s and addon for totems called totemtimers which every shaman needs if you want to free up action bar clutter
---
I am not a professional troll, but if I got you to make a list about me, I should think about charging people to troll for them.
---
You can set it up to ask you once per computer, that way it saves your pc and instant login after the first time you put your auth code...
---
For me I like putting my password, is faster when you dc than waiting to bnet to log in the app and open the game again...
---
Can confirm, it's offensive but no more offensive than fukwit
---
you cant separate them anymore since the grouped mobs fix. one is in combat=both is in combat
---
&gt;Furthermore, the very fact that no discussion took place in considering who will get the most out of the weapon took place
---
[](#thinking)
---
MS FTW!
---
so how does this match up to standard playstyle? is it competitive in raids?
---
dungeons are very relevant for early endgame content in classic wdym
---
Seems like a silly thing to complain about when you intentionally chose a PvE realm.
---
I play Warrior for Arms PvP. 
---
I get whispers constantly asking me to tank, and have read comments saying “If you don’t want to tank don’t play Warrior”, etc. etc. and to them I say this: 
---
I don’t want to tank. I’ll tank a 5-man only if absolutely necessary, because I think it’s a lot of pressure to tank. 
---
I feel like tanks are kind of just expected to have great gear, know all the dungeon routes and boss mechanics, and generally lead the group. 
---
I’m not a leader-type. I’m not a “take command” type. I play games to escape pressure and responsibility and have fun. 
---
I just want to run BGs with my friends. Arms/pocket heals premades, all day. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, tanks are badass. I just don’t like the pressure of tanking.
---
A man has an opinion.
---
Because being at the top of the dps meter as a fury warriors is fun.
---
if you do a lot of dungeons, go for consecration first, if you're gonna quest more then go for command
---
Have you ever had loot drama? people like the OP are a dime a dozen in any mmo, they always think THEY are the best most deserving and when they dont get what they want they go fully unhinged. 
---
IF everything the OP said is true then yes the guild is total shit, but wouldn't that make the OP guilty for staying in that guild anyway? you can see this coming a mile away if the guild is really that bad.
---
Boy, the correct choice is female nelf warrior. You got to be good looking and you are able to do frint flips, there's nothing else you need.
---
\#nochanges
---
You didn’t even get them all
---
Aquatic form is 100.5% movespeed (67*1.50) and levitate is 100% but 108% if boots are enchanted with minor speed.
---
Totally get your POV here, it is frustrating. 
---
At the same time, why would this other rogue, or anyone for that matter want to raid if they will just lose opportunities due to some loot council wizardry? 
---
I guess this is an example of where DKP makes a lot of sense if you have a good enough selection of guildies.
---
My one year old niece that shits herself after screeching for an hour is more gangsta than a multiboxer.
---
Yeah i wouldn’t be surprised if it was laziness. I’ve made many hundreds of gold on the AH because of just such laziness - its rampant. Usually the laziness that i profit off is not being bothered to research market prices before putting things up on the AH.
---
Sort of.
---
You can do similar from 46 to like 51 in Maraudon with scepter.
---
If what he is saying is true, then your guild has no business being a loot council. You do loot council because you know how good your players are and because you know who to give the items to. Your loot council has obviously no clue or does not care enough about their players, to keep them under control. 
---
Well what do I know though, loot council guilds are a huge boon for us, because we have a constant influx of applications from players who are in loot council guilds and want to come to our DKP guild
---
My interpretation could be wrong, but I suppose it was pretty clear that their statement said they apparently have fixed the PvE side of things only **and** reported Feign Death *still* being rather buggy. They're still gonna implement a proper fix for the FD issues.
---
Well that can never be unseen
---
Really? That could be useful
---
Get a hobby
---
Although realistically I imagine the majority or at least a significant plurality will migrate, they could just host servers for Classic, BC, and WotLK, presumably fewer servers over time on "old" expansions though.
---
for todays standards my garbage guild went into naxx without flasks.
---
There is no need to complicate things... Need vs greed just deliniates declaring your priority on an item. If it's a BoP of course some classes get more utility from it and they ought to be awarded the item. BoEs can be sold and therefore offer exactly equal utility to everyone, so why shouldn't everyone split it (how it's done in many MMO games with an offer feature on their marketplace) or roll for it equally (because there is no autosell in WoW, you can't really sell something immediately and split it) equally?
---
If a mob dropped 500g, the game would automatically split it. If it drops a BoE, everyone should roll on it instead of splitting it. If I'm on my mage and a Freezing Band drops (500g right there,) everyone should have a fair chance at it because my druid buddy can sell it and get his Warden Staff or my warrior friend can sell it and buy mats for Lionheart helm. Just because I'm the only one who can equip it for it's intended purpose doesn't mean I would be the only one who can benefit from it. It signifies a big upgrade for anyone who gets it. Why should I be allowed to just have it because I'm a mage?
---
Sounds to me like there were incompatible people in the guild. Players were fine taking advantage of the situation so long as it benefited them. But the reality is if you have a job, life etc. then why are you complaining when some NEET who did most of the work got fed up and left?
---
Not as much as un'goro
---
It's just your battle.net login.
---
Yup, or i go play with my dog, or water the garden, or pay a bill. It’s actually kind of handy.
---
Just looking at this box brings back so many goodmemories irl and ingame jesus christ time flies by so fucking fast wtf.
---
Looks like you have issue with attention like you are too easily distracted. Other than that...Fury isn't that great until you have Pre-Raid BIS. Also people got better with time, I used to outdps everyone by a significant margin as Fury in Vanilla, I still top dps but not as much...people got better and Vanilla has been known and researched for over a decade because of pservers.
---
Coming back after post-Uldir curve break and seeing all gear I worked for becoming obsolete and outshined by a dungeon drop was the thing that finally broke me even though I survived(and enjoyed) Legion. I quit the game on the spot and haven't come back for more than few days since.
---
I'm horde so I never got to play pally, would love to try sometime though, was pally tank during wrath and loved it.
---
Druid or sham are great leveling classes that don't suck to play since they can heal and get speed increase abilities. They don't necessarily need gear from your main though, the gear locked classes are particularly rough to play
---
If you play an underpowered spec, my advice is to learn to enjoy the extra effort you need to put in or... drumroll... level as feral/resto.
---
where do all u stupid bitter redditors come from lol its nuts.
---
I've been trying to get dungeon gear since I hit 60 a month ago. Bad luck on drops and thousands of other rogues have slowed down my progress so bad that I quit rogue entirely and switched to druid. No regrets.
---
Herod is a disaster of a server.
---
I heartily endorse this event or product
---
First off, stop spamming Moonfire. Starfire is your most MP efficient spell, use that for damage. But really, just DPS them down in cat form regardless of spec and heal after each fight. Of course your DPS is going to be bad, you are a healer spec.
---
When did they change it? I did it live in classic maybe four weeks back and she tethered back as i killed pet.
---
As others have said, making a group is a great option. You should also look for a good guild. Often people avoid lfg altogether and just organize guild groups on discord. I know you don't have an interest in raiding, but joining a guild that raids would go a long way towards helping you run high level dungeons.
---
So true, I never played mage before so tried that and cant imagine trying to learn it all at 60. Sure it's pretty basic but there are a lot of small nuisances I learned along the way to 60.
---
Really isn’t an advantage unless you pay for the software from ISBoxer. I’m running hotkey.net. Kill the leader or fear em and it’s easy. It’s more of a deterrent  which really works
---
&gt;Or they are just really cool dudes
---
Yea they could, and more power to you if they can pull it off, but in the long run it's just much safer from a guild culture standpoint to not recruit big blocs of friends
---
Yeah his BiS list is a little odd. But I generally use the tabs on the bottom for Armor or Amulet/Back/Ring and sort the list by what’s available each phase and by the “score” he gives. It gives a good idea of some of the better items available, but in the end you’ll want to build your own set. That should vary from people to people depending on what they prefer. (Crit/Sp/Stam) 
---
I agree with the mp5 being useless for PvP. I feel like he started the guide with all classes as PVE spec and later changed Ele and Enhance to PvP focus.
---
He’s also missing a few pieces of gear too for some reason? The Helm of Latent Power isn’t on there and imo that’s pre raid BiS. But compared to the other BiS lists out there this one’s organization was definitely the best. The other tabs past his BiS lists have been a good help.
---
So in your opinion what are the must have talents in the ret/prot tree for this build. I would be open to going for a bare minimum pvp ret/prot build and then dumping as much into holy as possible for healing raids.
---
You can also buy the books on AH!
---
Legendary
---
If it's only a week why the hell are you complaining online?
---
I'm actually leveling one as my alt as enhance and plan on getting ravager. So excited!
---
Sir, this is an Arby's
---
You just have to make DKP correctly lol. If you invent DKP like an idiot, of course it will be shit.
---
Our guild has:
---
DKP Cap: 500 DKP
---
How to get DKP: 5 per boss, 10 for endboss kills, 5 for being on time, 5 for every hour, 5 for overtime, 5 for being there at the end of the raid. Occasional bonus DKP for weekly quests, like Dousing or supplying specific materials needed.
---
Minimum bid: 20 DKP, bids have to always go up in 5s.
---
Minimum bid for meh loot and offspecc: 10 DKP, Offspecc &gt; Mainspecc
---
If an obvious upgrade drops for you (your classleader decides this if you don't see it yourself) and nobody else bids on it, you have to bid minimum DKP on it. Should two people bid the same DKP on something, either because they both only go minimum DKP or because they both reached their limit, the item is rolled for.
---
I recommend anyone in a guild that does this to leave immediately.
---
You seem like my post personally upset you. I was just wondering if I was supposed to be this weak when I’m almost level 60 or if I was doing something wrong (outside of my spec choice).
---
Most MMOs I played, if there was an expensive item that dropped from a boss, they would sell it and split it or roll on it fairly because that's the same expected value to everyone as selling it and splitting it. This attitude was definitely there in vanilla wow too at level cap... An expensive drop is like 10 hours of not having to grind gold. Why would someone ever be expected to give up their chance at saving 10 hours just because someone else can equip it?
---
I totally forgot about Orb of Deception, and I usually play horde so, never seen a gnome female using that.
---
Life finds a way.
---
#PSA - DO NOT JOIN ANY GUILD WITH A LOOT COUNCIL
---
What is even my login info?
---
Okay.
---
That's just being a dick to people, like going to your friends house hanging out seeing his wallet there taking a 20 out and putting a 1 in.  Lame.
---
Or sometimes because they just believe themselves to be the total hardcore people who know what they do, but simply aren't.
---
Mine defaults to classic wow...
---
Damn, come to my server. Priests are way more rare than tanks. Everyone is rolling warriors. Sure, half refuse to tank, but I don’t feel rare anymore.
---
I’ll be honest I’m not super familiar with Resto, I used this more as an Ele guide. I found the tabs at the bottom with bigger lists of gear to be more helpful than his specified BiS list.
---
Off topic, but with the speed that bosses in MC are going down do you think Mp5 is a little overrated right now? There’s only a few bosses lasting over 1:30-2:00. I feel like additional int or +healing would be more beneficial.
---
Hes still alive in retail just dormant.
---
Glad I’m not the only one
---
Because the cracks in p3 don't kill and only do enough dmg that your healers have something to do. Same in p2 with fireballs. You don't need prot pots on Ony unless you have major threat issues.
---
308 is skill cap. Any more yields a .1% reduction on boss dodge chance. Thats all.
---
Hit cap is 9% at 300 skill. At 308 skill hit cap is 6%. At 305 its about 7%. Save these numbers.
---
Here I am the GM of a loot council guild last in line for mageblade. I must be doing this wrong.
---
Akama was supposed to be a lost one since he was one in WC3 Frozen Throne.
---
Lol omg this guys only lvl 29.. he is leveling soo slow
---
Jesus you're dense... BoPs benefit some people more than others so the ones that benefit more should be awarded it. BoEs are the same as gold so everyone benefits from it equally, therefore everyone should roll on them
---
Yeah no kidding. Corpse walk or flight path back from wherever his hearth is set, either way I get my mobs or ore veins faster lol
---
No
---
I thought we were all boycotting blizzard for being a douchbag money grubbing company.
---
You guys would get shit on if you were a known guild
---
Huge reason why dkp is a shit system. People like this warrior are going to snag super contested loot by floating on the backs of others.
---
Ah, okay.
---
Well now you see THAT I can actually have a discussion about. What I'm ACTUALLY looking for is simply an addon that'll allow ME to draw up a route. We already have an addon like questie that puts markers on the map for where you can find mobs for the quests you're on, and will also include on the tooltip how far along your quest you are. What I'm asking for instead however, is an addon that allows me to draw out (on my own that is, I just want an addon that lets me draw lines on a map) on the map a route that I wish to take to go around mining that shows up on the minimap.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
There are already a lot of addons for classic that do a huge chunk of the work for you, however I'm not asking for an addon that does any work for me, only an addon that lets me draw lines on a map that I can follow.
---
Yeah but classic WoW has a shelf life. People are tearing through the content at incredible rates and sooner or later people are going to look to Blizzard and say "well now what..?".
---
It will be a while I'm sure, and that's great. I want everybody to experience all of the content of vanilla. Especially Naxx, which is an amazing raid. But after that, then what?
---
If there was, it would be client sided. Which would mean only you experience the effect. It would also mean modifying your game client, which is a big no-no.
---
I get left alone a lot as a Pally.  I guess our horde cousins couldn’t be bothered with a long fight.
---
What are you planning on doing at 60? (raid, chill, 5 mans)
---
I had a run where a priest found him with mind vision or whatever and I couldn't target him in the corner but when I got closer to the door I could.  Not sure
---
Probably mainly chill and 5 mans. I’d like to maybe raid occasionally but I’m not planning to be a hardcore raider or anything.
---
The 2 crits for Ele Shamans is absolute BS in pvp.  A decently geared shaman can almost 1-shot you with no effort.
---
I mean, on one hand, yeah he's being a dick. On the other hand, I get sick of the dicks who say they "just need to turn in a quest real quick" and then proceed to fly from Org to Tanaris to turn a quest in, while in a group for Uldaman.... I'm not waiting 45 min for you to get to the damn dungeon.
---
That’s awesome that that’s something that you find enjoyable, but you’re definitely in the minority there. 
---
That said, the people that hit 60 and killed Rag in the first couple of weeks are also in the minority, but there’s definitely coming a time (if not already) where the majority of the player base is max level and doing whatever end game content tickles their fancy. At that point you have to feed more content (see Dire Maul) or players will get bored and move onto another game and may or may not come back when blizzard finally does release content. Sadly, that’s just the nature of gaming today.
---
And wetlands.
---
&gt; Actually it would be fine
---
[x] doubt
---
You'd probably make another reddit post because it would be a shit thing for them to do. Just like the way this guild handled the loot situation (with what we know of the story).
---
i definitely do this, but i also definitely close the bnet client once im in.
---
Had a guy pm me cuz a warrior in my guild was questing in the same spot he wanted to aoe grind. Apparently he asked him multiple times to leave...
---
People be crazy
---
Guys, i have come from the future. In patch 8.0 our beloved sylvanas burns down Teldrassil and starts a huge war but the wpvp is pretty lacking
---
Herod
---
I've made around 1,600g in 2 weeks farming DM tribute runs. So yeah weigh your options on what's best.
---
Is it the Piper Perri meme?
---
Yes, that's the one we don't know the login information to...
---
&gt; because retail has personal loot
---
Really?   Damn, maybe I should pick retail back up again.
---
There's no way you did 34 runs on 7 min resets without being locked out as af.
---
Mage. The free fuckin water and the gold that comes with portals
---
Lmao you're dense. Gold=time at level 60. Respec and save 10-20 hours from 50-60 and then spend 10-20 hours farming gold then you're 400 gold ahead with the same amount of time spent...
---
Yeah and that's fine, but a lot of the playerbase will start to drop off once they've done most of the currently released content.. this is simply how games work. Sure you can occupy yourself in vanilla almost forever, but if they want to retain players then more stuff will need to be released.
---
The main reason it's so expensive is that it doesn't exist on loot tables in Retail. Sure it's cool looking, but that only drives a fraction of the price.
---
Damn you’re right excuse me for not being a pro and living breathing WoW knowledge
---
Unfortunately, every dps paladin I've ever met does half my damage when I'm on an actual dps class. Both overall, ST, aoe.
---
Dropping your groups dps by 15% is not worth it. It's a fun meme spec, but it's the mathematical equivalent of a shaman never dropping WF totem in a 3 warrior group.
---
What if you don't give a shit about the head?
---
Just did it in a run twenty minutes ago. Is working.
---
with the dungeon patch not only did they add the blues from p5 you are talking about, but also upgraded almost all the already existing blues to have much better stats. in classic the blues already have those stats.
---
I went with Resto/Enhan
---
1 for auto attack macro (you use to stop attacking after awhile; but you know what happens if you hit the Attack command while attacking :P)
---
2 for purge
---
3 for LB
---
4 for LBr1
---
MB5 for Frost Shock
---
MB4 for CLB
---
NUM9 for Flame Shock
---
NUM8 for Earth Shock
---
V for currently active weapon buff
---
Sadly, I don't have any screen shots of me past lvl 44 and using the shift key to auto-page to a new set of action bars via Bartender.
---
I fully expected this to say "respec feral" and be done.
---
Gimme my dolly!
---
Spec seriously doesnt matter for warrior. They can tank any 5-10 man content without even placing their talents
---
This. Why would tanks want to run randos through a zone they dont need?
---
&gt; Blizzard made it VERY clear…crystal clear…what role your class will be doing in end game content.
---
Warriors are the best tanks, warriors are also the best DPS. Turns out they do both at end game. They also pvp.
---
Just use Whirlwind Axe until 52 and get a Destiny and go 2H Fury. EZ mode
---
&gt; That said, the people that hit 60 and killed Rag in the first couple of weeks are also in the minority, but there’s definitely coming a time (if not already) where the majority of the player base is max level and doing whatever end game content tickles their fancy. 
---
I seem to remember that back in vanilla, raiders, in general, were the minority.  Like, all raids, not just Naxx and stuff.  Most players didn't do them.
---
Which is why I thought it was odd the discussions we so often about them.
---
But maybe I'm misremembering?
---
The damage is so low, it does not matter and thus is wasted.
---
We take more raid damage on Gehennas (~50s fight, 90k dmg taken) compared to Onyxia P3 (~60s, 95k dmg taken)
---
Ok you can attack me, I really don't care. It doesn't change the fact that it comes down to fairness. If they had guild rules in place like a point system when partyA earned his right for reserve on the item. Okay, awesome all parties agree beforehand.  Its established and it is fair to say to party B, "according to our rules you need to contribute X amount more to roll".  
---
But if you are the raid leader and trying to make things fair for all parties, imagine saying at the time of the roll, "Oh hey, yeah, partyB. You dont deserve this item because partyA did more.  I know you probably joined this raid specifically for the chance to get this item but your chances are now 0 since we determined he's more deserving based on statistics we never told you were going to be a factor on the roll.  I know there's a whole rolling system to help give people an even chance but we've disregarded that because, well, while you may have thought you were helping with the raids you've been offspeccing to help fit the guild needs, turns out there was a hidden extra step where if you dont redo your talents then your efforts are meaningless.  Maybe we'll let you have a CHANCE to roll next time if we dont arbitrarily decide someone else deserves it more.".  See how that's not really fair to partyB?
---
I’m a tank and get offered first orb to tank strat all the time. I hardly ever see tanks advertising for this, it’s offered to us as incentive to do a dungeon that’s otherwise pointless for us. 
---
If a tank actually wants to go there it’s likely for a quest, which means they’re a fresh 60. Id rather be with a geared tank farming orbs than be the  geared DPS with a fresh 60 tank.
---
Mage AoE leveling has always been ridiculous. 
---
Especially in dungeons as there's no competition or risk of wpvp.
---
Easy mode class to level, top tier DPS in PvE, very strong in PvP. That's Mage. :/
---
thats a pretty solid reason.
---
TBC buffs when!?!
---
Because BFA adds content, classic is gonna be the exact same thing with the new phases isn’t it?
---
No doubt about it mate, I never said I wasn't being a smartass about it. What I didn't do however, was accost some random player and accuse them of stealing a mob in an area so rich with them I walked three metres as a paladin and hit the next one.
---
Well #1 on the meter but whatever
---
If you have an older account, account name still works too.
---
Actually the guy who posted this apparently ALSO posted this on his server's subreddit and made a comment there too. He referred to the guy who posted this as a 'salty kid'.
---
This guy's going to be in for a bit of surprise when he comes back to check his post.
---
It cost 1 or 5g to respec. That's easy at lvl 55
---
Lmao I was just fucking with you, being a smartass is completely fine in my book
---
As appealing as getting all the dungeon groups you want is. . . Leveling sucks in the overworld, raids have too few tank spots to get loot, and respecc-ing costs way to dam much. Tanks can't really farm gold either.
---
So you go with fresh 60 tanks that still need the mask lmao. Go with a geared tank farming orbs and your runs will be twice as fast. More gear, more orbs, more gold for the whole party.
---
Duo warriors here. Been having a blast.
---
Mongoose and greater agility stack?
---
Happy someone agrees.
---
Blizzard never once made roles crystal clear, metas defined as people figured out what classes can do, and warriors excel at tanking and DPS. There are simply not enough raid spots for tons of tanks to just chill around as prot, and on top of that the content people usually can’t find tanks for is 5-mans and those are ironically the hardest content due to the size of the group and how easily a bad pull can wipe a group.
---
Tanks have to:
---
-multi-task and hold threat of most or all mobs in a dungeon, this simple in practice but current spec and other people make this harder
---
-be knowledgeable of all strats / routes in dungeon
---
-usually have a higher level and gear requirement for dungeons than rest of the team
---
-lead the group and control pacing of the group. Rogue wants to pull but your lock and healer need mana
---
-know how to efficiently mark, clear trash, many people complain and throw a fuss over minor shit
---
-hardest job aside from healer, who also has a task can be made shitty by others
---
-sometimes get chewed out by absolute morons about the type of gear you need. Warriors are a black hole for gear, almost as bad as paladins, and we compete with a lot of classes for BiS items both tanking and DPS.
---
Pass judgement on what? I think you overestimate people's reaction on here. No one is hunting down this guy and making him pay. If they get the other side cool, if not cool. You seem to think people are out there raging at this.
---
You’re a dipshit.
---
Anyone have the brickseek link?
---
Night elf also happens to have the best passive for leveling a warrior in Wisp Form
---
I'll take 3 mobs 2 levels higher than me on my priest, but yeah, 2 mobs 2 levels lower on my warrior is a chore.
---
Careful, blizz has banned a few classic accounts for TSM recently. (90 day bans and the support is ass)
---
pointless to talk to someone like you, really. too immature. 
---
the situation here is barely worth commenting on too, as it's your typical drama. WoW raids are not that hard that you would need to be an elitist about it. If the guild advertised themselves as a casual/semi-casual guild, people like you would not be tolerated and kicked out there, Mad\_Maddin. 
---
Now a casual guild will likely have more of an attitude towards minimizing drama, and equal opportunity. They likely have not thought about how people that do much should be rewarded, as that has the potential to promote favoritism. Most dont even take note of someone helping out your guild. Except those that have been helped. Which may in the end just be a handful. Word may inf act not even reach the guild leadership.
---
I do this, but mainly because on my keyboard @ is alt gr+v and the client routinely thinks I want the entire content of my clipboard pasted in there when I'm trying to type my email address
---
Mage has it the best in PvE and PvP, all in one strong class. Can't go wrong.
---
So he’s just supposed to die?
---
I dont even understand what kinda build you are going for. No improved righteous fury? Shield specialization? Holy power is a very good healing talent. And the more flexible you can be on buffs the better. Reckoning is not super good in classic. 
---
This is generally the holy prot build that is good for both healing and tanking. 
---

---
same xD
---
Just play one and do the others later.
---
Always forget about this one it’s so spread out
---
Quick question, what talents do you use?
---
only for the screenshot so I could hide the desktop lol. Agreed.
---
Mine is Rothchild because Rothschild was taken :(
---
I mean i just read this story, and read plents other stories like this, so my solution (as a tank) is to simple rethink taking rogues with me. Hilarious how some of you also want to skip on the opportunity of opening chests (that exist in a locked state because rogues exist), thus proving some utility (which rogues barely have otherwhise). No worries. A hunter can take care of the scholo skeletons
---
&gt;no overpower or sunder on bars
---
You are making it harder on yourself.
---
Considering how they managed to kill Rag in greens (pretty much), I don't think they care about MS warriors.
---
no
---
Dailies sucked the joy out of the endgame for me, though.  The first time I quit WoW was when I logged on one day, realized that after my raiding group had fallen apart the only thing I had done in weeks was log on to run my daily quests and log back off again, and ask myself, "why bother?"  I didn't resub until Wrath dropped and there was actual enjoyable content to play through again.
---
Zf isnt gonna give you a big ticket item.. it's a guaranteed, non competitive stream of steady gold. I mean u could get crazy lucky but it's not for the blues even. Just steady greens and cloth
---
Didn't even know that was a thing, thanks.
---
it has nothing to do with his spec
---
Check for quests in ashenvale and stonetalon, also try to spam some BFD abd SFK. p.s. Questie addon (if u use addons) shows aviable quests with lvl reg. on a map.
---
It used to be a status symbol for the Guild due to how difficult it was to create, so it was rightfully seen as a Guild investment because having one made was a flex of your resources. That mindset hasn't really faded away but the "wow" factor of the weapon is certainly less than it used to be years and years ago due to meticulous number crunching for BIS over the years on private servers.
---
There was a mini ban war going on but it's over
---
Lol I have a bank alt called louis futon
---
I played wow from Wrath to MoP.  I enjoyed all those expansions, including Cata.  I've never touched BfA, after hearing so many bad things about it, I decided I didn't want to drop any money on it.   Also I heard gear has randomized stats like Diablo, which really, really fucking sucks for WoW.  
---
I'm only playing classic because a bunch of my old wow friends who played vanilla and since cancelled their subs bought me a month sub to try to get me playing to tank.   All of classics tedious time sinks have killed the magic for me.   I never liked the vanilla dungeons when leveling my alts in wrath, especially the WC and lvl 50 dungs.   And now I don't even have LFD to queue for them, making the experience that much worse.   I'm lvl 55 now and realizing all the content I hated most in wrath is endgame content, so I'm likely done with this.  
---
Unfortunately, BfA sounds quite different from wrath to mists.  But part of me is feeling like I should try it out for a bit, get all my alts leveled up, and hope Shadowlands is better.
---
I have severe altism sir... but I'm glued to rogue atm
---
It doesn't matter because you don't need tank spec to tank dungeons. People are just shit scared of tanking in Classic for some reason.
---
in the cave, seems like you didn't have to but it was fun =)
---
Source?
---
&gt; nor is it "computer science stuff".
---
If you're feral, you'll kill faster and therefore make gold faster. You'll also hit 60 quicker.
---
The gold cost for your respec is worth probably a couple hours of gold farming. You'll easily save 2 hours by doing the respec
---
I love doing this in game. There's always at least one person that doesn't 'get it'.
---
Eh, it’s only about 3 hours a day since launch
---
Don’t have saved links and am on phone rn, but we’re a decent amount last month on the wow economy sub, they were all playing classic too, think it’s TSM sniper iirc. Can post link in the morning on pc if you want
---
Call him a poor sport or a whiner all you want, If everything he claims he did for the guild is true, then they are fucked up bug time losing this guy.
---
If you learn it, no
---
People play warrior because it's the top dps class.
---
It'll cost you 3 gold to respec twice.
---
Yes, he patrols
---
&gt; both me and the rogue weren't thinking
---
seems like an easy solution
---
I don't know about the others, but Stalagg lags like a motherfuck when players mass in the open world like this. 
---
Recent large scale engagements in BRM have felt like EVE time dilation fights. It's just lag and lag and more lag and then one side finds out they lost.
---
You’re a clown. 2h fury is the best dps spec and class until phase 3. &lt;Rats&gt; whitemane on warcraftlogs if u wanna see my proof
---
NE makes for the most meta warrior, if youre trying to min/max. You just cant beat the wisp racial for end game content.
---
I honestly was not even aware that you could even log in with those fields. I thought it was just a vestigial organ from pre-battle.net days.
---
Yup. Cancer made me a NEET
---
Status weapon for getting fucking laughed at. Welcome to vanilla
---
How much +spell damage and healing gear do you have? It starts being more plentiful in the 50s, and you can score many decent pieces from the AH like the dreamwave set. Balance leveling is awful enough as it is, but if your gear does nothing to help your killspeed it's no wonder you're struggling to get anything done.
---
Shame on your +3 all stat enchant.
---
I actually enjoy tanking
---
Not the one you originally replied to my guy.
---
is this like one of those optical illusion books? my eyes never worked for them :(
---
Anyone: *opinion*
---
r/eyebleach.
---
The best part of this sub is all of the people you can tell have never raided in a real guild whining over LC.
---
If you are talking about life steal items they scale with spellpower. The sword in question scale 300% I think. Skullflame shield 100%. Axe from BRD chest 100%.
---
&gt;ould truly love to get the point of view of a guy similar to the one I posted about above, but something tells me I wouldn’t get it.
---
I COULD be the person you're talking about, and if you are, its either because half your guild has been absolutely ruthless and scummy causing an entire faction to mark you KOS (this has happened on my server) or you messed with one of my alts when I was just trying to get on with my day and ended up on my KOS list.
---
If you didn't know it was my toon or what your guild had done, it may seem random and unprovoked.
---
Of course the big ticket items will go to the trusted inner circle instead of flaky fucks who will just fuck off with it as soon as times get hard.
---
What does 8.x+ mean?
---
"also I haven't seen my family in *years*, I wonder if they still recognize me"
---
8ish and change days overall.
---
assist your guild in every way you can to move up in the priority list.
---
Ok let's just go back, I haven't been around the world so I'm not 100% sure if such purple sky is possible, I do however am 100% sure that such purple sky is  possible with editing, therefore this is 100% edited. Pls explain how this flawed logic isn't exactly the one U r using
---
Oh shit, thanks for being nice about it lol. Didn’t know if you were joking or not and am on mobile so just assumed it was the same person. Sorry
---
Congrats?
---
A spell only gets 100% of spell damage if it has a 3.5 second cast time. An instant cast gets like 15% of your spell damage.
---
lmao, its good to know Im not alone in doing this
---
Hm, actually, yeah, they have two charts
---
&gt;So we added two tables, in one we split the difference and went with 20 days as the average total time /played until reaching level 60 and in the other we used 10 days /played
---
...
---
&gt;Here is the data at 10 days /played
---
&gt;Even if you play 40 hours per week it will still take you 1.4 months to reach level 60
---
The other:
---
&gt;Here is the data at 20 days /played
---
&gt;Even if you play 40 hours per week it will still take you 3 months to reach level 60
---
I just grabbed the info from the second one.
---
So, I guess that depends on the player.  Some take 20 days, but I'd guess I'd be closer to ten days /played, each.
---
Figure about a year, total?
---
No. There are a lot of level 21 and 22 quests in Tarren Mill.
---
Applying a new scope will overwrite the old one, if that's what you mean.
---
Are you okay bro?
---
well if you shield them because they will othereise die in 3seconds they start flaming, so feel free to elaborate
---
Yup just making sure it wasn't locked in before I put it on
---
Yeah but we had 11 mages in our raid group to fight for loot, so it evens out in the end.
---
im sure you dont understand   
---
\*pat pat\* lmao 
---
And Im sure mr. career or whatever you claim to be, makes it impossible to write a full sentence LMAAAOO 
---
Not just neckbeardo
---
It’s not just holy attacks, it’s all holy spells (per recent Blizzard post).  GBoK increases threat by 114 per player affected.  RF increases this by 60%.  Say there are three mages.  Casting GBoK on them generates 114 x 3 x 160% = 547.2.  Cast it 3 or 4 times, and it is obviously huge.
---
As a mage is there a way I can even fight warlocks?  I had a 60 warlock mess me up earlier while fishing in red ridge.  "Isaid fine you want to throw down?" And went to get buffed and head into a battle.  He put me to sleep with his succubus then a death coil shadow bolt and shadow burn and I died in what felt like an instant.  I'd heard to be wary of their felhunter as a mage but I didn't expect that lol.
---
actualy felheart set have less shadow power than preraid bis... u got more hp and mana pool and some resist but the setbonuses are crap. only valuable thing from mc is the sword. that add +20sp to ur preraid bis gear. no better main hand for locks til nax.
---
shitty... i just wanted it so i stop hitting the wrong mobs without 20 seconds of pressing tab, oh well. thanks
---
Yes they do. Use mongoose first.
---
"cuntee" huh
---
Wait. Is this real?
---
I mean, most people can hit 60 around 7 days played, so it wouldn't be terribly unrealistic to shoot for one char a month, but yeah, I'd say a year is a pretty good guess
---
Go 0/30/21
---
You can tank (dps a little less) and heal but at decent level. I’m doing 5-10 man tanking and MC healing. Just prepare to have loads of bagspace for 2 gear sets.
---
Have you looked at the BiS lists for tanking and fury DPS on wowhead? It is fairly self explanatory. Neck, cloak, bow, trinkets, rings are nice slots for threat. Lionheart helm, Savage Gladiator Chain, bracers with hit if you need it, Brigam Girdle, legs from Prince in DM west, etc.
---
I use the GW2ui ui addon looks infinitely better than stock
---
He's on the side which calls the writer "a salty kid".
---
You can check this in his comment history.
---
So he's part of the problem.
---
Gonna check in a bit when i get home, but im pretty sure i wasnt kicked from world even if there's a pw now. And if there is, my guild is usually the ones controlling it so I'll get back to you
---
You're evil.
---
GG loot council.
---
Essence of water mafia is gonna get you.
---
That's why most people are saying "if OP is remotley true."
---
I'm sorry to hear that. But... quite a few ppl here said it's working, or somehwat working.
---
Scarab lord
---
Would be around 4%
---
You'll be in for a baaaaad time. Trust me. I tried. Those builds require some gear to work properly and that would be too hard to procure while lvling up. Go ret while lvling. Ret while lvling is really smooth without downtime.
---
I mention Baron specifically in the video when referring to that exact situation.
---
The other points you mention are talking about maybe a 1% increase in dps from optimizing swing timer and hitting energy ticks perfectly (like timing adrenaline rush activation and your opener with ticks). But you're right. To 100% maximize dps, these small things to add up.
---
There are many other pieces of green gear that was made unavailable in cstaclysm. The reason you.dont know the name of any of those pieces, and why none of them noteworthy is the glow effect on this sword.
---
Of course its huge that its not on the loot table anymore. A pre-requisite some might even say. But its not the only reason for its notably high price, and i would say the unique look is what drives the demand.
---
MC has 10 bosses, 8 drop 2 pieces of tier 1 each week, you get around 4 pieces of BoE tier 1 each week.
---
Rangaros is 2 pieces of T2 and onyxia is also 2 pieces of T2
---
Most guilds are At 6 full clears of MC now, and that's 7 ish onyxia kills too
---
That's around 120 pieces of T1, and 26 pieces of T2, and depending on the loot system some people are geared faster (like main tank, or a guild leader or officer in a bad loot council)
---
A full 40 man team in tier 1 would be 320 pieces of tier if it all dropped perfectly, so we aren't at that point yet, but seeing a decent number of people in full tier isn't unreasonable
---
Just checked on an alt. No password req. Also, Eternal has control of it again, so maybe they added/removed one? Idk.
---
Flying mounts - game over.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZMIVbbEz0boV
---
&gt;Seriously getting full preBIS is NOT very hard. 
---
RNG is a bitch, but its easy to notice someone actually trying or not.
---
Give this man gold 😂
---
It's an Eredar you fuckwit. Same as Archimonde and Kil'jaedan. Draenei have nothing to do with the Eredar you idiot. The Draenei are just some tribal culture living in the Outlands whereas the Eredar are interdimensional demon lords. No idea why a Demon Lord would be a paladin though.
---
It's not though. You can do that without any addons by just looking at the combat log. If you see a red line like "&lt;player&gt; gains arcane intellect" or any outgoing damage, you know there's an enemy player nearby.   
---
Spy just gets that name and puts it in a window.
---
Without fanboying too hard, Blizzard’s art team has always been top of the industry, in my opinion. Like lightyears ahead of everyone else. Their games are always gorgeous even on lower end PCs simply because they have such a profound understanding of art direction and how to create more with less.
---
Well threat capping is a big problem.  Generally you need your tank threat higher than increasing the damage 1 individual rogue does. We at least give all the gear the MT needs directly, ahead of anyone else, and that includes daggers, band of accuria etc. Plus Lionheart helm, gladiator chest, onyxia neck and all the other stuff previously thought "weird" for a tank to wear.
---
retail ofc with its personal loot
---
btw elemental fire is white so it's not rollable
---
Hes on Herod lmao i bought Devilsaur from this guy
---
tbf mageblate + spirit isn't even THAT much better than staff of dom for warlocks. sure 20sp is huge and weighted way more than the stam/it/spi on staff of dom, but the large stam/int on staff of dom is nothing to scoff at and has tons of warlock specific benefits. 
---
and arguably mageblade better on mages regardless of phase since they simply get FAR more hit than we can get. if we could get close to as much hit as them we would be by faaaar top DPS caster and prob even beat fury warrs/rogues atm.
---
2h fury is pretty legit though, at least with BRE or Nightfall. No serious guild would be using Hand of Rag in a raid setting.
---
Mage 100%. You can aoe farm and always get invited to dungeons
---
I have a really hard time taking the guy's post seriously. It reeks of bullshit. Way too self aggrandizing and completely dismissive of the other dude. Reality is never this black and white. To top it off this guy seems to put a whole lot of weight into "I deserve it because I'm going to grind rank 14" which may be completely meaningless to an actual loot council.
---
I tried different UIs but they are shit and the original UI is great. No Bartender etc for me.
---
Why do you care how someone else's UI looks. Set yours up the way you like it and forget about everyone else.
---
Taste differs and it's okay!
---
PVP consumables
---
wot
---
And this is why you go with dkp
---
No discussions just Numbers, that loot Council bullshit ppl invented to give gear themselfs First LOL
---
Newb there is no wow 8.0. wow will not last 30 years ( using current patch pacing)
---
But muh vanilla experience!! This is not how it used to be back then /s
---
I tried elv and tuk with classic but they’re both trash. I really didn’t like pitbull but I use luna for the healer functionality
---
What about balance druid rotation?
---
Yeah combat daggers is the raiding spec for daggers.
---
It does. If your hearth is up and you delete your hearthstone, using the in-game stuck feature will kill you and send you to a graveyard.
---
Why give mana to bad dps instead of giving mana to healed so you need less of them and bringing good dps.
---
Love how you claim I'm a clown right off the bat. I'm sure they do great with gear, but with blue and little prebis, it's not . I'm just a mare hpala explaining what my guild do.
---
Hope you get hugs today, seems like you need it
---
The blue dude looks fugly, why would blizz add more ugly races. Haven't they seem what happens with the ugly ones?
---
And mats for power leveling engineering. At least if you are on a pvp server.
---
How can you prove he's wrong and an idiot?
---
Might be, I dont have much experience with horde
---
Susan Sarandon
---
🇭🇰🇭🇰🇭🇰
---
He wanted to be the guild leader instead of just an officer to make the policies and calls. Others didn't agree with some of the things he wanted to change. For example, He wanted to do stuff like loot funnel to prep for P2 to get people geared so they have an easier time to PVP farm honor for epic PVP gear to use in BWL instead of our current DKP system because it was too slow in his opinion since if you bought an item with DKP, you're spent and won't have DKP to spend on the next big item until all the other mages have used their DKP too.
---
I didn't. I dont run my guild, I heal
---
not yet you don't have fun doing C'thun without flasks early on before everyone is in their 2.5/aq/bwl gear
---
It sounds like you don’t know how Spy works. It doesn’t just detect anyone who is nearby. It detects enemies that take an action that triggers a combat event.
---
No because I no longer support Blizzard
---
Ya that guild I am glad the good people left I kept running into total jerks from RS
---
Thanks this is perfect.
---
You're talking about being carried in a game where the most powerful pvp rewards are gated behind 16 hour days of afk grind instead of any actual skill. Also playing on a pve server makes getting higher ranks even easier because of all the casuals and noobs.
---
And I was wondering why I keep seeing warriors looking for other warriors to tank instances for them.
---
With a "modern" UI like this, it all makes sense now.
---
ElvUI master race
---
Anyone who didn’t share unfortunately.
---
We have had a boss pull and wipe with a few afks at the beginning of the instance, they were each teleported to onyxia and destroyed
---
I would say, because other classes scale even better with it.
---
Imagine mana tide totem rotations (swapping a resto shaman from a melee into a caster group mid-fight for the duration of mana tide) allows you to replace a healer spot for a damage dealer spot. Imagine filling that spot with, let's say, a damage dealer with a meta build rather than a balance druid or an elemental shaman.
---
Now not everyone is min/maxing and that's fine, the content is trivial enough. But if you worry about mana efficiency, I assume that you do, at least to some degree. And to answer your initial question (TL;DR): Because the mana is better spent somewhere else.
---
So because you help the guild you deserve special treatment and priority? I was the first rogue in my guild and I overperform on a weekly basis but I’ll pass on loot I need to help others. There’s no special treatment needed when you’re literally raiding MC for months before PvP comes out and even longer before BWL.
---
I dinged at the exact same spot! 
---
Great times.
---
Yep this is most likely
---
Are you on your phone? I think resto autocorrected weird.
---
on my server they went for 500g, very few people bought them as guilds would collaborate to acquire them. 
---
Flasks are nice to have, I'd say your MT and a few healers could benefit from them. But most DPS didn't even bother, I used to flask on my warlock just for funs to see how high i could get my dps/crits etc
---
It’s multiple guilds.
---
the amount of spirit you need to convert into any meaningful amount of mo5 is pretty huge. its hard to find the exact ratio but outside of classes like druid and priest who have talents that make use of their spirit you will always choose mp5 over spirit because the regen is far higher than what you’d get from just stacking spirit and it continues in between casts w/o 5s rule
---
I'm terrified at some point I will be required to know it. That will be the last day I play classic I guess .
---
It is worth it because if you take any damage during the 10 sec duration then you have generated a non-zero amount of rage you otherwise wouldn’t have for one gcd. Your rage spenders should take priority (MS, WW, Bloodthirst). 
---
Obviously in fights where you may be feared save berserker rage to break/negate that.
---
Gimme ur stuff thx
---
Several expansions from now ;).
---
I like classic but the rotations and playstyle for rogues later on is a lot more fun. Early wrath assassination was the best IMO, keeping everything up and running well took a fair bit of skill... but they ended up nerfing it and making the rotation a lot easier. Still fun though.
---
Why type a bunch of stuff when you can achieve the samw result with a couple of clicks?
---
So he wanted to ditch dkp, which is an unfair way of splitting loot for something else?
---
I mean, he did/does have a few good points.
---
And he made his own guild afterwards and half of the original guild followed him.
---
He probably had a few good points.
---
NO
---
You have to have a perfect memory of every boss emote and k ow ALL the timers BY HEART
---
Not really. People are generally lazy or do not want to dwell in such details. On my server, the pvp consumable materials have risen just 100% in price within the last month, it will be another 600..700% raise when the phase 2 kicks in.
---
It’s nice, I was using it today in MC. Took like 5 minutes to setup and now I just /itemrack equip singletarget, /itemrack equip aoe, /itemrack equip fireres. Will eventually be setting up /itemrack equip dps and /itemrack equip pvp
---
Alright I'll give him blue.
---
People that I have asked questions or have gotten help from
---
Nah. At least this is how I remember it too. I played with a couple of guys who was doing raid content with some proper raiding communities back in the day. But most players I knew were just running the normal instances, grinding out the tier 0,5, levelling alts, maxing professions and having fun.
---
Mages are superior for farming and of story and the drinking time is made easier as you laugh at your piles of gold and boes
---
APES
---
Shout if you have a problem, could probably Zip my one 👍🏻
---
or doing the exact same thing that the rest of his party did.
---
Anyone else uncomfortable?
---
&gt;Is this a good plan or am I missing something?
---
There's nothing you need to craft as a leatherworker that matters. It's an extra expensive that serves no real purpose to you specifically. If you're just making it for yourself, the patterns add to the cost. If you're making it for others tribal is a no brainer and your class doesn't matter.
---
Guides get kind of caught up in their minmaxing and forget that other players/an economy existing change what's realistically "optimal" quite a bit.
---
I clearly care about the guild more.
---
/gquit
---
Logic.
---
Flashlight is good people. &lt;SUNSET&gt; is an asian guild I think, also good people.
---
Might wanna work on your side though, my level 20 warlock got ganked literally 14 times trying to do a warlock quest in wetlands. Shame
---
Nope
---
This is more common than people may think
---
I don't care either way. I don't know the guy who wrote this or who Kai is since I'm new to the guild. I just found it amusing
---
Ice block the cast that comes while in seduce, poly lock kill pet, kill lock csing fear
---
In the same boat. I am going to create a hunter.
---
Are there any more widely used pvp consumables besides switness potion, limited invulnerability potion and free action potion?
---
Your question/questions seem scattered. I'm a Hunter, and we have almost no AOE potential while leveling. However, while I'm looting and skinning, I'm sending my beast to the next mob. Very little downtime for me. Will bandage when she gets low, but other than that it's constant killing. 
---
Can't speak for locks
---
&gt;Making patterns for people
---
This! Making clothing for people, helping others.
---
Casual guilds should not have a loot council. What is the point in that? Casual guilds should be rolling for loot or use DKP. Elite guilds are the ones that should be using LC.
---
yeah, i just want low down time, somewhat acceptable speed on killing stuff, and solo potential for grinding and stuff.  
---
So mend pet isnt enough to keep pet topped up ?=
---
If you hate downtime from a playstyle perspective, hunter has the least of any class. Warlocks can have "no downtime" but they have to swap their combo up to return resources and slow DPS to achieve that.
---
Of warlock vs hunter, hunter has the better options for instance farming via boss shenanigans.
---
Unless you are in a hardcore try hard guild deep prot with a decent rotation and a mix of threat gear is way more than enough. I’ve been main tanking MC for 3 weeks now as deep prot and never once had threat issues just using shield slam, sunder and revenge. Go deep prot and get the (simple) rotation down and save your fury tanking for being decked out in T1 with a full guild group who opens up immediately instead of waiting 5 seconds. Maybe 10% of all guilds currently raiding right now could actually benefit from a DW tank
---
&gt; But most players I knew were just running the normal instances, grinding out the tier 0,5, levelling alts, maxing professions and having fun.
---
*Effin casuals.*
---
Every second u dont have SnD up is a 20-25% dps loss. That said, tanks need a chance to get agro, so going to 5 can be worth it.
---
That is an entirely wrong assesment and shows that you are just parotting some basic information that you might have heard instead of actually having a clue.
---
5 bonus weapon skill will give you 3% hit against targets exactly 3 levels higher (i.e. raid bosses) this is because at level difference blizzard added a base 1% extra miss chance which makes weapon skill extra valuable since it alleviates that.
---
Alt+f4 every dam time
---
Sounds like our guild.
---
nah its shit for both pve and pvp. nearly all of them have odd itemizations and garbage set bonus that are good for nothing
---
Is it linked to both versions of the staff? 
---
So if i enchant healing both will have healing?
---
Report him.  Seems like something blizz would take action against as it's a blatant scam attempt especially assuming there was a conversation about buying orbs.
---
Theres no good defense
---
yeah i get bored if too much down time \^\^, if i can keep going and solo stuff and have little down time im pretty much happy.
---
WotLK pre-patch event was the most fun I've had in any game ever. It was so chaotic.
---
Did not even capitalize the R, what a shitty scammer
---
This is how it goes.
---
Someone tried to gank you when you’re fighting two mobs. You somehow manage to turn it around and kill them because they fucking suck. 
---
When he revives he brings along 4 buddies and they kill you. Then the original guy t bags your corpse while he spans GO TO RETAIL
---
Ok i'm going crazy here. Where are the training dummies in Orgri pls? I've been looking around for an hour now
---
I think that's the big thing for a lot of people. Regardless of where the game was heading development wise, the biggest nostalgia kick and their best socializing years are often from TBC.
---
Shame really, TBC isn't what I want from this version of WoW.
---
If you're any hybrid spec you basically need to be twice as try hard as everyone else. Full world buffs, every potion, spell damage flask and so on. Then you will, assuming your guild isnt insane, probably be above most people in damage. If everyone else is as try hard as you of course, you are not going to be near the top though. We have a shadowpriest and he is very try hard, and he gets the loot he wants.
---
All currency is virtual
---
When I first saw them in-game I was like holy shit I thought they added the broken models in BC, I guess not
---
Play hunter. It'll make you happy.
---
don't forget scholomance: 60ap, 8str, 8agi
---
My war alt is going so smooth. I still die every now n then cause warrior but I love every 10 levels just gearing em out with spare gold and buying pots lol about to get WW axe and immediately put crusader on it xD
---
Don't dump that on private server players.  My server had two of our GM slots taken by accounts on over twenty hours a day back in Vanilla.  That isn't a new phenomenon.
---
there is never a restriction on wearin leather too in retail either if you want to gimp yourself
---
And if you turn on improved lash of pain, it's 30% damage increase. ;)
---
I know that's true to an extent, but people want to go forth and do new things and take on new challenges together. Not do the same things each week with no reward and nothing to work towards.
---
They need to go forward, either in to BC or something different. Personally I think not using BC and other content they already have would be insanity, even if they were to change it somewhat when they did. But new content needs t ohappen.
---
I have to do this. Whenever I try to log back in from the login screen I get a message saying that WoW doesn't recognize my account.
---
aNyOnE eLsE?
---
A few days ago we were waiting for a mage to come to ZF.
---
He was somewhere in the Eastern Kingdoms so it took a while.
---
A friend of mine just respecced from 2h Warri to 2x 1h weapons and he had to skill maces so we just took on the lvl ~40ish beasts in Tanaris.
---
He skilled his weapons and me an a Pala skilled unarmed.
---
At the same time me and the pala fucked with the mage, because he told the party that he is a drjg dealer yadda yadda and we knew he was lying. 
---
After 20 minutes of screwing with that mage and skilling unarmed combat on these scorpions and hyenas at 4am the mage was paranoid (we told him Blizzard is giving text messages to the police and he shouldnt say that he is a drug dealer) and left the group.
---
So in conclusion I skilled unarmed combats on mops that dont give me a lot of XP only to have that mage logout and we couldnt do ZF.
---
In the last 10 years I never had so much fun playing a game.
---
I dont know what is so charming about classic, but do I have a great time playing it, even if I do nothing.
---
&gt; What is it you're looking for with healing keybinds?
---
Been watching some vids, i think i need to do that vidlayering thing from other toons to main to have click healing. And for aoe im thinking the aoe target needs to be in a key that turns on broadcasting on keypress, and cast on release or something like that ?
---
Mainly just interested how people have setup those things (and if possible share the profile so i can dig around it a bit). :)
---
I WISH i had a tank pally, aoe damage with a warrior tank is plain useless, meaning controlling the mages and warlock becomes a ton harder.
---
There was alot they pulled from azshara, they were going to have a large battleground like av there and alot they didnt put in until later.
---
Or 14 more ;)
---
"riverpaw gnoll tries to run away in fear." ahh yes, that was the piece I needed.
---
Friggen clown car.
---
Just don't be that guy in the guild who always bitch. And pick a dps prot spec. The core membership are the ones that respec constantly and have well geared alts ready.
---
I this Kael?
---
Not really, since he can ignore the BIS list and get full plate DPS items and still push out almost as good DPS.
---
In retail, you  have no freedom. You're forced to use the armor type your class  is designed for and doesn't matter how items look or almost not even what kind of stats they have, if it's an ilvl  upgrade it's better for you.
---
I don’t think that’s true I will test it and reply again
---
They would be incredibly stupid to introduce TBC and flying mounts to classic. The whole point of classic is that it is old school level 60 content, before the madness started.
---
THANK YOU........  MY god it was driving me nuts trying to figure out what the hell was killing my load times.  mine was creeping up to the minute mark
---
It's words on the internet.. even the most outraged responses here are from people alt tabbing at work/school or just bored and talking shit online.
---
Not everyone can be arsed playing detective. If someone posts something I have no reason to question, nobody contradicts it, and (most importantly) *it doesn't fucking matter if it's true or not*? Whatever, it can be true. I'll comment on it as if it is and then I'll go on with my day.
---
Why people make comments such as *yours* I don't know. Or care if I'm honest.
---
Was /world a thing back in the day? I started playing in TBC and played until Cata (with breaks) and I don't remember having a world-wide chat.
---
Me:"Ok guys, do not light all the fires at once. Just one at a time"
---
Tank proceeds to light all the lights
---
Tank:"uhm... ^yolo?"
---
Rest of the group:"FFS!"
---
That is the retail mentality though.
---
I had loot Drama only ONCE in classic in aq 40, by an idiot,that thought all itmes belong to him.
---
Most of the ppl were just happy that the raid/Group was working.. now 95% are item horny cunts.. 
---
They even think its their Right to act like they do (ninja etc), because they think to be so much better than everyone else. It’s so hilarious to see all those tryhard idiots playing 24/7, still having bad mechanical gameplay or rage about some item they don’t get.
---
But I guess that’s what happens to ppl when they play wow for years, since some itmes is all they have in their shitty lives lol
---
That's a stupid comparison.
---
Mentalities like yours is what makes the wow community so toxic all the time. Anyone no-lifing a video game like a lot of the people on here are fucking losers and should cancel their subscription and get a social life. Taking a fucking pretend item this serious is some of the dumbest shit I ever heard.
---
Not everyone plays for efficiency. I never played retail; classic is my first experience with wow. I don't have that much time to play. Ive only gotten to 33 on one account since it came out. I'm just enjoying myself. Play how you want.
---
Never let that damn Thief out of sight.
---
Just play a lock, and then don’t look back until you are 60.   
---
You’ll enjoy it for sure and you will have a fairly easy time to get a guild and loot since there doesn’t seem to be that many locks this time around.
---
Tons of warriors tank all the time. But only for people they know are good.
---
If you can't find a tank, I think that says more about you than the tanks.
---
No, *this* is why you're guildless.
---
I think it’s absolutely hideous as well. Not to mention immersion breaking. I also refuse to use addons that use this UI.  I don’t want wow looking like Windows 10. 
---
However, it’s not my UI, so I don’t care about other people.
---
I agree, everyone's different and plays the game unique to everyone else, that's what makes the world so great! 😊
---
Then they are definitely stupid. What's the point of classic, then? I'll quit classic when they release TBC or Wrath.
---
Don't stand in ironforge then. Join lookingforgroup and world channels and keep looking there. Simultaneously you go out into the world and level up.
---
53 is a shit level because while technically you can go ST, DME or Brd, only few people run ST and nobody really wants you in dme or brd.
---
😂
---
Says the person of no importance.
---
I’m a warlock, what’s down time?
---
Not really no... Warlocks are the absolute kings of 1v1.  
---
Between a higher base health, 3*2k shields, drain life and a healthstone, no single class has enough damage to take down a warlock.
---
If you end up rolling on ally whitemane dm me.
---
Haha, we did the exact same thing at around lvl 34 going from Southshore to SM. But people lined up and we did an amazing follow train :p
---
Who is yogg saron?
---
Um no
---
Well maybe, just maybe, people need to reevaluate how much time they invest in this game and not "blow through content". What happened to just enjoying your life and stopping to smell the flowers? What's with the addiction to grinding to the top? Haven't more people discovered the illusory carrot on a stick nature of such an endeavor?
---
I'd add warlock and shaman to the high utility classes as well.
---
Somehow I don't get queue priority when I turn off the game - only when I login manually.
---
So in a server with too many players and occasional layer crashes, I made manual login a habit again. It's not too bad, had to change the PW to something shorter and easily spammable though. Also hat to change from oldschool auth to new one click smartphone auth.
---
Do you mean Deadliness talent in Subtlety and not Deathbringer? Deathbringer's an Axe.
---
Well they still have 1 min to sprint back to the chest.
---
For most instances it fine l, only one I've had issues was strat ud. Started my own group yesterday was done in 3 minutes
---
If you click open all will it pay the gold automatically?? If so I need to be more careful.
---
Seal Fate dagger raider here. Where does it say I have to be combat daggers?
---
You gotta remember that about three quarters of these people are addicted to these pixels and have no life outside of WoW.
---
You are talking to a bunch of addicts who thinks the biggest addict should be the only one to get the good shit. It's because they relate more to the no lifer.
---
While what you say is true for sulfuras and applies mostly to atiesh, it is simply false for thunderfury. The threat boost it give to your main tank will allow the whole guild to crank out significantly more dps.
---
The server pop didn't farm to the max like crazy back in the day and all that hoarding is going to make it easier to get black lotus when you need it. If the sell ot then the price goes down because of undercutting. And if they use it for themselves then you can get time to pick. Bassicly the price might be high now. But the constant farming is just creating a overflow of black lotus. There isn't enough people who can raid bwl and needs it. People are actually just inflating the market.
---
It would be funny if I weren't terrified that it was going to come out too soon again and I wouldn't be able to complete Naxx
---
Looks interesting but dropping the beat scaling ability in the game seems wack
---
Lvl 39 at almost 9 days played...idk how these guys are doing it
---
lvl 42 already? Haha wow that's way too hardcore for me I am lvl 7 , I was just leveling fishing in Stormwind and explored the world a bit.
---
&gt; in a balance/ele group
---
What is that?
---
Tempest
---
So annoying!  I let it log 'cause I go /afk, returning to login.  Don't know it.  ALT+F4, then restart [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client ... in hopes WoW login will return.  Sometimes it doesn't, then have to try again.
---
So for this you'd need level 40, at which point you would've had 5/5 Vengeance and 3/3 Two handed weapon spec, and given that you're better off using Crusader than Righteousness, you're wasting a lot of points into a gimmick. Most of your damage comes from white attacks, so look to buff those as much as possible ( yes, even 5% parry chance is good, since it provides you with more sustainability and damage )
---
Only reducing the spawn timer doesn't really do much, it only gives more lotus to the people camping the spawns. 
---
A private server I played on somewhat fixed this by increasing the number of spawns and by changing the respawn timer from a static 1 hour to a random spawn window (I think it was 30-70 minutes, so slightly boosted rate).
---
20-man raid gears up twice as fast as a 40-man one.
---
Yeah you can always spot the people who had their shit drop and be won within a few runs each. Doesn't work that way for everyone, some people don't ever see their BiS and others never win when it drops.
---
Yeah, you're right. Sorry about that.
---
In any case, I think mods flagged your post as hidden.
---
Also full of sugar , typical yank
---
Will they actually use it though or just sell it on AH themselves? You can't know if they will and that's why everyone needs on BoE's in pugs.
---
it shouldn't.. there is a window and you have to click accept.
---
That being said there is no reason to use cod for orbs just use the AH or direct trade
---
/roll 3
---
I wish I saw more retributions Paladins.  I can't even TEST smite dps half the time because of how hard they are to find.
---
This is the most retail complaint ever.
---
People saying how OP STUPID AND EASY mages leveling is, obviously don’t appreciate how well this mage did, coming very close to dying quite a few times.
---
It takes a good deal of practice to get the cone of cold to hit ALL the mobs EVERY time. This guy missed a few times too, but otherwise very well done!
---
You are one spikey boi
---
fury is the best pve dps spec and there is no such thing as dual spec yet
---
&gt; People who have been with a guild for a long time where this kinda bullshit doesnt happen
---
&gt; where/how did you find your guild ?
---
Made my own. Currently all content on farm pretty much drama free.
---
Well, no offense, but if ALL of your social experiences are negative ones...Maybe take a good hard look in the mirror
---
I can't afford it :( It's at 135g on my server.
---
How does someone have 77g at 20 and I'm sat at 43 with barely 40g :(
---
except the kind you hold in your hand?
---
Nexus went 9/10 last week
---
Also love the paper! So happy I chanced out and rolled this server!
---
What sword?
---
Oh definitely, Leatrix Plus has tons of functionality. I usually stay away from big mods like that though, I prefer to pick and choose small mods that just focus on one thing.
---
I try to make my UI as minimalistic, simple and out-of-sight as possible in order to see as much as possible while grouped or while raiding. This is especially important while raiding, since I got 40 health bars I have to fit in on my screen and keep from going too red and all gray. 
---
Coincidentally it allows me to see a lot more of whatever area I'm questing/grinding in as well, which is nice - the artwork of WoW is really quite appealing, despite its age (thanks, graphics engine update).
---
Except that one ele shaman that kept blowing me and a mate to pieces once in winterspring. Heck, I would like to say that I'm among the "better" PvPers in wow, but damn I had no chance against that guy. Granted that I messed up on grounding totem.
---
Hahaha, [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fierceflow/comments/8n1qdn) is literally you. Good luck being a fucking neet, bitch.
---
I did just this recently. I went straight to consecration because paladin is a class with 40 points for talents and a mandatory 11 points in holy, and then took ret. Got the reduced mana, parry, crit, movespeed soc, all the yummy early ret tree stuff. 
---
At 41 I respecced to prot/consecrate and got blessing of sanctuary and became god of tanking. U know that part in cathedral where if u aggro the boss he aggroes the entire cathedral? I did that on purpose without clearing side rooms, took around 15 mobs at a time no problem. Was full clearing cathedrals in like 12 minutes with a mage group.
---
100g an hour? I farmed golden pearls for 4 days and only got 3... I don't think the drop rate is worth it.
---
So monopoly money?
---
I know right, F and respect for our brother, who took the time to hide his interface for the bis screenshoot
---
This one was harder for me the winterspring and ungoro ones were the easiest
---
Just wait until you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind.   
---
Pull 2 mobs -&gt; Activate SS -&gt; WW  
---
The shower of big numbers is so satisfying.
---
It's a 'bit' false presumption that multiboxers spend hundreds of bucks for this game every month.  
---
WoW Tokens have been around for over 4 years, and for 4 years I've kept my 20box up and running ( both subs and buying xpacs ) with just gold, paying $0/month year after another.  
---
Also, I do not approve any of the shit this multiboxer have caused for our reputation
---
Have fun! Just wait for the SM set
---
Yes it can be a pain. I spent an hour studying maps/guides of that place to know where everything is.
---
Then I lead the groups and decide which bosses to go to. You have to be strict with people otherwise you’ll get pulled all over the place and won’t get anything done.
---
Well I am usually doing around 30g per hour, sometimes more, sometimes less, with herbalism also ofc. Yesterday I dropped 3 green swords there which was 15g in itself (2hour session) + greys + herbs. I made around 80g in 2 hours, was lucky with drops tho. Which is fine by me for healer. But still, I looted epic book on my first day of farming in DME from dusty tome and sold it for 750g and bought mount epic mount right after... There is this little gamble with books on the ground in DME lasher farm which is cool and keeps me interested in farming more. I know where 2 spots are right where lashers are. If anyone know another locations there - let me know :D
---
(crops out savage chain)
---
literally anything you can do for gold in classic is a thing you can do for gold in tbc
---
Found my second one yesterday. It's been a month for me with herbs farming almost every other day
---
My dude you just got anal with no lube from all those ally holy fuck.
---
You claim your full prebis but you do t even have +4 stats to chest lionheart or cloud keepers I call bs
---
Is there any addons similar to polite whisperer which was around in TBC?
---
I find whispering people best for finding groups but I lose track of who I’ve messaged already and who has replied.
---
I play overwatch and this is exactly what I do because my password for battle.net is ridiculous and I don't feel like looking it up constantly!
---
is there any different way?
---
You mean leveling content. Endgame warrior's a killing machine.
---
Make an alt.  Potentially on the other faction so you get to see more quest lines.  If you don't enjoy just doing 5-mans for the sake of 5-mans then yeah its just gear on the treadmill.  I actually liked doing them a ton but finally got a bit burnt out after doing so many so I switched to leveling alts when not raiding.
---
So true. Skipping best attacks is just dumb.
---
But if there is one game that allows you to play all roles it retail?
---
In this game you have to stick to a specx no?
---
I feel sorry for everyone who absolutely have to theorycraft every aspect of the game, must be a pain in the ass. 
---
Personally, losing maybe 1% dps against combat swords on the meters versus an enjoyable, personalised spec? Sign my up for enjoyable. 
---
Also, fuck pre-raid BiS.
---
Yeah you can try it out yourself by watching your stats when you put em on. Both buffs will show but only one actually applies.
---
But like, if someone was to buy you a sub.... would you still be able to play...?
---
Download Slashfour addon. Its a lfg addon that uses key words to categorize what people are wrighting in lfg and so on to show you it in alot better way.
---
I went with Clothboy, Flowerboy, Leatherboy, Meatboy etc. 
---
Everyone knows you can't just have one bank alt..
---
OH res usually means the off hand is reserved
---
ID relates to the raid ID, having a Jed ID just means he’s spawned in that certain instance ID
---
Alright so i got the game, i don't really know what rel to pick though, should I go for the PvP experience?
---
Use a macro to have your pet destroy totems, coil when they get near, put an amplified coe on them and kite with dots.  
---
Alternatively, use a succubus and burst them down, shamans can't get out of charms or fears (except tremor, but again, macro to destroy them instantly).  
---
Shamans are a tough matchup for any caster, but it's definitely worse for mage/priest than warlock.
---
Then everything changed when Jay Allen Brack/Activision took over.
---
Yeah. Because my personality makes people ninjaloot vendortrash and act like twats because someone isnt topping dps. Fuck off dude
---
So you're saying that people who think that world is not the focus of World of Warcraft are somehow wrong.
---
Yep.
---
Do Edgemaster's Handguards work on 2H swords?
---
Yeah I will keep the 8 mp5 one for raids, thanks!
---
Pretty good answer actually.
---
Shit, I leveled my warrior first and this is still my experience. I am, however, what I believe is called... a noob.
---
OH = offhand (referring to dal'rends which drops from rend)
---
ID = instance ID, usually people will say "jed id" referring to having a rare called jed up, who drops a nice caster trinket
---
Check out this guide: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-balance-druid-leveling-talent-build-1-60
---
What a great sample size.
---
Ye I also killed a few murlocs and got lucky that doesn't mean it's a reliable farm method.
---
Living outside your mom's basement is much more expensive than 15$. That could be a reason 😱
---
Why not.
---
Alright
---
but.. you have Alliance flair..
---
No just on one handed weapons
---
Could you elaborate what it's specifically lacking in raiding? As far as healing is concerned it's not missing anything important.
---
I'm not sure about the joking part, but it's not really correct. "Draenei have nothing to do with the Eredar" is incorrect. Draenei are basically uncorrupted Eredar - so the opposite of the Man'ari (basically corrupted Eredar).
---
Also, the things jns swamps of sorrow are really draenei that went through the dark portal when it was originally opened but turned mad due to homesickness. Swamp of sorrows is basically next to the dark Portal, a Portal to Draenor, where Draenei live... Why would they be anything else?
---
The OP said a few hours a day, not a week. Regardless, the guild decided that it was gonna be rolled on and that's how it will work. It's the guilds money to do with what they please not this assholes. He don't run the guild. Just because one guy decided he's more important than everyone else doesn't mean it's true. Being a loser who plays vidya all day doesn't automatically make you deserving of shit. The only person who deserves it is the person the guild decides. If he took issue with that, it's probably best that he left. It's obvious he cared more about an item and his own greed than his guild.
---
Besides, throwing a fit over some pixels is some childish shit. Giving someone like that what they want is just enabling their shitty behavior.
---
So the most common thing I see is either MH and OH reserved.  This refers to a set of 2 swords that a boss can drop - Main Hand and the Off Hand.
---
The ID part is referring to the Dungeon ID and that someone has found Jed in that ID which is a rare boss spawn that I believe most casters want for his trinket.
---
This post is inaccurate jed drops a wand and only a wand :)
---
So you're saying that people who think that world should be the focus of World of Warcraft are somehow wrong and that it is raids that made this game great in the first place?
---
Google HOTW spec. Feral spec that can heal at end game. Don’t need to respec.
---
I need whatever you are smoking
---
If you get a huge group and invade their hearthstone location, technically it is beatable
---
Well *Ackshual* *Ackshually* lots of zones have two flight paths in it! Feralas has three because horde has one there too.
---
&lt;pushes glases up nose&gt;
---
It's that kindof "legendary-for-everyone-entitlement" that ruined retail wow.
---
Legendaries are suppose to be **LEGENDARY** and only reserved for the most try-hard-uber-nerd-legendary-players.
---
Yes I would be able to. I have time, just no money due to some things
---
Not sure if this is on mograine, but in there my char is named ragnaros and for some reason i tend to always have the ownership of world channel
---
So, I just hit level 40 on my Priest and I have only 35 gold saved up. Been learning only the essential spells and been vendoring trash. Is there any way I could farm gold at my level to afford the mount? I have mining at 170 and quite some mats.. Quite new to wow and would appreciate any advice on gold really
---
That actually works?? I thought it would still pop up for rolls even if you're dead/in spirit form?   
---
Good to know..
---
The rogue would never get access to the chest if it wasn't for the group; the group wouldn't ever get access to the chest if not for the rogue. You need each other. So it's only fair that everybody gets a chance to win, right?
---
Firewater and Juju stacks afaik? Same with Elixir of Giants and Juju?
---
because you cant, ive been in the paladin discords and searched through everything for "proof" of sor double procs, and there was absolutely nothing except a few combat log screenshots which might as well just have been due to lag or inconsistent batching.
---
SoR does not proc anything, and if it can proc very few certain effects (like the fiery blaze enchant) it may very well be a bug and not intended. SoC procs are intended to count as seperate additional attacks, and have been tested and proven to be able to proc everything.
---
So you wanted to be a Tauren?
---
For other rogues seeking advice, don't do this.
---
Lazy or efficient? 
---
I mean, I don't do it because I'm lazy, I do it because it's literally faster to restart the game.
---
Id say retri is the WORST of the three, by FAR.
---
Nah just downvote and move on like everyone else it's cool.
---
Good on you to stick it out to the end with the 2nd group. All the people that tell you to leave the group earlier are wrong, IMO. The guys from this group have to have a chance to learn as well, a chance you now provided by taking over the core roles with you and the other Paladin. 
---
I bet that you or the Ret must've made it onto at least one of the other party member's friend list.
---
Leaving early is a mindset that we don't need in this community driven game.
---
I know this comes too late but if you main a warrior it's *much* easier to level against mobs a few levels below you. Just got to get ahead of the curve by doing an extra 5-10 zone and then you're golden.
---
My tauren ass pulls pretty much half the dungeon I find myself in, and i am infamous for: Not remembering to loot core hounds, getting aggro right off the bat in p3 in onyxia dying horribly, ass-pulling some molten giants, ass-pulling something else, and a fuckton of other stupid mistakes... I am the highest performing healer in my guild and I am a druid...
---
Same experience here.
---
There were Panderan Monks in WC3 so I wouldn’t be at all surprised. I’ve got ‘Pandamonium’ reserved already, just in case.
---
The raids in TBC and Wotlk were just sooooo much better than vanila. And I realy prefer 25 over 40 man.
---
The 5mans are kinda close, bug just because of how they feel. They feel more story connected than in later two expansions.
---
That's bogus logic man. That shield is worth let's just say 200g. If a mage wins the roll he can now sell it and buy a different 200g epic. If the warrior wins he can do the same or equip it. It has too much gold value to just allow somebody to reap all the rewards simply because their class can immediately equip it, what an arbitrary rule.
---
Yeah, "I chose a pussy realm, why does nobody here want to fight me?"
---
And the patrol is a LOOONG one.
---
that will last you until brd for sure.

They also gave us reworked items and talents right away which is massive, but nobody here seems to care.
---
my first 60 was my hunter, it took 9 days 10 hours played, priest was 7 days . i got pretty lucky on the priest and this pally tank god was boosting his mage friend to 60 , so i would heal, he would pull all of SM , and 3 mages would aoe. he was super easy to heal :D
---
Disenchanting this gives Shadoweffect the funds necessary to purchase pieces of his own gear. #noninja
---
I could definitely be wrong, but i remember hearing it's running on the legion engine

To me it seems like a massive waste dumping points into the protection tree if you arnt going to be tanking and picking up RF(when are you ever going to use a shield if not tanking). When I freshly hit 60 I dumped 13 points into proc, allowing me imp RF and letting me main tank all 5 man's for easier gear pick up.
---
I'd personally run 21/0/30 - allowing you to heal dungeons and raids and solo/reasonable dps in 5 man's with Vegeance, conviction and sanct aura. Use a sword/Mace if you are a human for more hit with that 5 plus weapon skill.
---
one is mine, one is holding a name, one is my little brothers
---
Just look for "brd quest run", most quests are in the first half of the dungeon and I see people looking for those a lot especially on alliance side with the ony pre chain.  it doesnt matter if you have any quests or not if you just want to get some xp or kill some of the first easier bosses in there.
---
If tbc or wotlk were released today I would ditch classic for them instantly. Not sure if I would even raid log classic.
---
I had a mage do that to me at the graveyard in WPL.  I tagged one mob for the kill quest and he whispers me like: "wtf are you doing why are you intentionally targeting my mobs?"  Sorry bro I gotta kill 10 of these guys and you shouldn't have any issues as a mage with someone single targeting a mob here or there while you aoe down twelve or more at a time.  Some people are so entitled.
---
He said threadmill not treadmill - totally different thing.
---
Well, to be fair it filled in my 2006 username. Not my email.
---
around 17 days played for 1-60 on both. its been out a bit longer than 2 months , ive spent every second of free time on classic :P
---
At 60 it’s healer but before then you’ll probably level as retribution but you will be able to tank dungeons as protection up until 60. At 60 you may have issues.
---
Sorry to hear about your dad, I hope that Classic is giving you that connection to him. It is so much more than just a game to so many of us.
---
Same people downvoting you are the ones thinking that a hunter pet should never do anything despite the fact a pet can move quicker and stun a mob hitting the healer AND it doesn't matter if it dies. (compared to the ret pally)
---
Shit happens in dungeon so while you can talk mythic raider level how things SHOULD go it often fucks up and you're all just reacting on the fly to the given situation. Ret pally swapping to concentration aura and doing whatever to get aggro on the mob killing the healer is much nicer than letting them die.

Hope you hate it.
---
I'm on a different realm, but found that (as usual) tanks are in even shorter supply than healers; which makes perfect sense from an endgame (raid) perspective.
---
Most encounters require 2 tanks out of 40, whereas you keep 7-8 healers. Pure numbers game. The fights requiring more tanks are not that many, and can be solved by having DPS warriors equip some tanking gear and take a Defensive Stance. 
---
I'm also fairly sure that far fewer would agree to shoulder the role as a tank than those who'd agree to heal, just because you have to do more (or at least a different type of) work to keep the group alive when your 3x DPS run amok in the dungeon group, hitting everything they can see except the skull. 
---
That said, if you manage to find a big and active guild (big in terms of numbers of 60s or near-60s, not big as in "1000 members, with 900-something being low levels or idiots", even if you only join with a Social (non-raider) rank. Shouldn't be a problem to find a dungeon group if there's a lot of active players of your level. In addition to strong group heals, shamans bring unparalleled group utility through totems, and it can be tailored based on group or encounter. Having a 6s CD interrupt is also insanely good, and on higher level dungeons it's often worth putting off a heal by 1-2 sec in order to interrupt that annoying Shadow Bolt Volley or whatnot. So many good tools to use!
---
Good luck out there
---
What chest piece should I wear? Cadaverous armor or the Shadowcraft Tunic with 4pc set bonus? I lose a lil bit of crit but gain 10 AP.  I play combat daggers
---
I blame the threadmill.
---
its all about how efficient you level
---
Two of my lvl 60s I have ~5 days played lvl 1-60
---
Its a shitshow because its full of people who have no idea what they are doing.
---
Its kinda like scholomance which I think is the hardest 5man just because its common to invite lvl 58s there.
---
t'was a joke
---
you don't go fury/prot dual wield until you are losing aggro as deep prot.
---
Horde can just teleport into gnomeregan...but then again, feral is only viable on alliance side so.
---
I did probably 20 runs and saw only the wand.  I've since seen a few reeds and got my own and still never once seen the cloth head.
---
ebonys multibox assistant classic or emac
---
you dont need to multibox to take advantage of it.  has some useful features even for a single character if you aren't already running something like leatrix plus or another equivalent.
---
What do you mean? There's plenty to go around on EU servers.
---
&gt;when we kill Ony I try to end phase 1 with 5 combo points built up, giving me a full slice and dice the instant we start damage on phase 3.
---
Out of curiosity, don't you do anything else during p2? As a rogue you can stand under the boss and SS or backstab while she is in the air. I can usually build 5 points, eviscerate and then get another 5 before she lands.
---
I read those post almost everyday. Started a warrior myself some days ago and was already scared. I'm level 20 now and never died. I don't know what the problem is actually. He can easily kill 3 mobs same level, doesn't have much downtime and is already a lot of fun. Maybe I'm doing it wrong...
---
Yep.cba typing ! Problem is...i am gonna forget my password when i need it fuck
---
Oh wait I have seen that head piece, the one with like a ton of int right? Is that pre bis for anyone?
---
Is there some sort of dueling etiquette that prevent mages from spamming polymorph? Or is it normal for the mage to keep resetting to try and get the upper hand?
---
Still using mine too from when they first came out, core hound forever!
---
how about you PVP as holy too? paladin is the best PVP healer in the entire game. why is eeryone obsessed with meme ret instead...
---
Happy about beating vegans, not happy about beating beer though but oh well
---
I have been giving  it up too but luckily  finally got it yesterday  After so Many runs  ^^ also had to roll against 3 other people :P 
---
And I rolled 100 
---
So I would say never give up Xd
---
Feels like a real demonic version and what draenei should be.Not "pretty" blue goat people
---
I've tanked 50-100 dungeons my first time through WoW and especially in later dungeons BRD onwards, the inexperience can result in so many wipes the first run through (even though I'm decent enough that by the third run through healers start to PM me to add me).  Those first runs have probably ruined my reputation with a number of players and I find them embarassing.  
---
Often I do get amazing players who guide me and it goes smoothly, but it can often be hit or miss about them knowing where the patrols are, which packs to pull or charge in, where to los, target priority etc.  The tank is the only new player that has to go and watch a youtube commentary of the full run so they can commit the route, pack locations, patrol locations, boss mechanics, etc to memory and if you can't recall the second half of the dungeon the team's performance because of you goes rapidly downhill.
---
He's roleplaying as an angry nerdsplainer from before the TBC lore was revealed, before the connection between the draenei (lost ones) and the eredar was a thing.
---
Do tanks or melee dps need FR gear for onyxia? Would tanks sacrifice their stats and armour values for FR?
---
then why the fuck did you make this post?
---
I would believe you'll get more out of Elemental Leatherworking as a Resto Druid. You'll be able to craft Living Shoulders which you can get profit from, as most people would rather buy that then farm pre-raid BiS shoulders. Since everyone else is Tribal Leatherworking, you will have a tougher competition to craft Devilsaur/Hide of the Wild.
---
Don't recall one either. I'm positive that LFG chat was still global though, at least until some point in wrath where they made it restricted to cities for some reason.
---
yeah which makes it funny how he keeps talking about leveling :D
---
Oh, are you picking a class actually? Wasn't apparent from the OP.
---
The lowest downtime would be afflic locks - drain tanking lets them fight indefinitely against weaker mobs, as the combination of Siphon Life, Drain Life, Life Tap and Dark Pact recover resources faster than they're being expended on doing damage.
---
Overall mobbing speed won't be that good, granted, cause it's not exactly dps monster to begin with and furthermore reaching peak damage output takes a few seconds of putting up DoTs.
---
I sell angerforge runs for HOJs on my  holy priest. 2g per person per run. Not bad stuff.
---
I always heard Heroic Strike was a waste of rage, and I remember MonkeyNews saying that if you use HS after level 10, you are playing your class wrong. but I didn’t know what else to spend rage on until about lvl 30-ish when I noticed Sunder Armor was useable in battle and berserker stance. Instant attacks which trigger overpower more made it so much easier.
---
Spy addon knows you are there :D But cba to make detour probably
---
After 2 years, you will be lucky to find 50k+ active classic players. People will be begging for TBC.
---
Still Interrested? its not "amazing" but if you do it right it works, Here´s one example.  
---
i did from 10 to 15 in 40minuts. on the coast of westfall killing level 12-13 crabs.  
---
I, a level 10 mage Tagged mobs with wand. and my 2 friends. level 19 Warlock "twinks" enchanted and Geared chars dotted everything i tagged.   
---
Thies crabs just kept on spawning. we had zero downtime. the thing about this is, that the warlocks helping, can´t be more than 7 levels above what they are helping killing.   
---
Once i was 17 i had 2 lvl 24 warlocks kill the crabs i tagged longer down the Coast. and so on.
---
I guess you are doing the «wrong» zones and quests. 
---
My, coming from a hunter, i had to adjust. I can’t do mobs og quests +2 or +3 levels higher than me on my warrior, like i could on my hunter. I have to do the one -1 or -2 levels lower than me. Not often i die then.
---
yea you can have both active but you wont get more than 25 agi from both together :p
---
I get what you’re saying and agree, but if you’re the type of person to rage in RFC, you probably need a break from the game...
---
Jed is a patrol, therefore moving.
---
He isnt always in target range of the entrance.
---
I leveled a warrior to maxlevel and I will never ever fkin do it again!
---
I saved [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6dt6o/the_blackrock_depths_experience/) special for you, not written by me but absolutely awesome.
---
My first quest run in there was with people being too low level and not so well geared - we made it to Emperor (two of my pieces red, as healer) and when the tank died and all his gear turned red, he just gave up. Can't fault him, it was a run full of struggles and it was probably 12-1 AM on a weeknight. Then I read that post and felt a bit better, but once asleep I once more found myself in BRD, there really is no escaping it. 
---
Yes, that place really is something else!
---
it's pretty good for warriors
---
It everyone greeds that is following ms&gt;os.... no one needed it for their main spec so you needed it for your offspec.... that's literally what ms&gt;os means.  Add everyone who cried to your ignore list and move on.
---
Beyond that if you want to roll against other people who need for their mainspec you should tell people before the run but since that's not even what happened here.....
---
I feel like a lot of people are a little bit deluded if they think Blizzard will do anything other than release BC after some time... 
---
BC Was my favourite expansion. That said, I still don't want them to release it too soon. I want to really experience and take in classic before we explore the next chapter. 
---
But anyone who thinks that they will introduce a runescape like system or 'Classic+' is kidding themselves in my opinion. Sure, it's possible, but the chance is very low and BC is almost certainly the next step after 6 months or a year of Naxx.
---
Yes but it was new and cool(ish) then, the current day 12 year olds are all playing fortnight
---
Just make sure your run away from mages.
---
Can you proc Winter's Chill on all MC raid bosses with  Rank 1 Frostbolt?
---
My exact point. You're not getting banned for tagging a mob.
---
Oh no, definitely not. I've decided that it's not worth doing the whole dungeon and all the quests. I'll run it once more for the MC atunement once I'm 60, and maybe a few stealth runs for HoJ. But definitely won't do all the quests, even though my goal was to do them all in the beginning.
---
It also made PVE irrelevant. In vanilla, PVP success is partly determined by how much PVE gear you have
---
I just started a warrior alt, only level 13 atm but I keep dying all the time, and I bought every single green I could find with sta/str ...
---
Always haha
---
Does rogues use elementium sharp on any of their weps, or just poisons?
---
Hey its you again :D Wna buy some more gold or lvling boost? (Check his post history its hilarious)
---
PLS GOD PLS
---
I'd transfer my char with deletion from classic servers in an instant
---
use [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) not [wowhead.com](https://wowhead.com) ????
---
Holy shit i thought I had lots of key binds with 39, how do you reach ctrl+9? with your pinky+thumb or do you release the hand from the mouse? :D
---
Assuming that he reset at the start of the run (I didn't quite catch if he reset as he got to GY or not, I watched it with 2x speed and skipped a lot of parts), you can easily shave off 20-40k exp\h. If he reset right before GY, waaaaay more.
---
But I can still imagine this being the most efficient way for a 44 mage to level, as you never have to fight for mobs.
---
Just saying that you're gonna screenshot is absolutely fine and might make the other guy think extra next time before sperging out, but I can agree that the part with "to show how stupid you are" might not be neccesery.
---
exactly!
---
remember what happened to a fresh blue geared 70 tank in Shattered Halls heroic? God that was fun
---
If only I could upvote more than once. This really hit home.
---
Because someone posted a video that says otherwise and he said “I’m being downvoted by people who farm lotus” when I am 100% positive this isn’t the case because I also downvoted him.
---
Firstly, BRD is a dungeon of compromise. To attract players, you need to be willing to do extra bosses that you yourself may not need, particularly if the bosses aren't out the way.
---
I'd start by getting the Shadowforge key for yourself. The quest to pick it up can be found &gt;!in Forgewright's Tomb, which is the centre platform where the BRD meeting stone is. You need to be dead to speak to the NPC!&lt;. This run takes you through the "intended" way of the first half of the dungeon and includes Arena, Loregrain, Fineous and Incendious, but is easily adaptable to include Roccor, Interrogator, Houndmaster and the Black Vault to complete other quests people may have (Shadowforge quest runs are usually people's first time on that character).
---
After you have the key, you're ready to access the dungeon through it's many shortcuts when you return at a higher level to complete the second half.
---
Hi, /u/DrRant

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
why would you want that? if someone tries to log in on a different location it will ask them.
---
Yeah, Ive seen a couple of situations where people roll need for MS while I could use it for OS. In those instances I just greed. And you are right, Ill tell people in advance how Ill be rolling given my gearing needs.
---
&gt; I can but I don't need to and I'm better off leaving it to the ranged rather than running around tunnel visioning
---
Fairplay, we do 2 20m runs instead of a 40m so our p2 dps is very important. 
---
&gt;possibly messing with whelps or getting caught by a deep breath
---
During p2 I am mostly dpsing from where the tanks tank her in p1/3, far away from any whelps and the perfect place to avoid deep breath.
---
&gt;Other big thing about being a rogue (or any DPS) is knowing when to stop.
---
I mean, if I can do damage during an encounter with no drawbacks I am going to, stopping is slacking imo.
---
classic pvp is a joke compared to TBC / Wrath
---
No, they were literally banned for TSM sniper.  Wtf
---
That said, I'm always looking to improve... if you'd like to provide better information please do, if you're correct I'll adjust my own playstyle.
---
If you link your warcraftlogs i can help you get better
---
PFFFFT ya that’s classy stuff
---
Anyone can be a joke, Jim.
---
It’s quicker to close the game and restart it than it is for me to type my email and password, then open the Authenticator and type that in too
---
The only thing that comes to mind is if you played the first few weeks to 60 when all the really really experienced players were playing.  I rerolled and had to take break due to work commitments so most of my experience is in the 2nd month after launch when I expect there were a much higher proportion of newer and lesser experienced players.
---
I’m playing a warrior.
---
I’m level 44 and currently am Arms Spec.
---
I want to start to do more tanking and having a hard time keeping threat especially when  doing multiple mobs.
---
My main question is. 
---
When do I need to switch to protection?
---
What is the best way to hold threat when holding multiple mobs??
---
Well I accidentally sent some one 10k, after getting my alts name wrong! Although this was retail so the equivalent is about 10g lmao!
---
Anywhoo, I didn't get in trouble for SENDING it, and the other guy never sent it back obviously.... I kinda hope he got banned for being a prick but hey I don't think I'd have sent it back either tbh...
---
I enjoyed shadowfrost a lot more. But yeah 1shotting obliterates was fun
---
Im sure you could say that on all of the servers, due their size. Only real difference might be faction balance.
---
Yeah I usually start at 20 as well.
---
Also if you click the "World of Warcraft" shortcut instead of "World of Warcraft Classic" or just Battle.Net.
---
Was confused the first time it happened to me because, like the OP of this chain, it was not only showing retail, but an account I hadn't used in years.
---
That's just the way it goes sometimes unfortunately you could be lucky and skill up off every craft but sometimes need to make 5+ crafts to go up a single level when they are yellow. Only orange coloured recipes are a 100% skill up point.
---
Nope it’s not just you. My server (Skullflame-EU) is high pop and I play on the dominant side and still have the same issues you do, so I think it’s general WoW classic thing as opposed to a server one.
---
It’s gotten to the point that I just advertise myself as dps to help me get groups faster, and for whatever reason whenever I’m looking for a particular dungeon I’m always competing with another healer or two in the LFG chat, as all of us are desperately spamming the channel to get into the same dungeon.
---
As to why it’s happening - well probably because there’s an abundance of classes who can heal, and up to level 60 pretty much any Shammy/Pally/Druid/Priest can slap on some int gear and heal any dungeon just fine, meaning that the single spot allocated to a healer in a group is usually filled up quickly with ease. Tanks on the other hand are limited to two classes per faction and it’s a role players often tend to avoid because of how threat mechanics work in classic, so they’ll always be in demand. And while DPS is the most common role they also have 3 slots for them in a group, so it’s a numbers game.
---
It’s made me regret rolling a priest tbh. Had I known that being a healer wouldn’t get me into groups any quicker than a DPS then I would have just rolled a pure dps class in hindsight and not had to worry about spec, or just rolled a pure hybrid like a Druid so I could fulfil any role. I don’t really enjoy awkwardly dpsing as a priest because I couldn’t find a group as a healer.
---
No one else needed on it and thats why I thought it was ok to need on it. The icing on the cake that I forgot to mention was that the previous boss dropped a blue robe. Raid leader (warrior tank) needed on it and got it. No one said anything (personally I was too tired to complain about either that or the absence of Jed).
---
Still feels very balanced, was around 45/55 last census
---
See I have to explain everything to you. Because you're stupid. I'm glad you're following along.
---
The only other class capable of aoe-farming (still not as good as mage) are prot paladins, but they also need to drink after every aoe pull just like mages, and they are also extremely gear dependant compared to mages who can do it naked. Theoretically prot paladins can reach a point in gear where their aoe-farming even becomes better than mages, but that gear would require things like the epic 300 engi shield (alternatively skullflame shield), essence of the pure flame, and full t2 or t2.5.
---
For warlocks to be able to continously pull without downtimes, they should put a few points into demonology to improve their voidwalker abilities and basically only cast corruption + curse of agony on a mob and then just wand, mana should be back up by the time a mob dies and they shouldnt be using Lifetap ever. 
---
Lifetap and the 21 point affliction talent Siphon Life are actually very common "noob traps" and are really inefficient while levelling. Using Lifetap to get mana back only to then have to use all of that mana for Drain Life to get that health back again is one of the slowest and most inefficient ways to farm. This does get really good however once you're 60 and start stacking a lot of spellpower.
---
got 4 greater eternal essences from 1 DE, cant relate.
---
Roughly how long does an arena run take?
---
How do you raid twice a week. You doing half an MC at a time lol
---
How many accounts have gotten banned so far? Why keep trying to cheat? Why not just play the game?
---
Yeah by the time I got to BRD most people weren't very experienced but it's rare to have a 5 man party without at least one person knowing what to do.
---
And if other people also don't know what to do how can they get mad at you for also not knowing? Tanking isn't as hard bad as people make it out to be.
---
Pleb, real bank alts are lvl 5 so they can de
---
Not even slightly. Look at his history. Got one account banned already for buying gold.
---
Well then that makes a lot of difference! Then you're definitely not the asshole, they are, hypocritical assholes. IMO...
---
Nice timing.
---
I don't upload logs, haven't since I was playing far more hardcore a very long time ago.
---
And yeah, I'm all up for someone correcting what I say if it's wrong. Or just providing general tips.. I didn't get good by refusing to listen to others. But I rarely die, top metres most of the time, and otherwise have no problems with my class.. don't really feel like I need to seek out improvement to the point of providing logs for others to go over.
---
Hsbce
---
\*cries on a 13" thin laptop with Intel HD Graphics\*
---
me everyday.
---
so for effective farming and capable solo play its  mage or wlock ?.  and either drinking or lifetap\\draining ?
---
&gt; I'd love to tank if I didn't have to play a warrior or a druid to do it. Give me that fat rework and make shaman tanking viable!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That is actually the issue for a lot of people. There are two tanking options and if you don't like that, tough nuts.
---
Shaman Tanking is viable, here's a whole guide about talents, rotations, etc... https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150c
---
Streamers bad, am I right?!
---
My most recent bad experience was the most experienced person in the team get mad at me for not separating a couple of packs and accusing me of being a yolo warrior (LBRS where you get multiple 3-packs with spellbinder alongside the 3-pack with raider/worgs).  I put my 2 cents in that I don't think its possible just from visual range but I had to eat his admonishments and resign myself to him knowing the dungeon and he's right, because if he was right, I caused the wipe and had to take it on the chin.
---
That was until I found out for myself in later runs that yes it was indeed impossible to separate the packs he was complaining about.  That's the sort of thing that really winds me up and makes the first runs where I'm clueless really really stressful.
---
Raids will get harder and being holy spec will be required by most guilds for their priests in order to do the content.  MC and to an extent BWL are the freebies.  So if you are planning on raiding through Naxx you either will be the token shadow priest, a holy priest or a shadow priest pretending their best to be a holy priest (to the detriment of the guild).
---
Can yall keep it to your server subreddit or discord? I don't see how in concerns the rest of us.
---
The best thing you can do is grind another couple of levels.
---
54 is low for a warrior in any part of BRD
---
Do quests that are green or grey (but mobs are not grey). They're a doddle to complete and give the same xp whether theyre grey/green/yellow/orange. You always get the same xp for the hand in.
---
Pick an area that you haven't yet visited and  spend a couple of hours completing every chain. You'll also make some decent gold
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/wow-classic-zone-levels/
---
So 25 days of game time doing arena runs?
---
Gehennas is like 70-80% horde, cant go to brd/ubrs/dire maul without corpserunning 5-8 times, and thats before phase 2.
---
Also 10 horde for every alliance if you level an alt. The server will probably die eventually and become a horde server.
---
4D chess
---
Totally not correct and has nothing to do with insufficient supply.
---
There are like what - 30 spawn location with respawn timer of couple hours? Meaning you can supply whole raid for whole night in in like 4 hours if you theoretically pick up every flower.
---
My personal experience on a server that just dropped layers - lotus went from 20 to 30, but there are like 2-3 sellers selling 10+ lotuses each - clearly an AH game. It is also evidenced by price of supporting flowers like dreamfoil that is in abundance and price is constant 50s since layer drop.
---
So no - its just people are hoarding hundreds of this shit OR playing the AH to use basic economics.
---
If the prices really go up, you for sure can level herb and farm them yourself for couple days to be enough for entire raiding month.
---
stop
---
Windfury pls
---
Yeah they aren't going to be shield blocking.  You don't have the rage to make it efficient.  Revenge will be used whenever it is up and otherwise just sunder.  On lower level dungeons honestly I just DPS tanked with a 2hander and mostly sunder spam.
---
Someone else said 5g, which one is it?
---
Paladins &gt; shamans. Discuss.
---
It doesn't really matter in 5 or 10 mans, though. As a warrior, I'd gladly take a ret paladin to my group. It either improves my threat or my dps by a lot and wipes aren't as common as most of them heal when needed. 
---
Also they usually won't take pre raid bis gear from the other dps because they know they'll heal in raids anyway. At least this has been my experience so far.
---
its faster :D
---
Yes you can :)
---
&gt; Viable doesn’t mean wanted or invited to groups though does it.
---
At this point in the game, Shaman Tanks are indistinguishable from a prot paladin.
---
I hope u get ur next week in Mc next week and replace it
---
Small flame sacs have shot up in price like crazy, was 20s now its 1g, everyone is too lazy to go farm them lol
---
That'll break damage meters, logs and much more.
---
The only thing i google is your mom..
---
I’ll disenchant something that’s worth 14-22 silver only to get 2 dust which sells for roughly 1 silver each on the AH. I wish there was a way to see what you’re going to get before you do it?
---
talents dont matter
---
gear does, just stack +healing for raids and have a secondary set of gear for pvp
---
use the beaststalker set since it provides the most all out stats. Prioritize gear with +crit % and increased spell power
---
OP, not gonna lie. You seem quite a dick.
---
As long as he wasn't a dick about it then it's no issue - even experienced players get it wrong sometimes and one wipe on a 60 instance isn't a big deal.
---
Being right doesn't give you the right to be a dickhead though and if someone's being an asshole to you just because you made a mistake then there's no need to put up with it and once the possibility of the tank leaving is on the table people tend to start being a lot nicer.
---
Unless it's a TF you can't replace it as a tank anyway even then I'm fury prot.
---
rip my boy Warrel Dane
---
That's cute we would of surely been a match with our own 80strong duo run mc group. That usually raids at the same time as every other alliance guild. Looks like youd be corpse running.
---
I've tested Bashguuder personally, I was quite sad when it vanished after I told someone to cast Faerie fire. And ye, it's pretty wide spread knowledge.
---
haha I love this
---
Best raids, best itemization, good compromise between uniquness of classes and balance, arena.
---
Would be perfect if it was kept in azeroth without flying mount.
---
&gt; Ha! It’s funny that you picked one of the worst dungeons to shammy tank, nature resist is super annoying when your main threat is Earthshock
---
Dungeons are so easy for a shaman tank, they can cast frost shock and rely on auto-attacks and simple items to keep aggro/threat. This talks about it in [detail](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150).
---
You could just turn it to enemy players only, so you only notice movement in the log when an enemy player is nearby (don't need to focus on it, like any sane person). Or use the addon.
---
Or how hard the item is to get. I sold a Stylish Black Shirt for 20g, bought for 60s.
---
For pvp you would probably get more unitily using resto talents instead of enhance talents in the shaman. While it may take longer to gear the shaman, it is pretty dang good as ele in pvp. The warlock gear is easier to obtain since most the pre raid bis can be bought off the ah and t1 is pretty sick in pvp.
---
Bit of an obscure question:
---
I just finished getting a paladin to level 21 in 18 hours /played with no breaks (i.e. whenever I wanted to take a break of any length I'd log off.) How good a time is this? I know it doesn't compare to hunters or mages but I was curious.
---
Full sessions yeah than I basically go swap to an alt or flower pick w/e works my luck on that specific item was not very kind to me while multiple guildies got there's in around 100 to 200.
---
Yeah it totally depends on what I'm trying to accomplish, but I'll alternate between hyper-efficient 0 downtime chain pulls, or just blast things to death as quickly as possible, and when my character drinks/eats, I go and do the same.
---
I just disenchanted a level 54 5,5g 2h axe because I was greedy and got 1 illusion dust :)
---
&gt; I wish there was a way to see what you’re going to get before you do it?
---
The whole point is that it's random.
---
lasher is worthless somehow, I never made over 5-10g/h
---
it was definitly more rewarding back in the day (I didn't play pserver)
---
I dont think its that much overall, you can have huge variations within certain areas tho. Even a 60:40 split means that you will have main faction dominated diremaul doors.
---
Respec, grenades, and faps. It's obviously exaggerating, but even then it's not a guarantee. If a mage can poly you, the fap is useless, and you've now burned 1g for nothing or burn 2g to kill one player.
---
Assuming healers in raids shouldnt go oom before a boss is dead if they downrank properly and have decent gear when raids are on farm, mana tide totem would be best used for dps classes that are otherwise lacking resource management, which includes spriests or ele shamans (mages have evocation, warlocks can lifetap backed up by more mana on the healers). What also comes to my mind here would be hunters, the \~1.2k mana from the totem adds atleast another \~15-20 seconds to a hunters dps rotation, however hunters are better split up across melee groups for Trueshot Aura.
---
BRD quest run or Arena/anger/golem
---
Lol what is this, your third account? 
---
Why waste so much time getting banned over and over again and not just play the game?
---
&gt; Any dungeon is the worst to shaman tank.
---
The game isn't as difficult as you might think. The game is 15 years old after all. Atm I am tanking level 60 dungeons with relative ease and I see myself off-tanking an MC boss tomorrow. Happy to answer any more questions
---
Me too but with scratchits.  Just sell me the winners plz
---
Not far away from ww3
---
Gotta play the greater essence lottery tho
---
That itself is an indication there are to many healers - the fact we have to go out of our way to plead with our tank friends or strangers to start a group because the abundance of groups advertising for a dungeon you need don’t need a healer. The fact is I don’t see tanks or even dps having to resort to that.
---
wouldnt be able to get most of the bottom points if I do as you suggest. No Divine favor which i feel is a pretty important part of the healing bucket
---
That is actually a sick shot.
---
Priest with the assistance of druid, the role of a priest shifts heavily from alliance to horde. For alliance, priest healers are doing more raid-healing due to the lack of chain heal coupled with strong tank healing from paladins. For horde, priest you got strong raid healing through shamans and therefore priests are more leaned towards tank healing.
---
Have fun getting to 60 in 45 days played
---
The Human racial is weapon skill, not "you start with 3% hit". But it does mean you need 6% hit instead of 9% with swods/maces.
---
And you're in the 305 zone, not 315. You need 6% total hit to never miss, which is 3% from talents and 3% from gear. if you ever get an axe, you'd need 3% from talents and 6% from gear.
---
Blizzard also made warriors the best dps class in the game so that's why :shrug:
---
That's why my warrior alt is a Night Elf... 50% faster corpse running is just sooo useful for warriors
---
1.12% ?
---
Translate: "I think I should not be banned for breaking rules the game developer set. Also does anyone know of a loophole?"
---
Yeah, i am aware. Never actually seen it though, he has never lived long enough
---
Oh so you're a friend of submissions, too?
---
Yeah, and in Vanilla (especially the early vanilla that's analogous to phase 1) every nook and cranny of the game hadn't been documented, researched, and optimized for.
---
Gold costs time. In vanilla I always had a choice to just farm the mats myself if it would take less time than farming the gold. Now though the low supply means that both ways to get Black Lotus take too much of my limited wow time, which effectively locks me out of raiding.
---
I have no ill will for the players who have been on top of their black lotus spawn timers, but blizzard needs to make flasks achievable for the average raider or they're going to see a lot of lost subs when later phases hit.
---
yeah neither have i on classic only in vanilla
---
Oh yeah, I remember playing cata, our guild was a little slow with starting to raid firelands, just as we were about to start new patch dropped and basically made all that content irrelevant as you could easily get gear of equal power from the new, extremely easy dungeons.
---
Because youre buying gold...
---
This might be true for Sulfuras, which fails due to the nature of only being useful on a memespecc that has a much better weapon in Nightfall.
---
Thunderfury however is extremely powerful and most likely the most overpowered weapon made in a endgame. So powerful that it was used on the Illidan firstkill in BC
---
He is trying to buy gold / boosts / etc with real money.
---
Juding by the rest of his post history it probably isn't even his own money.
---
2 according to himself
---
Ooo nice scam thanks for teaching me
---
No reason to die on some ez mode trib runs.  Fd before he's in charge range or los then fd or you know just kite him after the charge knocks you off.  Shit ain't hard
---
AQ is soo medieval
---
OP deleted his post so idk what he said. Hunters still do suck in classic.
---
So how do you raid twice a week
---
She’s such a drame queen.
---
He's getting charged as he fds during trib runs
---
Hell we are a dkp guild and still have decided who gets bindings.
---
The true mark of a scammer; The inability to get everything correct grammatically.
---
I ended up going 5/5/18 
---
Improved evisc and crit/dodge/dodge multipliers and stealth spec for getting quest done while sustaining damage. 
---
 
---
Finishing out 16/10/25 all with a focus on agility. Made for a good subtlety spec. 
---
It’s possible just stick to your focus.
---
Thanks! =]
---
Even the developers probably use this method when they disconnect.
---
What makes it so bad that it can ban you tho?
---
**LF Addon**
---
I'm looking for an addon that records mob kills and drop rates. For example, yesterday Balnazzar finally dropped my Star of Mystaria. When I mouseover this item I would like to see: "Balnazzar 1/13 (7.7 %)", or something similar.
---
I'm currently using mobinfo2 but that one seems to be a little off. It doesn't seem to correctly record the kills and drops.
---
Is there such an addon?
---
Death to the bubble boys
---
reroll or quit
---
stop crying
---
Alright, time to trigger the mages and warlocks.
---
If you are pugging then all you can do is roll. How ever if you are in a guild and your guild ISN’T LCing mageblade to holy paladins first. Then leave, because your RL is an idiot. Mageblade is always more useful to a paladin than a mage. Same with the robes of volatile power.
---
False reports are against ToS I'm pretty sure, even telling someone you're going to do it is I believe.
---
And personal loot resulted in Loot Council becoming the norm in retail because it just means you get loot, not that it is good for you. And you can still trade it with others from the raid. So now the Loot Council decides on who you give your item to.
---
Just respec for 2h fury or 2h arms. What kind of question is this?
---
Absolutely not.
---
I have personally witnessed a fastest lotus spawn of 57minutes and a slowest of 73(consecutive spawns, was on it as it spawned again)
---
I have heard thru the grapevine of a 55 spawn, and even lower (like 50).
---
Definitely not 12.
---
I agree. I love the idea of classic + but I have zero trust in blizzard to make that effort. They're going to go with the easy option and grab cash before the playerbase dies.
---
This guy lucks
---
Hell, honestly prefer to drop Mana Tide for a group of warlocks over any group with a boomkin or elemental shaman.
---
It took more time than I'd like to admit perfecting.
---
Technically this isn't the finished version it's like 98% of it.
---
It's elv UI and a litany of other add-ons including masque and a hd icon pack switch.
---
I do this and only this, but when shit hits the fan I suddenly realize I don't even know my password let alone my username anymore
---
I literally always do this.

Or the UltraNEETs Sora and Shiro.
---
"Young Dragon, you hand over those T2 helmets *this moment*!"

I currently have blacksmithing and mining (300 both) on my warrior. Thinking about dropping mining for alchemy since I had no luck finding rich thorium veins so far and DM:E jump runs are too slow to generate good gold/hour (thorium bars are 50s and arcanite crystals are 30g) Is alch a good money maker and is it worth buying recipes now to make gold later?
---
The answer is yes
---
Its more like, if blizz come knocking due to reports ill show them this piece of text which invalidates the reports.
---
Would have appreciated a source where to read this..
---
Yeah, but he can start the chain and work towards the UBRS part as a lvl 56 - don't you have to make 2-3 trips to BRD first?
---
Well popping reck/lay on hands is definitely laughed at.

Druid question:

Would Stormshroud's 2+3 set bonus work in cat form?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=142/stormshroud-armor
---
Holy shit! Is that tentacle guy new race related to N'zoth?
---
This. Currently a NEET. I was in the Navy and I am very trustworthy and can speak well. I trained people for machinery and in my school I was class speaker.
---
When you are in a group it’s pretty common to expect that people are going to be rolling on look that’s for the roll they are performing unless other wise stated at the start of the run. IMO this Druid shouldn’t be rolling in healing gear until they are healing. How ever if I’m running for a specific item I’ll make sure no one else in the group can use it.
---
Currently asked a guildie! He said he could help me out with it. I’ll probably buy the rest of mooncloth once I get all orbs. I’ve been spending all my money on hide of the Wild mats, consumables for raids. I really stink at being a salesman in WoW. So I’m always broke haha
---
Because you keep buying gold
---
That's when you magic dust em and reset the fight.

---
Flying mounts sucked. Apart from that pretty great
---
Brd has mostly been horde for me. Seen alliance out there maybe twice.
---
My guess is you'll see the opposing faction more because if they're there you're gonna take longer to get in, thus it feels like they're there more often.
---
When they post a pic, I don’t want it to offend my eyes. Most people, I couldn’t care less. But if you are sharing screenshots, don’t have a fucking garbage ui.
---
It’s like people that take selfies or pics at home, and there’s clothes strewn around the room. Clean that shit up!
---
Unless you already put dots up :)
---
That, sir, is why I’m leveling with a priest
---
2 maning it with my GF healing me, takes about 6 minutes per clear so after 5 clears you have a 30 minute break during which we usually log out.
---
This alone is why they should bring back screenshot of the day. It would be cool if the sub mods could organize it and maybe do a screenshot of the week and put it on the sidebar
---
Ret is fine in dungeons where mobs can be stunned, doubling JoC damage. Even better in UD/demon heavy dungeons. Ret also does decent AoE damage with cons on top of their single target. Yes ret is not good in raid. Ret is good in PvP. But again, all you people crying about bringing a hybrid to raid must not be in very good raids if you struggle in MC/Ony with a couple hybrid dps. This content is faceroll. It must suck to suck.
---
What I would suggest you can also delay going into the prot treew by picking up 3/3 Healing Light so you can heal aswell.
---

Gehennas is the most active with more horde numbers. Expect queue
---
I dont feel so good Mr Smiles...
---
The information collected via census before will probably still be reliable. There may be some important changes in servers like Firemaw and Stonespine due to the transfers to the Spanish servers, but overall, most EU PVP servers have Horde as the overwhelming dominator at level 60. Mograine and Ashbringer were the only balanced ones.
---
&gt;Even a 60:40 split means that you will have main faction dominated diremaul doors.
---
60:40 is already a massive imbalance and unfortunately most PVP servers tend to hover at around that ratio.
---
I'm going improved backstab and then sub with imp ambush and hemorrhage at 40. I found a cheap gut ripper. Going with hemo for weapon swap if I can't ambush or backstab
---
I can understand cross server dungeons but cross faction sounds ridiculous
---
Ha I waited for the "player is ignoring you" message :D
---
No need, a resto shaman with Gizlock's buckler can tank 55-60 dungeons, provided the DPS play smart
---
44 Priest currently running a Shadow/Disc hybrid but switching to full Shadow soon. Getting kind of sick of using this [staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7713/illusionary-rod), or staffs in general. Looking to use a 1H + OH combo.   
---
Currently for 1Hs, I have Hypnotic Blade and Hand of Righteousness. In terms of OH, I have the Orb of the Forgotten Seer and a Durable Rod of the Owl.  
---
Thoughts as to what I should be using, or ideas for things I can pursue at this point?
---
Then again I really want heroic 5mans, hybrids having an actual choice how to spec for raids and the tons of small improvements like limiting the number of consumables you could use at the same time. I also loved the early achievements, when it wasn't just about spending hundreds of hours in another boring quest area.
---
So if I had to chose between classic and TBC it would be TBC for me every single time. Many decisions that steered the game into the wrong direction didn't start until WotLK like a groupfinder for super easy heroic dungeons, philosophy of making everything avaiable to everyone etc.
---
I realize a lot of people also hate flying mounts, but personally I don't share the hate. I play on a PvP server so I can fight for stuff I want, like that mining node. You can't mine those while on a flying mount, so how exactly do they hinder me? In my experience flying mounts mostly make it harder to grief.
---
But even if you hate flying and hate linear dungeons, you could easily fix this stuff in a theoretical TBC+, which in my mind would be superior to classic+ in almost every way. I don't believe we will see either, but TBC is simply the better foundation for further updates. Keep in mind flying is limited to Outland.
---
I've noticed that with frostbolt too
---
Like i said, those items might go up much in %, not in total value.
---
Yea I found a fair few when I first was leveling/hit 60. But now on incendius they’re just non existent.
---
That is indeed the cycle. I for one never gank someone who hasn't ganked me first. Of course if they don't remember that, they'll think their counter gank justified as well.
---
Does anyone know their password?
---
I don't know about pvp. You'll probably still get some misses regardless of what you do - this is specific to raid bosses only.
---
Was gonna comment some good info here until I read "pet peeves" and "out and about". I hate those terms so much.
---
Nobody cares dude.  Literally all you use reddit for is to advertise your steam.
---
Wait, how does my point of view translate into playing the game correctly or incorrectly? Haven’t seen the error message when changing spec telling my I can’t do that. 
---
Emphasis on my point of view.
---
Yes you need a lot of spell power. T2 and T2.5 are very good for ret, until then you don't really have any options with both str and spell damage.
---
And you also want to use both melee and caster consumables to be competitive, which means twice the gold per raid if you want to tryhard.
---
Ooh so i should kill them before that then? :-)
---
This is why you dont give one person all the power. We have one guy who does DKP and Guildbank. (he has also been part of the overarching guild for the past 6-15 years or so.)
---
One guy does recruitment, two guys do raidlead, 5 people are tanks, etc.
---
Imo the strath pyjamas are better if you are full holy due to the spirit and it's conversion to SP/BH. I have the pattern since our first run but the mats are just not worth it .
---
/salute
---
Yes, it's a holy paladin weapon just as much as it is mage/warlock.
---
Play on judgement, we need more players !!!
---
Well you sure aren't killing a paladin.
---
Unless you have a friend waiting at their hearth location.
---
&gt;Tanks on the other hand are limited to two classes per faction
---
Shamans can tank these 5 mans without breaking a sweat
---
Try tukui on the v17 profile which is found in the general tab. It’s basically the same but already set up and so there’s less tweaking. Still a ton of options to make it how you want it though.
---
I totally misread the post. I thought he said Vanilla to Classic :P.
---
When leveling, you won't have the luxury to be able to choose between a big selection of gear pieces, so what you bring up is probably not going to be a big concern.
---
In any case, as a tank, you benefit very little from strength as the ratio in which it affects block amount is very small and white damage is a very small part of your threat. Having more mana is definitely useful. Just for the record, intellect doesn't increase spell damage.
---
Because they like to let all their better pcs collect dust, of course.
---
You use sharpening stones on poison immun bosses like garr, geddon and ragnaros. 
---
What kind of sharpening stone depends a bit on your gear but they are fairly similiar in dps gain so you might just save a few gold and use dense sharpening stones instead of elemental sharpening stones.
---
Oh I didn't check the name - yea, I recall this guy. Wonder why he's not using a new reddit account.
---
You dont roll in LC's
---
This!
---
This is so fucking frustrating. I’ve had this happen multiple times in a single day in silithus and it is infuriating. Actually made me log off last night.
---
There's literally been 5-6 of this same guide posted in the last two days
---
Buy Umbral Crystal, it should only cost a few gold and lasts a long while.
---
What if I told you.... it’s not a waste of my hearthstone at all and that I will probably just go somewhere else and do something else.
---
Cataclysmic.
---
I don't know how viable alch is as a money maker compared to mining but considering you already have 300 mining and would need to buy mats to level alch it would have to be a hell of a lot better, in the long run, to be worth it.
---
What add on shows the vendor price
---
Such as? I know it's not pvp viable , but other than that it should do fine in most aspects of play I thought
---
I agree that int and sp should be considered as desired stats for ret. Unfortunately not much of it on plate gear this phase. The best ret pally gear in the game is either the field marshal set or AQ40 2.5 which has int and sp as major stats. The FM set also has mp5 on it for that sustained damage.  Im looking at picking up a crown of destruction from MC, bloodmail boots, and the trueaim bracers also out of mc which all have int on them. Im also using the ogre forged hauberk. Unfortunately that means i have a lot of mail gear on which sucks for PvP.
---
I recommend making a macro that explains how threat works. As a warrior, there is absolutely no way you can have healthy threat on 4 mobs within 2 seconds. Also explain you have no aoe or ranged taunt, and that people will die if people start to dps too soon. Ask your party this: want this dungeon to go quickly? Then don't attack right away. It will be way quicker that way.  
---
  
---
I had a guy (feeling brave with 3 of his guildies in the party) scold me for not mainting threat on the non-elites on the 3rd pack in ST. I told them it was obvious there was no way I could tank them if the mage decided he wanted to dps right after I charged, so I just didn't try. He got angry, so I quickly excused myself from the group and saved myself from a whole lot of butthurt. He whispered something along the lines of "good luck being blacklisted by the best guilds of your server" and I almost choked on my dr. Pepper. How could this superior human being and obviously better WOW player not know how threat works!? But I quicly realized he was not superior at all and was indeed just a little shit simply boldend by his guildies and some form of superiority complex. Moral of the story is: Try to teach, but if that doesn't work, just bounce and try again.
---
spend that mount gold on the warrior!
---
AH takes a bit cut. Fuck that. Direct trade sometimes is a bitch. Not everyone is in the same city and wants to go. Very often I am asked to COD because they were leaving SW and they couldn't wait for me to get there. Almost everytime they pay.
---
Because constantly grinding just for a necklace to be upped again isn't a tedious grind with no end reward

---
I would at this point either already kick him out or not award any DKP. I have threatened to kick people from the raid for less.
---
im interested, how is seal fate more enjoyable than lets say combat dagger?
---
I have points in prot for Blessing of Kings an almost mandatory buff for some classes. I could drop the 2 points from.shield specialization but I dont knownwhat they would go towards
---
lol it's necklace not "neckless"
---
That means someone with no neck haha
---
raid bosses should be dying well before people run out of mana
---
What I'm saying is that in a given fight, regardless of how much mana you have, you'll never burn through 2k mana between life taps and drain life regen.
---
So yes, from zero to full you'll be pacting a while but that's not what the spell is for. Its purpose is to enable non stop killing by pacting 4-5 times between each pull and using the life you generate from drain life and siphon to lifetap the rest of the missing mana.
---
Copy from another reddit thread
---
”For each point that your weapon skill exceeds your opponent's defense, you gain the following: Your chance to miss decreases by 0.04%. Your chance to score a critical hit increases by 0.04%. Your opponent's chance to block your attack decreases by 0.04%. Your opponent's chance to parry your attack decreases by 0.04%. Your opponent's chance to dodge your attack decreases by 0.04%.
---
So if you fight a mob/player of your level you get like +0.8% hit and +0.2% crit. There are formulas on the net to calculate the bonuses for mobs higher then you and lover. In any case, +5 is very good.”

Ony is so fucking easy that there is no reason to pot at all. If you 10 man it I can understand but else?
---
&gt;Mageblade is always more useful to a paladin than a mage. Same with the robes of volatile power.
---
I don't exactly agree with this. Healing in current content is not exactly an issue, so having your spellcasters dealing more damage has a bigger effect as it means that every fight is shorter, which leads to overall faster kills (which in exchange, makes healing easier as mana becomes less and less of a concern) and runs.
---
Said this, I'm a holy paladin carrying a Mageblade...

He could be a tzar, you never know

Hello, i have a serious problem during raids(in molten). On the bosses with adds my game freezes for 4-5 secs, i disabled my addons to test if that was the problem and still got freezes, my PC definetely has enough juicy to handle classic so thats not the issue, any help would be appreciated, thanks.
---
You can pre pot it.
---
I wasnt aware Righteousness was better for one handers that frees up a point. 
---
I'm aware that ret normally uses 2 handers but the issue is that if I want to competitively heal I will.need either an off hand shield for the extra caster stats or an offhand item that does the same. Also the chance to block when some farming helps survivability
---
I've played a bunch of warlocks over the years; went full-meme, pink hair, female gnome this time and called her Meringue. My ONLY regret is I don't get that male gnome "ur-ur!" death-cry.
---
Truefaith is better and its not even close, no idea why you d think otherwise.
---
Disgusting traitorous filth!
---
Because
---
A. 90% of all guilds that I would deem worthy of my raid attendance already have their tanks
---
B. I tanked from vanilla unti they butchered tanks near the end of cata.  Been there done that. 
---
C. Fury is fun as hell

D. I can still tank just fine for guildies and friends that I know are not going to be mentally challenged. 
---
E. Herding cats in a pug is not the fun and engaging gameplay that I choose to spend my time on.  
---
Have a nice day!
---
And none is healing the warlock
---
Can't even remember my password
---
TBC surpassing or being better than Classic isn't some new belief, plus many of those that played Vanilla share this belief. Better rotations and raids went a long way in improving the experience for a lot of people.
---
50 DKP Minus?
---
You do realize getting 20 people in the raid group while 2 more pugs constantly looking for members to join theirs is very demanding.
---
You write in General, world, /yell. managing whispers from people asking hom many of X class already in. Keeping people in raid when you have only 7 people in it when other pug has 15+ members.
---
You /who x class 60. check if they are in a small guild or guildless so you write them and ask if they interested.
---
When you finally got the people, you invite them to your pug discord. explain the tactics, summon those 3 guys again because they forgot ony neck to bank.
---
All this effort for a change some one does stupid shit and you wipe once and then you keep things positive and try to get every one stay in your raid.
---
We had 23m pug last night. We got her down first try, even tho one of our rogues spin her 360° when getting agro and half of the raid wiped.
---
I reserved the neck for myself. I am a rogue and i fucking deserved it.
---
not well
---
did 20+- BRD runs on my priest and finally had

---
drop and a mage won it :/
---
its ok tho he tried to trade it to me afterwards :/
---
:/
---
Those are all 50+ though, I'm 40 at the moment.
---
Thanks! Didn't know about intellect, for some reason I thought it does increase spell damage, thanks for correction!
---
Same with paladins!:)
---
There have been many threads detailing at length the reasons why there is still a tank shortage, but I'll summarize the most common reasons here:
---
1) You need 2-3 tanks for a 40-man raid. You need 1 tank for a 5-man. Mathematically, this means that there won't be enough tanks for 5-mans. Dps warriors can help fill this gap, but for reasons below, they don't.
---
2) Tanks are not respected. In most pugs, you'll have at least 1 dps, if not more, who seems to enjoy making life difficult for the tank and making the run stressful and not fun. And if the tank is not on point (say, hes normally a dps) then he gets actively mocked and ridiculed.
---
3) Tanking is not easy. It is stressful and takes effort, while dpsing is, quite simply, brainless fun. The majority of dps classes could do an adequate (not good) job of dpsing by simply pressing two keys. Even if dps are behaving, tanking properly takes significantly more effort and focus.
---
4) Tanking is expensive. Plate costs more to repair, a tank gets struck more, so his armor takes more damage, and, if a tank is doing his job, he is the first to die in a bad pull. I recently had a Scholomance run that was an absolute disaster. We wiped 5 times before we were done. But I personally died 9 times. Each death costs me 75s, and if any tanks area reading this, they'll probably recognize, correctly, that I must not be very geared, because that's cheap compared to the more geared tanks.
---
5) Good tanks are added to friends lists and adopted into guilds, and then they spend most of their time running with these friends and guildmates. And why would they do otherwise? Even if said friends and guildmates aren't the best players, they will listen to what their tank tells them to do, because if they don't, they lose access to that tank.
---
My advice is that you make a threat that is looking to address these points, rather than simply asking a question that most already know the answer to.
---
No I mean elemental. Why would you you give up flat stats (spell power, crit) for a melee proc? It not a dps boost in anyway, and as a resto shaman, your off spec is likely going to be a 2h axe or elemental with a staff. Just too big of a good sink and doesn’t fit any spec outside of a tanking shaman, which are equally rare.
---
You are fooling zero people mr 900g at lv35 with bis gear
---
Yes. When in doubt, open the comment section and check what most comments are saying (ofc use good judgment since some things change over patches).
---
It sucks to be sure but losing a roll isn’t ninja looting.
---
If it’s they low, I feel you’re doing something wrong.
---
That said, you basically need herbalism to make it consistently worthwhile. You should be averaging about 20g/hr without it, with a potential for more. Mara farm is more consistent, it just has much less potential to suddenly get you an item worth a couple hundred gold.
---
There was a few i saw and tested but most of them req. to do stuff that below avarage player is kinda risky and you will lose gold if you try and die. Thats why i tried to make it as much risk free as possible \^\^
---
Because once you get to 300 it is expensive. Some combination of 40 days of CDs, golden pearls (not easily farmable and currently like 20g per), righteous orbs (got to agree with guild you get some and farm 1-3 runs or buy them 50g per on Kirtonos). Unless you came into the game knowing you needed them at this point it is a huge sink.
---
Honestly, if Vanilla was that way to begin with, and later expansions made spells available despite spec I'm pretty sure people would be all: "WTF? You're not supposed to be able to cast frostbolt when FIRE SPEC'd, they're just catering to casuals now! all uniqueness with spec is gone!"
---
many changes have been  for the worse, but there are also changes that people dislike only because #nochanges
---
Currently in the process of doing it
---
Haven't heard anything until this guy said something. Tons of people use tsm, you'd hear more.
---
It kind of bothers me that people call a wipe on Ragnaros when the raid fails to kill him before the first sons phase these days. So I do care, but I understand that overall it is a good change, because some specs were even less playable then they are now. I didn't expect to be challenged by Molten Core and the interesting stuff was balanced after all the changes we already got were in place.
---
For now it simply feels like playing with a catch-up mechanism already in place. You know, like those 20% nerfs to raid encounters they did at the end of some expansions to let more people experience the content.
---
By that logic, warriors should be waiting for Deathbringer, Vis'kag orBrutality Blade, or any 2H that drops.
---
There is no universe where a dagger should go to a warrior over a rogue.
---
GZ Almight Smiles. I remember running ZF melee cleaves with you having a blast. Nice to see you make progress. Golemagg Horde is the best!
---
Deathbone is silly good for Protection tanking. It comes with a good chunk of defense, fantastic set bonuses and mana per 5. I think it’s about as good as it gets for pre-raid gear.
---
I don’t think the mana gained generates threat but I haven’t tested it.
---
This gets much better after lvl 20.   IMHO DW is far superior to a 2h until SS and WW
---
No of you see seeing doing it just turn around and leave them alone unless you want to ruin their day.
---
Is the world chat good to use in Mograine?
---
I haven't joined it just using lfg so
---
Yea, but you won’t attack ! You are a healer, sitting back, or else you lose cast time. An offhand (bis is not a shield) will not block ! 
---
And as damage, you won’t use a 1h sword. 
---
I would go holy/port for reckoning build in pvp. But if you solo pve and dungeon, it could be easier as retribution. 
---
From what I see, you don’t really get any real benefit from port/ret tree.
---
Is blacksmithing doing you any good? Unless you have rare plans like lionheart's, it's generally not a money maker at all. Maybe if you really want that anti-fear trinket.
---
Alch is good for money simply because there's tons of useful potions you can craft so there's always something you can spam for profit (compared to other professions that only make 2-3 useful things so the competition is way higher).
---
&gt; Yet another reason they should have just reset everything at some point.
---
They did. here we are :D
---
Main hand for a fresh 60 tank UD:
---
[Mirah's song](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15806/mirahs-song#english-comments) or [Hammer of the Vesper](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18683/hammer-of-the-vesper#english-comments)
---
I'm am orc fury warrior and have been running dungeons to get hit gear. Currently at 8% having an aim for 9% as suggested in here.
---
Recently purchased axe of the deep wounds and serathil (both 1h axes).
---
My questions is, with the +5 weapon skill on orcs to axes, what +hit % do I need?
---
Go for natural shapeshifter talent if you can. It really helps. Also try saving your bear or cat to the end to finish them when you need against rogues and warriors unless you are full feral. Try only using travel form during fight to keep distance and break slows as its mana is a lot cheaper than bear and cat. 
---
If you are fighting ranged dps then you need to play differently and instead close the gap and engage with bear or cat. Druids cannot out-dps ranged like hunter/mage/warlock etc. There's no chance there
---
You should be fine with a min of 6k mana
---
Adding the time it takes to run out, reset, run back in, and prepare for his next GY pull, all adds up. Let's say 4 minutes in total. (in the video it takes him 4 minutes and 27 seconds before he STARTS the first pull.)
---
That makes his entire 20 min run, into 24 min. That's a 20% decrease in exp\h.
---
And most likely, like you say, you will die every now and again. Adding another 4-5 minutes in corpse running, buffing, run back to GY, full hp\mana etc.
---
So 120k exp\h is way off if you don't include any of these thing, every minute not accounted for will make that number vary by a lot.
---
Exp\h isn't accurate unless you've been doing it for an hour or so.
---
Mages have multiple epic options for a weapon because they can use staves. Paladins have one choice being the mageblade. Mageblade is always pally prio.
---
Paladins and druids can tank raids NOW. Molten Core has zero bosses that hit the tank worth a damn, unless you count Magmadar when he has frenzy up, or maybe the core hound add on Golemagg if you tank him near Golemagg.
---
I may be proven wrong, and I'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't see Paladins fairing as well as time goes on. Druids have a lot more potential, and with what we know about the game, as long as healers can keep up with the increased mana they require to heal, they may be able to MT all the way to Naxx.
---
You do not get the same hand-in XP if the quest is gray, you get a reduced amount. This is also true for green quests if the quest lvl (first available at) is 8 levels lower than your level when turning in, IIRC. You can look it up.
---
Just because the Druid is tanking right now doesn't mean he never heals.
---
You lost a roll. It sucks. Realize that one piece of digital gear is not the end of the world and move on.
---
Sounds like facebook :P

I’ll definitely take that dps gear, yum yum.
---
No one wants to do the key quest and it's so hard to find someone to open the door for you. At least once you do get the quest you can solo the boss easy then it's just a matter of finding another key man to hand it in.
---
Okey
---
There are lots of spawn locations. Like 10-14 per zone but there are only 4 zones. Once you figure out how around when it is respawning you can own the zone
---
This is very true. We had a dude join our guild the other day and last night, trying to get him involved and see how he plays, we set up and UBRS run basically for him. He asked to have Truestrike and skinning knife on reserve. I already was like uhhhh idk I don’t like reserving loot never really felt right especially in classic we all need everything, but guildies figures we should give it a go. 
---
Once we finally find everyone who is ok with loot reservations dude tries to make entire group wait while he “makes poisons” in storm wind so we go in because one dude said he would leave if we didn’t start soon. We threw him one last summon and went in. Like 5 minutes later he says okay ready. 
---
So we go out to summon and run back in and he still isn’t there. Pugs were obviously annoyed, so was guild in disc, and we started the boss without him. He comes in after but truestrike didn’t drop anyway. Then he starts whispering one of the mages we got from LFG about how they have beef and the mage just asks him why he’s whispering him about shit in the raid chat. So everything stops and tons of drama and ends up the dude thought this mage was someone else. 
---
ANYWAY. There were some members of big guilds on our server with us and we kicked him from the guild and group real quick and apologized to everyone. People remember things that you do and it really does help be nice and have a good rep with others.
---
personally I like to ding from exploring.
---
Got you covered bro!
---
&gt; run back in,
---
Counting 5 seconds now ? in a 20 minute run. The timer hes doing, is from the START of the instance, including all the setup for the pull, moving there etc.
---
many people on server confirmed it to me
---
Correct. Just because all warriors CAN tank, doesn't mean that all warriors SHOULD tank. Most warriors just want to enjoy dpsing. Even I, a raid main tank who thoroughly enjoys tanking, enjoys sometimes just dpsing so I can relax and not worry about anything.
---
Ok, unless you really dislike having to farm shards for pvp (pve is easy and you get new ones all the time). Choose the lock. You get more loot, you do more things, you have the coolest mount, you have good gold farms, God in pvp. 
---
I was originally going to be a warlock. Went with mage because during the beta I hated to farm shards in the middle of wpvp. If I could go back, I'd go warlock instead. Turns out I don't do that much wpvp anyway.
---
It does increase crit chance. Around %1 per 53 for Paladins.
---
I mean I was unemployed for a few months and cancelled my WoW sub for the $30 of food that it got me. $15 isn't a lot in general terms, but it's not worth ragging on a stranger for.
---
Totally agree with your post, I just wanted to add that I'm pretty sure Rogues also compete fairly well with Warriors. They currenty beat mages, but I think once mages are able to go fire, they pull head.
---
I feel one of the most important things classic has that no other wow expansion has had is the economy.
---
Gold matters in classic. AN i wish this were the case on live but it rly isnt..  
---
Imo blizz should do a full economy reset with every expansion release.
---
Hope you get the help you need.
---
Ugh.. ok
---
Lava run is emp run. Including 2x bosses on the way. Not sure what groups you've been in.
---
Still on my list, but the guild has them covered so the urge to push is minimal....  I need money lol  =\]
---
I don’t. No changes! I’m so used to entering my info when playing on pservers. Especially with a fresh launch trying to get in with the masses of ppl causing login servers to crash.
---
Sounds like you need to see a psychiatrist not play a different game.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Restorative potion. Invis pots.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
20g golden pearls and 50g righteous? We have it the other way around :D
---
It's a big investment but it lasts all the way until T2 which you won't get until nefarian is on farm. It's totally worth it.
---
That’s just wrong. You sail smoothest by playing 2H all the way to 60; fury to level 40 and then respec to arms.
---
You do know that the only people capable of knowing such information are blizzard employees, do those people  happen to be blizzard employees?
---
Lol, read on the correct website first. Haha what a waste
---
thers also stratholme holy water. Its superusefull in naxx especially by tanks for aoe threat.
---
Irrelevant because it'd use end of Wrath patch just like it'd use end of TBC and just like it's using end of Vanilla. It would have dungeon finder.
---
Yes it's a soft way to level, especially on a high pop PvP server.
---
And after ZF you can go Mara solo if you want to play solo.
---
But then again as a mage you could just join a group for easy spellcleave all the way to 60 :D
---
Actually I regularly auto attack in dungeons up to this current point as level 47 Aura Dancing as I like to call it. Also you are correct Bis isnt a shield it's an offhand held item if I remember, but that's for healing not for solo content where if I do anything it would be aoe pulling things and burning them down which is what a lot of these talents are for.
---
The points in prot get me BoK which is one of the best buffs in the game, the points in Ret get me extra damage, mana management, and some utility
---
You can't pretend to be socialized on here, we know.
---
*"I hope you like corpse walkin' too, oh yeah"*
---
Dailies sucked, hub city sucked, limited time event rewards like arena season sucked.
---
I gave up on farming it and bought it when it was down to 60g. That was over a month ago. Last night decided to run strat for the offchance of getting shadow wrath cloak, recipe drops and I manage to win it. And it's somehow still at 60g. Payback time!
---
On my server the mats for the robe still cost around 400g. I still think it's well worth it. Can't find anything better raiding today.
---
Comparing dps between warriors can be tough, especially when they have different builds.
---
It is definitely as you mention a matter of who crits the most, especially if you have similar gear.
---
If you ever want to compare performance between mages or warlocks, simply look at the amount of FB\SBs casted. A person casting 20 non-crit FBs, can be out-dps'd by a person who did 15 casts, but 5 of them crit.
---
Making it very easy to compare.
---
agreed that Ulduar was the best raid of the Wrath expansion (and definitely top 3 ever). But Icecrown Citadel was decent.
---
and most important of all imo. Gold matters.
---
Its a fresh economy. and i wsh every damn expansion came with an economy reset tbh.
---
currently levelling a druid and it feels even better. When I leave rogue-form I have full mana to heal up, and while murder-mittening the next few mobs it all regens for next heal again.
---
You shouldn't be dying all that often. What is happening that's getting you killed?
---
It's the pre-BiS healing neck for pretty much every healer in the game, and it drops from the second last boss in Strat UD. No idea about OP, but I've ran it 12 times now without seeing it drop - if some Druid tank wannabe-healer won it over me I'd be pretty freaking upset. 
---
Sure, if you are gearing up for healing while tanking that's one thing, but do **not** steal the only piece a healer who's ran the place countless of times is healing the group for. That's extremely bad manners.
---
o...kay?
---
It debuffs the target, you would be banned from using it in my guilds raids anyway...
---
Gotta love how they made the elf on the box art looks so corrupted/evil with scars and tatoos, but in the actual game they are nothing like that. They made them as pansy as possible, and even self aware of that if you use /silly and other emotes.
---
The way I understood it is that the xp does not change but the % towards level goes down as each level requires more xp to level. So it might seem as though you are receiving less xp. 
---
A link would have been helpful, rather than a downvote and "you can look it up"
---
Whether green quests give lesset or equal xp, they are the most efficient way for a warrior to level.
---
Credit to my guildie Riljin @Arugal
---
Lol, this :(
---
Came here to say get Questie! Great add-on. This should solve your questing problem.
---
its 14 stam 5 BH and 6 mp5 over the pyjamas which in return has 11 spirit and 5 int. The spirit will also grant you BH in holy. And will be better with 3 part Tier 2. 
---
So if you think 2 seconds on a 30 second cd fade and 14 stam is worth over 400g on most servers then go for it.
---
I'd have a lot more feelings quitting a guild than quitting a job. A job is a job, I'm paid for this. A guild I invest my freetime into for my and other peoples fun.
---
Not abandoning anything, just moving somewhere else at zero convenience loss.
---
Besides it’s usually more than just one corpse run and usually 3-5+ horde constantly in the area.
---
But seriously it’s no skin off my back neck it can even be a good chance to grab a bite to eat and a drink. Then go do a dungeon or something. 
---
Absolutely zero loss on my part.
---
WCGW?
---
I haven't found any "friendly" orcs to test it out, but i've done my best to throw some grenades at orc players.
---
out of 9 thrown grenades, i've seen "Resist" float up 4 times. With both damage and CC ignored.
---
I'd say OP is a bit fat liar.
---
I think that's their point. They're having fun.
---
I had no idea that was an option.  Will do, thanks!
---
Also to add on this, arena + anger are just two bosses (sometimes golem if casters/healer need trinket) then back out and reset.
---
Yeah, except DKP was phased out of the game over time because of the heavy flaws the system has.
---
A) DKP pooling.
---
B) people not taking upgrades because they're saving for some other upgrade down the road.
---
C) Terrible players getting BIS items over your best players.
---
Like serious question, why do you think the game evolved away from DKP over time? Any serious, decent guild is going to LC. It's just a superior system.
---
Hey hey!! I did enjoy the cleave groups whilst I was levelling :) hope you’re well!
---
LOK’TAR OGAR!
---
Start with something similar to this [Combat Dagger Build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZGcV0bvz0foV)
---
This [Seal Fate Dagger Build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhefoxdVZGcV0boZV) won't be top DPS until way later into Classic, but I find it much more fun, so i'll be doing this once i'm better geared
---
Good advice, personally I use ravager; the proc gives you an extra attack on single mobs if you abort it after first tick.
---
I had it in classic. The grind is not fun. It requires at least an average of 8 hours of playing per day. Sometimes more depending on the server
---
I got the sword ^_^ am so lucky
---
Dailies in tbc replaced the combination of rpeat turnins and just blond mob grinds for reps. You think you feel behind becuase you missed a day? Dude yo' lazy is already 40 hours of playtime "behind" that guy over there with the wintersaber mount better start grindin so you can "catch up"
---
You say in 10 levels like it's not that long. You do realize the last 10 levels are like the equivalent of the first 30 right? Feral will definetly speed up your leveling and make it more fun. The respec cost isnt that much especially once you get to 60 and start making more gold. I enjoy playing a caster druid but if it's not for you then you go feral. Your talents are fine so there isnt much you can do except maybe improve gear
---
We have a shadow priest who is our shadow in raid as well. He respeccs every week, even though we told him that he doesnt need to do it, seeing how it is just pvp shadow vs pve shadow.
---
There is also the Aurastone Hammer. I'll grant that the mageblade is better, but paladins technically have another option, one that mages and warlocks can't use.
---
Just remove flying mounts and LFG mechanics, for the sake of social gameplay and i'm a happy man
---
My theory is Blizz will release the trilogy while working on (hopefully) WoW2 which could release in the next 3-5 years bring together the "classic" community and the retail community
---
Is this a fancy player report or is there more to this story
---
WHat is this tradition for the uniformed?
---
Yeah it's likely the case because given that it's been 2 months yet it's  the first on the server likely there were a few people already holding the mats just waiting for a crafter. I'd be so pissed at this guy if I was in the guild.
---
He will and theres nothing wrong with that lol. 
---
If anything taking longer to reach 60= longer enjoyment of classic
---
Don't bother rushing - you can already access every dungeon you will be running for weeks on end at lvl 60.
---
You may as well start farming your endgame gear now and do whatever dungeon drops the gear you want. Better now than at 60 when it gives no exp as you're killing 2 birds with 1 stone.
---
I have no idea what this is referencing. Context?
---
I’m currently leveling up my Paladin. I was beating up some Nagas in Southshore and two mages (3 levels lower than me) appeared out of nowhere. I had 10% Hp when they threw their frost bolts at me. So I bubbled, threw of one heal that got me to 50% hp, then I beat both mages to the ground. Verigans Fist with Seal of Command double crit, two shotted one of the mages. I think that people are hating to much on Paladins. They all say they’re only good for healing and buffing. I don’t agree.
---
Pattern on my server doesnt go for less than 100g.  They wont sell.  Mats are easily 200g+.  300g+ is not easy to farm on a holy priest if you have a job and responsibilities.  Plus if you have rag on farm in blues, I mean...why waste the gold?  Its bis...but for what?  You think people are actually going to struggle with bwl?  
---
I just laugh at people like you who take classic so seriously.  Content is so old and everything is so easy.
---
He obviously should have clarified his intentions at the beginning of the run. So he's at fault here, I wouldn't necessarily call or ninjalooting, but just being kind of an ass. 
---
Many resto druids are currently using the spec HotW/NS which allows them to both tank and heal. This makes it easier to find groups, and also makes it easier for groups to find tanks - but in most cases the druid will be a healer in raids, and therefore healing loot is what they are after. 
---
You should of course clarify that with a group before going in ;) 
---
I tanked a BRD run the other day, and had forgotten til inform about the fact that "I identify as a healer" so had to let some of my Pre-bis go to the priest - luckily he already had the mace and off-hand, so I got pretty lucky still.
---
Our tank got disconnected and "Game time has expired" messaged in the middle of a DM run - luckily it was between pulls. Continued on for a few trash packs without him, then he popped back in. Happens.
---
In the guild I am in. If you heal enh. Specced, you'd do this for exactly as long as it does for one of the officers to notice you being consistently low on the meters and inspecting you.
---
I'd say OP is trolling. Orcs do have a 30% chance to resist grenades. But then again, a sample size of 9 is not much.
---
An interesting tech is that if the target is an orc, you could use a goblin sapper charge instead of a grenade to avoid the potential resist. Throwing grenades at orcs is an option, it's just not very reliable.
---
What is fun?
---
&gt;with a mage group
---
OP, make sure you notice that part.  We can tank a lot of mobs at once, but it ends badly without AoE damage.
---
Dreadmist representin'
---
How about you just report them in game and move on instead of trying to incite a witch hunt.
---
last time my game time expired i was able to stay logged on for 5-10 ish minutes before i would get booted off
---
Maybe the decent players don’t want to play with out?
---
Your standards are higher now.  
---
    
---
Shocking, I know :p
---
You really, genuinly think that reporting a player will make a GM go "Mm, oh man, this guy, he rolled "Need" on an item for his off-spec! This is a banable offense!"?
---
hah damn that's cold. That'd drive me crazy.
---
Priests pump out the most hps.
---
Oops!  I dieded again!
---
I started tanking emp runs at 54. Usually I find a group within a couple minutes.
---
Yeah DM me his name pls I've got a lot of friends on Mograine EU
---
lol retail babies think max level is the only thing that matters
---
Typical politician who doesn't understand how games or technology work.
---
I have found far more decent players than not so far. More so than any other MMO I have tried recently.
---
Unless they've specifically blocked them off for Classic, they're accessible and have been since vanilla. Always enjoyed getting up there with my RP guild back in the day.
---
... You really have no idea what a white man in white robes carrying a torch next to two black characters referring to Charlottesville is referencing? Are you serious?
---
It's shady, sure, and I wouldn't want to play with that guy in the future.
---

My realm has a lot of warriors (12-13%) but not as many mages (16-17%) or hunters (14-15%), that being said is it too late to roll warrior with the single goal of pve? How does having that many warriors affect my chances of finding guilds? I had been leveling a healer to get into raids easier but lost my motivation to continue.
---
t0x's comment above got it right. Calling people casuals when classic takes just as much effort but in a different way sounds really pretentious and like you smell your own farts or something. People enjoying the experience shouldn't be shit on like I see on these posts a lot. Maybe don't assume people "didn't fucking do anything" and that's why they don't enjoy BFA. Who cares. 
---
Also imo the story in BFA is lazy and so are the allied races but that's another issue and entirely one's own opinion. There may not be much "story" per say in Classic but I'd rather no story than the shitstorm that is BFA.
---
I’m excited to play as a high elf
---
Probably because you're running with randoms and most of the decent players are in guilds, because running with randoms means you often play with shit players.
---
Yeah I would say it is quite useful.
---
T1 l’âge head is even better than T2 because of the spell hit
---
Actually that was finalized at least 6 months before Wrath, and had been agreed upon by both companies during December 2007, a full year before Wrath.
---
Happened to me the other day. Even tho I have a recurring subsription.
---
Protection is slower solo leveling, retribution is slower at finding dungeon groups. Holy is probably too slow to main-spec into for leveling. 
---
If you plan on tanking put the first 11 points in holy to get Consecrate. Then the rest can go prot.

They're all mind controlled by 80 priests

So? Why do people care about being so much better than shitty people? Shitty people deserve to have people be shitty to them too. What good is taking the high road? Obi-Wan had the high ground and he became a lame old hermit. Anakin didn't and became bad ass Darth Vader and was right hand man to the ruler of the fucking galaxy.
---
Stop buying gold you idiot.
---
The 5% crit for holy spells is very powerful. 
---
It’s really the only reason I went that far in holy
---
What’s your opinion on leveling a priest?
---
I’m on the fence of making a priest... their 1v1 pvp abilities are crazy
---
Did I hit a nerve? Are you one of the dozens of people that whisper to join our guild everyday?
---
Well it’s a pretty sick wallpaper for me :P
---
Completely agreed. Since this is kinda a noob rogue post this is my suggestion to newer raiders
---
It's personal preference.. there's no way to answer that question
---
That being said, I completely agree with him
---
"Species" is both singular and plural. "Specie" is not a word. E.g. "One species, two species."
---
I would say the opposite, there are way more decent players around now. Which shows in how fast things are cleared. My old guild in vanilla got upto twin empanadas in AQ40. Our fastest clearing time for MC was 3 hours and fastest Rag kill was around 4,5 min (just after p2 goes back to P1).
---
In my current guild we clear MC in 1,5 hours and kill rag in 1,5 min with worse gear available. Also clearly at least I play with better players these days.
---
Another thing of note is that MC pugs was pretty rear in vanilla whereas day today easily can do at least 8/10 of the bosses.
---
Filthy casual /s
---
Burning rag before he submerges is totally dependent on how well the ranged dmg does during this fight. Maintaining positioning, maxing dmg, minimizing knockback downtime, not knocking back others, etc. So ranged doing well in the face of that despite the RNG knockback is vitally important. Therefore rewarding the ranged dps who do well on this fight isn't "pretty dumb" when those same dps are why we're succeeding.
---
If you don’t need the gold immediately, save them.  Once battlegrounds are released, you’ll probably see an uptick in enchants needed for all levels.
---
Lol swing and a miss, Zerker rage is on a 30 sec CD.
---
But sure if a warlock comes back before the 30 seconds are up, I'll just pop *Recklessness*, Death Wish, or even WoTF.
---
Robe of the Exalted has amazing stats but is the ugliest piece of gear in the game.... no, just no, I’d rather wear something with inferior stats than looking like I am wearing my Grandmas curtains!
---
If everyone just dpses properly the boss should before you do without getting decursed
---
Not sure where you are getting your info from, from release of bwl it took 77 days before it was cleared
---
Draw me now Smile, draw me :DDDDD!
---
But warlocks have unlimited mana as long as healers have mana
---
This guide is great and is what I’ve been using. So much fun, good kill time. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx32HH-yVX0&amp;t=9s
---
As a holy priest my ability to stand there and so nothing while my opponent can't kill me and I can't kill them it's frankly unparalleled.
---
Sure, but it still is mostly RNG on who gets most time to push damage and who is being thrown around. So basically you are distributing that loot based on luck.
---
This exact scenario happened to me except the hunter traded them to me, a prot warrior, despite losing the roll. I told him I’d tank any dungeon for him anytime. Wish he’d hit me up sometime! I have some major karma to repay.
---
You aren't using HS though, you queue it and cancel it before the MH swing.
---
Your*
---
I hear they are going to add flying mounts? This will ruin the game if it's true!
---
My reaction time has slightly diminished, and I tend to get bored a bit more easily, but overall I am a much better player. Various game mechanics are just easier for me to understand and situations are easier to adapt to. It's actually been a rather interesting comparison, since I quit during Cata.
---
Experienced people familiar to raiding from multiple expansions or playing on pservers need to be reminded how difficult the game can be for new people, as well. Been healing from TBC/WotLK and with a few dips into some of the newer (but less memorable, to me) expansions. However, I was brutally reminded how difficult things can be when people don't know strategies/don't understand/refuse to listen when I tried to heal his onyxia pug last week. "Stop DPS in P3" was, for some, an insurmountably difficult sentence to grasp, and there were breaths. Oh, there were breaths. My fault for joining a PuG for it, I guess.
---
Falsely banned 2 times, sure :D :D Now the fairy tale about Cinderella :)
---
I hear it will be named “Space Goats: Coast to Coast”
---
Well first off, there's no way to play "incorrectly." That's a real douche of a comment. Play how you want. Anyone who thinks you need to min/max at this point in classic is insane. We're in a phase with easy raids. There's no reason to NOT play the style you want
---
There are essence of water fishing pools that spawn in Azshara.
---
I got all of them, and no. The prices of crafts are always exactly the same as the price of mats, give or take.
---
If the mats for a greater fire prot costs 5g, the pot never costs more than 5.3g (often 5.1), so you cant really make anything of it.
---
Flasks are the same. If mats costs 80g, the flask will at max cost 85. That doesnt even cover the AH cut, and no one goes through the hassle of buying mats, finding a crafter, tipping and then saving maybe 2g on an 80g investment.
---
Other servers might be different, but on mine they are good for nothing (still fun to have though!)
---
Put down the bruiseweed... you are seeing shit
---
Honestly I just wouldn't group with a druid tank as a healer, this type of thing happens all the time because druids are typically raid healers. If you are going to invite a druid to tank I'd make sure you talk to them beforehand and figure out what they are running the dungeon for.
---
2 level 60s here... the math is off there. 
---
It’s typically 6-7.5 days per played depending on your character and ability to level. That’s about one month per character, maybe a bit more if you take some ‘fun decisions’ like I did.
---
Are you not reading the words I'm typing?  It's breaking a written agreement that they're banning for not for rolling need and yes they've absolutely 100% banned people for that.
---
Hello druid friend,  
---
learn to love your forms. And work on your rotation.
---
Your rotation makes not much sense to me. Here is how I would do it:  
---
Starfire -&gt; Moonfire -&gt; Insect Swarm -&gt; Roots -&gt; Starfire -&gt; Starfire... Hold Moonfire up
---
You don't need to root the mobs at first. It should be enough time to root the mob before it arrives you by following the rotation above. I think this already would feel way more better to you.
---
But I really recommend to start the fight in Cat form. If you are lucky and your Ravage crits the mob is already on half HP. This is always a nice feeling if this happens. Thats is why you should learn to love your forms. Here the rotation how I would do it in your case:  
---
Catform -&gt; Stealth -&gt; Ravage -&gt; Rake -&gt; Rip -&gt; Castform -&gt; Moonfire -&gt; Insect Swarm -&gt; Natures Grasp / Roots -&gt; Starfire -&gt; Starfire...
---
Give it a try.  You don't need to respec to use it.
---
haha, indeed !
---
You're a tank.
---
You use a sword.
---
A sword that requires a crusader enchant.
---
A crusader enchant that requires orbs.
---
Yet you and other pug tanks constantly claim that there is no reason for a tank to run strat live. And won't go unless a zone specific drop is reserved for you. Hmmmmmm. 
---
It is no longer month 1 of classic, most people don't need gear from there. The only reason for anyone to go is for orbs and gold. If you hate tanking so much that you will only do it for 30-50g of enchanting mats...why don't you just reroll? People will always be running live strat, even when Naxx is out because crusader enchants will always be required for melee classes and tanks. You don't see melee dps classes pulling this bullshit, only greedy shitter pug tanks. 
---
I myself have done live strat a dozen or so times so far, and I just don't join groups with people like you.
---
I leveled as a holy/disc priest. It was miserable tbh, but shadow is a different story! Shadow priests are amazing
---
No ,you cant but you use it in advance and lasts a while 10 sec is enough to kill you if you not tanky and pvp build .Fury warriors also get death wish 
---
Succu can be feared pummeled interrupted or just killed considering she is really squishy .
---
If warrior aggros some mobs in world pvp that will fuck you up as well and just give him more rage.Ofc if you are the one getting jump first its much easier
---
You're absolutely right, figured it out. Thanks!
---
Happy cake day!
---
[Moveanything](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything).
---
Works fine with classic. You'll want Right Action Bar - Horizontal and Right Action Bar 2 - Horizontal.
---
It’s gone down to 40g on mine!
---
XD I also always tagged away mobs that mages gathered for AoE farming.
---
Are you using the correct official LFG channel? I spoke to a few people who were experiencing what you are and it turned out they were using LFG instead of Lookingforgroup.
---
Nah. GM's got better shit to do than worry about minor loot issues from 5 mans.
---
I saw nowhere that they said that. Leaving a group .2 seconds after you're done vs shooting a "thanks for the group!" *drops mage port* "cy'all later!" is what I saw.
---
Wow before plow

This is basically what I'm doing.

You can even take out the bags and menu items, to either have two rows of bars at the bottom, or just one - centered in the middle. I really like that look :D

---
Nope, TBC was garbage. Some people are a little slower to realize when the game died, others aren't. The only good thing about TBC were the talents, literally everything was completely devoid of soul.
---
If that were the case our dmg distribution would look different between kills. Week over week each person's dps has been increasing by about 15-20%, but peoples positions on the meters aren't changing. Like I'm consistently 5th overall dmg on rag, even with everyone's dmg going up as a raid.
---
It's a blast as a rogue. Dunno why anybody plays any other classic to be quite honest.
---
Aggroing more than one mob usually, 2 I can handle sometimes but 3 is just me dead. Some of the quests so far that has been unavoidable :/
---
go ahead and 1v1 a priest / warlock as a warrior and we'll see who wins
---
If a bis piece drops for me you better believe in going to roll on it. I don't care how many times somebody else has done the run.
---
You said it yourself, it's bis for all healers. So what makes you think the Druid has no right to roll on it?
---
This is my view too. I want the UI to be aligned with “the theme” of the game.
---
Oh man I'm so excited, it's so weird how they basically dropped out of the world after being in the RTS titles. Sure, Arthas did a number on them but it's not like he killed **all** of them. It'd make sense for them to reunite with their former allies if demons invaded or something. I'm betting that's going to happen from the title, and it's going to be awesome, fighting the burning legion, defending our homes. They could use the opportunity to refresh some of the zones that get neglected later on in the game like Silithus, or Deadwind pass, where basically nothing happens. Blasted Lands in particular is going to be awesome if they're coming through the dark portal again, because right now there's not much point going there.
---
Not sure who the blue dudes are, but it's probably the usual deal where the horde get some kind of new monstrous race with different colour skin. I just hope they're not aliens or some shit like that. Maybe something celestial to balance out the demons and justify giving Horde paladins?
---
So here's the thing everything you're saying I know already. I'm not planning on dpsing in raids with this build hell I'm not even planning on raiding period with this build. I dont have the time nor inclination to raid anymore. I used to very aggressively raid from TBC all the way through Warlords and have several server firsts and some impressive claims to fame from when I did raid.
---
Now that that's out of the way. The shield is for aoe pulling to help me survive. Every blocked hit is less damage I have to somehow mitigate or heal back up the shield is not for when I am healing. When healing I will be using one of the offhand trinkets that improve healing(I'm already half done with the linken questline for the offhand it gives)
---
In dungeons I am planning on rolling healer I have everything I need out of the tree to be competitive and competent in that roll, outside of that the character still needs to be able to perform in daily activites. Some things serve a dual purpose like improved Ret Aura others more of a solo purpose.
---
The game was great tbh. Controversial here maybe but imo tbc was peak wow. The worst thing about tbc was that BT lasted too long
---
okay, but i doubt classic wow took its place
---
TBC's class balance is good and they had some fun raids but I don't really care much for the Outland zones (find most of them very ugly) and flying is a big no-no.
---
Shadow/disc hybrid then Respec to shadow at 40 is stupid easy.
---
...except there haven't been large swings. What your saying isn't supported by the tools we have to measure with and the measurement we've done. Like I get how that fight can feel that way, but that's why we measure, so we aren't making the judgement call based off feeling but data instead.
---
Yeah I mean the point is you won't be tanking in raids. You can tank dungeons in your fury raid spec and then dps in raids.
---
I mean, by the time you get WW the problem with warrior leveling is pretty much solved anyway, still can't compete with a mage, but you can at least fight one or two mobs of the same level without risking death
---
Yeah. I only have two MC pieces, and I already noticed a sharp increase in repair costs. I can only imagine the horror as I get more geared out.
---
Let's be clear what you're doing here. You're posting 4 deep in a thread where each post in the chain is steeped in irony. But just in case anybody doesn't get it, you're finishing your post with /s just to be completely sure that everyone knows it's a joke and no-one should take your post seriously.
---
At this point every tank has their favorite healers.... On ally side it's not has bad. But we are definately starving for tanks sometimes.
---
That works!? Nice. Does that mean hibernate also works on bear/cat druids?
---
I think people on this sub and on wow in general don't really get what casual gaming is.
---
I dont even remember my pw anymore
---
I agree that there should have been some communication beforehand, but I believe the Druid has the right to roll on any gear they reasonably intend to wear.
---
Next thing will be retail expansion
---
Depends on where you are in the leveling/gearing process, most of the serious players already have their main to 60, and nearly full prebis, so they don't really have much incentive to join random dungeons or do quests with people outside their guild.
---
So if your behind that curve you are going to run into more casual players, which will have a higher % of "bad" players
---
Shamefully I tied my girlfriend to the bed. She thought I would go down on her but instead I let our maltese shitzu in the room to lick her face. She's never let me tie her since.
---
Dungeons at early end game are as relevant as leveling.
---
You only do it cause you have too.
---
Im not dyslexic and i do that all the time lol
---
I believe he meant a partially cleared ID. They probably cleared everything but Majordomo and Ragnaros, and 6 of the finished the Hands quest and can now douse runes.
---
Mage is the most popular class on my realm (Azuresong-US), does this harm my chances of getting into guilds for raiding short and long term?
---
Yes. The enchant won't change because the staff changes. +Healing is +Healing, regardless of whether it's on Benediction or Anathema.
---
Thats a fools game trying to cue and uncue HS to get your offhand to not suffer the miss penalty.
---
Hmm, if you don't have a ranged weapon then it might be worth picking up that skill to help with pulling. Pulling is a bit of an art form as you develop that innate sense of which mobs will/won't pull aggro. 
---
But if you're in areas where pulling groups is unavoidable (like some of the Trogg killing quests in Loch Modan), then I would just grab another random player nearby and smash it out.
---
If you buy gold, there is a good chance you will be caught. Simple as that.
---
It's actually hard to say my character is a 60 warrior. Been 60 for a few weeks and I think it's a matter of people who think that there class can do more then it can as long as you know where you can go. So when you can go to a zone and know when you can take mobs. It's more of not wasting your time once you get that I think warrior is quite easy. Still slow tho and thats all because the downtime that you have.
---
I mean, let‘s be real here. I‘ve read all your comments and what you‘re saying is basically that your guild is playing a suboptimal tactic, you afk half the fight and you‘re still always top dps. Then you refuse to provide the necessary proof that your afk tactic puts you ahead of other rogues. (logs)
---
I really don‘t mean to start an argument here, but what you‘re doing with your comment is providing new rogues with wrong information that leads to low dps and bad parses. There is absolutely no reason for you to pop cds in p1 and then afk in p2. Pop them shortly before p2 starts so they end when she goes in the air, then quickly handle whelps and follow ony around with 5x ss spam + eviscerate. There is absolutely no disadvantage to dpsing ony as melee in p2 and if your raid leader says you should afk, then he does that because he‘s not confident in your ability to use sprint to walk to a safe spot on deep breath - and that speaks for itself. 
---
If you are still top dps with that tactic, then the ranges in your guild are doing something horrendously wrong. I **guarantee** you, if you would actually upload logs, you‘d be surprised how low your parses end up compared to other rogues who don‘t afk half the fight.
---
And again, of course, your guild kills ony with that tactic, so it works out for you and there‘s no reason to change it - however, please please please don‘t tell new players to do this if they want to max out their dps. It‘s completely wrong and just an example of inexperience.
---
Wasting an actual DPS Warrior on Nightfall is a bad idea. Offtanks are fine. Ideally, you want multiple users for maximum uptime.
---
I find it pretty funny people are getting butthurt over this.  This is the battle you choose to fight?  Some kid RPing in Warcraft Classic?  How about you go fight racism in the real world where it matters.
---
How important is a swing timer on rogue? I don't mind losing 2-3% dps by not having one as it's already annoying enough on my Hunter.
---
This thing called loot etiquette that once existed but apparently is not respected anymore. If you join as one role, you should stick to that. If you want OS gear that a dude playing another role doesn't need, sure go ahead, but **it's absolute BS to grab the one single piece of gear that the healer is there for**. If you want that particular healing piece, join as freaking healer, not tank. I could go on, but I doubt that you will see eye to eye with me on this point, given that you make this question in the first place.
---
which is surely 29 out of every 30 minutes...
---
Then create a group with pug and freeroll all. You won't right? You would rather someone else do the hard job to put the raid together, while you feel entitled for all the loot.
---
&gt; Ok I guess the people blizzard
---
&gt; banned for scamming just imagined it.
---
Umm?
---
&gt; *your reading comprehension?*
---
Right dude. Right.
---
Holy cow, 50g an hour Lasher farming??
---
Can you give us a breakdown of where that gold came from?
---
Hunters and mages
---
Instead of answering idiots like this, what you do is mount up and just start running all over the god damn place aggroing as much as you can. Aggro anything and everything and drag them as far away from him as you can, and as soon as they leash, you ride back in for more. AoE farming mages rely on clean pulls and getting the mobs stacked nice and tight.
---
I was farming for Crusader Enchant the other day and a same faction hunter showed up. I'd have been happy to share the tower with him by him staying up or me staying down, but instead he insisted on placing traps directly under where I was standing and waiting for a spawn. I asked him if he could go farm one of the other 6 spawns and he said, "you mean 7 spawns." He continued doing it and was winning every single mob tag as they spawn one by one.
---
I started dragging in outside mobs that didn't drop Crusader over his traps so they'd activate and just CCing and kiting them around him and the tower all while keeping an eye on the Spellbinder spawns. I probably won 7/10 tags and a few minutes later got the enchant to drop. I linked it in /say and hearthed in front of him.
---
Laurel seems like a dick.
---
Depends on how many mages you have. Mage is one of the most needed classes in raids. We have about 7 mages and we'f like to have 3 more.
---
You're probably right that if it was that way from the beginning people wouldn't have complained, but Renew is pretty much a core priest spell. Essentially instead of class +talents to improve a certain aspect, its now just new classes, "shadow priest" and "Holy Priest"
---
It is a large reason why I stopped playing in Pandaria.  I hated the way the talents were. (also hated the way raids were)
---
Yes would it have been silly to be sinking 100 points into a tree, but all I know is when I logged into retail (after resubbing to reserve my name for classic) and tried to figure out what was going on, I shook my fist at it like an angry old person and just waited for classic to come out. I'm that old person now when it comes to wow.
---
MLK combat text does healing.
---
WOTLK was the beginning of the end.
---
TBC was "too hardcore" for the casuals which is how we ended up with WOTLK.
---
However I completely agree, I want Classic+, not TBC/WOTLK.
---
But considering how utterly lazy and incompetent modern Blizzard are, they won't do it. It's too much work.
---
That is also just wrong. Sweeping Strikes from Arms at level 30 is the biggest power spike.
---
They are all dead now due to basement dweller lifestyle that works perfectly fine when you are a teen but once you turn 30 your heart gives up.
---
I share a totally different opinion, I think TBC dungeons and system around heroic dungeon was great and best thing about wow back than. I'm not interested in classic +, I don't want anything changed or updated. I would not play it
---
&gt;  communication beforehand
---
This is the key. He has the right to ask to roll on anything, but I just find it to be a major dick move to just do it
---
The only item remotely interesting for a druid tank in strath undead is  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13397/stoneskin-gargoyle-cape](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13397/stoneskin-gargoyle-cape)  and it's beaten by a world drop BoE (by a long way). What do you think he's doing the run for?
---
Dailies... I already have a job in real life.
---
They have good coefficients, but they don't "scale" as well because of things like cuse I'd elements/shadows, shadowweaving etc
---
You should check with your officers in the guild, I don't think it would be a problem for you to dps as shadow when you have the raid on farm. It might actually be beneficial if you have a couple locks in your raid.
---
&gt;I agree that there should have been some communication beforehand, but I believe the Druid has the right to roll on any gear they reasonably intend to wear.
---
So based on this, the conversation would go something like: "Hey guys I'm the tank, but since druid can use spellcaster gear, healing gear, Rogue gear and all leather/cloth that fits this description even remotely, I will roll on all those items since I in the future I might perhaps reroll and use those"?
---
Essentially that's what I'd expect, since you talk about "some communication beforehand", and then go to "Druid has the right to roll on any gear they reasonably intend to wear". Ever in your life heard of MS &gt; OS ?
---
Best thing to do imo pick one of the three then forget the rest even exist. Think that you can't switch there aren't any other classes in the game to play.
---
It's only a waste after you get ms or bloodthierster because you just dont have anything else to press until then besides rend and overpower procs.
---
TBC bad???? ^^For ^^the ^^sake ^^of ^^continuity.
---
Phew!
---
It's 12 hours I thought
---
Also, level 2 or 3 characters at once, then you can use the hearthstone to save you even small amounts of walking! Level a different alt while HS is on cooldown!
---
Blessing of light doesn't do anything unless the healer is also a paladin.
---
And yes even a ret paladin can shine if they actually press all their buttons and the rest of the group is slacking.
---
Tbh we should just scrap this no witch hunt rule. Only way people learn to not act like assholes.
---
IMO you should always state your intentions before starting an instance (probably as soon as the party gets full). People mostly think of role &gt; MS which just isnt the case for some classes, thinking of raid roles mostly.
---
Firemaw is really nice, playing an alliance lock there.. A lot of Danish people there, but everyone speaks English..
---
Balance is around 50/50
---
Queue though,, think only Gehennas has a higher queue time
---
Cynicism is very validating.
---
Oh no, the runs will take 10 minutes longer! Strat live is a joke lmao, the level of try hard to pay people for an easy to fill and do run is hilarious.
---
looks like Leatrix Maps to me
---
Sunder Armor till the mob has ~50% health.
---
HS is ok when you and the mob are low health and you're going to have downtime to heal after killing it. If you're healthy, just pool rage for the next mob and get your next sunders up quickly.
---
EPGP with decay is pretty fair. I hate rolls. Mine always suck.
---
I do love his other work so I'll check his addons out too!
---
I manually sign in all the time since I play WoW trough Steam.
---
How am I blowing it out of proportion? You wrote this in a separate reply:
---
&gt;**If a bis piece drops for me you better believe in going to roll on it**. I don't care how many times somebody else has done the run.  
---

&gt;You said it yourself, it's bis for all healers. So what makes you think the Druid has no right to roll on it?
---
That's being said in a thread where a (supposedly) feral druid decides to grab a neck from the healer all of a sudden. Further, you say:
---
&gt;I believe the Druid has the right to roll on any gear they reasonably intend to wear.
---
It sure sounds as if you think you have to right to roll on any item you at some point, in a different spec, might be wearing, as long as it's a BiS for that slot and regardless of whether or not that item fits the role you are fulfilling in the dungeon where it drops. Even if that means you're rolling against a guy who actually needs it for the role he is performing in that said dungeon, since well, you might wear it at some point. 
---
If that was not your intention with these posts, my apologies. Please clarify what you meant if I got this wrong.
---
Get a ranged weapon and pull back if mobs are in tricky spots.
---
Also get those blue boe mail boots (forgot name) and put runspeed enchant on them. Get a decent 2hander and put fiery weapon enchant on it, then spam hamstring.
---
This will be awesome, I cant wait to play it!
---
Extra DPS is more useful to the raid group than extra healing at this stage of the game. I wouldn't get upset if your raid group insists on giving that to a Mage or Warlock instead of you. 
---
But you should still express your interest if you want it. They might not care.
---
I'm not sure if this is a scam for lower pops, on my high pop righetous orbs were going for 35-45g.
---
Done that, dont seem too helpful as it wasnt break and enter (had the door code) and only tower was taken. Theyll look into it but they didnt sound too promising..
---
&gt;boss does less damage than other boss, therefor WASTED!!!
---
Really terrible logic, there.
---
Also it's not like GFPP are rare or expensive; we're not talking about flasks here, we're talking about a ~4g consumable.
---
lol thanks for that
---
Literally everyone is decent now man, no idea what your talking about
---
We used to do this while our gild was still down on douses.
---
Clear up to domo, 1 lock summoning party outside of MC, 1 inside at domo.
---
People getting extra douses take darnassus portal and fly to azshara.
---
When they get the douse they get summoned outside mc, run in, then get summoned to domo.
---
Because tanking is stressful but you're pretty much forced to do it in 5 mans to gear up so you can DPS in raids. As a DPS I can walk into any dungeon without knowing what i'm getting myself into and perform at an okay level as long as I follow the tank around and attack what he attacks. 
---
Being the tank I have to know what mobs do, where to go, what the objective of the dungeon is, what mobs need to be cc'd, what mobs need to be priority, what packs can we skip etc. 
---
Add into it that for 40 man raids you need 2-3 tanks with maybe an offtank who will probably still be dps specced and throw a shield on. Most good guilds are going to have their MT/OT in place before you join unless you get in from the ground up. those same 40 people need 8 tanks to run dungeons. There's going to be a supply/demand issue once DPS wars stop needing to tank 5mans for gear. Now that I finally got my bow from DM E i'm likely never going to pug tank it again. Unless some guild comes along looking for a tank there's no reason for me to tank anything more than I have to for gearing purposes.
---
 Good luck telling a DPS war pulling 1k DPS when everyone else is pulling 500-600 that blizzard made it "very clear" he's supposed to be tanking.
---
I see what you did there
---
Yeah, my experience with it has not been too toxic.
---
dailies were implemented because the average player didn't had enough time to do anything of value at endgame.
---
Dailies are a concept are fine, it's abusing it everywhere which made it bad
---
Where did I say "required" ?
---
I'm not big into lore but isn't it a whole different planet in another dimension. I think that would definitely make it different than Azeroth.
---
y would bwl b different, bosses'll still drop like flies to the full t1/pvp bis pug raids that have had mc on farm for half a year
---
Wait, really? I use the login screen, have an authenticatior attached and it does not ask me for it upon login (probably because I have bnet open in the background). Sounds like y'all doing it wrong.
---
Depends on which procs you have. If you don't have HoJ and aren't using swords, 0 difference. If you have sword spec and HOJ, uuuh like 1% less DPS? If you have windfury, should be a lot more noticeable but I'm not positive about that.
---
That makes it more impressive imo, that such an old game can scale in beauty as frame rates and resolutions improve.
---
It took me 24 days played just to get my warrior 60 lol
---
People called paladin flash heal "flash of shit" in the previous naxx clearing private server guild.  As it doesnt really heal much (spamming max rank), even with +1300 healing. It just isnt enough in the heal intensive fights.
---
Its more of snipe healing the raid.
---
I think that was his point exactly.
---
Different doesn't mean break art principles and make it look bad.
---
imp run and lava run isnt necessarily the same.
---
How else would I have been able to know he was being ironic? Smh
---
It was originally :) But they've updated to the 8.0 version, but not the current retail version with better multithreading.
---
If an extra sword attack procs when the white weapon swing is almost over, it immediately "finishes" the swing and attacks. This means if you sinister strike toward the end of a white swing, you waste most of that "extra" attack.
---
SInister strikes doesn't reset it, but HoJ, Thrash Blade, and the Sword Specialization Talent's "extra swing" all do.
---
Does open all trigger COD?
---
Which was largely because of vanilla content that people came to late. Remember, TBC was still levelling 1-58 in Azeroth.
---
OP labeled the the title as 'threat here I come' then procceeded to use terribly optimized gear for threat tanking and you can't seem to figure out why people are talking about his weapon among many other poor choices for threat. Interesting.
---
Shit like this is the equivalent of a mage posting a thread talking about how they are going to top the DPS meter wearing +100 spellpower. 
---
Like if you got a cool set or something that's fine go ahead and show it off. Good for you. Don't come around here with some meme shit though trying to pretend like you're going to generate a shitload of threat in 8/8 might, QS as an orc with no edgemaster and like 3% hit. It's literally an oxymoron.
---
Did you tried switching factions? For me personaly playing horde wasn't so enjoyable as playing on alliance and you obviously like gnomes and dwarves.
---
It negates boss autoattacks and it's good for topping off the raid from random damage. Basically does what a priest could do spamming low rank flash heal, except they don't run OOM doing that.
---
Whoooooosh
---
Nagrand was the least worst, but it still wasn't great by any means. Un'Goro and Feralas is lush green done well. Nagrand was green on drugs.
---
Greater Arcane Pot while finishing up Geddon so the buff is on when Shazz is pulled, restorative pot while fighting to remove curse so mage doesn't have to stop casting to decurse = 30 sec kills
---
For sword spec, sure. OP is talking about Dagger spec.
---
Do the math, dude. You're just accepting that 2 points SnD is correct, it's not.
---
Like you said, people will still have a hard time standing in fire and bwl has some harder mechanics. I havent ran it as a 60 before but I remember people complaining a lot even post vanilla
---
You make a fair point. "Roll on the gear for the roll you're fulfilling". I can get behind this.
---
So if a Druid wanted to run for this piece of gear, they should either join as a Healer, or let the group know before the run that they intend to roll on it.
---
Again, this seems to come down to lack of communication.
---
If you are on a high pop try hard server it will be even worse. The entire honor grind will be tightly controlled and regulated, it’ll be like a full time job (actually worse).
---
That's a pretty bad alt though... no proper bags, using wrong abilities (sunder and overpower missing on bars), not having proper enchants or potions.
---
Get bags, go to the class trainer and weapon master, get a ranged weapon, get a decent 2hander and enchant it with fiery weapon, get blue boe mail boots and put runspeed on them. Buy different levels or health potions, mail them to the alt (take out only right level ones) and use them liberally.
---
Judgements of ret and com. Scale with melee crit chance, not spell crit chance. Fun fact for you :-). When I respex to ret in phase 2, I'll be stacking that crit harddd
---
You can see the profit margins for my server in the picture. I'm not selling them yet; I'm just stockpiling them for later phases. Prices and sale rate will only go up during later phases due to inflation and content being more challenging.
---
I think OP means healing numbers that pop up over the healed target, not in your "floating combat stats" area. Think of a Mage casting blizzard on 10 mobs and seeing 10 damage numbers pop up every second.
---
To my knowledge, MSBT doesn't do that?
---
This is how I leveled my enchanting to 300
---
Yea man. You know what sounds fun. Standing there doing nothing because you will rip threat at 250 dps. Loads of fun.
---
Exceptional prioritisation.
---
This reminds me of the cup from Flight of the Conchords.
---
Artorius the Amiable (the one in Winterspring) only takes 15, not sure about the others,
---
Sounds like you are reseting the boss, i am talking about killing it and saving money on the invis pot.
---
There isn’t one, at least on this website. I guess a true classic wow sub or something that’s all discussion and no memes/shitposts. 
---
Every server has a discord server and those aren’t bad depending, thebofficiap class channels have been nice particularly the Hunter one. I’ve learned a lot there already. 
---
4chan’s /vg/ wow classic threads are also good.
---
Elemental earth and heart of fire was a great investment when i played on nostalrius. Theres still a couple of phases before they get their spike though.
---
Yeah I have miks to tell me when I get sword spec procs. Only SCT that actually does that.
---
It's not a bad idea, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to do, honestly. Also, seems like there's some stealthed rogues disagreeing with everyone in this thread that's not blindly spouting the Icyveins party line.
---
**thank you good people of horde Firemaw.**
---
I like reserving orbs and taking all the trash loot
---
I appreciate the input! Spirit tap first because of when you can get your first wand I presume?
---
This seems to be a hard concept for people to grasp.
---
I'm sure I could sell a few now, but I'm going to be stockpiling them for later phases. Flasks are slow to sell at the moment, even if the margins are fantastic, due to them really not being needed for MC. They should sell much fast during later phases.
---
You had the chance to say Laaurel.
---
Gratz, OP!
---
I already did 46 arcanit bars only by myself and still don't saw Eye:(
---
? Arms is best in slot for tanking 5 mans lol
---
Yeah if you can kill it go for it by all means, but I'm an Elemental Shaman and he's quite resistant to nature damage so it takes a while and all my mana just to get him to 50% :P
---
This is exactly what I'm afraid of since I'm also farming that same neck coming up on my 20th run.  
---
Only solution is to reserve the neck or just don't invite any druid dps / tank nor priest / shaman dps
---
the best part about warrior is when you’re barely killing mobs without having to eat and some fucking smoothbrained midget runs over the hill with a band of window lickers all frozen in place and starts to aoe them all down
---
omg u absolute madlad
---
Maybe his guild raids for fun too? Maybe everybody killed Ragnaros 10000 times each over the past 15 years and don't actually care?
---
Maybe he doesn't even raid in that gear but just posted this for meme points.
---
Don't clench your butt too hard.
---
Mana gain from wisdom does generate threat and it is increased by RF.
---
Deathbone is great starter tanking gear. I've even seen warriors wearing it since it gives a lot of defense.
---
This might be true but I dont even play retail (and I do think it's bad rn)
---
No joke
---
Deathbone is great, if you want to tank raid bosses. The hit you take on int for me is too much. I have 2 peices of DB (boots and belt) for that sweet +3def bonus. Im opting for energized chest over DB. You need int if you are going to compete for threat, especially in the future phases.
---
You do know FTL setups are perfectly viable In HKN too, right?
---
we are stealing posts now in this sub?
---
Go figure
---
What
---
Ewww squid face guys? No way this is real. Where did squid guys even come from?
---
Ive had a couple of PM's, thank you folks.. im really after either a digital or physical commission piece. Art work is what im after..
---
What ever would their mounts be? I could see horses like humans have but that is kinda boring (maybe unicorns?) In TFT they were around snapdragons so maybe they'll ride those? Also wtf blue goat men? Blizzard plz
---
You could say that its....Geralds Game ...of choice
---
He is apparently doing a KKK cosplay
---
I didn't get it at first either.
---
He should be reported, but Blizz probably needs to send a GM over to observe since this kind of behavior can be hard to prove just with the logs.
---
Yeah just gotta give it time. I'm watching it drop daily on Sulfuras. Last week was 150, yesterday was 95, by the time I get the mats, it'll be 50 for sure. Depends on how long ya wanna wait.
---
Yeah I would sell it now, it's only worth a lot because it's better than using a blue for ele pvp. By Phase 3 a lot of people will have Aurastone hammer
---
yah, I like keepass myself. ctrl+v, easy peasy
---
Communication and honesty is key in these situations. I don't mind if the tank (or whoever) grabs OS healing pieces I don't need, but what am I there for if they will also roll on the single piece of gear I run the dungeon for? In that case I am nothing but an unpaid carry.
---
So absolutely; communication from the start.
---
But.. It's an RPG...  =( They need to realize people loved WoW and it grew so so much during vanilla to WLK because it was an MMORPG. As soon as these "let's water it down"-features came, playerbase started to decline. 
---
Bring back RPG and MMO elements and it'll shine again.
---
I've seen a few 60 warriors with WW axe still. I have no idea how people make it work for that long, but apparently some people are crazy like that.
---
Weapon skill is great if your targets defense skill is higher than your weapon skill, raid bosses are lvl 63 wich means they have 315 defense.
---
305 skill gives you 3% hit and alot of glancing dmg reduction, glancing benefit caps out at 308 skill in classic anything after that is a waste tbh.
---
While I agree with you that this is a stupid thing to be butthurt over, this "kid", as you call him, is actually a 40-something year old man. Played PS2 years ago with TE, while it was fun, ending up in his squad was not fun...at all. All he does is rage, scream, and whine, when he doesn't get his way.
---
[Buzzcutpsycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=untPEx9qin4) was his name back on PS2.
---
Afaik luna has heal comm built in. I did t really like shadowed either luna just feels like an upgrade over it. There was like a week luna wasn’t working and I went through a couple as replacements but was dying to get luna back. Old dogs can’t learn new tricks I guess
---
We do that strategy too.
---
We actuallly do it because we dont have a lot of tanks and it's easy for a fury to just stand there tanking one guy.
---
If you kill melees first you'll have to worry about tanks picking up new targets when they become sheep inmune.
---
You could do that too. But that takes more effort than just mailing them to a bank alt and I’m all about minimizing the amount of effort to achieve a specific result :p
---
Weapon skill is almost useless against mobs that are your level or lower though.
---
&gt; Can't be Draenai as they're Broken.
---
Draenei were nerfed to make them balanced in the last patch.
---
Come to Gehennas
---
https://youtu.be/pP7Pys1lMgI
---
Yea but I mean when Im dpsing as arms in dungeons and we come to a single target, I dont cant spam sweeping, whirlwind and cleave, so my dps is not good :D
---
If you don’t stack crit you will hit like noodle. If you don’t use mana consumes you will be oom, if you dont use melee consumes it wont matter if you crit or not.
---
This is kind of my thought. Business wise it makes perfect sense to go for the easy play and just do the original trilogy. Its loved amd doesnt ruin the game like cata. And if they someone found a way to merge retail and classic in wow 2 it would be the biggest gaming moment from any gaming company.
---
Blessings don't either, I didn't know Fortitude did that.
---
Oh look, what a surprise, you got triggered over my comment. Are you perhaps a little self conscious about what I said?
---
Or an orc
---
Disc Priest - even Alliance side they are the best single-target healers.
---
If he would really spread a message of hate, I believe that he wouldve been already banned. 
---
If he is just roleplaying (maybe even a rp server?), like a slave merchant selling his goods, depending on the gold they pay they get a "slave" for a few hours to help them questing. This would actually be quite funny.
---
The more I think about it the more I want to do it.
---
Relatable man...
---
Paladins arent easy kills. You're going to have to waste every single CD and consumable you can just to live long enough to get the paladin oom and force his bubble hearth.
---
And paladins have very short Cooldowns on some very powerful abilities.
---
And their hearthstone is going to be set to the closest town/Inn
---
STV = BB
---
So your most likely going to get caught with your pants down fighting a mob, by that same paladin who you think you beat and who will have HoJ and Wings ready. While your defensive are still on CD.
---
Ya there's a reason the most popular pservers was vanilla, I'm frankly surprised by the sheer number of people clamoring for the grind fest that was bc.
---
Yeah we have a partially cleard ID, we didnt dowse anything when we went 8/10. Seems like the opionion is on Monday go dowse 6/8, then send two people to get more quintessence and just summon them back. Thanks for everyones comments.
---
Having exta skill increases hit and crit as well as reducing glancing blows. Only works in Pve so you won't see a difference at all in Pvp.
---
Ony looks like shes preparing for her biggest flame breath to be ever seen.
---
Paladin tanks make some sense on ony since she can't be taunted and you've got that new op gbok threat.
---
#nochanges
---
I take pride in and am comfortable with the amount of life this game has taken from me. That being said it does get a little ugly.
---
Well, 18 more days for the Moonthcloth...
---
Agreed. I use SMMH (show me my heal) but it's a weak compromise.
---
No new tricks indeed, I was quite unhappy until I found myself a working Grid2 release. Think I used to play with Pitbull unit frames, so SUF is perhaps a new variation of an old trick at least!
---
Yeah it's not fear that's the problem, mate
---
Ah yeah, mine doesn't do that either. I have an old account that got banned because my credit card expired and I wasn't actively playing (which I kinda think is a bull shit ban reason but whatever). My bnet launcher remembers classic and the new account.
---
TBC had far more subscriptions than Classic or Vanilla ever had. I think it's fair to say TBC was lot more popular than Vanilla. TBC was just a better game. To say TBC is a not good, is like saying WOW sucks in general. If TBC wasn't good, what is? Vanilla for sure isn't better than TBC by any measurement.
---
It's not just pre-BIS, that necklace can last you well into the game, potentially even phase 4.
---
Actually ... it's not.
---
The company that made them bought RSA.. and was subsequently bought by Cisco.
---
Clearly there is. Whether negative or positive is relative to who you ask.
---
Wtf?
---
I got mine at 30 like 2 months ago. No way in hell was I gonna kill it so I got my lv 40 shaman friend to help me. The fucking add is immune to nature dmg so it fucked us both. I had to tank it while he healed me we got it after a while lol.
---
Power Infusion is considered more valuable than Healing Well (?) Light well (?) Whatever it is, I forget. The last talent in Holy. You'll get much more use out of it. 
---
I believe that's what he's saying, as you should be  (at 60 and in my opinion) a good mix of Disc and Holy but you take disc further.
---
I think they just do it because it's a translatable insult.
---
Happened in my guild today. With evidence the offender got a 3 day ban.
---
This is why I am trying to gear for spelladin, not ret. Outside of 3% hit (6% for dwarves or if using an axe) you heavily gear for spellpower which usually has int baked in. This is only really in PVE through, PVP burst is king.
---
I think that'll do lol. Should be nice a cheap
---
Agreed, absolutely loved that event. Amassing enough of an army of scourge to take A'dal down to his invuln point was hilarious.
---
As another poster mentioned, you can't get heal numbers over players with an addon, and I still like seeing the flury of numbers when I holy nova.
---
As a result, I keep the stock combat text on, but then I use an addon called [ShowMeMyHeal](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/showmemyheal) just so I can see what my hits are hitting for.  It shows crit and overheal, too.
---
Getting massive Jojo vibes from this, awesome pic!
---
Why not "Classic WoW" servers with "BC enabled? This action cannot be undone" option?
---
Currently leveling as ret and been mostly grinding/questing. Thinking about respecing holy around 52 and finishing out 60 in dungeons. Any thoughts on this approach? Anything I should keep in mind?
---
Priest I guess
---
Oh for sure yeah, it's a pain to not be DW fury when attacking a single target boss
---
Lmao your gonna get banned a third time for sure, can’t wait to see your post about that when it happens
---
So the cap is 308 and i don't need to have this much weapon skill in daggers ? Because i'm top dpsing with my dagger rogue having only weak daggers and having this +21 (with the MC gauntlet and the HT belt and dagger)
---
Happened to me, Blizzard didn't return my gold, but they did promise that the other player would get a talking to and wouldn't get away with it again.
---
The lake in the middle 100% is a penis
---
I agree
---
Rivenspike is a bit slow though
---
Mid 50s for your first question. You probably aren't going to hold group pulls while leveling.
---
Ah yeah, the healing is comparable to the MC neck. I think that one has sta/int IIRC, so slight upgrade for shamans/paladins.
---
Sure.
---
Exactly
---
You only run the dungeons because you have to get the gear needed to raid and pvp.
---
Once you have the gear after spending a week spamming 3 to 4 dungeons.
---
Theres no need to keep doing them.
---
That's equilivant to leveling. You only level so you can raid and pvp. Once you hit 60 you dont need to do the things that help you level faster
---
That's sad I had to explain this to you.
---
It's supposed to be a high droprate but from my experience the skinner never drops. Odd.
---
There's a big range difference and rogue trinket does not remove sap nor blind.
---
You wont make more money with alchemy. You can make some guaranteed 3-5g per day and if you look into the AH at the correct time you may be able to make some. But it is not worth the expense of leveling.
---
yeah, I can see how that sucks.  Smaller servers don't have this issue though. Maybe the smaller servers are just closer to the original experience.
---
However, I will say that crafting is definitely a lot less lucrative in smaller servers.
---
Thats debatable.
---
&gt; Spending entire evenings running laps around EPL or Winterspring getting perhaps one or two Rich Thorium Veins 
---
Why in Elune's name would you do that when DM is in the game now
---
Yeah blizzards policy around scamming is to remove gains but not return losses.
---
It's bad for tanking with no improved RF or Sanct. It's bad for DPS with no Conviction or Vengeance. I think you need to pick something you want to do and spec for it. 20 points is enough in Holy to raid heal. Divine Favor isn't a must have. You don't really need to solo quest anymore so you would have a much easier time if you build either for tanking, damage, or farming.
---
It doesn’t.  The people saying it does must be using some smart cast addon or something.
---
You know you can set it to remember your computer?
---
&gt;It's painfully obvious to anyone over the age of 12 what the screenshot and tweet is referencing, I'm sorry if some people's brains can't make that connection as quickly as most.
---
It's obvious when it's pointed out this is what they are doing. 
---
Is "The Enclave" a name for KKK (because if it is I have never heard about it). Does the name Horrigan have any significance?
---
The KKK are horrible people for sure, but not everyone will instantly think of them when looking at that screenshot.
---
What class averages 100 dps?
---
I reseted the session a moment before I entered ZF, so the exp/h counter starts from like 5-10 seconds before the video starts. I could also shave off an extra minute or so if I use evocation before the first pull of graves, and my fastest run so far has been around 17 minutes.  Takes 30 seconds to reset the dungeon (log out, reset instance with another account and log back in, automatically takes you to the start of the instance). 
---
Means that 3 runs can easily be done in an hour (without deaths obviously), which will be 120k+ exp/h.
---
What level did you start running brd arena as heals? Tried at 52 with a tank and mage and couldn’t keep them up.
---
List of mats needed is VERY unreliable for some of these guides, seems that nobody bothered to proof read it. For engineering it for some reason lists mats that you craft yourself while following the steps, making you waste money buying copper tubes and whatnot.
---
Horse’s pussy. No, it’s not. I’d gear a top dps before I’d gear a top healer.
---
thats usualy what happends when u get scammed. Unless the its true a bank and they cover the losses.
---
10-25 barrens / ashenvale / stonetalon peak
---
Showmemyheal is actually better in the way that it does show over heals. That’s like a huge part of healing is keeping the over heal at +0 but I agree not seeing the green number over the target is a little sad. I admit this would be a change I would not reee over.
---
Hunters?
---
It does though.
---
Not true. There are some hidden spots still. They just aren't on any guide and no 1 is sharing. Good thing too.
---
F.
---
I mean, at least feral DPS is a lot more competitive on the alliance side (no WF buffing the rogues and not you). I honestly don't know how I would play without the shift&gt;stun&gt;heal&gt;shift combo though.
---
Easy fixable, just kill Nerfarian: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19375/mishundare-circlet-of-the-mind-flayer
---
Still doesnt mean LITERALLY EVERYONE is decent. Mc is ez mode. Half your raid can be nodding out on heroin and you'd still clear it.
---
yeah. i'd instead be playing FF. when my friend first got me interested in WoW, it was between WoW and FF11. back in 05 it was a tough decision, but he ultimately won me over by saying WoW played like diablo. my dumbass believed him, and I started leveling a paladin, thinking I would get to blessed hammers at some point. i'm still mad to this day that I bought his bullshit about it being the same as diablo. glad I started playing, but I could've saved myself the trouble of not wasting months on a paladin.
---
Can the mods please do their jobs and ban this guy from this sub ?
---
&gt; I‘ve read all your comments and what you‘re saying is basically that your guild is playing a suboptimal tactic, 
---
So? We one shot her every time we go.
---
&gt; you afk half the fight and you‘re still always top dps. 
---
No, I don't come top in Ony, the ranged do. I'm top melee DPS, which generally means top DPS overall. Not the case in Ony, I was using that as an example of forward thinking as a rogue.
---
&gt; Then you refuse to provide the necessary proof that your afk tactic puts you ahead of other rogues. (logs)
---
If I did, you'd immediately compare it to rogues in guilds who use different tactics than my guild so what's the point in that? 
---
&gt; I really don‘t mean to start an argument here, but what you‘re doing with your comment is providing new rogues with wrong information that leads to low dps and bad parses.
---
Only if you repeatedly and intentional insist on ignoring the *multiple* times I've clarified my point. Perhaps I shouldn't have used Ony for my example.. oh well, that confusion should be long gone.
---
&gt; There is absolutely no reason for you to pop cds in p1 and then afk in p2.
---
Raid leader wants to use that strat, end of discussion. I've led many *many* raids and I never gave a shit what you DPS was, if you can't follow directions then get out.
---
&gt; I guarantee you, if you would actually upload logs, you‘d be surprised how low your parses end up compared to other rogues who don‘t afk half the fight.
---
You think I'd be surprised other rogues do more damage in a fight where they attack in a phase I don't? Hrm. No. I don't think I would.
---
&gt; however, please please please don‘t tell new players to do this if they want to max out their dps. It‘s completely wrong and just an example of inexperience.
---
**PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD READ THE EDIT AND THE OTHER MANY TIMES I HAVE CLARIFIED THIS EXACT POINT.**

I'm sorry but at this point if you've read everything I've said you can only be missing the point with wilful ignorance.
---
A 40 year old man "RPing" a racist, toxic asshole? Pretending what he does is OK because "people do worse stuff IRL" is a terrible excuse. Racism is racism, being shitty is being shitty. Ban that loser and let's all move on, you're the one choosing to fight on his side.

I guess as long as you know you're username/ID you can always reset your password if you need it. I forgot Blizzard enabled auto-login, I've had it disabled for so many years.

You can *easily* douse Garr and Magmadar rune from stealth, even with all the respawned adds.
---
Also, there are only 7 runes that need to be doused, not 8. Lucifron doesn't have a rune.
---
If you are healing you want +healing&gt;int&gt;crit&gt;mp5
---
If you are tanking you want def&gt;stam&gt;int
---
If you are DPS you want either hit&gt;str&gt;crit  for normal AP or +spell damage if you are doing spelladin build.
---
You sound like you play a mage
---
Are you saying certain specs should allow you to roll on every piece of gear that fits your spec? Because that is utter BS. I addressed this in a different reply, CBA writing it out again so Ctrl C+V:
---
"If he (Druid joining as tank) is there for healing gear he should say so beforehand so the healer knows and doesn't waste 1 hour in that group - and having a hybrid spec should not (does not) entitle you to roll on every possible piece of loot: it should be based on what role you perform in the group. I could spec 17/17/17 derpspec on my shaman and claim that more or less everything is for my MS, but it still would be bad manners and BS. Direct quote of my other post:
---
This thing called loot etiquette that once existed but apparently is not respected anymore. If you join as one role, you should stick to that. If you want OS gear that a dude playing another role doesn't need, sure go ahead, but **it's absolute BS to grab the one single piece of gear that the healer is there for when you join as a different spec**. If you want that particular healing piece, join as freaking healer, not tank. I could go on, but I doubt that you will see eye to eye with me on this point, given that you make this question in the first place."
---
I am happy to heal a dungeon and have the tank / sPriest / hybrid DPS grab all the healing pieces I don't need or already have for their offspec, as long as we've discussed things beforehand and they have the decency to pass on the 1-2 pieces I came there for. However, if they will outright need on every healing piece, including the one I am running a dungeon for for the n:th time, there is literally 0 incentive for me joining that group. At that stage I am nothing but an essentially unpaid carry.
---
I mean I have a 3 button rotation. BT&gt;WW&gt;HS over 55 Rage.
---
Well, in case you didn't realize - you don't have to do the "daily checklist" every single day. They release catch up mechanics *every patch,* &amp; doing actual content gears you past the "daily checklist" gear any fucking day.
---
That feeling of "busy work" is created in your mind. You don't have to log in every day. You don't have to have the same gear as everyone else. You feeling insecure against other player's gear is your own problem.

I went holy at 55 and did BRD a few dozen times. Questing solo is horrible but I got MC/Ony attuned by 58 and had 2 piece T1 and T2 helm at 59. That made anticipation to 60 higher and it seemed quick.
---
Roll Prot. Enter dungeon. Leave at 60. 😂

Look at this fancy guy having an alt already!

I would always be wary of p-server data. And there are a few issues with the guide that I found with a quick glance:
---
* The links to the specs seem to be dead
---
* He basically says to go for 310 weapon skill, but 308 is what you need at most.
---
* He says that the minimum hit you need is 8%, but it's 6% with 305 weapon skill or 9% with 300 weapon skill
---
* The pre-raid BiS list is not up-to-date, 6 piece T0 is what you want to go for.
---
No, that's stupid. Do you tell the arms warrior tanking your dungeon he can't roll on 2handed weapons or gear woth offensive stats because he's the tank? No. This isn't any different. 
---
Just because someone is tanking a dungeon for you doesn't mean that is their main spec and all they ever do is tank and the only gear they want is tank stuff. They are tanking because tanks are a necessity, not because they want to get tank gear.
---
Because every one needs gold. I have no way of knowing if that person will equip it. I have no way of knowing that a random person will roll need when everyone greeds.
---
Play in your delusional world were everyone is nice to each other and keep coming to Reddit complaining when you get skrewed.
---
Now you can reroll gnome.
---
I literally get 120k+ exp/h using this method. There's no need to run out as I log out and reset the instance with another account, it automatically teleports me to the start of a reseted instance.  Also why are you adding running back in and preparing for pull? It's already counted in the 19min46s run.
---
I dunno, I wish alliance had more quests in Hillsbrad at 20 instead of the 30's. Every ally rolling through hillsbrad is in their 30's while most of the hordies are in the early-mid 20's. It's the one zone I feel is a bit biased in this regard.
---
Depends on your spec I'd say. If you put some points into ret for SoC you won't get slowed down too bad killing mobs on your own.
---
Maybe, but at that point just head over to the auction house and even a level 50s green is an upgrade.
---
Check out world of paladincraft 3 on YouTube. Home boy does exactly this.
---
But he did contribute the most didn't he? Sounds like people just going their separate ways. Some people want to play more, some people don't want to. They're just playing with like-minded people.
---
&gt;Should have just made his own guild from the start instead of pledging to a guild then splitting it after.
---
'pledging to a guild' lmao a guild is not a cult. No need to make it seem like he betrayed and fucked over everyone when he was doing most of the work. Sounds like you're just bitter.
---
Most hybrids do whatever role gets the group going ;) And I include warriors in that, many of whom will tank or dps as needed
---
IIRC Deep Wounds will deal more damage too  since it looks at the average amount of damage of the weapon equipped in your main hand.
---
As a warrior with eye, it gets replaced well before naxx. Sword spec is just too strong. Ashkandhi slightly less damage, way more Stam and ap, and is a sword. Definitely better. Especially horde side with wf.
---
It's just a cool weapon to have and none of our shamans wanted to make it.
---
Money in all forms is the root of all evil
---
Spirit is a wasted stat for any paladin build. Your mana sustain is going to come from MP5 and either seal/judge of wis if you are tanking or crit if you are healing.
---
“If everything smells like shit, guess what?”
---
you didn't though. which is even funnier.
---
Yeah but why would they do that? It would have been simple to add the new honor system in vanilla over the old too but they didn’t. They want these experiences to stay the same. If vanilla had came out with any significant difference to the game other than patch differences I’d say there was a chance. But since it didn’t there’s not. If we get TBC we’re getting flying.
---
I had an arcanite sword recipe I have to my guildie when he got to 300 sword smithing as a congrats. He said it was one of the best recipes for him but are the others just not in game yet?
---
Oh boy.
---
It took me two dozen runs just to see a Finkles Skinner. We tend to keep UBRS as guild runs, because it’s such a time sync, we like to make sure the look goes where it’s supposed to.

Icy-veins rogue BiS sucks so hard... Why 0 t0 pieces? They're REALLY good with 6 parts and combat dagger build....
---
I followed the enchanting and the alchemy guide and they went smoothly. Thanks for pointing that out for engineering guide though :)
---
not really? that's literally how technology works.
---
wat as heal u cant do some insane good dps in dungeons as cat and as boomkin u can do good ofheal and have a talent to taunt mobs etc...  also u can go bear to soke some mechanics
---
Remember the quicker the kill the higher DPS you will have because of cooldowns. So the guilds that have 700 avg dps on bosses have a very good grp with alot of burst. So their fights are short, giving them that dps.
---
I was just - smartassingly - correcting you labeling healing as an offspec for HotW/NS. Its a healing spec, that can tank dungeons and probably most of MC and ony. Its also a tank spec, that can heal everything phase 1.
---
You would have just wasted it on something else. TV or another game. 
---
Ultimately, we all end up in the grave, the exact same amount of dead. So don't sweat it too much unless you're unhappy.
---
Let me guess, stalagg?
---
Same,but reversed 🤣🤣🤣
---
Like Holy Nova with the green appearing over players heads just like the yellow text does? If that's what you mean then that is impossible for an add-on to simulate.
---
It gets way easier after 55. I ran DM East a lot with some lvl 60 buddies first for some of the caster gear there, and it made going back to brd as lvl 56 or so a lot nicer.
---
What... it takes maybe 7 days played to hit 60 if you just quest casually and sprinkle some dungeons every few levels.
---
No priests' mind soothe does what you're describing for humanoid targets. Druids have a similar spell for beasts.
---
Maybe it's 12 hours after it's killed, 15 if it's despawned
---
&gt;since I in the future I might perhaps reroll and use those
---
But they don't even need to respec? Hardly anyone brings ferals to a raid, chances are he heals for raids not tanks... It's barely even an OS roll in this case.
---
Huh, seems like some dead links indeed - had this saved in a document and haven't used it for quite some time. Cheers for checking, edited OP.
---
Horde start questing in hillsbrad at 22 with the elixir quests and the syndicate quests. there's like 4-5 at that level and the round after that is all 24 quests you do right after. Most horde will be there from 21/22-25/26 and then come back later to finish up the battle for hillsbrad quest line.
---
Nope! Escapism is the symptom, not the cause!
---
How the druid should have handled it: “Hey, I’m a druid. That means nobody will want me as a raid tank, so I want that necklace for my main raid roll just like everyone else who raid heals.” 
---
Then when the group healer says no, he just doesn’t tank for that group. He can find another group and complete the run, then ask again because they’re probably still looking for a tank.
---
Mirahs song attacks faster so I think that’s why it is considered better for tanking.
---
Oh for sure. It's when the first painful levels all become worth it.
---
I typed "Hello World!" in World chat on  my first day of playing classic and have been banned ever since.
---
Hey main us shadow priests have to swap back and forth between Mind Blast AND Mind Flay WHILE we keep SW:Pain up. That's like, 3 whole spells or something we have to rotate through if you do the math.
---
Not in raids. No corruption for u!
---
Vendoring and using TSM to buy items is probably faster since you'll vendor junk and go to AH regardless
---
What happens with COD trash and "OPEN ALL" function?
---
Best to make friends with a tank and or guild and roll that way. 
---
As a tank, I have 3-4 healers On flist and I just post in Flist comment, running xxxx. Normally one of them will answer and were off to the races.
---
it's because ownership reverts to the character with the lowest ID. Which is the earliest character made. I suspect you were quick to get 'Ragnaros' claimed.
---
Maltezer shitzu? Some kind of chocolate dog?
---
weird flex but ok
---
On a wep with 3.40 seconds or more which you should be using it’s only 2 hits. The price of SoC and judgement are increased by spell power while also consecration which should always be up
---
True, only Titans is really required on main tank in naxx
---
Well I hope things turn around for you OP. The game will always be here! And at least you hit 60 :)
---
So I have pretty good holy paladin gear azure, judgement, 3 piece law bringers(know that isn't healer stuff but pretains to question). I'm power leveling 4 friends through content and want to know, does redoubt ever proc? I mean I see I'm blocking but never proc? I went 11/21/19 for improved ret aura, sanc, and conc for most effective aoe dmg.  In these lower dungeons I feel like I'm not getting the full effect of my aoe spec with the exception of my ret aura, any thoughts on dungeon grinding as prot up until zf? Thanks in advance. (Not defense capped not even close, shield is kind of bad(dm one) and wondering if there is something I can do to improve my speed. Currently average 12 mins in stocks but I can't pull more than one entire lane at a time without the mages help. :(
---
Does it show expected heals as well?
---
check out /r/hiddenwow/ pretty cool stuff, the sub is a mix of botch classic and retail though so you'll have to filter through.
---
Wouldn’t that get old?
---
Don’t get me wrong I love Classic, haven’t played retail in years, but the content would dry up if nothing is done additionally to what is planned. 
---
What they have planned will last the average gamer a couple of years at best, forever though?
---
The pattern is still going for around 200g on my server unfortunately
---
What am I looking at?
---
So many 60 war/rogue dps that need anger/arena so no one will take a 54 unless you decide to tank it, then just do a arena/anger/golem run and should be easy enough
---
It’s a reference man.... big whoosh.
---
Had the same happen to me yesterday, even with reoccurring sub. Logged to my account, showed active, logged back in straight away. Very odd
---
I'd go with Satyr's, hit is devalued but I think 1% hit will still be better than 8 AP and .28% crit
---
 *What are you talking about?*
---
Exactly this, I even started studying just to have normal working hours someday to be able to raid.
---
Imagine having the mentality that you shouldn't ever have to roll for good loot and it should just be given to you uncontested. Go back to retail if that's what you want. 
---
Personal loot means nobody else can "steal" *your* item, and you won't get loot outside of your chosen loot specialization. Sounds like exactly what you want.
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
Samesame but I play a mage so I'm already motivated to dump mana then drink for free.
---
I also work from home so I've always got spreadsheets and extra tabs open and I have to be responsive to my works' group chat.
---
It's kinda made me a master of identifying safe afk spaces inside dangerous camps.
---
I also don't care about rest xp because of this, I'll just log out at Scarlet Monastery and log back in there the next day just because the trip there as Alliance is very long.  The amount of xp I get by not travelling makes up for not spending 1 night in the inn for 2 bars of rest.
---
Perhaps it's just the people I group with but I get asked about Kings a lot and have had several people tell me it's better for them than wisdom or might. And well as for the ret talents you may we right but this build is about aoe pulling and survivability outside of dungeons and providing, limited, damage while providing what I feel was the most relevant talents for healing
---
Ouch
---
Multi-shot is part of hunter raid DPS rotation. There's what like 1 fight in MC where you might hit a sheep with multishot. Where you getting your info?
---
Your game time renewed, It d/c's you when the payment processes. It happens to a few people, including me last week, you probably got an email around the time you got kicked with a thank your for payment.
---
I've chosen poor wording talking about MS/OS as the hybrid spec you are referring to exists, that one is on me.
---
The point I am trying to make (and made in several other posts that you probably missed) is that you should roll on gear for the role you are fulfilling in the group. And if you are joining the group as a tank but are after healing gear, you should be very clear about it from the very start and come to an agreement with the group and, first and foremost, the healer. 
---
I am happy to heal a dungeon and have the tank / sPriest / hybrid DPS grab all the healing pieces I don't need or already have for when they will be healing, as long as we've discussed things beforehand and they have the decency to pass on the 1-2 pieces I came there for. However, if they will outright need on every healing piece, including the one I am running a dungeon for for the n:th time, there is literally 0 incentive for me joining that group. At that stage I am nothing but an essentially unpaid carry. 
---
If the Druid joining as a tank doesn't tell this from the start of the dungeon a healer has little to no chance of knowing that he might roll on healing gear; people can't read other peoples' minds, generally speaking. Communicating these things is very important, otherwise the healer is better off finding another group, or the group is better off finding another tank.
---
I loved Hyjal because it really felt like playing an RTS in MMO form, more than anything wow has ever done. And as a warlock spamming seed of corruption on all the trash and seeing all the numbers flying was a lot of fun. It was a unique experience that i'd love to see more content in that same vein.
---
when they release TBC they obviously also release some new classic vanilla servers.
---
Anyone told this guy to run for new PM in the UK yet?!
---
If you care about making gold, herbalism is going to be more profitable than alchemy unless you spend most of your time sitting in IF waiting for dungeon groups or running herb-free dungeons.
---
herbs sell pretty quickly for about 85-110% of the cost of the potions they make, you only really make money by buying herbs low and selling potions right before raid times, whereas you always make good profit off herbs. herb + mining is even better since you can run around and profit
---
There are only enough debuff slots typically for one or two corruptions if you want to optimize DPS for the entire raid. 
---
If you have a 4-7 warlocks and you're all using corruption you're popping off other debuffs that matter way more.
---
What I'm hearing is that resilience didn't ruin PVP, the way blizzard implemented it's itemization ruined PVP.
---
The concept of arena and resilience are great if you do it right. Scale back resilience and arena rewards(or change them to something different) and I think everyone is happy.
---
If you are still leveling and not interested in tanking you should be full ret, maybe 11 points into holy if you want consecrate. 5 mans up to the first half of BRD can be easily healed as Ret spec if you keep a set of int gear with you. And you would kill mobs much faster when soloing.
---
Well they could. But that certainly wouldn't be in spirit with #nochanges.
---
For the dungeons, 53 is the lower end for BRD but it is doable. I would not run any BRS until atleast 55+.
---
I have a guild with a few close friends and we don't often have an opportunity to actually 4 or 5 man anything. Many times I am limited to playing solo
---
I agree they should totally pull a Runescape. But let's be realistic here, adding content to Runescape is a\_lot\_ easier than adding content to WoW. Even classic WoW.
---
Activision is not going to spend tons of money on wow classic if they've got a timeline of content already completely laid out and ready to go.
---
There won't be 5man dungeons dropping loot equivalent to the previous raid tier. Sure, a couple of pieces might have a niché here and there, but not baseline.
---
On the fact you bring up raiding more than pvp, I'm going to assume raiding &gt; pvp for your priorities. 
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/51503100501--53230051200315](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/51503100501--53230051200315)
---
You miss some nice ret pvp talents, repentance, eye for an eye, and you miss the prot talent's for more melee hit, improved BOP and BOF, which is massive for PVP. 
---
You can move some points in the ret tree to get vindication as it is 1 extra debuff that you get to put on a PVP target which is dispel protection for your teammates on more important spells. It's not considered an amazing raid talent but some guilds don't mind it as it's just another damage reduction debuff, just not as strong as improved demo shout from warriors.
---
With this spec you get the best holy talents. Again you can gimp your damage if you give up 10% strength to get 10% int. But that will be your call.
---
Only item I disagree with there is the dagger on an orc. You won’t be threat capping your raid in phase 1 with an annihilator and if you somehow are just go fury prot with 2 axes instead of stealing a dagger from rogues or another non orc tank.
---
Id say lvl 54 min. before you go BRD, you get new rank of SS and Garrote at 54.
---
Lifeforce dagger is pretty good at your level if you want to switch.
---
If you want those bigger backstabs though, The Shadowfoot Stabber could provide that and should be plenty off them on AH.
---
Also watch out for people selling bulk runecloth. Had a guy say he'd give me 10 stacks for 10g 10s, I was out in a dungeon so I asked him to COD them to me and he send them as 10g 10s PER STACK! Almost clicked the first one and would have been out.
---
You're lacking Improved Righteous Fury for tanking, Blessing of Sanctuary for farming and Vengeance and Two-Hand Spec. for DPS.
---
While your talents are probably enough to do BRD anything higher will see you lacking without raid tier gear.
---
Obviously you can't fill all trees but usually you can make up with gear and consumables what you're lacking in talent trees. In my experience Holy is the easiest talent tree that can be completely ignored except for Consecration with sufficient healing gear while the other talents are not that easy to circumvent. DPS and Ret is by far the hardest as most DPS talents are deep down and they stack multiplicative instead of additive. Paladin tanking is in a difficult spot. You'll absolutely need consecration and Improved RF. Everything else gives you options or allows you more lenience in gear choices. 
---
At the beginning I would say pick two trees if you want to be a hybrid and later pick something with consecration and at least 30pts ret.
---
Not to mention a pretty big change for a game which wants to adhere to #nochanges.
---
as others have already said, the most important part is making your own groups. not tanks are the rarest, but people who can be arsed to actually put a group together. i do this as a DD and have decent success
---
This is one of my favorite posts since the office memes pre-release date announcement.
---
Same!
---
Do you have any data on T0 being better than the regular pre raid bis? I've usually found out it works better than T0
---
The audacity of a healer, in a 5 man group (typically consisting of 1 healer, 1 tank and 3 DPS) to feel as if he's entitled to being the person rolling on and receiving healing gear that are upgrades for him - astonishing!
---
But no, a druid getting to roll on both healing gear, tanking gear and some DPS leather for good measure sounds perfectly fine. You are the one who should scuttle off back to retail, if you think you are entitled to 2-3 different roles worth of loot. 
---
Ignored so I don't need to listen to more of your hubris.
---
I always use battle net, i am too lazy to type my password....
---
3g for the recipe on my server it's crazy
---
Tbh I'm not sure how it would be okay to heal in ret I'm mostly int gear now and spamming FoL and Holy Light sometimes still aren't enough. So how I would do it with less mana and less effective healing is beyond me
---
This has to be a troll post
---
I play stonespine EU too
---
We have done a few player counts in the past week mainly using /who and counting all the 60s
---
It comes out to about 35% alliance 65% horde
---
The server is going to be a mess when p2 hits and pvp starts
---
Horde are already whining on discord about the lack of p2p but they only have themselves to blame.
---
Balance between the races would make the game fun but that is too much foresight for the average horde mouthbreather
---
The BiS wand drops in Scholomance, not Stratholme
---
Can’t. Blizz would get sued for making a “Kung Fu Panda Expansion”.
---
Akama, you duplicitous slut!
---
Comedy is dead and this post is proof
---
The enchanting guide is fine, since you waste enchants on yourself anyways so the lowest mat cost matters, but guides with sellables like: alchemy, tailoring, blacksmithing, and leatherworking are all pretty bad in terms of what to make with some issues with expected mats too
---
whats the point of hiding UI when that stupid ass UI-hidden-notification ruins the pic?
---
Thanks man :)
---
I've got a Lord Alexanders for sale right now, 20g at level 51 and makes WW look like a toy.
---
You missed my point completely and gave me a massive chuckle.  My guild, and I'm guessing most guilds, dont give a fuck as long as you are doing your job and clearing content.  We 1 shot every boss and 2 shot rag.   That said, three priests have true faith and I beat them every fight and do much better with mana management.
---
Honestly, this content is fucking old and easy.  What kind of guild is still looking at shit like that lol?  I'd leave that nerdy ass guild and join a casual one.  Clearing at the same pace, so who cares.
---
No sorry, not playing Rogue this time around. Just linked a source that I found useful way back when I did.
---
Me too! I was soo confused
---
Don't think elvui is capable of that. Don't think it can check player level. Can't think of any addon that can.  Will have to check now.
---
It’s November my dude, where are you pulling half of what you’re saying in your comment? Nowhere did I mention anything about September. If anything I agreed with you. 
---
&gt; If you think hitting 60 within a few weeks is not hardcore you need to check yourself.
---
I literally said the exact opposite in my post. Is half this player base senile or do video games actually rot people’s brains?
---
You’re actually going to claim that a desire to level 10 different characters to level 60 without doing end game content doesn’t put someone in the minority? Check yourself bud
---
After some googling, I found that It is a Fallout Reference
---
Frank Horrigan is the final boss of Fallout 2, and he is part of The Enclave. 
---
Back in the early 2000s there was a character named Horrigan and he lead a guild named "The Enclave" who were known racists. Urban Dictionary has a page on him.
---
It seems this character is a reference to that Horrigan. Blizz should probably just ban that name tbh.
---
It's really funny how fast people are OK with changing a fundamental part of Vanilla and WoW in general just because of this one Addon.
---
Look at every thread in here about people complaining that a dungeon tank took "their" loot. 
---
Now realize that most tanks are NOT raid tanks due to a much lower ratio of tanks:heals:dps needed, and most people tanking dungeons are using an offspec to do so.
---
Everyone wants a tank. Nobody wants to let them roll on the gear they need for their actual spec. Now why would you want to subject yourself to the added stress of tanking when you get a bunch of ungrateful dicks raging that you ninja'd an item you need for your main spec?
---
There's no surprise there's a shortage of tanks, it's a stressful and thankless job.
---
I hope you’re right. It dropped as low as 150~ last week. Two are up today for 165~. It’s not dropping thus far.
---
I have a full paladin tanking BIS list(even for raid tanking), and it's full deathbone. Deathbone was literally designed for paladin tanks. The only thing it's missing is strength, but paladin tanks don't really need that, since our threat comes from spells, not hits.

Titan panel will reset the session every time you relog, and I need to relog for each reset. What I'm showing here is that if you do exactly as I did for 3 consecutive runs, you will get 120k+ exp/h. Obviously if you die then it will be less.   
---
For this specific run I reseted the timer before even entering the dungeon (meaning that there is some additional time counted in the exp/h calculation), as I just came back from clearing my inventory &amp; repairing in Tanaris (you can see I have Resurrection Sickness at the start as I ressed myself next to Tanaris).
---
Any add-ons that show you when your blessings wear off? Apparently I'm a moron and can't get weakauras to do so.
---
Has never been the case in any MMORPG ever, not sure why classic would be any different.
---
No it comes from big numbers. My favorite thing as a holy paladin in WotLK was judging light on the boss and watching my screen fill with green.
---
Yeah, cause even though I actually know my login information (I checked outside the game, and I did in fact enter the correct information) it always tells me I entered something wrong
---
Yeah the crit batch abuse sways me towards 30/0/21 more than EM
---
&gt; Why should an entire guild drop its entire bank on making a PvP weapon for 1 player?
---
Because the mats alone is 10k+ gold? Also every guild is keeping the ingots for stuff like this.
---
Your right it’s just easier for me to tell the group I’m a ret paladin since ret is seen as the dps role for pallys
---
Any build you do whether it’s tank, healer or damage dealer you still have the ability to perform all roles.
---
Sounds like a real loser, sure.  But I don't think he should be banned.  Too many soft betas in classic think they have the right to tell others what to think and how to be.  They should shut the Hell up and just worry about their own lives.
---
The highest damage for Ret is the spelladin build where you stack spell damage and use a fast weapon and seal of righteousness.
---
A portion of territory surrounded by a larger territory **whose inhabitants are culturally or ethnically distinct**. 
---
A poster below mentioned Fallout, an organisation that "adopted a policy deeming it the sole remaining bastion of "pure," mutation-free humanity on Earth"
---
Doesn't take much to connect the dots here.
---
Just let people play the way they want to play man. You’re just as bad as the people saying everyone are noobs if they’re not full bis.
---
Is it any good? Speed isn't great, no stats, proc is okay but 3 seconds of crit looks a lot better than it is.
---
Turn on advanced combat logging in your settings. run /combatlog before the raid to log everything.  Optionally upload it all to [warcraftlogs.com](https://warcraftlogs.com) afterwards for all to see.
---
You will be able to see who's casting the garbage buffs.
---
farmlog might do something similar.
---
it records every drop you get in a certain timeframe and what npc it dropped from.
---
you can also set the addon to create a session for each instance. the session then switches to the correct one when you join the dungeon.
---
so you might see something like:
---
&gt;Balnazzar:  
---
&gt;item1 3x  
---
&gt;item2 20x  
---
&gt;Star of Mystaria 1x
---
youll have to calculate the droprate yourself but its still a nice addon to have imo :).
---
thanks u/bov1ne &lt;3
---
If you can call having zero stamina gear on a counter...
---
A pvp geared mage isn't gonna die that easily or fast.
---
Woot faster travel speed!
---
Thank you, fixed that.
---
Til you get to AQ and you're expected to clear MC/BWL in one night. Is your casual guild gonna raid 4 nights a week? Probably not. Goodluck in the future buddy.
---
You can start doing arena/anger runs at 53 as a rogue. provided you know when to stealth so you dont pull mobs by accident. Generally I wouldn't take anyone lower than 54-55 but rogues are the exception.
---
Completely disagree man. Overpower us your best ability until level 36 so you want to go arms and open with rand and sunder to trigger dodges and land an overpower with deepwounds. Also, warriors are pretty much unplayable without 3 points in tactical mastery.
---
Pally power is a good one
---
Thunderfury?
---
Is the 6 piece tier 0 only better for combat/SF dagger rogues or does it extend to swords as well? I know a few rogues in our guild use it and swear by it but nearly every list I look at has it ranked below other other gear.
---
Ret palas? (exaggerated obviously)
---
margin = math.random()
---
Jelly! Goodjob
---
Looks like a lot of people in the anglosphere is taking offence every person in the world doesn't think of KKK when they see a dude in white robes. My first thought was a priest...
---
Horrigan doesn't mean anything to me, and I had to Google what on earth Charlottesville is. And why anyone's skintone should matter is also not obvious (referencing the two kneeling characters).
---
After reading the comments here I obviously understand what's going on here, and that is not ok. But yeah, this appeared to be a completely normal picture to me at first glance.
---
"LF Jump run partner(s), split loot, 4+ runs/hour"
---
If you have "an entire evening" to run around and get two nodes, you can spend that time finding people to jump with. You need 2/3 people for jump runs.
---
No Cata? But Mop? Hell no.
---
hes a clicker too.
---
People got triggered by anything. Dude RPing kkk? Whatever, getting back to farming.
---
Looking for some input and thought it would be best to come to you first - anyone notice DM tribute changes in the last day?  It's possible I just had a VERY bad morning but here's what I experienced this morning:
---
1) Yesterday I was able to complete 4 tribute runs in \~80 minutes, this morning with more time I got ZERO done.
---
2) Pats in the key room seemed much more active? I was able to get through it everytime but it took me a lot longer.
---
3) The packs going up the ramp on the right side before you blow up the door were aggroing onto me.  In the past, I would just hug left wall and pull back the two mobs on the door and blow up the door.  
---
4) My FD was getting resisted A LOT more - by mobs on the way to tribute AND by king gordosh+add boss 
---
Did I just have a really bad morning or have there been subtle changes made to make this gold inneficient? 
---
Personally I'm just doing it for 2x Tarnished Ring + Barb blade.  the only thing I need left is my 2nd ring I've done \~12 runs.  For me, I prefer to farm in the open world but trying to get this last ring done!
---
Because it's far from easy to 2 man it and not everyone is bis with the perfect class combo.
---
m8, the guy is a clicker.
---
Get that MOP shit out of here.
---
I told myself this as well back then but managed to kick my mmorp addiction around 2008 anyway. I kinda turned my life around and used all this extra time to become a pro artist. Now with that under my belt I'm actually enjoying WoW a lot more because I don't have this constant lingering feeling in the back of my head, that rightfully told me that I'm wasting my potential being addicted to this game. 
---
Yes, we'll all die someday and if you're truly content playing WoW all day instead of finding what others would call "balance", more power to you. If however you're a bit more like me, maybe consider quitting mmorpgs.
---
I'm not using a smart cast addon, but mine seems to be doing it. Only from my bars though, from the spellbook it won't.
---
I don't think Classic+ will happen but I think people want it to happen because they want new content that still maintains the feel of how the game used to be. I think we are more likely to see retail slowly start to move back towards systems people liked in the past than see Blizzard creating new content for both versions of Wow.
---
I want classic + because it’s basically takes the bad out of TBC and keeps the good. Like fuck flying mounts, fuck Outland, let’s just uncover the zones we have already that we can’t enter. Let’s use TBC spec optimization.
---
Google a down rank calculator and plug in your stats.  It will tell you which heal is most efficient.  Using that as a base you have to use your judgement on when you need to be less efficient for more throughput
---
That's why you only level mage as an farm alt.
---
r/relatable
---
i dont understand this. isnt it basically the same for all other classes?
---
You should be able to heal any dungeon with just regular Heal.
---
Flash Heal is for idiots and healing meter snipers.
---
It's been said but, this is normal now. The old days of getting insta queues as a healer are behind us now, the simple fact of the matter is that a healer perhaps even in less demand than a DPS is in some cases. 
---
I recently saw some census data for WoW Classic that showed roughly 10% of people maining a tank, 30% maining a healer, and 60% maining a dps. If that's true that means that you may have better odds of getting into a group as a dps than as a healer given the 1/1/3 ratio parties comprise of. Personally speaking at this point, that would be consistent with what I see on my server. 
---
Healers feel almost like a dime a dozen, and it's probably because healing is really fun and very satisfying, I can't blame people for doing it at all.
---
You simply never see it in this version of the game. In early vanilla you typically called a wipe if you got a *second* sons phase, being able to manage the first was mandatory and the hard part of the encounter.
---
Classic fights already have very few mechanics and being able to ignore some more simply because every single class is a lot stronger than it should be at this point of the game is kind of sad. But it is also not something blizzard could change without doing more harm than good, so that is probably the reason people don't really talk about it.
---
I'm on a PVE server (haven't got time for world PVP lol) so I could swap imp kick and imp sprint?
---
Yeah that makes sense I was seeing it go for 250g+ on the first few weeks on my server but its PVE so its obviously going to be easier to farm without horde being able to kill you for it.
---
Good is different tastes, browse [wago.io](https://wago.io) find you you like and try it out. I usually start with someones then completely change it around to my liking. I do use the same basic setup for all of my classes, but my raid frames change between specs i.e. healing frames are in the middle below my hp bar, dps they are to the left and smaller.
---
Oh, didnt know that existed.. Thanks!
---
Not a terrible price though
---
This is the wow classic sub not cry because blizzard won't refund a game you played sub.
---
10 days ago
---
Why would u refund best game of The year
---
I hate Ret. I just love to be a frustrating healing juggernaut. 33/18/0 spec as silence is our other weakness.
---
I mean, I don't condone playing 8+ hours a day, but that's a requirement to get that mace in relevant time. We have one enhance shaman in our guild who is cool af'. We all understand that if/when he gets the eye he isn't getting the mace for monnnttthhhsss. But that's just his end goal really.
---
Western culture is obsessed with the concept of being happy. Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.
---
Using flash heal is your problem. Even low rank will make you oom fast. You have to understand there are more healers then you in raid. You don't have to race to every raid member to heal. If you expect big damage to come flash heal. But most of the time you can use normal heal rank 4 whitout going oom. I always use normal heal and still top the meters becaus other healers are going oom very fast like you becaus spamming flash heal.
---
Can confirm it still works, did it yesterday.
---
righteous Orb. They couldn't even capitalize the R in righteous, they are just learning, provide them feed back.
---
Your raid leader is an idiot.
---
50% of this game is putting together a spec and gear set man. Now you just sound angry for no reason lol
---
Until the mana runs out, then you have to wand rotation until you can cast again.  All while mages are still half mana with evocation still up.
---
How?
---
What sort of bootleg keyboard are you using
---
&gt; Yeah but why would they do that?
---
Because it seems like a *lot* of people playing Classic do not want flying.
---
Early Cata was when subscriptions peaked.
---
Some were resists, but to make it even a little better, the cone of cold range extends slightly with jumping. If you jump with CoC there’s less chance of missing a mob in the back due to range. Just FYI. It ain’t much but it’s something.
---
What are we seeing? There are nelf/highborne ruins all over northern/western kalimdor
---
I play slay the spire when I have to run across the map for some reason or during flight points.
---
I guess you should probably go deeper into prot and get Holy Shield. Thats at least what most of the guides say. And of course using a shield spike is mandatory, if you don't already use one. Also, in case u did, I wouldn't specc Deflection in the ret tree.
---
Any tips for Dagger Rogue?
---
Reported.
---
Someone who just graduated hopefully won't spend enough time unemployed to be considered the guild NEET.
---
NEET normally refers to people who aren't looking for work and instead make a lifestyle out of it.
---
Did you not read?  That's exactly what I was saying when some dude started whining about OP not having Truefaith.  
---
This stuff is not serious or challenging so trying to demand people dedicate hours and hours is silly.
---
Wrong sub.
---
Everything up to 5 levels lower will still give 100% exp, and I think it goes down 20% exp per level after that down to 10% at 10 levels below. So generally as long as you're within 6 or so levels of the quests you're doing its definitely worth doing them as they're likely going to be much faster to finish.
---
 I always try to dungeon every 10 or so levels so i'm consistently 2-3 levels above the zone i'm going to. makes everything nice and smooth. The more you start dying the less likely you are to keep playing that character and trying to level.
---
It's not even out yet. Thought it would be ok to post here. And laughing, not crying.
---
FYI BWL doesn’t come out until phase 3
---
This got my friend banned back in vanilla.
---
As a warlock.. tel me more about this.
---
It might be easy to find a tank for strat live on your server, not on mine. Most tanks are off running DM, LBRS, UBRS, Strat UD etc. I get whispers and see groups looking for tanks for live every night.
---
I'm level 36 undead rogue. How ill advised would it be to just keep running any of the SM iterations until I'm, say, level 40? Seems like I can always get a group real quick. I've not done the Cathedral yet so still have the quest to kill the two dudes in there, but I don't mind running any of them cos they're all fairly straight forward and the xp, gold and loot is okay.
---
Or should I go quest in Desolace? Not been there yet.
---
Yep, keeping your wand relevant is the only thing you have to worry about.
---
yeah. the Pservers crowd are a special breed of people who somehow enjoy repeating the same stuff over and over and over and over with 0 new challenge, 0 surprise...
---
why? how? who knows. But this is clearly not addressed to the fringe case of people who spent the last 15 years repeating the same stuff and still somehow enjoy it.
---
Sometimes his pat in that spot is to far and you have to sit there for a while. I started walking to the door and /target jed. The door was way better, but I am able to mind soothe and fear to get out.
---
Until you're 40 and realize you might wanna live a longer, healthier life for your children.
---
The former as I explained on the comment
---
It’s an off-hand for a fury prot warrior so it’s not like you have a lot of insane choices to go with. You basically just get a mini-recklessness which any warrior knows is pretty insane for threat, if you compare it to other offhands it’s good, not sure of the math though.
---
Thank you
---
When you send years being miserable happiness sounds devine
---
Yeah, that's one of the weapons that just really makes you scratch your head. Maybe ret? I guess?
---
Yeah I feel like we are going to run into that same issue regarding competition on the any primetime timeslots. 
---
The small core of 60s I do have would like to raid Tuesday Wednesday ideally, but we've been having to do our pugs before reset usually.
---
I agree 100% as well that recruiting in trade/general/lfg is pretty low yeild. 
---
I guess the plan for now is to just continue to host pugs and try to recruit from there by showing the core group are good people to play with.
---
You can get into BRD arena runs and maybe Angerforge runs. Neither of those give any decent XP though. If you get lucky though you can get into a quest run, that should be decent XP if you do them all on your way through, if not wait a level or two and then do it.
---
Around 55-56 you should be able to get into LBRS
---
As for a second dagger, you could move Lifeforce Dirk to your MH and obtain Julie's Dagger or Hookfang Shanker for your OH. The classic MH to grab would be Barman Shanker from BRD, or you can also buy Shadowfoot Stabber.
---
Best tip would be level combat sword spec and switch back to daggers at 60.
---
Why is 51 considered too low to heal BRD as a holy priest? I did 10+ arena/anger runs yesterday no issue but most groups tell me I need a few more levels.
---
Really wishing I stayed shadow to quest, it's getting expensive to respec and I'm so sick of Mara.
---
Okey, didnt know... thanks
---
To put it simply I wanted to play vanilla, not relive the games entire history.  So if new content must be introduced I would prefer it not follow the same path we have already been down before. 
---
And on to your points well it's not like they are doing this for free. Iwe all pay a monthly subscription so really your points are pretty weak on that end. If it was free I might agree with you but it's not and they can easily take that money and invest it into a classic+ blizz isn't some small indie company let's not pretend they they have the resources because you would prefer to go to tbc.
---
Live testing has it at 2.86% on the warr discord.  Where is this from?
---
Did you read op? MT was warrior.
---
OP is prot spec paladin that just sat there essentially as a fire res buff and expect T2 head for his contribution, LMAO
---
I did this with Blackfury on private server for a bit, with relative success. In ZG/AQ20 gear I did around 250 dps usually. More with consumables like Oil of Immolation, and wizard oil. I don't know what's viable with the items currently in game, but it was a fun build with those items.
---
yeah i respecced and am in DM right now. the runs are fucking hard, lol
---
We're busy running with our friends and guildies so we don't have to tank for pugs.
---
Yeah i would probably be wasting my life on some other MMO. WoW wasn't even one of the first 10 MMORPG's i've played.
---
Maybe, I don't overly care. We clear MC and Ony with ease every week and it's a relaxed and fairly casual guild. More importantly, **I** am not the raid leader so I can just jump on at raid time and do my thing... one of those things being "whatever the raid leader wants the strat to be".
---
That's what I want from the game at the moment, my 60 hour WoW weeks leading raids of the ultra hardcore are done.
---
Regardless, if that's the point you took away from my post.. well grats on missing the point I guess.
---
Reporting is just another form of min-maxing, prove me wrong.
---
And in the belly of this dragon lives the mother named Onyixa... 🤔
---
It's pretty common knowledge that the whole raid of bwl is quite a step higher in complexity than mc.
---
I just decided to play in the moment for once and not thinking about what will come later. Its a nice thing to complete "best in slot" or not. You aint wrong however. Sword spec is stupid good. But as a player who prefer 2hand fury (to share the loot and just the overall feel of play) I till be handy for me until something better comes along. 2hand fury isnt as locked to weapon type either as PvP spec is.
---
That's because classic was over pretty quick. People subscribe because they heard classic was good.
---
Yeah. If turtles had a decent cooldown on that ability I'd use them all the time. (it's like many minutes right now)
---
Not even a good flex. That crappy 2-hander isn't 'pre-BiS'
---
Redoubt becomes active when you get crit. Low level (gray) mobs wont crit you
---
It even is better for sword rogues, but it is definitely even better for dagger rogues. Essentially Dagger rogues will only switch to T1 if they have pretty much the whole set. For sword rogues the switch is beneficial a bit earlier.
---
And you shouldn't play SF with pre-raid gear or MC/Ony Gear. You need a ton of crit and also the weapon-skill and hit to make it work.
---
What do you use that info for?
---
&gt; You can get a whole level in an hour at that level. No problem
---
&gt;Not currently, low level zones are pretty populated right now due to people doing alts and now that layering is gone it's a lot of competition for mobs etc. So no, not really.
---
&gt;But this whole thread is about Classic being just fine and enjoyable when that Isn't your goal.
---
No, it's not. This SPECIFIC discussion was about whether or not its possible to get a level an hour or not at level 15 in the current state of the game.
---
Everytime...
---
I did read it I was just musing because it's what I thought of when I read the title.
---
I think that’s what he is trying to point out, his name is smashing after all.
---
The compensation is strong with this one!
---
Why not just start the game with old items and talents? Would that be so disastrous?
---
“I just laugh at people like you who take the game seriously” 
---
Just let people play the game. Being serious and dedicating hours is playing the game how they want. Just because it’s silly to you doesn’t mean it’s not how people want to play. 
---
I agree with you about the vestments. I don’t think insulting how others play a game is exactly relevant to any part of the discussion tho
---
Just imagine how dumb you have to be to sell that pattern when it's the first one on your factions side. Even if this thing dropped in a random group where everyone needs and I were to win it, I would literally drop one of my professions on the spot and level armorsmithing. The amount of money you can make per craft of that item would very quickly overtake just selling the pattern. As evidenced from some other comment saying the pattern buyer made their money back in 30 mins. You can easily charge 200g a craft to randoms (especially on a faction without the pattern) and make that money back on 6 crafts. 
---
This has to be one of the worst "ninja" stories i've ever read. Destroys his whole guild for a paltry amount of gold, when he could have kept the pattern, kept the guild happy, and been swimming in way more gold in the long run (even in the short term...30 minutes was all it took to craft enough people the helm to make the pattern buyers money back. Just think about that...)
---
Got my true faith at 58 it was worth it
---
You might be right now that I think about it.
---
I didnt play a paladin til TBC and blood elves came out.
---
It's not, you don't really need to be high level to heal effectively, especially if you're already using a healing spec. But groups still prefer when everyone's about the same level, partly because of superstition, and partly because you will aggro mobs from further away when you're low level, which can lead to wipes.
---
Please come to firemaw server. Healers are quite scarce. (Warrior tank / dps here)
---
It might be considered too low but it's doable. my biggest concern would be you pulling mobs by accident. especially in the arena/angerforge runs you'd probably have to pull 2-3 extra packs of mobs that a 55+ could just run past. 
---
healers generally get a few levels of leadway in dungeon runs though because you don't have to worry about hitting bosses.
---
Well you never know if you'll have an even more serious situation in the next 30 mins!
---
If by quite a step higher you mean the fights have 2-3 mechanics instead of 1-2 mechanics then yes, things are really going to escalate. But once again, you wouldn’t really know either way, especially if your opinion is based on what you heard 15 years ago.
---
Try Dominos plus [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dominos-classic-skin) addon.
---
I should've specified...
---
on retail mythic raiding you can tell who's good and who is not by their ability to keep track of 12 different RNG'd mechanic while doing their perfect rotation as the DPS/HPS check is more intense than anything classic has to offer... even on fight that aren't considered DPS-HPS check ( queen's court, for example).
---
on classic, there's multiple fight where I cannot tell if the healer is being played by a sentient human or a drinking bird spamming a low-rank of their heals... and unfortunately, I can't ask for anything more, cause there's nothingelse to do.
---
At one point i'd tough I'd look at the overhealing meter and see who can cancel their heal and who cannot... but stuff die before healers go OOM wether they cancel their heal or not... so who care if the healers average 60% overhealing. We're down to 8 healers and that's only because we have 4 warlock who lifetap non-stop to keep us entertained...
---
the people who somehow don't even manage to meet that very low bar don't even meet the ''sentient human being'' criteria that was implicit.
---
You only need 20 pts in holy
---
Not ill advised at all. You can be doing Armory and start doing Cathedral whenever, and you can run it all the way to 40 if you want.
---
Before we had questie, I looked things up on Thottbot to see where quests actually wanted me to go.
---
I have 0 idea how the game's earliest players ever actually enjoyed themselves with none of this data collected.
---
I know it's the same spec, I thought we already went through this and that my comment above addressed that, but it doesn't seem it did. 
---
While your main is a mage and has to compete for rolls, I appreciate that it's frustrating - but in a group of 5, usually consisting of one tank, one healer and 3 DPS, can you really fault the healer for thinking that he's the one rolling on healing gear? 
---
&gt;I really don't have much sympathy with the priest occasionally having to compete with 1 other.
---
If this is the attitude you are going to have in dungeons, I really hope you are being very clear and communicative about your rolling intentions when joining a group so the healer has the chance to find a group with a normal tank instead of potentially wasting 1 hour in a run you're just doing for 1 item, only to have it contested by another role. Or so that the group has the chance to find another tank, whichever way it swings. 
---
I just think you and I disagree too much on this topic as I don't think any particular spec should be entitled to needing on gear for 2 wildly different roles; I believe any further discussion is futile. I don't think you will change your mind, and I know that I won't. You have somewhat changed my mind about grouping with Druid tanks, though.
---
Your gm sounds pleasant.
---
Not just 15years ago. People are talking about it all over, just look. You can keep your opinion and leave me alone at this point. I'll make money off this information and you'll just roll over bwl and get bored
---
I’m at the moment leveling a druid and I hope to rekt as hard as you do one day. Ps, what was that instant heal at the beginning?
---
&gt;A poster below mentioned Fallout, an organisation that "adopted a policy deeming it the sole remaining bastion of "pure," mutation-free humanity on Earth"
---
Ironically enough, Horrigan is a mutant in Fallout 2 =)
---
What key are you talking about?
---
You only need one hunter with T2, and even then many guilds wouldn't let them use it because it takes up a debuff slot that requires quite a few hunters to be worthwhile. So yeah either use full T1 or mix and match best pieces you have.
---
Lul what? Why does it bother ypu that most of the players are bad? You can clear content on classic and still be bad.
---
Good practice then....In this case the scammer would earn around 50g per banned day. Not bad.
---
always, too many weird characters in my password lol
---
Write
---
 LFM BRD Arena/Angerforge, nothing reserved, i tank for free
---
and you'll get tons of whispers
---
looks like a shitty console RPG
---
Does Mind Soothe really work for others than yourself? 
---
Maybe I'm reading to much in to the text of the spell, but it says "reducing the range at which it will attack **you** by 10 yards."
---
Devilsaur is better.  The 3 piece does little
---
Dude grats!  I love setting goals in classic and hitting them.  Epic mount your next goal?  What other goals do you have?  (looking for ideas)
---
So what language is all that Warcratr choir music in? Latin?
---
Good riddance clown.
---
After 6 or 7 Domo kills we still have no eye dropped... But we have both bindings. Guess Benediction is now rarer then Thunderfury...
---
Yeah averaging 35k an hour and got two twink blues worth 45g now likely 200 a piece in p3, to the others duh I am an idiot. Of course it won't proc, reason didn't go holy shield proc was bc it's only 4 charges and I'm pulling like 40 mobs. So I figured ret aura would be more useful, no I'm not using spikes but I def should, didn't want to waste a thorium spike on a shit shield, but that's def not a bad idea.
---
You can mark targets with macro but the command only works for a specific symbol. You could add modifiers to it tho to try and reach 3:4 symbols... I just made a targeting macro for quests and added a skull marking command to hit for easy searching . Now it's just my skull macro.
---
I appreciate the insight. I'm currently stepping into the 55+ dungeons and checking all these lists to see what I should be targeting. I had read that you need 30% crit for Seal Fate to "work". At that point you won't be topping combat swords or daggers but you will be able to keep up with them. Is that true or is it a little more nuanced than that?
---
I find the UC wall jump Shortcut useful to get to SM. Hate walking around UC as alli.
---
Righteous orbs and pearls look exactly the same. But righteous orbs like 25-30g each vs a few silver each. Scammer is hoping he doesnt notice he sent him the wrong item.
---
Honestly I expect this to be the case. I don't see blizz doing classic + or rereleasing TBC or wrath. I expect they'll just push for everyone to jump to retail.
---
Armor&gt;Stamina=STR&gt;INT
---
For 3 pearls yeah it is lmao
---
Superstition?
---
Because the world lies at your feet. You are you. You do what you want to do. There's no expectation of grandeur you have to deliver, and especially there's no homework chores to do daily/weekly or you don't get cookie points.
---
This is \*your\* story, not a multi-million dollar written, directed and perfectly choreographed story where you can merely railroad along. You do it, you and the other players around create the story in a rich world, full of possibilities. This is RPG. Something got lost along the way during all those expansions with all the things we won and wanted.
---
My opinion? Look at the fights, lol. They have 2-3 mechanics. They’re not hard.
---
I don’t expect you’ll make money off anything when you’ve never even done it yourself. So keep your inaccurate information, nobody wants it.
---
This guy has an advantage too as a human. He's effectively 1 level higher due to weapon skill.
---
Calling your own question great, eh? That’s edgy.
---
I thought something did this. Am I losing my mind? Was there something in Vanilla? or Never? Am I thinking of Just myself? I know I have green floating text. Are we talking about other people? 
---
I have health deficits showing for everyone so I'm actually looking at their deficits the whole time to make sure I use the appropriate spell, so maybe I never noticed that the green was only for me?
---

It's an actionbutton feature built into the default ui. If you try to cast a high rank spell from spellbook or try to macro a spell, the game will not downrank. However if you drag the max rank spell from your spellbook to your actionbar and then use that button, it will downrank. Some actionbar addons may interfere with this. If yours does, that means the addon is essentially re-inventing the wheel in terms of actionbars which is highly inefficient, so you should probably change actionbar addon anyway.

Go with t1 gloves and go for the 6 piece shadowcraft bonus, that leaves 2 offpieces available
---
Were you planning on lying before? Why qualify ur response with "not gunna lie". In fact, now i think ur lying, filthy liar!.
---
Also, how would you know OP was seeming a dick anyways?
---
Not that asking you is productive since youll just lie to me.
---
You're not my real dad! Also people taking the tier 1 stuff so seriously. There's plenty of time yall
---
It ramps up significantly as you level.
---
Did you buy it bundled with something else?
---
Yes
---
make that two
---
Yeah a lot of people who have the YOLO mentality randomly die at like.... 53. Also, they tend to be out of shape which is decidedly unsexy. 
---
You gotta balance the YOLO and the truth that you'll probably live to 70 or so.
---
Meh. Maybe I would have an interesting career, maybe I would botch an interesting career too. I don't really care tbh I have what I need in life and am content with it.
---
The robe is definitely worth it, it's Bis until p5 iirc.
---
BWL has a lot more of fights with threat management so you won't be able to plow with a guild full of min/maxers.
---
When and why is a good level to switch from enhancement to elemental while leveling? I read in some websites that elemental is better at 40, why? Because of the lvl 40 talent? 
---
Also if i switch at lvl 40 , how can i get proper gear to level up, since elemental needs different stats. ( also planning to do more dungeons as a healer)
---
Probably not the best word for it, but on average a higher level player is expected to have better gear/game knowledge.
---
Step 1: have a friend that wants to level a healer.
---
I was in Un'Goro trying to escort Ringo and had got a little group going. We had almost made it to the turn in when a group of like 5 60's just came in and killed all of us. Now that I'm nearing level 60 myself it will be my turn to do the wrecking, The cycle of hatred must go on.
---
&gt; Maybe his guild raids for fun too? 
---
if THAT is my tanks gear you know what im able to do as a fury warrior? auto attack. if i click a single button ill pull threat and die. is that fun?
---
Mine is the most upvoted comment on the post, so clearly a few people out there care. :) But I'm sure you'll just fire back at this with another rude comment.
---
Oh my god was that fucking chromie dancing in the BACKGROUND at 1:01 from that c l a s s i c w o w vid!?!?! I nearly spat my drink out LOL
---
Smiles &lt;Den&gt; what?
---
The lower level you are the higher level the tanks need to be, the mobs hit hard.
---
Could be executioner's cleaver, same model, slightly different colour.
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,mod:alt][@player,mod:alt] Flash Heal(rank 4); [@mouseover,help][@player] Flash Heal
---
I think it's hilarious when "dps wars" refuse to tank. Get good scrub
---
DEN nothing, because rag is dead and Nefarian is too afraid to fight us for now.
---
Yeah charm is great when it works rogues  are ussualy dead.But i had some rogues kill succu ,or blind/gouge which makes everything more difficult if you not pvp spec.
---
And as i said when they got jump on you succu isn't invisible but is fighting mobs and makes her vulnerable
---
Playable Eredar? Wtf??
---
2 questions, what's your speed and what gear are you using. I'm a rogue and this sounds like a blast
---
If someone buys "orbs" and you would send them the pearls without further comment by writing "orbs" in the text field, would that get you banned? It is a orb after all. And you never said its a righteous orb to begin with.
---
Also, is setting 4 slides of 0 copper double price buyouts enchanting mats in the AH bannable? It's to scam also, allthough also inside the given system ofc.
---
Personally I found it disappointing as a rogue because there is hardly any loot. So I opted for questing. But just do what you enjoy :)
---
I have a level 60 hunter with Rhok’delar and have really been enjoying raiding. However, I have realised that I’m quite competitive, and while my DPS is strong in phase 1, as the game progresses it will get worse. 
---
As a result I want to make an alt that will smash the DPS charts so I’m deciding between rogue and warrior. Both of them seem super fun, so I’m curious which you would recommend to play? 
---
I also really enjoy PvP and play horde if that makes a difference.
---
I leveled engineering as a gnome, then dropped  it, and re leveled.  However, i don't see the quest to learn goblin engineering.  I noticed my gnome engineer card expires in  13 days.  Do i have to wait 13 days to learn goblin engineering?
---
That could very well be, I swear I remember 12 hours but I could be misremembering or confusing it with something else
---
You can certainly buff them *prior* to them starting the encounter, but anything done after will cause the mob to reset.
---
I'm uncertain of if it's been changed, but you used to be able to complete the quest for other hunters. Just group up and the one who has **already** completed the quest does the fight (solo), then the hunter that needs it loots the head.
---
My gai
---
Some people kust don't immerse themselves in rascist rhetoric and dog whistles either and don't spot it as easily as people who do.  It didn't click for me at first because I honestly didn't know what I was looking for.  I saw the dude names Jesse Jackson and thought that was it.  The rest of it my brain just interpreted as random wow characters in the pic.  Those are white times but not KKK robes do I didn't make that connection.  The only name I recognized was Jesse Jackson  and that.by itself isn't really rascist. Though now that I have read through the comments I get it now..
---
Deathbone is nice for the Mp5 althoug Defense is a bad stat for paladin, as it reduces chance to proc Redoubt.
---
Key to pally tanking is high armor, lots of STR and STA, and dodge/parry
---
To avoid comments like this xD
---
My server has no tanks. So ya it’s bad.
---
Found the KKK sympathizer.
---
I wouldn’t pay either but I’m a warrior haha so I feel ya there. You probably hit 60 at the right time when people were running anything and everything. At this point, tanks just have no other reason to go there so people incentivize them with orbs.
---
I think it’s pretty simple, if you want to farm orbs, get a tank from your friends list or guild first of course. If people want gear/quests and can’t find a tank, they just offer the first orb and get a tank quickly. Probably worth it and they aren’t really paying the tank anything if he had a 20% chance to win each orb anyway, or even higher with round robin rules.
---
Same and as nice as it is compared to night, healing fct would be wonderful haha
---
Are you doing a 24/0/27 build with this, or something else?
---
Do it!  As others have said, keep your wand updated and you're good to go.  Spirit tap = zero downtime.  Also, you can easily heal all dungeons.
---
Join a guild. Same answer every time this is posted. It's an MMO, you're supposed to be in a guild making friends.
---
That's true, little downtime. You might only need to heal the pet every 5-6 mobs. Plus you can survive even if you pull wrongly adding 1-2 more mobs.
---
NTA.
---
Healing druids require cloth drops at that level.    
---
He is the arsehole for not explaining his rules at the start and wasting your time.
---
lol what privilege is that?  Get over yourself.  I have no privilege.  I work for things like everybody else.  STFU with your garbage.
---
but then people will go back to pservers once classic servers are done.
---
No. 
---
As hpal I roll on all armour classes.
---
I'll echo what some have already said, roll a druid. I did this in vanilla due to the same issue that you are having.
---
That's Kael'thas and he always looked like that.
---
Already have my mount at 40. Currently 43.
---
As a Warrior do you need to save up any more gold until you want you Epic mount?
---
I'm starting to struggle with PvE, looking at my equipment I'm starting to lag really far behind. I still have some level 20 items.... I also don't have full plate. I'm following a Leveling guide, so it's more about getting to 60 the quickest and not about getting good equipment, and I know Warriors are the most gear dependent class.
---
I have the BoneBiter, so Not sure if I should buy the Executioner's Cleaver....Or just invest in better equipment. Or what? Maybe consumables?
---
you are right, worded it differently now
---
I think that's been blown out of proportion. The nerfs mean the gph has dropped to maybe 60gto70g raw per hour. Selling brings that up but the initial rush of buyers is gone.
---
It's just faster if you have a decent PC
---
Imagine using World chat. Private Server players are their own clique I guess.
---
eh... I've had some amazing experiences on Warmode. You just gotta find the right people.
---
Right after you stop spreading bad advice.
---
Yeah shamans have incredible single target threat and tanking dungeons is pretty easy up till late 40s. (Issues come from poor gear specialization and running oom)
---
First guy that had it on my server charged 200g per craft. Think like 4-5 warriors in my guild forked up 200g to get it crafted. You could easily make over 10k gold from it depending on how long you'd be the only one with it.
---
And Lionheart is one of the few recipes you can do this with too. What an absolute moron.
---
Good ring for tanks too. Prebis for alliance druids, situational great ring for warriors and horde druid
---
I certainly would.
---
Yeah whats your point?  People will try to farm SGC for weeks.
---
At low levels (until 50) agility is better than strength. A few AP doesn't help much with weapons that deal such little damage, but crit and dodge go a lot further.
---
Nah.
---
I mean, he did play for 18 hours. You can't watch a movie and get a refund after its over.
---
Uhh yeah? They are by far the slowest solo class, what other metric do you need to use to determine the worst leveling experience? Not to mention they literally do NOTHING but autoattack and judge for 60 levels. Dying every once it a while might feel bad, but not nearly as bad as doing 20 autoattacks and not getting a SoC proc.
---
its not about having the ressources but spending them. its not just him finding a justification wtf
---
I have Heavy Silk Bandages as an Warrior at level 43. What's the next step, and are they worth taking?
---
I used to love using first-aid at lower levels....but now the Heavy Silk aren't helping out as much.
---
Can you link a video/guide of a mage pulling this run off? Curious as to the spec/gear lvl required to do it solo
---
Hammer time.
---
he’s a dick for waiting so long to bring it up. since he can do it solo he wouldnt be a dick for wanting to solo though.
---
you should roll on good healing gear as you level even if its cloth
---
I want Classic+ because I don't want TBC and flying mounts again.
---
There are things in place (Like Karazan and Hyjal) that they could work on. Same game we all loved, new content we never played.
---
Dude that's incredible Going to the RP server STAT. Thanks for the idea.
---
$20 says if a couple horde started ganking people in front of that group, not a single ally would step up to stop it.
---
I reckon if you have a propensity towards gaming there always be another game to fill that void.
---
I also reckon that the demensions of the void expand and contract to the game you choose to push into it e.g. mmorpg skinner box vs casual games.
---
The secret is to choose the right game to fill your gaming void.
---
Uhhhh i think u have this backwards. The dedication is what makes this impressive you dolt!
---
A dipshit who now has KANG THE DECAPITATOR after last night woot woooooot!
---
The tank got a cool leather chest piece those.
---
I got an epic two handed axe.
---
A soul.......for a soul......
---
The exact moment someone gets hit down to 8% but you precast greater heal or a mouse over PWS because you saw the mobs coming. That’s also satisfying.
---
If your only concern is your personal gain over everything else, go play a single player game.
---
Heh, you let me know if you ever actually go read what I wrote and understand the point.
---
Warrior is only competitive in PvP with a pocket healer. I think, If you put in the efford you can do well with your hunter. 
---
I guess Warriors scale the most with gear, but rogues do aswell. If you really wanna smash the damage meter, you gotta roll mage and be one whos ignite everyone else feeds into...
---
Dmg Meter is not really everything in raiding.
---
Yep, confirmed.
---
Whats this have to do with wow classic?
---
Lol at level 20 you can heal just fine without any cloth
---
Lol this.I would just play other games as i did before classic Maybe less tho.
---
But i quit in Cata and didn't look back till Classic at all.Had plenty of times to get my " things in order"
---
I just won briarwood reed over a mage in the guild. I'm a holy priest and the Icy veins BIS list had it as 2nd bis after the royal seal. I was then told it was in fact not even in the top 5 list and that I should feel ashamed, which I sort of do right now.
---
I know there's no item trading or anything but has anyone had any luck having a GM trade an item over in the past? I seem to recall someone saying that a GM could fix these things, but maybe that only applies to accidental ninja looting.
---
I was in alterac 2 days ago on kurinaxx as a horde rogue helping a bunch of allies do some quests. Emote communication is pretty funny. 
---
Some of em probably saw a horde rogue and got scared, but id point towards a mob and wait for em to hit it, and then attack after, then we would rotate and they would help me burn down one of the elite mobs. 
---
When you can't find fellow faction members to help with elite quests, sometimes you have to work with the enemy lol.
---
Player is allowed to do what ever he wants. Wanna do dungeons with friend where all have different roles and no one need the same item. Go ahead. But a lot of people cant do that. And they just look for any party.   
---
And there are no "loot priority rules" in the game. They were made up by the players with a mindset similar to topic starter. The game just gives an option to "need" an item if player needs it. Every one should decide  for themselves when and what they need.
---
Like, 5 times while clearing to Lucifron?
---
Congrats!
---
Your're'nt*
---
Me too. And the shoulders. Mostly because they look so good and every shoulder I have gotten since has been but ugly. I figure that if I keep one piece only for looks it would not matter too much dps wise.
---
Ah this makes way alot of sense. Thank you
---
Out of the loop here ...but If it's a pre purchase..could he have played it yet?( is it some sort of early access?)
---
I played as Paladin in vanilla , about to make my first toon and feel like I should switch it up and go shaman. I know I'll miss the indestructibility though. Won't miss chasing ranged classes.
---
They tend to drop aggro all at once if I shield and heal myself, but if all I do is dot the mob then only the one tagged will chase me. I think it might have to do with I am constantly damaging the quest mob. They did chase me for a longer range than simply a body pull. Warrior shooting isn't instant cast, so the mobs will catch up. I don't know if it will work with hunters shoot and kite or druid moonfire and travel form, but if it works for hunters and druids, then I think it's the constant damage that does the trick.
---
Are you toggling HS?
---
I thought I was the only one! 
---
I would love to use the login screen for nostalgia’s sake, but tbh I can’t remember my password lol
---
Because you need only 2 prot warriors in raids and maybe 3 offtanks. So warriors are more likely to have a lot of DPS gear and to be DPS specced.
---
Classic was all about having fun on your way there is no endgame enjoy the leveling
---
Fuck bro.  I’m still putting my password into the login screen.
---
You are thinking about the elitest jerks type of people. I'm thinking about the 80% of guilds that will have a harder time. That's who to make money off of. Goblins can always make money ;)
---
None of the mechanics in wow are particularly hard. The hardest thing is coordinating 40 people to do all the mechanics.
---
You also need to remember that not everyone has an easy time grasping this stuff and there are still tons of kids and teens playing too that don't have any experience with the game prior to classic.
---
Enjoy being an elitest jerk ;)
---
Ha gay
---
Think about what a windfury, sword spec, hoj, do to your weapon swing timer, and how using SS might impact this.  If you get a sword spec proc with SS right before you're about to swing anyways it was almost completely wasted.
---
Why does someone have to be an asshole here?  You guys discussed loot before the dungeon and found out you were incompatible.
---
Literal guild of Nazis. It goes beyond being edgy bois, everyone on Grobb hates these pieces of shit.
---
More flurry
---
Maybe if you’re fucking high!
---
Yea, until Revered, when you have to go back and kill just as many to get beads :(
---
I always wonder. Why is it stressfull to you? I get it being stressfull for healers. As they have to keep the stupid dps alive, but why the tank?
---
He played the original WC3 for 18 hours. Reforged comes with it.
---
How do you reset it?
---
Yeah, unless he's doing it with bare fists and resurrection sickness, I'm not impressed !
---
Yes the extra damage is nice, if its an elite and takes a while. Normal mobs? They usually die too fast for it to be worth it, but feel free to test it out
---
If there is a mole underneath him then it sure is hungry
---
See that’s just wrong. If I mention Vurtne, there’s tons of people who know the EXACT look he had, because it was so iconic
---
I see it, pretty sweet.
---
Wut's an N'Zoth?
---
No point in trying to have a conversation with you it seems, as your just gonna spin it until you feel like you are correct.
---
Know the mechanics and stay alive. Even a live person in 58 greens out DPSes a dead person.
---
It's an alt but not totally outfitted in the best AH gear you can get for his level? Hmmm~.
---
With a 60 mage I've just funneled the tiny amount of gold I need to to keep my warrior decked out. She's a murdering machine now who can charge into groups and shit. Can pay a lower-level alchemist to mail me all the health pots and buffing elixirs they make, too. 
---
Also, with cloth being reasonably cheap or farmable, can just train your warrior to silk/mageweave cloth before they're even 10.
---
If you remain a tank spec you can sell tanking services at 60 for dungeons that are hard to get tanks for like Scholo and Strat.  Since you can't really do things like solo Mara runs that will be one of your gold making options.
---
Y't*
---
&gt; because your dps isn't just auto attacks
---
Half of it is just auto attacks.
---
&gt;~~Sounds like~~ lots KKK sympathizers on this thread, which is pretty disgusting.
---
I think they would lose retail players if they tried to revert, theres a reason why people are playing either classic or retail.
---
summons
---
Run some dungeons to get some gear. Uldaman,ZF and RFD all have decent plate upgrades for you. 
---
If you find some decent of the bear plate it can't hurt to pick it up if its at a cheap price.
---
 As tempting as it is I wouldn't recommend buying items to use while leveling unless you already have a 60 that you can funnel gold off of.
---
You lose 25 healing but get better farming/pvp. I think it's well worth it in the current content.
---
Nice scouts you got there
---
He is off tanking. He just needs to generate more aggro than the healer.
---
Classic holds a special place in my heart, for sure. While not FF11, FFXIV has certainly won my heart over these days.
---
Off spec for druid is anything not Resto.
---
I made an Alliance alt (as shown in the album), but all my friends play Horde, so I didn't really feel any motivation to sink more hours into that character.
---
Throw in a Battle shout also. Make sure your mates are close enough to receive it. Give decent threat to all mobs. Then start tab sundering.

So this macro should default to self cast if no mouseover is selected?

1440x900 on an HP dv8000 laptop, but I started playing in 2006 not 2004.
---
I should have mentioned how Enclave members like to get into other guilds' discords and start spamming racist memes for the lols
---
I suppose, don't think many are doing it.
---
I have a friend that made a similar decision. Good on you for being honest with yourself about your limitations, stay strong and kick ass in real life instead of WoW!
---
Nah theyre lazy. Ww axe starts feeling bad around 42ish. I couldnt imagine using it until 60, you must hit like a wet paper bag.
---
It only gets faster.
---
I just think the game has designed them as a PvP class
---
Absolutely
---
&gt; I'm not really choosing his side, more so I'm just rejecting YOUR side.
---
When you are choosing between someone spewing hateful invective and someone saying maybe we should not let a game be a platform for hate then you are implicitly supporting the hate.
---
I understand that you are saying you are opposing censorship but your argument directly supports hate/racism by supporting giving it a platform.
---
The fact that Blizzard has not done anything about it surprises me since it directly violates their stated ToS/EULA.
---
Yea and the huge frame of the orc. The big bad looks slightly too big....or they are placed slightly too far out on human shoulders. 
---
But I will definitely roll need once I get to ZF and have a good thinking about using them hehe.
---
It works with all addons disabled.
---
Our chat logs just involve the Human Mages making fun of the Gnome mages for losing with 5% int.
---
I use auto self cast.  It will cast on me if no other target is available.
---
This should allow your macro to work as written.
---
60 druid healer. Have gotten solid gear in every slot par chest. Trying to get these robes off Baron, but Strath groups aren't too common for me. Any good healing chest that's not a nightmare to get?
---
Would you mind sharing with me where you put your points in the balance tree? I’ve seen a few different suggestions here and I’m struggling to figure out where to allocate those 24 points lol
---
Nice gear bro, who did you sleep with to get that?!
---
Sure then I would get Endurance for sure. Then you'll always have either sprint or evasion up.
---
they probably can, but if you are 4 dispels behind someone it doesn't seems like a big deal to me.
---
&gt; Too many soft betas in classic think they have the right to tell others what to think and how to be. They should shut the Hell up and just worry about their own lives.
---
You realize that you are being logically inconsistent here?  Don't worry about the people you are calling betas, just focus on your life?
---
If they're not willing to do a Classic+ expansion style (e.g., further developing the existing continents), I'd love to see a Classic+ version that makes the game more challenging.  E.g., Re-tuning the dungeons and raids to be significantly more difficult.  Since this version would have an end-game focus, I'd like to see the leveling process accelerated - perhaps reduced all XP requirements to 30% of current.
---
This would obviously be an optional version available on servers alongside the existing.  Sort of a 'modded' version of the game.
---
yeah don't roll on a pvp server and take a fight you, especially since 2 other horde left the area! You should be ashamed that you actually pvp'd and had fun.
---
I'm all for guild ranks and an established system. Now if you guys declared from the onset that the higher rank gets priority on items, then partyA has every right to complain. But if its strictly for invite purposes, then he's acting like an entitled selfish brat and is really missing the point of being a guild and should simply offer grats to the winner of the roll.  My opinion anyway.
---
Noted!
---
If you are doing high volumes of trading or setting up an agreement with a guildie or something, cod is wonderful. 
---
For example, I made an agreement with a guildie that I will buy up to say 5 stacks of something they said they will be farming for a while. They're going to cod them to me as they get the stacks. I'm in no rush for the items and cod allows ot to be at their leisure. Chances are at some point they'll be online farming at different times than I'm on.
---
im  unfortunately the opposite end. I can't log in via the [b.net](https://b.net) launcher because it claims i dont have the game installed. When i try to find the directory for the file in the [b.net](https://b.net) app it says it cannot be found. I've tried soooo many folders and none of them work. 
---
Now I just manually launch the game from the folder. I'm super boned when a new patch comes out tho...
---
i just dont want to redownload 40+ gigs just because the app is  f'd up :( lol
---
It's a team game when it comes to raiding. If you expect to be part of a team of people pulling their weight you better be doing your part too. It might seem like overkill for MC, but good guilds are trying to create strong cores and part of that is weeding out people who don't put in the same effort as the rest. There are plenty of casual guilds and pugs out there.
---
This is so bad... dont do this
---
Im guessing you arent level 60 yet, which would make sense. All the challenged individuals are still leveling.
---
If you are 60, then I guess you are playing with a bunch of south americans or something.
---
yep. corpsemaker to ww to ravager to gatorbite to lord alexanders
---
Some people like TV as an hobby. I like WoW. And the memories are worth the time spent
---
Truefaith Vestment from tailoring are pretty good and they dont include dungeon runs.
---
That’s not really a good comparison.

There are items in D2 that take dedicated players YEARS to find, which is a good part of why it’s still played today. 
---
Can you imagine if in order for a Frost Mage to hit its maximum potential it needed a few items from Molten Core and they had a .002% drop rate. The outcry would be epic. 
---
D2 players don’t mind spending years farming the same boss over and over to find that one item to put their character at max power. WiW players would throw a fit.
---
This is exactly the info I was looking for.  THANKS!
---
Well, I know what I’m gonna be doing at that level. Thanks for the advice!
---
I just want tbc without flying (and maybe less timesharing)
---
Insinuating that is kinda pathetic, and the level virtue signaling is exhausting. Some people want to play, not police the game.
---
Just delete it
---
yeah I opened a ticket, they told me they can combine into one subscription if you want (i had two separate accounts for dual boxes back in the day) except he told me that some of the account specific stuff wouldn't move over like mounts or something...i told him no even though I hadn't played since the panda invasion  now i just use the launmcher
---
There is no way it can be done without all the extra's and him having it is the whole fucking point. The rules are simple, just be lvl 1, then go all out on what you can to see what you can kill, such as a lvl 10 elite.
---
I thought it was a fun lil video that showcases how powerful a lvl 1 character can potentially be.
---
People in dungeons often switch to zerk stance to whirlwhind too.
---
We are the best PVP healers for sure I cannot deny that. Melee is every other healing classes weakness, but not us. With good baiting vs Counterspells/Interrupts/Line of sight you can be fairly unstoppable.
---
I would still beplaying FFXI if not for getting worn out camping ferry pirates for the Sea Robber and and Sea Wolf Cudgels. Hours and Days spent. Never dropped one. Oh and my Dynamis AF would never drop.
---
On a single encounter? That's a pretty big deal. It's like their 12 vs my 8 or 9 or something.
---
Oh you play alliance and you’re a support class... acceptable warrior prebis is fine
---
Can't speak for locks or hunters, but priests have very little downtime for a caster. If you have spirit tap and imp wand, you can pretty much back to back pull single mobs. You can handle 2-3 if things go bad, but I'll need to drink after
---
Got it, thanks! :)  I'll just stay badass with my giantstalker set then
---
Would appear they're priest only :(
---
I would say that it’s because the amount of level 60s have gone up. PVP consumes will go down again. Trust me
---
&gt; Maybe I would have an interesting career, maybe I would botch an interesting career too.
---
Point it you would have tried something else. 
---
Then again, addictions depend less on the availability of something and more on the personal weakness, which predisposes to all sorts of similar addictions.
---
Well since I have no other reason to go there besides the orbs I would hate to just give one away.
---
Your offspec is whatever specialization you aren't using... if you're specced feral it isn't an offspec lol
---
I know what u mean, i've got the 8 pieces so i could swap the pieces i've got while raiding. Still, it was friking hard to get.
---
This was a week or so ago, my gears much better now., thanks to my guildies being sick as fuck and a lot of luck on warrior drops.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dq4y2q/people_who_camp_the_brd_entrance_how_lonely_are/). 
---
I think thats the play. If they announce tbc then that will keep alot subscribers  as people know theres eventually more. I for one will probably switch factions so i would be leveling up a horde character eventually.
---
Saving gold etc for tbc will be a priority but maybe not gearing as the first few quests reward greens that replace epics
---
Can you name 5 others? Naming _one_ person, who happens to be super famous, out of literally tens of millions of players ever as proof that WoW's facial customization is an important tool of recognition...is a pretty poor defense

The dm book is the best one followed by either the mindtap talisman or the reed. It is close.

I have a small guild and about a dozen of us are 50+ at this point.  Including myself we have 2 pure tanks and 1 hybrid that are 56 to 60 and we have 3 healers at 55+ as well with another 3 healers in their 50's as well.
---
We are working through the Ony and MC attunements.  At what point could we reasonably start hosting Pug runs for these two raids?  Ideally I would like to fill all the tank and heal spots within the guild.
---
I had a shaman healer leave group because he "wasnt having a good time" because he was telling the tank what to do when the tank clearly knew what to do.
---
We were running Zul Farrak, not Onyxia. Some people just arent meant for team activities
---
Everything, they spellcleave that shit, gotta top the meters.
---
Warlock drain tanking has basically no downtime! Just about to hit 60 and it’s been amazing not having to heal and mana up every encounter!
---
Then what happened? Wife? kids? Successful business owner?
---
Make your own group, you set the rules then and you will fill up just as fast.
---
Charge-&gt;(optionally thunderclap)-&gt;Zerker stance-&gt;Zerker rage-&gt;(optionally WW)-&gt;Defensive stance-&gt; Battleshout -&gt;Demoshout-&gt;tab/sunder/revenge spam.  Usually works well enough, you may have to taunt back one runner.
---
Taunt is not affected by +attack hit. It is a spell.
---
they aren’t really mountains, I would consider them hills if you were to conpare them to barens mountains
---
I guess once you all are 60 and have at least blue if not pre-bis gear.
---
I’m planning on ending my subscription if they announce BC.  (As in, before it hits servers.) So for me it’s Classic or nothing.
---
If it was in a pug, yeah all for it, it's yous AND you can use it.
---
But for overall help to the guild, ouch... since Mages get screwed so bad on their DM trinket, they really only have 4 trinkets to help with DPS for Phase 1.5 - Reed, BoK, Eye of Beast , and ToEP from MC.
---
I mean a decent guild can very easily do farm runs of Jed/Rend with 5-6 ppl or even full clears if needed for the various parts of the Ony attunement and tank shield, so help make it up by forming a guildie group, fishing for Jed spawns and chain run that shit for a few hours for Reed, Leather Shoulders, and Dal Rends.
---
Just green's from the AH along with any new abilities as they unlock. I'm at the level now (18) where AH upgrades aren't great unless I want to start spending gold per item. But buying a decent armor set and sword early was a big help. Also buying 14 slot bags helped and having plenty of potions on hand was a big boost too.

Did you know that you can take screenshots ingame?

---
Oh fuck me yeah.
---
problem is if you are stacking up on something for the future, there is a good chance so are 30 other people. the price may crash because all 31 people are trying to unload at once. thats what happened with a lot of mats for DM
---
Warriors are not using overpower in their rotation. Sure, you *can*, but... you will not find a log of any top performing warrior using overpower. It's just not worth it, especially since most optimal builds are dual wielding and not taking imp overpower.
---
Also, don't neglect cooking.  Easy food to regen and the buffs actually do make a difference.  It's really easy to level cooking with the stuff you find.
---
what professions do you have, and what spec are you?
---
Truefaith is only for priests. I don't think any other robes come close to Robes of the Exalted, healing-wise.
---
Wouldn't recommend Desolace, picking up all the quests and finishing them gets you like 1 level and there are quests you have to do under water which are a pain in the ass imo. SM runs are a good and easy way to level imo, so that would be the fastest if you don't mind doing it over and over again. I don't think there is any good gear in it for you but you can always just run to UC and sell what ever you gathered together.
---
Around 36 you should be able to pick quests up at stv which is a 100 times better place then Desolace, especially for Rogues, they can easily 1v1 other classes higher then them. 
---
Once you hit 40 you can go to badlands quest there and run Uldaman, i think it has a couple of good rogue items but im not sure, you better check!
---
MA BOIS!
---
Lol i finally understand the scam
---
Ill give it a go thanks!
---
I'm a tank and I love shadow priests. I wish more of them would respond to my LFG spams.
---
 * They're casters, so they're not even rolling on my off-spec loot (unlike fury warriors or rogues)
---
 * They can shackle, which is a big help in Scholo and DM:W
---
 * They help heal the group, which means less healer mana consumption and faster pulls. I also play alliance, so it's helpful without a Chain Heal equivalent
---
 * They provide a level of AoE threat that is often higher than the healer, which means I'm picking wayward mobs off of them instead of the healer
---
 * Fort buff and shadow protection
---
But I've only had maybe one or two ever join, which makes them as rare as a ret paladin.

10% discount at honored so yes 900g

If you’re leveling solo don’t go to Westfall. Loch Modan is more forgiving :)
---
You should pull with righteousness + max rank consecration or you'll lose aggro with high dps in your group. Auto attack with righteousness until judgment is back off cooldown then switch to crusader, judge and back to righteousness before you lose an auto attack

Know the feeling, just yesterday i decided to kill one elemental in plaguelands between herbing. Got an essence :D
---
Why didn’t you just do solo princess runs in Maraudon?
---
Resisting censorship is 100% my point because you and I can't decide where the line is drawn otherwise we send everyone sliding down a slippery slope.  Either everything is allowed or nothing is.  There can't be an in-between.
---
Motw 100% auto-downranks. I noticed that while trying to buff lowbies in the Barrens.
---
Running to the alliance raid is indeed the most fun
---
Get some feral gear, host the run as the tank, reserve the item. Warriors and feral druids don't get a much out of strath so thats why you aren't seeing very many runs.
---
Blizzard will change spawn timer like they did with devilsaur
---
a pop up asks you if you really want to send gold for the COD item.
---
I don't have the scepter required to zone into it, and I'm too lazy to get it.
---
It's more of a nudge to how if you bring a druid you'll want them to go resto or in some cases I guess bear tank. Kinda like how if you bring a paladin it's for holy and buffs.

a 54 isn't going to tank for level 60 dps.

You are highly ignorant and contradicting yourself. 
---
Sorry to break it to you but The world of Warcraft is not the real world, neither is reddit. You will be banned and silenced for spreading hate, that is society dealing with them accordingly, we are the society.
---
The guild enclave is not just 1 racist old man cosplaying the kkk, over 15 years and across multiple games they have acquired a large group of these shit heads and have literally harassed and doxd people based on their sexual preference or skin color.
---
And to clarify, my feelings are not hurt, I'm just sick of this level of toxicity online and people like yourself defending it by telling people "ignore it there's REAL problems out there"... It's been years bro. Stop allowing hate groups to form and live online.
---
ha ha ha
---
I've been soloing trib runs
---
Professions wont really help - Miner/Blacksmith and I'm enhance so basically going to be farming 1 at a time.  I've been doing a lot of mining to make gold but I find typically over peak times it's too slow (like 2-3 rich thor veins an hour).
---
Honestly, WoW made me a better and more successful person. When I started playing the game as an awkward teen, I wasn’t the best at working with others or even really socializing with strangers. WoW taught me a lot of lessons that have really helped me out.
---
Tier tokens happened in vanilla.
---
isabankalt, itsabankalt
---
Always worth levelling up first aid. Even as a healer, I made sure to get up to heavy runecloth bandages.
---
Tyr's Hand has more forgiving pulls if you are looking for mindless farming, Hearthglen has great mob density but a lot of the pulls are packs
---
&gt;and blizzards response was "don't play with them"
---
No they responded that every tool is in the game to combat this behavior. Other people band together? Create your own band. This is how it works in real life as well. Not saying it doesn't suck or can be hard to achieve of course, but it's silly to ban people for this type of stuff. It's not even a scam, let alone one of the worst scams in the game as you so eloquently put it.
---
To be clear; we're talking about the devilsaur mafia here. And no, I'm not happy about it existing (I'm playing a rogue that will soon need some of these coveted leathers). I just feel people nowadays rely too much on some third party fixing their 'problems' by crying about it and creating outrage.
---
Regarding the hunter quest: I agree our approach is probably a LOT better than instantly crying about it and calling for bans (lmao).  
---
To be fair, until now I haven't seen that much 'bad behavior'  in wow classic, which makes me feel all good and fluffy inside :)
---
It’s a really quick quest and worth it for sure.
---
Noted. That makes level discrepancies greater than 3 even more dangerous, then.
---
You’re also assuming that all the money they make from classic is being used to develop classic... lol. They clearly have shown they care only the minimum needed amount for classic with servers being such shit
---
I recently switched from Axe to Mace and the stuns are good for mitigating damage, and randomly interrupting spells, but sometimes mobs will get stunned while i'm trying to move them and i'll pull extra accidentally.
---
Axe works also with impale, while there's no real benefit aside from reduced damage to stunning mobs.
---
I switched because I got the Thunderfury mace from ZF and the 2h mace from Princess, while my axes were kind of behind the times.  It was a DPS improvement for me but not as much as it would've been if I'd gotten Gatorbite, and I'll probably go farm it up and switch back.  For PVP, maces might be ok, but solo PVP as a warrior is also a DPS race and often I'd rather have the crit than the stun.
---
I haven't done the math but I see Swords as being somewhere in between the two.  An extra swing isn't a crit, but it is damage.
---
I’m not a pro, but I read a bunch of guides telling me to Sunder Armor until enemy is 50% hp. Made killing mobs a lot easier imo. Idk how much armor an enemy has but reducing it by 1k in a few seconds isn’t a bad deal.
---
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" and then win the roll on the loot.
---
Why? Get an axe and call it a day. QS is not that good.
---
But in PvP only burst really matters. Classic meele pvp is all about oneshotting people with big crits. Those 10dps wont make any difference if you dont stack agi and at least crit once or twice before you hit them again with the seal.
---
Of course if you can do all that AND get spellpower that would be awesome, but palading gearing demands that you choose one or the other. And then critgear is the clear favourite.
---
Crit good, crit make damage and rage, warrior love rage.
---
Like I said, really no point in trying to have a conversation with you
---
Weakauras would add sound to certain scenarios but can’t change the sound of the current voices. Try searching around on wago!
---
Nah, it's an equiv of a trade scam, should be at least a temp ban.
---
Max range grenade, charge whirlwind, sweeping strikes, defensive stance, reactive cooldown if possible, Battle shout, demo shot for damage reduction, tab sunder, tab shieldslam if you are that spec, thunderclap for damage reduction as well.
---
Felcloth in Felwood from the Jadespire or Jaedenar are options, though I've noticed felcloth has dropped in price a fair bit in the last week or two.
---
You might also consider rep farming for Argent Dawn in EPG/WPG to prep for Naxx, or Timbermaw in Felwood if you want rep rewards.
---
Mara runs, tonight I hope to farm 1-2 eye of shadows to finish my gold farm and have some spending gold.
---
Or if they caught it in the middle of a stance change. That would look cool.
---
I think he got diabetes.
---
My satisfaction from healing comes from preventing my allies from dying, but that’s just me
---
I got my 60 main on Firemaw, but also decided to level a horde alt on Dreadmist, it seems like a nice realm.
---
Yes they can be batched but isn't decurse something that you can cast regardless of whether they actually have a curse?
---
Or blood rage
---
I just want new vanilla style content. I wouldn't mind going up to Wrath, I really enjoyed Wrath because that was the first WoW I really got to experience. Do I think the current Blizzard can do it successfully, absolutely not. I feel Blizzard is so far out of sync with their fans they will just ruin it.  
---
Maybe Classic will give some insight as to what people really want, be it retail or classic MMO style games. Classic+ or a completely new MMO is what I personally want.
---
Depends on your class, warriors can mainly do green quests (they are extremely slow at leveling), but yeah i do recommend doing all your green quests they give full xp. And later on you will find yourself running out of quests so just use them to level as long as you have them available.
---
This is the exact same model as my priest from back in the day. Before everyone knew dwarfs were the best race for priests. I stuck to my nostalgia
---
So about that hug, you want it now?
---
900g for the mount, you don’t have to buy the skill.
---
At that point you might as well just play on a private server...
---
The riding skill isn't split into two parts like later expansions. The training you got at level 40 will let you ride any wolf you just need one that goes 100%. The mount is then 900g flat with honored.
---
set particle density to 1 and prey the suppression room animates for its aoe
---
I figure quite a few of us will individually go in as pug members while everyone finishes leveling and getting attuned.  I'm just trying to have a general plan ahead for the next couple of months as we grow.
---
if you tab one too much you can shift+tab to target previoustarget
---
Really reaching.
---
That's why he would be so impressed.
---
I don't remember people doing that mistake back in the days, seems like a WoW Classic thing.
---
The defense is that nothing was forced. Op accepted paying it. That’s why you read your mail
---
You're fine doing arena/prison, but further in your aggro radius will be a problem and tbh if you're not well geared you'll be going oom more often than a higher leveled healer.
---
hey, I also press arcane power and troll berserk every 3 mins for maximum frostbolting!
---
The biggest reason is to build hatred for the alliance in horde players.  Getting ganked at the farm and while running back and forth between there and Tarren Mill by skull level players will do that for you.
---
I'd imagine making the itemization and talents accurate for every major vanilla patch would be a herculean task.
---
My bangs coming out of the front of my T2 mage helm (human female) look so dumb. Ruins what should be a pretty slick looking helm.
---
I was doing it at level 50, just depends on your tank I guess
---
I don't care about it personally. I want bloodfang and the sword, I can get a neck piece with my guild later
---
Might be hard to find a healer if you reserve the robes
---
Haven't thought of that. I'll give that a try too
---
Swifty, Mekill, Trigz, Monkeynews, Maitoz, Xn, Perplexity, Bloodskull, Maydie, Lezonta, Nyht, Payo, Esfand, Staysafe, Ipolylol, Mcgankinston, stormx, Uhvoidme, Goth
---
I’m at work right now so I’ll edit this list as the day goes on
---
Not for a very long time as warriors get priority.
---
I do know how fury/prot works. I am saying that too many warriors go fury/prot too early, without knowing how to play it. This leads to it being a meme spec unfortunately when it is really good for threat. I believe people should start out as prot, farm their pre-BiS and then go fury if they have the gear and is more comfortable tanking. 
---
I would argue that prot is way better in dungeons (imp revenge, Concussion blow, imp taunt, tactical mastery) and if you have problem holding aggro I don't know what to tell you. That said you can tank 5 man in full fury spec easily, I just find prot a lot better.
---
reason i set my warrior on the back burner... also getting to lvl 60 by grindin/dungeons is a nightmare ...
---
As an arms warrior, how long is Ravager relevant, thinking especially for dungeons and 3-5 mob groups.
---
K.
---
Yeah you’ll get it, even in vanilla on my server we had a paladin and a hunter with it.  The game is much easier 15 years on and there’s no doubt you’ll get a chance at it.
---
ofc u can , just farm enough gold to pay people off
---
Hunter can just FD -&gt; invis and others can lure the mobs to the end of the kiting path and then run to the ramp and jump on the raised ledge reset em.
---
Is this some kind of late April fools joke or something? Sheesh.
---
Spell damage increase came in cata I believe
---
Simply put: No.
---
Its the rarest and hardest weapon to attain in the game.  There is no way its just going to be given to a class that cant benefit from it. 
---
Even a rogue getting it is kind of absurd.  Its the best tanking weapon in the game bar none.
---
Tried that a few times myself. I'm 2/31/18 build, don't have imp FD.  I gave up after 2 hours coz I'd get toward the end then die and would have to start over. I'm full bis with 5/8 T1 on my hunter.  Dm trib is the only dungeon i need loot from though (elvin ring).
---
They're fucking dumb, Reed is arguably your 2nd BiS trinket until BWL. Keep the trinket, if anyone has an argument against it then link them this comment and ill happily do them some learnin'
---
It's simply my opinion, I don't see exploiting as skill, the younger generation clearly does.  I saw the shift in thinking sometime between end of life swg and early wow. That's when I noticed the change from most players intentionally avoiding the abuse of game mechanics to taking advantage of them and labeling it as skill.  It's been going on since gaming started but things like this weren't always viewed as acceptable much less claimed as skillful.
---
We actually tried this already while leveling.  Regrettably the other guild was simply hoping we would merge and when we didn't their GL pretty much quit the game.  I think that goes to show, choosing not to merge was a good idea though.
---
"Watch out for the milk!!" he ejaculated.
---
It's not that simple.  Vanilla WoW had a certain difficulty level for the vast majority of its life - then a couple late patches made it significantly easier.  So the version of Classic we have right now is not really the vanilla WoW that we experienced.
---
Don't get me wrong - I'm not crapping on Classic WoW.  I'm thrilled and loving it.  But re-tuning it to adjust to the patch version we play on in order to better re-create the vanilla experience would be kinda cool.
---
I mean sure I guess that would work, but offspec has a very specific meaning and the guy above was using it wrong.
---
There isnt even a clear path to "reverting" though, its useless to speculate about it as its highly unlikely for Blizzard to attempt doing it.
---
We are playing a RPG, having the best gear you can have is(for many people) a huge part of the game.
---
You can't say that, maybe people subscribed because they heard TBC is good. You can 't proof anything you say.
---
im at 6%.
---
Lmao 😂 200 per craft hahahahaha hahahahaha what a fucking scam y’all pay it because you let them fuck you over tell that sob to go suck a dick for that price and die on that hill never budging never giving up and see how fast that asshat stops charging 200gold per craft
---
Be a tank or healer.
---
Pull with a ranged weapon.  Pay attention to surroundings and don't pull into areas where you recently killed mobs because respawns will kill you. Pull to areas where no mobs spawn. Know leash ranges for packs of mobs.  If a mob winds up leashing back, that's ok.  You now know where you can pull him next time and where his buddies go back. Patience is key. If things go south, hamstring and run away.  Not killing that mob and wasting that 20 seconds you spent fighting it is betting than that 3 minute corpse run and 10% durability hit. Know your escape route so you don't run into more packs. Try to group for any quests involving a cave.  Caves are a warrior's mortal enemy because of respawns and not having an easy escape route.
---

Looking to level a warrior alt and supply it weapons/gear at the best breakpoints. Is anyone aware of a guide of good boe blues to buy to have them ready to go?
---
Tbh half the reason I finished my true faith was because it looked awful on a green troll lol.
---
Pvp ranks are on a dynamic ranking compared to all players on the server. If you want to rank up you need to be in the top X% every week. This means that there is no hard cap on how much honor you must grind each week, by design you must grind more honor than the majority of other players. This is a cycle that only pushes everyone to Grind even more and only the people who can play almost 24/7 (or account share) will get to the highest ranks.
---
Classic Pvp design wasn't very good, but still people appear to be hyped for it.
---
Great suggestion, I think this is where I will try.  Good loot tables on the blood elves (lots of BoEs and vendor greys) and also close to a Satyr camp to farm for Fel/Dark Runes.
---

I do it with like 200 spell power and 5600 mana. But I have issues with 2 packs at once so I just throw on my servant trinket and rotate pi, inner focus and servants on each pack. Make sure you put your back against a wall because their backstab hurt
---
arcane missiles !
---
It does, unless you use a macro that specifically has a rank in it.
---
There was never mention of casting a 3rd spell in this hypothetical scenario. It was just the 2 spells, presumably, back to back.
---
If we were adding a 3rd spell to the mix, then yes, you would be 100%. In this case, however, we are only concerned with the casting of two spells, fireblast and frostbolt.
---
Are you tanking it?
---
If yes, you just need to find a healer and some caster DPS or Hunters and hope they dont still want an HoJ.
---
If no, good luck, anyone tanking those runs are going after the same items you are.
---
What is damage control?  Overwatch 2?
---
And some of us want to be able to enjoy the game without being harassed by racist old men online.
---
Who would have thought?
---
So what I have done and found it A) Efficient B) Entertaining and most importantly C) Actually feel like a rogue and not an off-brand warrior.
---
What I did was during the early levels (pre 35ish) go a mix of all three, grabbing the most efficient talents as early as possible, things like extra crit in Ass, precision in combat etc, up until the point I could A) Get the talent for the extra 45%? Crit talent when killing a mob that gives xp/honor and B) Spec far enough into sub for Hemo. Now I believe this is around lvl 33. Now it's important not to make the switch straight away, because it's useless without a good MH dagger. Now in my case I bought my daggers; as much as people will crucify others for this, I found that with Skinning and Herbalism, I had a good cash stack. Even after buying a good MH dagger, I could still afford my mount by the 40 mark. Now I did get a bit lucky here and there but mostly it was mob grinding + skinning that netted me a good cash stack. Now that I had a good dagger MH, Improved ambush, + extra crit on kills, I got prep (this was purely for utility as I love PvP, but even for solo PvE content I found it quite useful). Now from this point you have two options, combat or assass. Assass seal of fate has always been appealing to me, but I think for the most part combat offers way to much power creep not to choose. I routed for zooming to Blade Flurry instead of early speccing Malice for the extra 5% crit (even though this is completely viable). You are able to get bladeflurry by 55, which is a super awesome talent especially when you start grinding end game dungeons for prebis or even just for solo questing. I opted for decreased evasion CD, and even when things turned pear shaped, I could comfortably 1v2 mobs up to 2-3 levels higher than myself, and it made downtime less frequent. Now by 60 I finished Malice. I think I finished with something like 7/21/23. 
---
Yes, combat will always be better DPS for PvE, but using this setup, I got through the slugfest that 45-60 was and had the most enjoyable leveling experience as a rogue I have ever had in my last 15 years of rogue main. I am in no ways an expert, especially since I have only really played assass exclusively, but I had fun using this, and if you ever get a great MH dagger and you just want to spruce things up a little, give this a gander. If it's not for you, it's a gold or two wasted no biggy. If you have any questions on getting specific talents at what lvl I can give you my personal route for your current lvl. Goodluck and sorry about the long post.

 (If anyone has done a 22/7/23 type build please also reply and tell me what it was like)
---
If you are on lucifron, we might be interested in trading leaves for eyes...
---
A warrior will probably get off as many attacks as his GCDs allow. He isn’t just auto attacking
---
No. Freaking. Way.
---
Looks more like a skexi from black crystal, imo
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
The number of guilds that killed cthun before naxx was probably less than 100, in a game with over 10 million players at the time.
---
Flasks help undergeared has nothing to do with skill
---
Much better, this I can follow!
---
Thinking about making a prot Paladin alt, I had one in WoTLK and main tanked everything...could a Paladin tank MC and beyond or is that just for prot warriors?
---
Stern... but fair.
---
You will never get TF period. It would actually lower your dps in raids then if you have a stat stick or two.
---
I do not use any addon for smart cast. The game does it automatically UNLESS your skills are in a macro that specifies a certain rank.
---
It should be. I miss the wild west days of D2 where you learned important lessons on not being an idiot or you paid the price.
---
Ahh yes, the announcement of a game they've developing for years at a conference they've held annually for years is "damage control"
---
**Fuck off**
---
YOU ARE the game time that has expired!
---
Nope we arent. Also we have infinity healers so we need a couple more eyes xd
---
ok let's put that way since you want to be dumb. You can always use more damage while more healing is wasted.
---
But with GDC being 1.5s that's realistically only one attack by the time your see the proc. I mean, it's a great ability, but sounds way better than it is. 3 crits is better than none!
---
Oh strat bracers? I guess the icons are the same..
---
I would bet 1000g that these scammers are the same one trying to sell 5L QotF as 6L in POE.
---
BlizzCon is planned months close to a year in advance
---
''painful and long instance''
---
Pummerler is the first boss you encounter by going through the backdoor, takes less than 2 mins per run
---
Instance starts.  Four mob pull.  You mark the four mobs with skull, x, triangle, and moon.  You tell the mage to keep moon sheeped and request the rogue sap triangle.  You let the group know that the kill order is Skull &gt; X &gt; Triangle.  Except, that the mage sheep pulled in the middle of you typing the kill order before the rogue could sap his target.  
---
Now all three mobs are beelining straight for the mage and you have zero rage.  The mage frost novas the mobs before they get to him.  They happen to be frozen right next to the priest, who then takes aggro and attacks from the mobs because that's what they do when they're rooted in place.  Priest AOE fears because that's what low level priests do in low level dungeons.  
---
In the middle of this, you've bloodraged for an initial rage boost, and use challenging shout so all of the mobs target you instead of the priest, but it's too late, three of the mobs are running all over the place.  The hunter - being helpful - decides that dead mobs can't attack the priest, so they multi-shot and end up breaking the sheep.  Your taunt and challenging shot are on cooldown, and the mob heads straight for the hunter who then feign's death.  This puts the aggro back on the priest who's been spamming heal on themselves.  
---
Now you've got to intercept in and mocking blow before the priest dies.  No problem, you've got this.  Except one of the feared mobs pulls a nearby pack and all of the mobs have varying degrees of damage on them with zero focus...
---
It's been changed to affect both healing and damage in one of the patches in vanilla, but the wording stayed the same for some reason. I'm fairly positive it affects both in classic.
---
Counterpoint; It's the Mages/Warlocks 2nd BIS as well. The existence of TOEP means that caster DPS have a higher trinket ceiling than healers until BWL for Rejuv Gem. Healers should have just as much of a right to roll on Reed against DPS because it is their 2nd BIS trinket until P3, same as everyone else.
---
I'm exited to play high, as elf
---
Is there any reason you don't pop berserker rage right before charging? I know it's quick but i've never liked the idea of swapping to berserker stance right at the beginning of the pull as that's usually when your spike damage happens. 
---
I have a macro that swaps me to battle stance and charges if i'm not in combat so I often find myself going into serker, popping rage then using my bstance/charge macro and swapping to defense instantly afterwards.
---
its fun in pvp though. but to be fair. most dps specs are boring in pve atm.
---
LOL
---
Your argument is valid and I don't feel your opinion is wrong, I just feel it's a waste of time.  You will change nothing White Knighting this or anything else.  Maybe it's my age but I just don't care.  Ignorant on the subject?  Nah, I'm just sick to death of you people screaming about how there should only be one proper way to exist and that all the evil should be scrubbed from existence.  Without the evil you cannot appreciate the good or even know what the good is.
---
use annihilator
---
I've found the lining up of mitigated multishot a lot trickier than it might seem. It works pretty well if you can set distances well enough to know when you're within range of your target but out of range of things you don't want to aggro, pull, or de-sheep. Turning to try to get the right angles for a dangerous mulitshot while within a dangerous distance seems trickier, though it could just be that I'm not as practiced in it as some people.
---
In fast teams using multishot as much as possible doesn't need to be held back once aggro is properly established, but I've also seen a number of more cautious teams that would crowd control more and then single target burn instead of AoE spamming. (I've also heard the case that AoE, though powerful, can be painful on the tank and healer if multiple targets enrage at the same time as opposed to one at a time.) I am aware that multishot is part of a standard rotation even in single target, but the same rules apply about having to zone enemies such that you don't pull badly, like targets that don't have pet aggro or elites that can pummel you if too many are active at once.
---
I use the term "rotation" for hunters' typical setup very loosely because both aimed shot and multishot are essentially just abilities that up auto attack damage that you're doing a lot of the time anyways. Yes, aimed shot is a channel which means you have to stand still, and yes shot weaving with swing timers is absolutely a rhythm based thing. IMO, I make the distinction between a rhythm and a rotation even though I understand people might not. As opined above multishot is dangerous in some situations, and aimed shot requires a specific talent path (even if it is one of the most popular and standard) to actually use. Thus there absolutely can be situations where a hunter does literally nothing more than autoshot. When I think of rotation I more think of things like mages setting up comboes based on ice and fire spells that need to be cast in a certain order. For hunters the order of aimed shot and multi-shot isn't THAT important. I myself sometimes like to save aimed shot for sniping a fleeing enemy or trying to burn past enrage HP ASAP, but I still think that's different from what a lot of casters do, or what tanks do to establish and maintain aggro etc.
---
Click on the "Normal(22)"
---
The cast fails in that case.
---
if you want to achieve absolute highest DPS in most fights, then warriors is the go-to choice, sure ignite mage can do a lot but thats not really "your" dps since its stacking from every other mage and its not really relevant until AQ40/NAXX. 
---
So in PvE I'd say warrior if you wanna smash the dps meters and if you like going absolute ham, no questions about it. However, they also require a lot of gear to actually do work so you'll be farming your ass off for all the BiS items. 
---
In PVP I'd say rogue is way more fun, they can wreck havoc in absolute trash gear due to cold blood and just abundance of cooldowns, and if you add gear ontop of that... yea you are gonna be a monster out in the world. Warriors are kinda meh in world situations unless you got a pocket healer OR all kinds of consumeables to remove roots/cc etc.
---
If you collect all in mailbox, it wont auto pay for COD will it?
---
Every class that can tank can also DPS or heal (and warriors also happen to be the best dps). It's not hard to swap between the two
---
Agreed. There's no way I'm going to retail.
---
put crusader on mirah's and a weapon chain on the hammer.
---
That depends on what you are doing.
---
I've found better sustain with judging Seal of Wisdom, then either Crusader or Righteousness. If I'm particularly mana starved I'll Seal of Wisdom on top. I hate drinking after every mob.
---
If it's low level or low health target I'll just run Righteousness.
---
Enjoy being poor!
---
You are damn right. There is no endgame now.
---
You could... thank those people directly... instead of posting here... where they are unlikely to see it.
---
Which is why report and not shame people into having your level of outrage. A huge leap was made on that last poster's moral character. That shit is not helping the situation.
---
Meh can have dps apply that debuff, but it’s a good option if you’re not threat capped. If you are, edgies+QS will still pump out more tps.
---
Only thing I am saying is that item that dropped belongs to the player who get most point during a roll (need). Thats it. Thats how game was made, thats how i think it should be played.
---
Did you play the beta?
---
Hunter yeah... What about everyone else?
---
You were prot needing on healing gear? How did that go down?
---
No, it's not. Especially because all you greedy fucks wouldn't stop needing the BoEs after you've already got every item for your BiS you could buy. So that argument falls flat.
---
It's just a sign of general kindness to let someone have an item he can actually use and will be fucking happy to receive. That's how I roll, and you know what? Being kind has paid off, because Stockade Pauldrons dropped in BRD and the whole group agreed that I should get them, since I'm a tank, and I'm also generally a nice person (in game). And I intend to repay that kindness, or better put, I always have and will continue to act this way.
---
But you're just dicks, so you neither give nor will you receive kindness like that. You're the ones misunderstanding the "Need/Greed" system, since you literally only "need" it to sell it. Which is also called being greedy. Sorry if the english language is too hard for you to understand this.
---
Yeah that was me. This is weird.
---
You wouldnt want to macro berserker rage, if you do id have to call you a bad warrior honestly. Reason is because the ability requires you to be getting hit for it to work, which isnt always the case, then on some mobs you want to save it for fear, same with pvp.
---
His name gave it away, I didn't insinuate anything.
---
I played a mage back in the day and kinda hated the frost bolt spam, so I trolled myself and made a warlock so I could shadow bolt spam.
---
Oh, yeah no. Im lvl 47 at the moment. Just going off from vanilla experience.
---
I agree. There’s no point for a healer to just waste time getting people their items when they won’t help you and kill stuff you need.
---
Then yes it's a batching issue.  And for whatever reason someone else is getting luckier with how batching is deciding that his dispell landed.
---
Who cares. You increase the speed of your kills by a couple of seconds.
---
Well put. 
---
I once mentioned in a comment about how Classic was not only about traditional, hard character progression. Servers are persistent and the economy actually matters. Your financial well-being, friends list when you need someone with a certain profession or skill, server reputation and overall health of your faction are all measures of progression that just aren't displayed with some progress bar. 
---
The game brings the back core of what MMOs used to be, that is, the requirement that you engage with the people and world around you in order to solve problems and progress.
---
Fair. I've only become vocal recently after having many people on our server deal with these jerks.
---
You have a point.
---
We’re not talking about leveling gear, we’re talking about best in slots. A warrior isn’t a ninja for needing on his best in slot if it’s leather or mail. He’s just trying to get his best dps in this phase. And he’s going to do more dps than a rogue would in that gear. So you can ninja and get like 2 gold out of plate you can’t use, but you’re a ninja. If a warrior needs on his bis and it happens to be leather, he’s not a ninja, he’s just trying to make himself better
---
You're probably fighting mobs too high for you. Try to stick to ones at least 2 levels lower than you.
---
And that's fine.  Go HAM.  My whole point was that the expectation of sinking hours for an unnecessary piece of gear is silly.
---
I want to reiterate.  This is about his expectation that all priests need to have Truefaith.
---
"I solo Hogger as a level 1 Rogue"
---
...with tons of enchants on your gear, fiery weapon, etc.
---
Neat, but not all that impressive.
---
If Briarwood was actually a difficult item to farm then I would feel bad. Briarwood is a very easy item to obtain if you just run 5-6 man Jed/Rend runs. But it's still pretty much BiS for you with the alternatives being even more difficult to farm and probably still not as good. Don't feel bad, but maybe offer to heal some Jed/Rend runs for the guy so he doesn't have to roll against another healer on it.
---
I don’t even know honestly haha haven’t done it in a long time
---
I doubt we hear anything about Classic at this Blizzcon.  Considering the phases are likely going to be released over a 18month-2year span, we still have atleast another year+ on just this version of classic.
---
You need a shadow resist gear set, mines at 228 with aura and I destroy good shadowpriests and most SL locks.
---
The only true issues if you’re a above average pvp pally is geared skilled ele shamans and frost mages that keep sheeping to reset fights. Everything else is easy in this phase assuming you’re a reckoning build with the necessary gear equipped vs certain matchups.
---
It's everything but fair, it's literally being a greedy asshole.
---
The original scam was to wrap the item as a present so the recipient wouldn't know what was in the box. And scatter good items as well so it became a gambling situation where players would pay the COD to see if they won. Scammers today have no class.
---
On the contrary I pug most instance till high level. Definitely seen worse players back in vanilla. Most folk know their classes or have played them before.
---
Good job ignoring my point entirely and continuing to justify being a loot whore  
---
If you're going to respond to me with a strawman argument, at least make it a good one.
---
LOL no its not three BiS pieces not even mentioned.
---
All good, I appreciate the suggestion and it definitely was somewhere I was looking!
---
Should probably sooth him.
---
Spoken like someone thoroughly enjoying their white privilege. Get your racist shit out of here, you pathetic excuse for a human being.
---
I wanted BC desperately before classic came out, and I never really understood any of the arguments *against* BC (from a Classic design standpoint at least), but now that the game is out i'm actually kind of split.  
---
I really really don't want flying, for instance.
---
Not on ally. Problazer was the only crafter until Wednesday when a guildie of mine (named Domo) got it in an MC. Before Problazer got it, there was a drought, no crafters for the helm because the only other crafters before him xferred off realm. Since Wednesday Domo has crafted many lionhearts  for free even though he could have also charged 200g. But everyone hates Problazer and the fallout has been quite hilarious. I caved and got my helm made by problazer literally days before Domo, and now his bad reputation is burning a hole in my forehead. I should have got my Lionheart Helm crafted by Bradley when he was still on realm instead of my epic mount.
---
I think its impressive! Just curious what buff did you have to pay someone 100g for?
---
You can't change the past, and whether or not you made a 'mistake' is obviously (based on the other comments) subjective.  But you can tell your guildie that you're willing to heal Jed runs for him while he farms it, and I bet he'd appreciate that.
---
95% of the time I use divine favour as a small mana pot, hardly required.
---
ahhahaahha
---
P2 release date, maybe. Other than that, don't expect anything, we already *have* a content plan.
---
Blizzcon 2020 is when they announce TBC Classic for Spring 2021.
---
I never thought about a Shadow Resist set, that's going a bit extreme haha. I normally do swap Aura's when I see Frost Mage/Shadow Priest but never thought about an actual gear resist set.
---
you're missing the point, it's either you gain 3 sec or you gain some more overheal as if you won't have enough already in MC. Please fucking use your brain 10 sec before writing again.
---
Right now because we're in phase 1 you can push 4 corruptions in most cases.
---
And the best part is: the whole set is dirt cheap. I am on a relatively expensive server from what I can tell and the whole set cost me like 8g. That is super fine considering how long I am going to wear these.
---
Yeah I would seriously pay to change my hairstyle to bald at this point....
---
You want to replace it with one of the 2H from Ulda or the hammer from mara princess.
---
No, use a fast dagger and Mugger's belt / ACLG if you absolutely need to have an epic weapon for tanking. Quel is hot garbage on orc.
---
99% of the lot tables that are up are incomplete to some extent
---
Well that definitely shouldn't disqualify you from a refund.
---
Full run with a 54 tank is something that would turn me away.  LFM BRD first half. Would be better.
---
Then yeah, that could drop the g/hr to make the run not worth if y want consistent, reliable income. Mara farming might actually still be more valuable (I assume warlock by your flair), even though it’s painfully boring
---
remember theres +100 hp enchants to head chest and legs. can prob get you over 4khp
---
Ret is best lvling spec. 
---
You can still heal in dungeons up till at least SM. 
---
Holy does no damage which paladins already struggle with.
---
Prot keeps you alive longer, but again, no damage. 
---
Ret is where its at
---
I got it off of some random flying bug in Tanaris
---
Lol a druid
---
The other guy was obviously a dick too. But him calling him stupid isn't that nice either. Like the other guy threatened to "report" him, but that's not enough to respond the way he did. Just saying.
---
Is that gonna be a bitch to level in the level 20 ashenvale area I am in now? The owl will probably be ultra squishy.
---
A guild only needs 2-3 tanks and they usually have 5-6 warriors atleast. Some are forced to dps. Also if you complain about no tanks, just make one yourself.
---
Oh yeah? What makes you think that?
---
Yeah, and thanks to Kang the Decapitor I have now purchased my best in slot pants and gloves.
---
Just trying to make myself better, fam. I love playing like a warrior! I take back everything I said. Need away! JUST GET BETTER! GET THAT BIS by ANY means necessary. Top those charts! 
---
I'm starting a warrior just so I can need everything without anyone getting mad about it. Name's Ninjaboi! I love Vanilla!
---
Ding ding ding.  My friends and I picked this server at random and somehow ended up with two of the most toxic guilds from the pserver scene.
---
Tank axes are very poorly itemized. Tanks want fast weapons and axes are generally the slowest weapons. By the time Doom's Edge and Crul'Shorukh are available Thunderfury should be on the table (unless you're exceptionally unlucky of course).
---
What an idiotic comment.
---
If that's how you justify being a selfish and shitty player than good for you, at least you're an honest scumbag.
---
"Yeah that's cool and all, but not that impressive. Next time try to do it in a way that's literally impossible" - what you sound like
---
It is worth tossing a little bit of money at AH to keep your gear semi-current as it will make getting gold more efficient and will therefore eventually pay for itself as long as you're getting pretty good deals.  In general, I search for deals on AH for any gear I'm wearing with a minlev 8 levels or more below my character level.  On my server, up until the 50s it's not too hard to find upgrades for reasonable prices, and remember that you're going to eventually be vendoring that gear too, so buying a new weapon for 4g off AH that vendors for 1g75 is really only a cost of 2g25.
---
I did not know that. I just knew that it wasn’t against blizzards TOS
---
That's not how it was.
---
Ah shit here we go again. Stop asking for changes
---
You know what they say...”people are people”
---
I prefer skill based game over a time-based game. Pvp should never be time-gated.
---
In world pvp you also LOS casts whenever possible. Arena is more about it's Fair and equal 2v2, 3v3, and better balanced and has a ranking system to determine whos best. 
---
The difference between a gladiator pvp player in TBC and a r14 in classic is exactly the thing. One thing you know hes a decent player atleast , r14 could be completely trash.
---
Okay Timmy, thanks for sharing. Now rebuff everyone with blessing of salvation please.
---
wow, look at the progressive humanist here, a real piece of art, every grandmas dream to be her grandson.
---
When we rolled into raid on Tuesday there were over 200 ally guarding a black rock mountain. You guys have some of the best raiding guilds in the game right now you all are fine!
---
Noob trap weapon, sorry you wasted your time
---
If Imp shadow bolt procs, you should be trying to get a shadowburn or deathcoil in, it is also the best time to re-apply your corruption. Debuff conditional rotation
---
thats great to hear. trying not to get discouraged with all the corpse runs. just started a couple hours ago haha
---
Literally everyone
---
Fuck you're
---
Am I doing it wrong if I tend to use kidney shot more often than Eviscerate?  (In roughly lvl 50 dungeons atm)
---
They really just need to add Khara, Hyjal, a new version of the BELF zone, and Ulduman. Do something to similar to ZG and make it content that doesn't power creep nax (make them fit in between tiers) and maybe offer something similar to the enchants or something that ZG did. After that every few years just rerelease classic and spread out the phases. People keep trying to say that it will get stale but me and many others have been playing vanilla for the last decade almost on private servers that come up, we play, they close, move to the next one, etc. They really could just keep re-releasing classic every few years. Classic + WITH Khara and Hyjal would be a plus.
---
COMPLETELY agree
---
it lists 3 or 4 options for every slot. which ones is it missing?
---
I've done it without any raid gear and some greens. You just need to remember two things: patience and placement. You can survive almost any situation as long as you plan your feigns accordingly. Patience is letting the patrol walk past because dying and starting over takes a lot longer.
---
For horde. Get some healers and go to darnassus and fight their faction leader, will take about 8-12 hours for anyone to notice you're there
---
Cresent
---
You only get 5 resets per an hour
---
I assume no thrash blade for most, as they'll likely have dal rend's or a raid sword. Of course with thrash blade it becomes even more important. And my numbers were an absolute guess. 
---
That said, your numbers come out relatively similar to what I guessed. You're assuming every sinister strike is horribly timed when it's ignored. That's just not the case. Many sinister strikes will land within the first 0.5-1sec following a main hand swing, just by accident. How many? I'm not sure, would take a lot of log investigation of those that reset perfectly, compared to those that don't. And, those that are more inexperienced may also accidentally cap energy waiting for a weapon swing, and miss an energy tick.
---
So again, of course it causes an increase to perfectly time the sinister strikes just after your main hand swings, but the advantage it gives is overestimated.
---
It's been ages since I've had to do it, but I think the best thing to do is go fight mobs that are \~4 levels below you. You can kill them quickly and the owl will get decent XP. Could be wrong on all that.
---
It will be. Your best bet is to bring it on a few Deadmines runs, they catch up much faster in dungeons.
---
Yep, 40 was the breakpoint where it felt like I was no longer in danger when soloing.
---
Still slow as hell to kill things though.
---
I wish WoW could hold me for more than some months.
---
I log in now just for raid days.
---
How people can be addicted to this and lose their life over it? I think they would get addicted to any shit, gambling, hoes, etc, back in the day.
---
Yeah and my brain tells me who gives a shit in fucking molten core. When the content requires me to try then I will try.
---
It's likely because the groups that are looking for healers are looking to skip some of the trash pulls, and the aggro radius of a level 51 character in BRD is pretty big.  So nothing about your ability to heal.
---
It's crashing on my server like a junkie coming off of a high.  I play on Herod (Horde) and have seen maybe 5-10 bots on the alliance side. Mostly Hinterlands and Arathi.  I either kill them or try and kite them to a town.
---
always play bald characters for this reason
---
See if there are any hunters that will let you come and watch. I've brought 4 hunters with me that have asked.
---
where have you been for the past few years?
---
only hopes and prayers are allowed these days
---
Jaina at theramore is also bosslevel, and not many people around to stop you. You can probably get all the way there unnoticed with a single invis pot aswell
---
So what, like in Vanilla almost nobody will flask until the end.
---
You say that until it's 4 pyroblasts to the face.
---
And they get downvoted
---
This is why I rolled pally - No way I'd end up with a raid tank spot (too casual), but I can heal the shit out of raids with as holy/prot, while still being an awesome tank for 5 mans.
---
you couldn’t do this to save your life.
---
Do you skip everytime you dont get the mage?
---
I wouldn't say it wasn't good, but I do see why some people might want to keep Classic the way it is, or at least not want BC since that's when they started to prune some really cool stuff from the game.  That being said, I think you're kind of embellishing the scarcity of NPCs in Outland.  I won't lie and say I remember all the quests and what they were like, but I do remember some and I remember how little of a difference I saw in the game at that point.  
---
Regardless of what they do, people will leave.  BC players will leave if they don't release it, and Classic players will leave if they do. They've said they'll do what's right for the community when the time comes but I have no idea how they're going to interpret what that means.
---
Sword Spec is the best. First off the extra swings can crit so any extra benefits from crit still apply.
---
Second Sword Spec is 6% instead of 5%.
---
The main drawback is that axes tend to be the slowest weapons.
---
Oooh an interesting idea. 
---
A man can dream :)
---
found this game 1.5 months ago. at the age of 30. So i'm wondering where my life is going to take me
---
Paladins can tank any fight that doesn't need to be taunted through BWL at least. AQ and Naxx for similar fights are doable but need very good gear overall and might need more time to build up threat.
---
When you create an auction, you set the starting bid
---
Something like that I had in mind, just thinking is there any way to include reverberation in there, and maybe prefer -4% manacost to 2% damage
---
After geting some hit% gear on my 60 I've respecced to 21/0/30 (after being 11/8/32) and am loving it. I am a force to be reckoned with in PvP, and am able to heal in MC/Ony/Dungeons as well as DPS if we have too many healers. I've given up the tanking role to our more competent warrior brothers due to having no taunt. I just rolled a warrior alt for tanking.
---
I’m not quite sure what people are expecting to hear. I’ve seen a lot of people expecting Classic announcements, but there isn’t anything for them to discuss. Maybe a hard date on a phase or two? It’s a fifteen year old game with a fifteen year old content plan.
---
You are what we call a low-life, scumbag loser.
---
I like the showcase of the buffs/pots/bandages/gear that it took to accomplish this. 
---
I think that what most people have a problem with is the title of the video/post, it's disingenuous. For you to accomplish this feat, it required help from other players rather than just your own skill.
---
I don't think people would stop playing retail if they at least made itemization better. There's a lot about retail that I like that I would hate if they reverted back to how it was in classic. The reason I'm currently playing classic over retail though is because itemization sucks in retail. I don't care about my gear in retail. There's more I would change but itemization is huge and I think that's something they can always change.
---
I do not think I would have been alive today.   
---
So... yeh?
---
The halloween one, you gotta kills a 60 elite near undercity
---
Really? I use it as a minor oh shit button all the time.  And I try and save it for those more risky pulls like SM cathedral on the first pull after you open the doors. Or the long corridor right before final boss of Library.
---
On top of that it just helps smooth things out when tanks are moving at a decent speed. Gaining back 1/5 of my mana and healing the tank for north of 1200Hap in one spell is really nice
---
Yo always dawg!
---
Can Agree. Frost or Elemental PVP is awesome!
---
For me, the biggest trick to warrior leveling was running away with hamstring.
---
Pull 3 mobs, hamstring 2, run away while attacking the 3rd. The other 2 will eventually reset.
---
I just want my blood elves again.
---
Shamans are usually grouphealers with chain heal? Only heal talent I see mattering a lot is that -0,5s cast time to healing wave but without need of singletarget heals in raids it should be okay I guess
---
Is that what's showing up for me when I see other people's auctions?
---
Apparently 1.70 is very slow

So quick to anger, you petulant child.  Get back in the drive thru, people are waiting for their food.
---
We had a newish rogue spend use his #1 spot on loot priority when both bindings dropped. Our raid leader/main tank had been waiting months for even just one to drop, but hey, those were the loot rules.
---
Didn't stop him from gquitting along with 1/3 of the rest of the raid, though.
---
Alright? We all fished before, what's the point of making a post about it?
---
So like guy, if you haven't taken anyone else up on the offer to get you game time let me know.
---
I get being in a place where 15$ is the difference if you eat or not, but I got you fam.
---
OP calling someone stupid is 'not that nice'.  These are your words.
---
Then you call OP 'quite a dick'.
---
What kind of double-standard nonsense is this?
---
I'm over my short stint with classic and wow in general but the only difference is that my place is a little cleaner and my gf yells at me a bit less.
---
hf running around in holy, a spec not good for anything in the game yet. I'm not sure that you understand what holy is for or why people will use it in raid tbh. Your go to spec should be disc.
---
It used to have a cast time and forgot it was changed to instant. Still strong for a 1.5 sec cast but something that you could interrupt. Wasn't until wrath it was instant.
---
I dunno. For raiding it doesn't seem to useful for a heal. (Least for BC and Wrath. Can't speak for the others.) As a BE holy pally I didn't have issues with mana and could spam heal forever. (Though my PvE set was high end so probably very useful when people were still gearing.) If things got rough could always arcane torrent for mana. PvP it would be pretty nice on the instant cast version so long as you didn't have a form of mortal strike on you.
---
You play how you wanna play, it's that simple.
---
zf/mara/dm depending on class/skill level

mages can do brd
---
I don't know exactly how your group situation was, but being OOM every 3 mob pull is pretty normal for me. I roll a Troll Priest as a healer and whenever I run a dungeon in my level area, I gotta drink a lot. And I mean A LOT. After every pull basically. Which is why I get tilted by Tanks instantly pulling after the last enemy died. Or when I tell them to wait for a rebuff, I buff everyone, mana completely emptied and the tank just pulls the next enemies. And they then usually are surprised we wipe because I had 0 mana when they pulled five mobs.
---
I am not sure though whether I am even using my spells efficiently or if that is the reason why tanks keep pulling without waiting. Because maybe with other healers they don't have to wait that long. Since I am new to the game I honestly don't know if I'm doing okay.
---
Despite what everyone says, he is not going to get banned. I cant be arsed to look into the ToS, but when this did happen to me back in 2006, when I actually got fooled, their response on the ticket was that I accepted the COD message, and the deal was therefore over.
---
No matter what you write, the Cod asks as a contract. You can clearly see that you are buying 6 Small Lusterous Pearls for 155g.
---
They might have changed, but regarding my trust in Blizzard and bans, this guy wont get anything. As a comparison, I got 30+ death threats over a span of 2 weeks from a mage who I disturbed while AoE farming which I continuously reported and even sent a ticket about.
---
If that guy wont get banned, nothing other than exploiting or spreading hate propaganda in general channel will.
---
Wow that sounds a lot like the QS
---
Undead has the best PvP racial. But orcs have giant shoulder armor so it’s a toss up.
---
Not satire. Think about it. why the fuck would you use a keyboard and dedicate 4 buttons in prime positions?  Hell, even if you are that stupid, at least use ESDF as your movement keys, look at all the new options you can reach with ease and you have your fingers on the normal typing position.  IDIOTS
---
Yeah that's very true. We had a fury warrior with Edge of Chaos and TF come with us for rep runs in AQ40, he would pull aggro on every fight so we eventually made him switch to a different offhand. 
---
I PvPd with him a lot, he was an absolute animal in WSG.
---
If you're fighting a mage or warlock I'd save your ES for interrupting a sheep or fear.
---
Get some spirit gear. It helps.
---
Thanks a lot! And indeed now the even harder parts begins, but I'm ready for it! Bring it on😎😎
---
Damn dude, huge congrats!
---
Ok. You’re right. I didn’t realize people memorized the hair color and facial tattoos of so many other characters.
---
I just pity you. I think you may have suffered an aneurysm.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Why stamina?
---
Seal of command proc scales with attack power, not spell power. However, the judgement component does scale with SP. Seal of righteousness procs are SP and the judge is also SP which is why when people stack int and spell power for dps they put points in improved seal of righteousness and skip command and use a very fast weapon. Whether AP or SP is better is a never ending debate
---
Eye of divinity with a guild that runs 13 priests

Can’t wait for BGs
---
Yeah I forgot to mention that, my war was my first char on my server so I didn't have that luxury. A level 5 dagger with fiery on it would likely last you a decent amount into your teens. I'm not a huge fan of the skinning knife fiery weapon as that doesn't allow the use of weapon skills, but a level 5 dagger wouldn't be bad since you could potentially use it on a rogue/hunter/shaman/druid to power level you to 10+

If you don't use the Suit to talk to the last guard he doesn't trigger the item. (I'm guessing you just avoided him with FD or something)
---
There may be a way to get this item, I believe if you get the king buff, go talk to the guard, then go to the mage to get the tribute.
---
I am being cursed lol
---
No I'm asking why did you even post this?we all like something in WoW, if we all made posts about it that would be stupid, Makes no sense. Basically spam, just like people posting about their cats or dinging level 20
---
lol im telling you no need to rush anything, im not the best at PVP but I am constantly dueling shadow priests and warlocks trying to figure out why the hell my arcane intellect is dissapearing before I get destroyed by fear and dots. Warrior struggling to remain relevant, take some falls so you can get back up my guy take it easy
---
idk
---
I think mostly when I refer to efficiency, I mean I don't care about the most efficient way to level, maximizing my play time to get the most out of all my spells, buffs, potions, planning my quest runs to minimize doubling back, figuring out the best quests and dungeons to level as fast as possible, etc. I play for small spurts here and there in between the ongoings of my life.But of course I want to use my hp and mana and spells efficiently.  Maybe that is what he is referring to?
---
ah, hmm, do you known which patch it was? if it was the same patch that is 1.10 right? 
---
so we don't have the naxx blues, but we DO have the upgrades of existing blues.
---
I wonder what exactly the difference is, I know that BRE went from raid assist item to BiS with the armor reduction changes, but what else changed.
---
My guess is he was guild farming and leading.
---
Mics scrolling battletext is your friend my man.
---
Bow skill isn't even that good for DPS lmao
---
Yeah. If I get a week where Ony and MC resets line up I'll gladly respec but most of the time it's Wed Sun Wed Sun... Can't jump into DM spec just for that!
---
Did you know that you can take video in game with both nvidia and and video cards.
---
Are you trying to say you could post a picture of these peoples characters faces and people would know it was specifically them? I've never heard of like 85% of these people, the first one from your other post included.
---
Both are strong PvP choices, you could make the argument for either. PvE Orc has the advantage.
---
2 blues off boss, and 2 blues in chest.   With 2-3 greens and half a dozenish pots.
---
Everything you've asked for is available in classic, unless you're looking for something literally similar and not those exact addons, they exists. The UI is your call, I use bartender but I know some folks would rather have ElvUI. Most of the addons you would have in retail are in classic.
---
&gt; 10 stacks for 10g 10s
---
Thats vendor price.

If you offer to buy runecloth in trade for fucking vendor price (Like a lot of spammers do for some reason) you legit deserve to be scammed.

There are so few Raiding spots for a tank bro. I know I’m going to be raiding as Fury as pretty much all guilds have their MT/OT by now. Not even bothering to put together a tanking set
---
If you search solo incendius on YT, there's lots of guides
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0
---
Can you explain further?
---
&gt; Yeah but classic WoW has a shelf life. People are tearing through the content at incredible rates and sooner or later people are going to look to Blizzard and say "well now what..?".
---
Like evey private server before classic wow opened? No the game is fine, you're the type of guy that said wow would be dead on the first month.    
---
Personally if they keep moving fast I'll bail, I paid for a classic experience, not this crap. Speed running the expansions in order to scam as much money as they can.
---
Until the mid-high 40s. End of Uldaman or Maraudon.
---
If you want to look a little farther ahead than P2, P3 will most certainly lead to extremely rare twink items skyrocketing in price.
---
I bought Staff of Jordan off of some guy advertising it for a 100g. He wanted his 40 mount. I bought that up so quick, because eventually it will be worth at least 3-4 times that, depending on your server. I also had the gold to spare as I've been fortunate on drops when farming.
---
Of course, it could turn out to be a bad investment as anyone who wants to twink could be working towards those items right now. But hey, I'm betting that someone will want it bad enough, and at the end of the day - no risk no reward.
---
Hate shadow priests as a tank. Mind blast is ridiculous aggro
---
Farm it in the morning. Got myself 8 of em today in 2h and asking for hints in chat (paid 2g per blood). During the day you have to many noobs looting the blood who can't use it and do not know what is for or even people farming it before they got the carapace.
---
Not at all
---
What type of character are you going to buy a leveling service for this time around?
---
someone has to parse that low, might as well be that dude
---
Which is better DPS for ret?:
---
[Twig of the World Tree](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13047/twig-of-the-world-tree)
---
[Seeping Willow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12969/seeping-willow)
---
Seeping Willow has no stats... but it does have 12 more weapon damage. And it does have chance on hit to do some AOE damage and reduce states... it's a confusing choice for me given:
---
1. I don't know what the procs per minute is, and,
---
2. I don't know, when it says that it will hit all enemies within an 8 yd radius... if it will accidentally hit mobs that may not be in combat with my group, or ones that are CC'ed.
---
We’ll swap with you, haha! We’re about to start selling Eyes due to the absurd rng we’ve had
---
I mean it's not the coolest thing I've ever seen, but this is definitely pretty cool. Had never thought to do this hahah that's interesting. 
---
So many hate comments? It might be too early in the morning and alot of these complaints are from ppl that have been playing all night, fatigued and restless. Nerds.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/prat-3-0/
---
Giving shamans to dps for mana tide? You mean like hunters?
---
On a more serious note: shamans usually go into melee groups for windfury. If you have excess shamans you can put them with the hunters or warlocks or you make one more melee group and mix the hunters in. If you then still have shamans leftover somehow... Yes I guess they can mana up your moonkin. 
---
It is just not a realistic scenario. Might as well have the resto druids innervate the moonkin/electric and see if that helps.  
---
Which it won't.
---
Ele's is okay if you desperately want more shamans but heavily held back by lacking itemisation and no curse to remove resistances. Moonkin is just bad unless you got no other druids and you're keeping him around so he can go resto in naxx. But even if he's gonna do that why isn't he resto yet and why would you give him loot?
---
Looks intense
---
Mark and thorns do for me in my Druid... not sure what add on would be doing it if any.
---
Mine still works from 2008!
---
sure but the gm might think to himself "if he is that dude he won't raid with me".
---
And all currency corrupts people so easily.
---
QED
---
You sound like an ass lol

&gt; able to generate shit
---
&gt; MOP
---
The panda thing was most definitely shit.
---
What my guild did the first time when only a few of us had it was go in between night 1 and night 2 to clear trash and douse the flames so we had enough for the 2nd actual raid night to douse the rest. So:
---
Some on raid night 1
---
Trash clear and more douse (non scheduled night)
---
The rest on raid night 2
---
I don’t think it’s too hard to code floating combat text in “3D space”. You don’t even really need to project it in 3D. 
---
All you need to do is find the location of the player you’re healing, and look at the location of your camera. Then scale the number size accordingly, and place it above the head of whoever you healed. 
---
Probably easier said than done. But it doesn’t seem difficult at first glance.
---
&gt; Accidentally shot at one of the mobs for the Hunter quest in Un’Goro, which I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to do, then the guy messages me “reported” like a 12-year-old. 
---
Maybe he was trolled for hours? Nah, nevermind right? You're the poster, so you have to make the other guy an idiot.
---
Your weapon damage is what is going to carry you early as a warrior as you mostly do white hits, I find Stam and spirit are far more important to an early game warrior than strength, at least until you're 20ish probably. If his goal is to buy a BOE weapon he's not going to have trouble killing anything so he'll want to be able to chain pull as much as possible which is where stam/spirit/bandages come into play.
---
Reminds me of Shadowbane
---
It's just as good for holy paladin as it is for mage or lock so I would expect a loooot of competition when rolling on it but good luck. I just got finkles lava dredger and am gonna be happy with it so I don't have to piss our casters off lol
---
If you dont care for raiding, I would try to fit the aoe grind talents in your spec, meaning no winters chill.
---
&gt; Instant attacks which trigger overpower more made it so much easier.
---
I remember in vanilla I had a lvl 19 warrior twink whose only strategy was to spam hamstring until I got a dodge, at which point I proceeded to delete them with an overpower.
---
I was constantly looking for rogues for this reason only.
---
Yeah.  I don’t know what I would have occupied my time with.
---
Drinking and women?  Maybe I would have joined a fraternity and balled out of control?  Would have been more fun probably.
---
Shadow priests do, but you might have 1 in a raid.  
---
Rank 1 SW:P 4 times to get Shadow Vulnerability built up, then max SW:P.  Take 4/5 improved mind blast to get the CD down to 6 seconds, then you can do 2 mindflays for every 1 mindblast while reapplying SW:P when needed.
---
I make 20-30g per run just off vendoring. If a ring, staff, or sometimes cloak drop that's another 25-50g depending on item (ring usually 30, staff usually 50) and multiple can drop. I can also sell the mana pots at the end for 13g a stack. 
---
You can fit in about 3 runs an hour (idk what you mean by nerfed? Seems just as easy still). At the lowest you're making about 70-80g an hour, at the highest you can make easily around 150g an hour and I still have plenty of buyers.
---
On top of that you get book drops and I've gotten Foror's. I'm fuckin rich from DM tribute runs, at this point I just do them for fun.
---
Making furys use Annihilator is a pretty big fuck you to the DPS since it's Main hand only. Tanks should definitely be using it.
---
Should be till you can get the T2 set chest from Nef.
---
I must be a rare breed it seems. I prefer signing in through the client as Battle.net uses too many resources that I prefer to use on other multitasking programs.
---
No, but you can run interference in front of their kiting path so they can ignore the other mobs around.
---
You can check in the pets profile page manually.
---
Yeah but you gotta be able to move them.  No one really needs flasks right now for MC.
---
BWL is fairly easy too.  Maybe for aq40/Naxx but I think the margins will shrink by then
---
I had a similar experience in the Eastern Plaguelands the other day. Questing on my 58 holy priest I met two Horde around level 43 and 45 (priest and shaman) running past Darrowshire. 
---
Being way too low to be in this zone, I assumed they were running to Lights Hope for some reason. I escorted them the whole way killing and fearing everything they pulled (there was a lot) 
---
Should have logged an alt after and asked why they were there but hey, felt good to help.
---
I think that's great.
---
Some of these commentors need to chill out and go outside or something, I thought the classic crowd are supposed to be less elitist and stuck up than retail.
---
More or less everything but Hunter/Druid loot &amp; Warrior T1.
---
13 o.O. We run 4 holy, 1 shadow. We've gotten the eye 3 of the last 4 weeks. Our other guild raid team I think has seen 2 of 4 weeks.
---
A proper raiding shadowpriest should only have enough points for shadow weaving, while still grabbing nearly all the relevant healing talents. 
---
Going sufficiently in shadow for pvp just makes you a shitty dps in raids, worse than cat dps. Even the best parsing spriest is around the 60th percentile of the actual dps classes. Meanwhile a 13/18/20 spec can heal basically as well as a regular disc priest sans power infusion.
---
Otherwise, just own up to the fact that you're bringing a pvp spec to raids, and have fun.
---
You must have immediately pulled aggro.
---
Good thing they wont ban.
---
I accepted a COD Righteous Orb deal, knowing that he would try this (This is legit the oldest fucking scam in the book) just so I could report it and try it a few weeks ago.
---
Their answer was flat out: "Sorry this happened to you, COD-deals are binding, always check what you get. We cant help you". Note that I did not even accept the deal, and was very clear that I did not fall for the scam, just that this guy was trying, and all they did was say "Sorry for your loss".
---
Blizzard doesnt ban anyone for anything outside of spreading hate propaganda in trade, exploiting and real money trading. The rest is fucking free game.
---
Why is it misleading?
---
QS is not phase 4 and its proc is very frequent.
---
QS is overrated though. Its only the best for mitigation. If youre not dying Eskhandars is the best tank weapon.
---
subjet:Righteous Orb(6)
---
pretty sure this enough evidence to ban him
---
We get no love :(
---
At least we have PvP :)
---
I agree for sure
---
I usually log on at 7pm (after dinner) and play until midnight, probably 5 days a week. I have a full time job (career), friends, and good family. Sometimes, on a weekend day, I binge it. In my experience, playing WoW has been perfectly compatible with a balanced life. 
---
Get yourself to a spot in life where you don't have to work after dinner, and then go for it imo.
---
Just stop by the barber shop in a major city, oh wait.......
---
Same, I got the 2nd one, but at this point, we're 5/5 and it's now seeming less rare than ever hah.
---
What am I going to use AOE grinding for at 60?
---
The only set person in my group is my healer (my wife, we've been playing mmos together since before wow existed).   However, I do generally run with only guildies.  They don't have any mercy on us tanks, they open up right behind my charge (as a friendly "NO MERCY ON THE TANKS" thing.....not being noob-assholes).  This rotation will establish a base level of threat pretty quick on all targets.   I also basically always mark at least one priority target with skull, so depending on the pull I'll sneak in a revenge or sunder on the skull before doing the shouts.  
---
I also put thunderclap and WW as optional because sometimes, for the very reasons you're pointing out, you need to get out of zerker and into defensive QUICKLY.  In that case it's more like Charge-&gt;Zerkerstance DURING the charge-&gt;zerker rage-&gt;defensive-&gt;shouts/sunder/revenge.   Keeps stance dancing minimal.
---
Yep, I'm not Op though, most people aren't gonna wanna record the video file, save it then upload it, when they can do it with a phone and upload much easier and faster. 
---
  I don't like it as much as the next guy but what are you gonna do?
---
As a horde your primary quests in the zone are:
---
1) Kill farmers at this town
---
2) poison the dog of said farmers
---
3) kill the town blacksmith, his apprentices, and steal his ore
---
4) invade the mine, kill a bunch of miners and the foreman 
---
5) invade another mine, kill more
---
6) invade the town again, steal the town charter, kill a bunch of officials
---
7) kill important people at basically all of the aforementioned locations
---
8) go to dalaran crater, kill some prisoners before they can be interrogated, 
---
9) at Dc, kill a bunch of human wizards and their elementals 
---
10) gather a ton of stuff for the Apothecaries, so they can make horrible poisons and plagues.
---
11) charge a dead wizards magical staff and use in it the Southshore graveyard to turn him into a human hating super zombie 
---
Not much for the alliance to do here. With all of that in mind.
---
Going oom on a single 3 mob pull.... is horrendous.
---
The only time you should go oom on a single pull is if it's a big aoe pull. And if it's a proper aoe group with multiple mages, you still wouldn't go oom since they're being CC'ed.
---
So does that mean that the 5 man Onyxia video is worthless, because they had buffs from other classes and hundreds of gold in consumes? Should every accomplishment be done naked?
---
Here is what you do. Have a main that you go at your own pace with, and then have an alt that you level with a friend. Just agree if you are both on you level your alts together. Then if your schedules dont line up you can work on your main and not have to worry about keeping your quest logs levels perfectly aligned.
---
If you’re the guys that popped 8 dapper charges on a mostly AFK raid, then yes!
---
See you in a phase 2 friend. ;)
---
He will 100% get banned. Scamming is against the ToS. You can also get banned for saying "let's all roll greed" then rolling need. Guy in my guild got banned after he did that with some epic while leveling. Only for like a week but still.
---
Dont be a mouth breather.
---
Any of the epic one handed weapons. Weve had two spinal reavers and 4 obsidian egded blades already but not a single one hander while almost every warrior runs fury now.
---
effort=tryhard=bad is basically the motto of this subreddit apparently. The front page posts are literally a competition over who can be the most casual player.
---
I set my buyout to like 21.49 and min bid to 5g&amp;change, so I think that's a pretty good range to see what someone will actually pay for it
---
Nice man, whatever works for you. Lots of warrior players took this comment pretty personally for some reason.
---
Fury warriors can go fear immune for 65 consecutive seconds if they really want to.
---
Berserker Rage -&gt; Deathwish -&gt; Berserker Rage -&gt; Recklessness.
---
Is it just kings or any Greater Blessing?  Can I slap down a new Salv blessing on the 25 mages in my raid for just as much fake taunt threat?
---
You skipped Cataclysm, and even then, Wotlk is about the max anyone would actually agree on.
---
Cataclysm relaunch would be a hilarious fail.  Considering they re-did the map, you'd get a classic... not-classic experience?
---
Sure, There is a Lot more to cs but the scoreboard incentivize kills, not support players. In cs that is.
---
Its really not if you compare to other rings hunters have available in BWL and onwards.
---
The hit ends up being wasted in optimal gear setups. Tanks make the best use of the hit, followed by rogues.
---
Good guilds give this ring to tank warrior/druids,  then rogues, then hunters (but its really not great for them)
---
Even with top notch equipment and consumables it is still terrible. I leveled my priest faster than my warrior. On Priest most of the time I was behind 20 levels on gear as I didn't do any instances at all.   
---
On warrior I was using scrolls, pots, buying new gear every 5 lvls.
---
I think what keeps you relevant and different is that you're playing a human male priest. :P I'm no min/maxer but you're definitely the first I've seen. With Benediction no less! Gratz.
---
Yes. Just retail players being mouth breathers.
---
Why is that? I have it now and I usually get 5 stacks up on bosses before they die. Obviously it's not that useful on trash, but dps on trash isn't that important in 5-mans anyways.
---
What is the point of this? If you want to enter a new zone do you have to /w the GM of the controlling guild or something? Do ye have guild wars to take each other's territory between Horde and alliance? How does a specific guild own a city and it's zone?
---
Dude same! Once you get your warrior to 15 it’s not SO bad.
---
In vanilla my guild just assigned points to gear. Highest dkp got the gear if they wanted it and paid the price. If no one wanted the gear it got DE'd. Items that weren't BiS were always much cheaper than BiS, so most people would toss a few DKP in to take the small upgrade instead of hoarding. When it came to things like set bonuses, Class leaders were allowed to dish out extra DKP if you passed in order to let someone else hit an important milestone (capping a stat or getting a set bonus). You still had the option of getting the loot if you wanted, but most people opted to take the chance to be top dog for the next 2 drops.
---
It matters because it keeps you alive. If you aggro multiple mobs having 20 more attack power isn't going to keep you alive, having 100 extra health might. Leveling a warrior is never going to be "fast" you can however make it less painful by not minimizing your death runs, which is why having a high life pool is important.
---
Never thought I would be reminded about delta P in wow thread.
---
That’s hogwash!
---
Funny you should ask... Really bad, actually. I’ve heard of guys levelling Paladins to level 21 in just under 13 and a half hours. /played
---
Gotta step up your game. By a considerable margin too. Better luck next time.
---
Oh damn I knew that but never considered mind flay...!
---
IDK how you plan to curse of exhaustion kite when intercept, hamstring and piercing howl exist.
---
In many years in vanilla I never once saw a lock successfully kite a warrior.
---
Same happened to me since yesterday. I was playing the game just fine since the launch, and now all of a sudden, huge loading times everywhere.
---
This is not related to SSD health as all my games and programs are installed on the same one without any issues.
---
There's another way?
---
Well, I did expect it - still a great accomplishment tho
---
If barb blade, Rod or mace and toothpick drop yeah. 30g vendors. If 5 mana potions drop, yeah it's 13g a stack (10 on my server). If your clients are already outside, yeah it's fast.
---
So yes, we are all very aware of ideal conditions, thank you.
---
Where the hell did the idea that the tank has to lead the group even come from?
---
I’ve been in lots of parties vanilla and classic where the tank is a member of the crew, not leading the way. Just doing his role. 
---
Most raid leads aren’t the tank either.
---
You forgot warlocks.
---
What's not okay is getting offended.
---
We’ve got MC and Ony down to under 3 hours total, we’re desperate for BWL release now.
---
I have Edgemasters now, need a couple more Arcanite bars for my Lionheart helm then I’m going Fury prot for fun and farming :)
---
7/8 here I think. Somehow only 3 of them stayed in the guild.
---
When you log back in, Blizz bills your account.
---
If you are looking for displays of skill classic wow PvE is not where you will find it.
---
This reminds me of the Impractical Jokers episode where they have him ask for directions but anytime they point he says “please don’t point, it’s rude”
---
Nah, give yourself the credit lol. Thanks for posting and getting this resolved.
---
Lol
---
/r/OopsDidntMeanTo/
---
there is also the thing for pve bosses... 5% crit is nice 5% stun is bad as you cant stun bosses ... and you are really going to need crit on bosses too, trash dies too fast as is
---
🍆
---
We live in a society
---
no way lol
---
Seeping does better DPS even with the stats on Twig. The proc deals damage so it will break CC that breaks on damage. However, Twig looks a little better for PVP, slower attack speed and a ton of stamina are both nice.
---
I swear I’ve made several characters past 10 and rerolled bc of their hair/face. I even got a Tauren Druid to 30 &amp; gave up on them bc nelf forms are better :(
---
Then how does DBM do it?
---
try TellMeWhen, it's easy to set up
---
Defensive stance + eat after killing a warlock.
---
Gnome mages and ganking you when you're low on health after fighting 3 mobs.
---
I would not suggest to go full feral for PvP. It gives you more damage yes, but at the cost of too much survivability and sustain. I would recommend trying on of these out:

---
&gt; available in BWL and onwards 
---
Well no shit, but "BWL onwards" isn't available yet, is it? So right now Accuria is one of the absolute best we can get
---
Busy working an adult job, sorry. Keep being an ignorant piece of shit on the internet!
---
Yeah that's kind of what I thought, but I feel like in some of the level 60 dungeons there's a reasonable amount of AOE magic damage from bosses. That said, I'm not sure there's much else to invest points in? 50% int to armor seems pointless too, as does improved dampen/amp magic. Improved counterspell seems nice, but I really only use that for interrupts on trash. Those rows of the arcane tree just seem kind of pointless.
---
God damn it’s beautiful
---
Yea dude, DM puts Ony on easy-mode. Didn’t you read any of people’s concerns when DM was released ahead of schedule? This was one of them.
---
It's a ui change, not a gameplay change.
---
Ah, thank you
---
Each guild listed is affiliated with a zone, they do not control it. This map shows the guilds you will run into and that are known to start wars in those zones. What you’re saying is do you have to ask the guild to mine/herb etc. That is not the case, it’s just RPPVP pride!
---
Risk: WoW Edition
---
And unachievable buffs/enchants..
---
Probably for the worse. Wow got me interested in computers, which got me interested in computer science, which got me a good job and a passion.
---
would also like to know this.. how does it play out?  Seems great in concept.
---
Is that the real Clan Battlehammer? I was wondering what server they would roll on for Classic
---
How? Got any links to wago.io or whatever it is?
---
Or if you run with your guild just have them give you lead (assuming no one else is locked to a different ID)
---
HAHAHA he said the joke! He did it!
---
I couldn't even play vidya during the week through high school, i was and still am just a shit student.
---
That should work!
---
Wait till you see Alanna's Embrace.
---
No, it's not false at all. In fact, it's more than $600 a month. All the wow token does is shift the cost to someone else and add $5. If anything, keeping bots up makes Blizzard more money than a normal sub would.
---
Yes, I'll even try to find a smaller corner of water so the line will almost always land in the same spot so I can watch something on my other screen and click when I hear the swishy swashies
---
Other RP realms might have such a thing. I doubt such maps will exist beyond those ones, though.
---
Glad to see our community map is getting recognition here! And as the loremaster of [The Harbingers](https://grobbulus.fandom.com/wiki/The_Harbingers), *you'll never catch us alive, Alliance! Muahahahaha!*
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12467-CoolLine.html
---
Something along those lines?
---
I don't really see myself doing that. There isn't much I really need gold for, and I don't really want to grind stuff, period. Given that, what else would you recommend putting the points in?
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
So I'll answer what I can.
---
&gt;\- Herb and Mineral node gathering (Similar to Gathermate for Retail)
---
There is a GatherMate2 that works with Classic. I use it.
---
&gt;Bag organisation add-on similar to Baganon(I think? the one that lumps all your bags into one big block)
---
Think Bagnon exists for Classic. I use ElvUI and like their bag system (extremely similar to Bagnon)
---
&gt;Something similar to TellMeWhen and/or DBM
---
Think DBM exists for Classic. Never heard of TellMeWhen.
---
&gt;Something similar to Pawn (the add-on that tells you if an item is an upgrade; I feel this would probably be less effective with the talent specialisation how it is in Classic compared to Retail)
---
Unsure here. 
---
&gt;Is Bartender available for Classic? I would ideally like to be about to get rid of my XP bar entirely because it adds some weight towards the levelling process
---
&gt; Any UI add-ons that would allow me to minimise the space consumed by various panels and portraits. For this one, I would like some suggestions for add-ons as well as how to set up a UI that is minimalistic in appearance but still allows me the agency of having available my full range of actions. If you have screenshots and a tutorial, that would also be helpful
---
ElvUI
---
Were you in a party at the time?
---
If so, you might have gotten locked to a party member's ID if they had already killed a boss.
---
It's easier and faster unless your computer is an absolute potato.
---
Playing some other less interesting game?
---
Show me logs of furys opening with annihilator. Totally agree that furys should help stack a first sunder, but I haven't seen any top parse instances where melee DPS start with Annihilator.
---
&gt; Priest is probably the best leveling class in the game outside of hunters.
---
Mages would like a word with you.
---
Yeah I've used TellMeWhen before, it's a great add-on, just was hoping to find one of the ones like I described to work with my new UI
---
Exactly!
---
At a certain level it is. Not mechanical skill but game knowledge for sure. And that plays into late game play a lot.
---
Glancing penalty and 9% hit itemization say hello. 
---
Eskhandars is trash for anything but 5 mans.
---
That’s wild.
---
Which class requires the most gold to gear up in BIS preraid? For mage I ended up spending about 500g on various things like Robe of the Archmage. Wanted to roll an alt but don't want one that's going to be too expensive.
---
Your ignorance is showing.
---
Normally, I'd call this just trolling, but if these guys are genuinely harassing other players, then yes, they should be reported to support. Not because of some boogeyman white supremacist concern as, frankly, \*everyone\* is labeled as a nazi on the internet these days, but because they are clearly violating TOS by acting belligerently and intentionally bullying other players. 
---
Note: Not saying these guys are not wannabe nazis. They very well could be. Just that even moderates are called nazis or white supremacists these days and it's lost it's meaning.
---
Guys chill, it's something interesting to look at, while we have a benediction and literally an image of a frostbolt on the front oage
---
By the light! You're a paladin man!
---
Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.
---
It would be foolish to give this to a hunter when it is BiS for tanks the whole game. 
---
It is also foolish to be obsessed with getting a super rare ring that is better for three other classes than it is for you when you will easily get better rings in the next phase.
---
Oh awesome! Are they available under the Classic section or do I need to download the BFA ones?
---
It could be. I mained rogue till about 1/2 into bc and I'm pretty sure I still had to downrank once I switched to priest
---
Then you've been playing with shitty Shadow Priests.  There are multiple talents to drop threat and downranking MB isn't hard.
---
Before WoW I played Diablo 2 for 8 hours a day. Before Diablo 2 I played Diablo 1 and WC2.
---
Before Diablo 1 I played Sega Genesis.
---
It's not silly, it's their toolkit.  Poly will full heal you.  Depending on the class you have things you can do to address their attempt to reset.
---
I have a feign/passive macro and trap seperately.
---
Easiest way to trap in dungeons I found is to lay the freezing somewhere isolated before the pull. Then put a blue square marker on the one you wanna ice and distracting shot as soon as the tank pulls.
---
Make sure your teammates know what you are doing so the tank wont freak out or anyone puts dots on the mob. Doing it this way means you can still feign if the pull goes bad, or re-feign/ice later to keep the mob stunned longer. If you layed the trap out of the way, there wont be an issue doing aoe skills like accidentally multi-shotting it.
---
All the traps are useful yet I hardly see other hunters using them frequently. Hope this helps!
---
The Classic WoW team basically has 2 years of content already made for them. 
---
They have 2 years to create new content. All while they have a positive cash flow of people who are literally only subscribed for classic wow. 
---
They don’t need to do anything crazy amazing.
---
How?  I flew to the same places I walked/rode.
---
corehound belt is tribal. rep grind is real though. i doubt you make much money as a resto druid skinning/lw. killing devilsaurs will be difficult. the good money there is likely gone since most people will have their 2p already.
---
Imagine thinking a video game ruined your life.
---
Doesn't EQ do this?
---
I'm not sure how many players would bother, though. It's one thing to re-release vanilla wow after 15 years. It's another to keep doing it again every 2-3 years for seasons. They'd probably retain/attract more players by moving to BC instead.
---
I’ve seen plenty of druids with deep Resto/Moonglow builds, a few of which are in my guild. I’m not sure why 90% of the people on this sub have to insult me and jump down my throat because I don’t like using bear form but I guess all you are the professionals 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
---
&gt; 20/0/31
---
On northdale I healed every encounter up to Twin Emps with this spec and was rarely, if ever, the last place healer.  It is my personal favorite pally spec, and it works a treat in pvp.  Collect a proper raid healing set just like the pure hpallys and a ret/pvp set.
---
those exist?
---
That’s Oki but for leveling I think it would be less cumbersome to Marco it. And I can’t think of any dungeons where the fear immunity will help tremendously
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxf0xo HOTW/NS is what I would suggest (with that spec you can easily heal and tank all the dungeons and even MC/Onyxia can also help OT in MC). If you really don't want to play feral I would still suggest going moonkin https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xIMEstZxxc you might wanna pick up the 13 resto points before you take more than 31 points in balance though. Or just got for a 30/0/21 (like HOTW/NS but with caster talents) https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/500050030251135--50500311501 not sure about missing out on moonkinform and improved starfire though...
---
I was bored one night and decided to head to deeprun to mess around, otw I noticed a great place to sit down on the bridge in Redridge. I sat there for a good 30 min, waving at low lvl Alli walking across the bridge, if they ignored me I'd send my Succ to seduce them to make myself known. I hung out and emoted with a good 10-20 little allies until one beckoned me to follow him. I followed him all the way to the gnoll boss in the hills, got him his kill and went on my way. 
---
In deeprun I hung out with a bunch of low lvls again (I don't kill greys/greens) until eventually, I got overrun by a group of 3, but I killed the same 60 Rogue, who wouldn't leave me alone, 3 times.
---
I've always been glad I didn't discover MMOs (WoW was my first) until I was in my 40s. I'd already experienced plenty of life and built my career before I feel down the rabbit hole. I'm grateful for that wider experience every day of my life. It provides a good counter-balance and makes me a more well-rounded person.
---
I tried so hard to like my gnome mage for that 5% Int.. I just couldn't do it. After level 23.. I said fuck this and deleted him. Good luck to you!
---
Undead racial will let you truly pwn that matchup, but orc racial will provide consistent annoyance vs more classes, and vs any class with grenades
---
I don’t think Classic+ will happen as that would require developing new content and I’m pretty sure that’s a no-go for Blizzard when they have years of content already made. I think we’ll see a trilogy released; Classic, The Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King.  Servers will just convert to the latest classic expansion like current retail servers do, there won’t be separate servers for each expansion. 
---
They’ll likely stop after WotLK as I believe that’s where the “classic” experience ended and the more “casual” WoW of recent times begins to be introduced (with Cataclysm). Then I wouldn’t be surprised if a whole new WoW is made (shutting down current Classic and Retail servers) with what they learn from player feedback from Classic and Retail.
---
Your average given per hour is 110g. You may want to break down for us, with timestamps, exactly what is dropping, because even with 15 minute kills, running out to meet the buyer, having buyers come from non-DM areas.. Yes, please show the work for the 110 figure
---
At what auto cd? I'm at 2.8 and there's no way I'm fitting in both.
---
Auto,aimed,auto, multi... Then probably a feign after pulling aggro then aimed again otherwise a scorpid sting to get the tic damage
---
Ninjas were hunters needing on healing BoPs so they could vendor them
---
You don't think Arcane Meditation is worth investing in?
---
One of the runs we did avoid him, but not the other. Used suit and everything.
---
Good to know. I see what I do as I spend most of my gaming time actually in dungeons.
---
No, you stopped studying because you're irresponsible and have no self-control. Don't blame others for your own failures.
---
I wonder how many people actually use this world Channel there's a ton of people that don't even know there's a legitimate looking for group Channel I'm actually curious to know how many people are going out of their way to find custom channels. For those who don't know you can click the little speaker icon on your chat window and it'll bring up another window showing all the chat channels you're in and allowing you to select those channels and see just how many people down to the exact number are in that channel.
---
I don't even know what i want to be still and that terrifies me... but video games don't really have anything to do with that.
---
And they've gotten me through some dark times, fuck, theyre doing that right now.
---
The only real boe blue you would need to buy to fit in outside of easily obtained weapons is probably exectuioners cleaver
---
Runescape is probably in there
---
Because warriors suck in world while they're alone. 
---
Most of the warriors I kill are already half dead from fighting whatever mob was attacking them.
---
If they're not then I fear them in to a group so they take durability damage. 
---
You might be exceptional, most players I encounter are not.
---
Haha yeah Xandar(?) for president. That guy must've saved a lot of people a decent amount of money by now.
---
&gt; But TBC wasn't good.
---
Speak for yourself. TBC was my favorite expansion. TBC also had more subscribers than vanilla.
---
You look silly =)
---
Dagger warrior is actually more DPS than a rogue.   
---
Sword rogues do more damage than dagger rogues.  
---
So just because your second best spec is for daggers, you think you should get all the daggers?  
---
Daggers are also BiS for tanks.  
---
Rogues should get swords. Tanks should get daggers. Orcs should get axes.
---
Do people not understand how upvotes and downvotes work? People are downvoting this out of disgust, and by doing so, they're keeping this from getting the attention it should.
---
If you run gnomer, the end boss has a shield with a chance on hit to do 50ish damage. Throw mithril spike on it. Otherwise, The Green Tower does not go for much on my server, 10g. 1% chance to give you thorns for 30 seconds. It's only 3 damage thorns, but if you're pulling massive amounts of mobs it will add up quickly.
---
Well, if you’d see the *other* pictures you’d see I still have all my clothes on! I’d never disrespect a woman, by unholyfying her sacred body! I’m a Paladin!
---
Amen, through video games and a lot from WoW, I became more of a team player and see work as a unit rather than an individual. And now my current manager and supervisor is very grateful to have me and vice versa. Sometimes it's hard to see others that doesn't think as you though.... Meh
---
XD. Tbh I havent used CC pre BRD.
---
Well as a priest I have zero tools for that. If only sw:d was in the game.
---
Not sure if you played with reckoning but if you’re in a normal duel with someone and they crit you under normal circumstances you would store a reckoning charge. 
---
However if you’re not in range of them or if you’re at a certain point in your swing timer the reckoning charge will be completely lost. Spamming it constantly in fights ensures you not only store every charge (have to stop attack essentially) but for example vs a rogue, every time they crit you and if you’re spamming it your instantly hitting them with 2 autoattacks. 
---
Try dueling your fury warrior friend and tell them to pop recklessness with a dual wield vs you. If you spam it constantly with a strong 2h or 1h you will 100-0 him in under 3 seconds with the macro.
---
I only say 1h like a deathbringer because it makes you tanky with a shield (very hard to kill as melee) and it’s the highest top end damage for 1 hands in all phases I’m pretty sure. You can do it with a strong 2h as well and you will hit harder but you will also take more damage because you don’t have a shield on therefore your hp will drop faster. So if you want to 1vX with a 2h just hope that a melee with high crit is on you and you’re a wrecking ball, but you need hp pots and loh ready bc you will be more squishy than with a shield. 
---
I got lucky with a deathbringer otherwise I might be inclined on just sticking with a 2h with more dependence on FAPs, health pots, etc to stay alive so I can at least take down 2 people before I die.
---
Quite the contrast from my server where everything is controlled by a cross colab mafia, or maybe it's not? 
---
Wish cancer upon discord and spyaddons(and the likes) totally ruined the spirit of WoW tbh.
---
Well stop letting them get on top of you, if you're having them resist that much you're letting them get way too close. I always do it as soon as Gordok or the Observer get within what would be Gordok's charge distance behind the last pillar.
---
FD works a lot better when things are further away, which makes tons of sense. I will have maybe 1 resist over the course of 10 runs and since they're further away it's easy to recover.
---
Rogues can't self cast thorns for starters.
---
I'm pretty sure wow changed my life for the better. It taught a young me many valuable lessons:Social skills, Working in teams, touch typing, economics, writing LUA,Time management.. the list goes on.
---
Life is what you make of it.
---
I woke up at 5am on a Monday to farm rich thorium in southern winterspring and there was 6 horde already there (faerlina)
---
Thank you for actually being helpful. I’ll check those builds out, thanks!
---
I have died like thrice from 1-20. My shaman died far more and my mage until blink died maybe once
---
I’ve done this before when I played bc, my ex had her own account. You just log into your other account. You might have to find the actual exe file where the game is installed as it might not work directly from battle net launcher as it might indicate you are already playing the current account.
---
This wont go over well in this sub lol.
---
There has never been a ban-wave for iMorph or jMorph. The last ban-wave was for Arctium Launcher which functioned in a completely different way. Some more info:  [https://imgur.com/a/H2ulMNF](https://imgur.com/a/H2ulMNF)
---
CHT isn't BiS for a rogue. Swords is BiS for rogue for all phases beyond phase 1.   
---
CHT is actually BiS for any non human/orc warrior, and especially tanks
---
But you lost lol
---
are you sure thats true? the mana is roughly the same while casting, actually a little bit in favor of truefaith at 70sec.. Other than that its roughly 1/12 crit versus 5 +healing, where I'd normally go for the 5 +healing but I haven't run any numbers.
---
Doing this currently.
---
My Druid is currently moonglow, I fucking love it. But that is a 60 only spec, switch once you hit to 60 spec. 
---
This is the same as a prot warrior asking why he kills stuff so slowly and questing is a pain. But gets all defensive when people tell them to switch fury or arms. 
---
You are literally shooting yourself in the foot, and asking reddit why you are bleeding...
---
I always decimate other warriors doing this. Most of them don;t realize you can do this.
---
Actually had an argument in one group cause ravager dropped and they thought I already had one since my damage was so much higher than anyone elses.
---
Was that the orc aesthetic one? That place was definitely tough without proper CC, but even pre karazhan if you brought 2 or 3 mages for poly it became trivialized.  Hell its just a CC check really. I remember busting out the succy to seduce there. That was def the most challenging one by a mile.
---
if i had to bet hes probably trolling me
---
&gt; But considering how utterly lazy and incompetent modern Blizzard are, they won't do it. It's too much work.
---
I wouldn't call them lazy. I think it's ridiculous to expect them to spin up an entirely new, parallel development team to work on a fork of their MMO, *especially* since it's a fork that doesn't even come remotely close to the monetization of retail.
---
KS is great in dungeons if the tank pulled too many mobs, or if a mob is going to run and pull other mobs or even a spellcaster than does an aoe attack etc.
---
I think it's a social call on beauty standards on Forsaken. You don't have to have a fully attached jaw to be beautiful, all Forsaken are beautiful.
---
Azshara is great for mob farms, you can set up on the satyr camps and if you find its getting swarmed or hostile with pvp, you can either go to another camp, or to the blood elves.
---
Probably the same reason you have liked the same type of foods for your whole life. It's something familiar that I know I will have a good time with. Aka like it.
---
Oh, you don't have to import anything, just download the add on and almost everything can be configured inside the add on.
---
By shitposting alt-right garbage on the classic wow subreddit? Sure you are.
---
Same. Email me
---
I normally try to stick at least 2 levels below me. 
---
If I start fighting mobs that are my level or higher, I just do some instances until I get higher.
---
its not even hard. As long as you have fire resist potions, a tank with good fire resist and a raid leader who knows the fights you will clear it.
---
obviously braindead dps/heals will cause issues, but that is not unique to MC.
---
Where would would you draw the line on thing's value, you could need anything that can go on the AH by that logic, it would mean no one would ever get anything that isn't BoP, which is a horrible system.
---
GrobMob grows!
---
Oddly, Regrowth doesn’t auto-downrank.
---
You're seriously arguing +/- 7 healing power here you know - versus whatever the upgrade there is for a DPS caster. Mindlessly following BiS lists like this vs thinking about overall progress in guild...
---
Right now, Seal Fate daggers is not competitive. If you have a guild that lets you raid with a lesser spec, cool that's nice that you have 39 people spending more time on something so you can feel all bubbly inside about your objectively worse performance.
---
For people who don't have a guaranteed raid spot and are trying to secure one, it's highly advisable to spec Combat right now.
---
I would have missed out big time :) coming back to Wow has been so fulfilling, I only made it to lvl 40 when I played ten years ago.
---
I had absolutely no idea about that, hope this helps my DPS numbers. I FINALLY got HoJ so I can start competing with the other rogues in the guild so this should be fun.
---
Because the pvp grind was real back then.
---
This might be the best advertisement I've ever seen for a server.
---
15 years ago I was doing my 3nd year in sistems engineering, had decent grades overall and was doing it on time, still used to do some partying and light drug use, but was only casual, that was until I started playing classic for 12 hours a day for a year
---
Almost perfect. You can “use” instead of “cast” and delete “alt” just leave “mod”  (it will automatically accept any modifier - alt, ctrl, or shift) to make it cleaner and shorter.
---
/use [@mouseover,help,mod][help,mod][@player,mod] Flash Heal(rank 4); [@mouseover,help][help][@player] Flash Heal
---
Grobb is Home!
---
Works pretty well except core hounds that see through stealth. But if magmadarr is down you shouldn't have any of them anymore.
---
Most recouped cash is from disenchanting items, and dust is always in demand, unlike if you tried to sell large amounts of crafted gear, so it becomes a lot easier to quantify.
---
Especially for tailoring, it's good to make items at certain levels for best profit, and then bags at higher levels- even if they are green in the profession crafting list. Both dust and bags are easy to sell.
---
Also, there are very, very few recipes rare enough to keep high profits feasible
---
I don’t like playing feral. My question wasn’t “should I switch to feral” and everyone in this sub still feels the need to jump down my throat because I’ve said time and time again I have no interest in feral but everyone keeps suggesting it and then wants to be like “wHY WONT YOU TAKE THE ADVICE WERE GIVNG YOU EVEN THOUGH YOUVE SAID YOU DONT WANT TO PLAY FERAL 100 TIMES AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT IM TELLING YOU TO DO.”
---
You should be able to sword an board arms but need to pull smaller and cc well
---
&gt; It has a bit of 3D pop but it is on the sides of your character not above your targets head
---
... so 2D like he said then
---
Read what I wrote again 🤔
---
That will be the great revenge tour in P2/3. All the spriests that have been mocked will wreak havoc.
---
I feel like creating your own group is always the best way to get people to bite. People really like seeing LFM rather than LFG.
---
Probably because it's a hot? Though someone motw doesnt either.
---
Yeah holy tail that shit’s bangin
---
Really? That's re-assurng to hear. As I said in my post I fish too for profit so I'm happy to hear that. I can't wait to reach a higher level so I can fish for these better fish you are talking about. I'm still just 33 and struggling to find the time to play
---
You play resto. Of course you hit like a wet noodle. Play feral or play dungeons. 
---
It is the same for me. I respecced to elemental at level 57 and then back to healing at 60.

Exactly this. People waste time in a lot of ways. Some game, some go to football games, some go to dance clubs or play chess or some shit.
---
Stay mad.
---
well if 99% of the stats and power came from their consumables then yeah it would be less impressive. but they didn't kill ony with thorns.
---
People aren't likely to reply to that because they get raged on 99% of the time, regardless of a "friendly" initial message or not.
---
&gt; It's McDonalds and Coca Colas fault I'm fat because their products are cheap and delicious so I overeat. 
---
See how silly that sounds?
---
Hypothetically, would it be a reportable offense to damage the mob in the first place?
---
If I remember corrrctly, Shadowed Unit Frames has pet happiness built into the color of the pet frame.
---
That’s the general life cycle of a raider, there is too many other games you miss out on playing wow every day, if you are set on gold you basically only need to raid log
---
I'm not really into raids, so still running around doing stuff.
---
Did you just call me fat?
---
For #3, there’s a tab in DBM options that will force display the raid warnings. Just click the button next to it and it will show it/allow you to move it where you want. There’s a few warnings so you’ll have to play with a couple to get them all where you want them.
---
What are you grinding on your mage exactly? I’m assuming it’s not ZF
---
Our guild has done close to 70 runs without seeing the skinning knife.
---
We saw carapace before it, for reference.
---
Come to windseeker...I've had literally zero experiences with negative groups, and only one or two negative people at all.
---
At this phase in the game an alliance cat can do enough DPS+lotp to justify being brought. It’s a little tougher horde side since that means you are probably depriving a rogue or warrior of WF and it will definitely change as everyone but the cat scales into BWL and AQ but for now cat DPS absolutely is competitive.
---
It looks default to me?
---
Question.. how much of public channel chat and private guild chat on RP servers is actually RP style?  I heard a rumor that on retail RP is hardly ever used and not enforced on RP serves which would make the whole thing seem pointless to me
---
Might make an alt on your server. You guys do a lot of neat shit.
---
I remember dailies in BC being strictly about the gold. Maybe there was some rep in there but you'd hit exalted fairly soon so it hardly mattered. I see them as replacing any of the other gold farming you need to do in classic to afford raid consumables - outside that, I'm not sure they were bad.
---
*Maybe* they should be tuned down compared to other methods of gold farming in BC but the concept wasn't terrible.
---
That’s white damage bro

People don't play video games to escape real life, they play them because they're psychologically more stimulating than real life.

It isn't some sad loser story, life just isn't that interesting.

What's funny is I am serious. This is old school mentality with defense capped tanks.

3&amp;4 i cannot answer
---
I'd be burned out after playing 12 hours a day too.
---
I'm kinda at the same stage at you, but I never got close to 12 hours a day.
---
Nowadays I fill in the time by helping guild members gear up for our second raid group and I'm also starting to learn how to write my own addons.
---
A couple days ago on smoulderweb my mage alt got ganked by skulls in tauren mill by the weaponsmith. Naturally I hopped on my main and got 4 of my buddies to come to TM. We ended up camping and killing the south shore flight path, even mind controlling an ally to tell him to bring his friends. An hour later it was a 40v40 world pvp battle that ended up with us storming the south shore buldings, killing all the npcs, and taking their apples in the inn.
---
Even the jerks are like the Tanner from high school jerks, not just Chads. It feels nice!
---
You know what's more unique and iconic than the haircut they have?  The giant nameplate that literally every character has floating over their head.
---
Look up “how to be your guild’s shadowpriest” by Ooze on youtube and steal his build.
---
You can safely ignore the reddit trolls advising you to go for the holy weaving gimp build, as you can currently compete on the dps meter as a shadowpriest, especially so if you’re gonna be raiding with fellow with casuals or pugs.
---
&gt;It's perfectly possible to go through classic without saying anything to anyone other than "LFG ..."
---
Except people don't, they talk to each other. I think its not the players fault, its down to subtle design mechanics that force or encourage co-operation as opposed to streamline things and remove the need for co-operation.
---
Gee, you must be popular at parties.   
---
FYI - I remember your post and I upvoted it too. 
---
You just hurtin coz your own Epic mount post got panned for being trash.
---
This is the correct answer. Run back to last guard without king buff, make him run away and your third item will spawn in the chest. The mobs will still have red names but if you mouse over them you'll see that they're friendly and don't have a sword icon.
---
No, cuz I didn't bull rush to 60. Took my time, had fun. Still having fun. Might level an alt, but I haven't even reached the point where in disinterested in my main. And it's a carbon copy of my vanilla mage
---
short and hairy lol
---
A lock in my guild is clearing in right around 20 minutes so I assume the route has been somewhat optimized over the last couple of weeks
---
Because you brought up ToEP in the first place.
---
if you're using the battle.net app, beside the PLAY button you can select which account you would like the game with. Example i have 2 so i click Play with WoW1 and then go back to the app and select WoW2 and hit play again
---
Your only defense is “Muh BoE I don’t want want competition for muh BoE” BoE’s=Gold everyone should need on it. The rationale of “but he can equip it” is irrelevant with a BoE because .... let me say it louder for the people in the back...... BOES=GOLD
---
Better to be accurate than brief if you're not up against the character limit.  Something like this:
---
    /cast [mod:ctrl] Inner Focus
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,mod:alt][help,mod:alt][@player,mod:alt] Flash Heal(rank 4); [@mouseover,help][help][@player] Flash Heal
---
wouldn't work if you don't specify your mods.
---
On Grobbulus /World chat is only used for world pvp and war 80% of the time
---
/LookingForGroup is used properly.
---
There is a box in the interface menu called Auto Loot that will automatically take any gold/items off a corpse as soon as you click on it. The are also addons for faster looting once you have autoloot turned on.
---
Palypower
---
Kills are actually a super overrated statistic in csgo. ADR, KAST, and hidden things like calls and morale building are all more important.
---
You already bought the riding skill at 40
---
Masterfully done.
---
There are some aspects of RP Servers that I absolutely love like the added lore etc.  I just find the play-acting (Not using this in any way as a pejorative) tedious after a while.
---
Honestly, everyone just ignore this tool. Look at his posting history. He's either a troll or just an idiot who doesn't realize his gold buying will be caught, again.
---
Just like my face.
---
No need to go deep prot for 5 mans.
---
Only start considering it when your guild starts talking about you main tanking a raid IMO. Alongside gearing up your fire resist set.
---
MH is Deathbringer Axe from Onyxia, so he’s likely wearing Edgemaster that has +7 axe and +7 dagger skill.
---
I dinged 60. Did 1 MC and 1 Ony. Logged off, didnt log back in after.
---
I went back to retail and gave that another go with a casual look. Love it so far.
---
When you spend the majority of time in dungeons/raids mount speed doesn't really matter.
---
As I approach 60 my gold is being budgeted towards BOE gear that is BiS and enchants.  Followed closely by capping my Engineering so I can craft a BiS shield that will cost an arm and leg.  Need 2 of those as well due to inherit durability issues.  
---
Once all that is done I will consider saving for a 100% mount.
---
where do I send my CV for the goldshire inn staff?
---
To my knowledge Zandalar Tribe has a lot of similar territory oriented guilds. From the top of my head I can think of a few guilds alliance side...
---
&lt;Silverwing Sentinels&gt;
---
&lt;Defias Brotherhood&gt;
---
&lt;Battlelust&gt;
---
&lt;Booty Bay Inquisition&gt;
---
That I have seen engage in territory RP.
---
This is pretty awesome.  Do guildies all have their hearth set nearby or something? Or do they just hang out in those zones? Do they dedicate a certain amount of their play time to just being in those areas and RP'ing?
---
It’s an opinion you dult.
---
Ofc, if you have more than 1 mod, you have to specify
---
Talk to him before getting the king buff. The mobs will have red names but won't actually aggro if you've killed the last boss. After you've talked to him and he runs away the third item spawns.
---
Finite resources are part of the game. If you want musical chairs with too many chairs, play any other MMO.
---
Who has their camera that low? How do you see anything?
---
That's the thing, there's something for everyone, if you're a mage and the Freezing Band drops then Gz! you've got that great ring, if it dropped and I needed on it because it's just worth a chunk of gold there's no way the mage isn't going to be frustrated. Also as a holy paladin I can't reasonably farm gold, so the value of items differs from that of someone who can easily farm gold (like mages / hunters / rogues). Because of this if a BoE drops it'd take me 20+ hours of farming to be able to afford it, whereas it'd take a mage 4-5 hours, just from that alone some classes should get preferential treatment when it comes to rolls for greed, but that's complicating things, the simplest way it just to roll need for items you'll use and greed for items you'll sell, otherwise people will just need everything that isn't BoP, which is a horrible system.
---
WoW is the only game ever that I fully quit and then came back to. It showed me that I actually do enjoy gaming, even after a 6 month period of not enjoying a single game I tried. Quite depressing, really, to have a hobby that you hardly enjoy.
---
That sounds very expensive and not much more profitable than what they're doing now.
---
In other words, I doubt it.
---
12 hours a day. 
---
Seriously.... I don’t even know how to respond to this post.
---
Piss and moan on reddit apparently...
---
You lose honor every week. The more you have, the more you lose. The more you lose the more you need in a weeks time to hit the next rank.
---
Small eggs
---
Christmas is coming
---
how about not going into prot at all? lol
---
Mine was really friendly.
---
The following day I was farming a dungeon for a pair of pants that I really wanted.  They were need rolled on by a rogue who didn't understand rogues dont wear cloth...or need spirit. 
---
I'm a priest.
---
Sure, and I did tank WC while leveling as enhance. But when it comes to viability discussion we're really only talking endgame. That's kind of like saying priest wanding spec is a viable DPS. No it's only viable while leveling compared to the alternatives due to how wands scale faster than their spells at first. See what I mean?
---
Seems like someone hurt you in your formative years.
---
It’s all about personality. Arms makes you most viable soloing while prot basically ruins soloing but makes you stronger in group. However, it also takes away the ability to be a reliable dps or tank. 
---
What I don’t see people mentioning is how you want your groups to go? As a well geared prot warrior you can control group speed and make it much easier on healers. If you go prot be prepared to lead, mark targets, know when to move or rest etc. To me a tank is a group leader while a fury/arms war forces into tanking is usually along for the ride controlled by the healer.
---
behold all the idiot-reverse-elitists that will come in and tell your it's your own fault for "rushing" the content and that you can make more alts and farm more gold (without giving you a reason to why you want to have 15k gold instead of 10k).
---
They will tell you that you should've hugged trees while leveling, enjoy the LeVelInG eXpeRieNcE (which alot of us did like 30 times at this point and don't care to know why James Backwrding wants 7 spider legs), and that you should've sit in Ironforge campfire circles and "socialize".
---
Hunters only need 9%, can get 3% from talents, 2% from rings, 2% from devilsaur, and that only leaves you 2% short which you can get from shoulders/bracers/wrists/horde trinket.
---
So most weapons bis for hunters focus on crit%.
---
Godspeed
---
I didn't rush either, 11 days /played from 1-60, did all professions and all dungeons while leveling. Fucked around. Loved it.
---
As I tell my wife frequently, if it wasn't WoW, it would have been some other game(s).  If it wasn't video games, it would be books.  If it wasn't book(s), it would be long, contemplative walks.  Sometimes you just need something to do solo and take your mind off things.
---
Isnt landing a hit on a skull level mob impossible?
---
I don't think I would have made it to adulthood. Abuse, depression, etc colored my childhood. As stupid as wow is and has been, it offered me a world where I could be something strong. I pushed high ratings in bc/wotlk and it helped my self esteem that my parents spent my childhood crushing. So sure, some people might be better off without it, but I wouldn't be here without it.
---
Lionheart Helm, Battlechaser's Greaves(on my server), and Devilsaur Set all cost more gold than Black Dragonscale Set.
---
Exactly, career success does really not mean you are happy or content as a person.
---
Holy Kanolie, congrats!
---
There's no password and the people who were being dicks were told to cut it out.
---
I dont see how, you can literally mousewheel to switch your blessings if you mouse over individual people on the addon
---
You can actually pull more mobs as arms. Sweeping strikes + whirlwind is pretty great opening threat for aoe
---
I think the obsession with showing your happiness (mainly through social media) doesn't help people who are miserable, making them believe they're the only ones who are off that bad.
---
and that berry is named Theramore!
---
He was dead on the floor, Good DPS run to the tank when they get aggro, Great DPS don’t take aggro ;)
---
All my addon are in the Twitch ptr classic folder and there isn’t a good way of moving them over. I’m stuck using login screens :(
---
Is that like white bro damage? Chad and Brad damage
---
Stoneslayer I think.
---
Right?! I don't get the guy above me. Perhaps he's playing with spriests who actually read/understand their class.
---
Every spriest I've had join my group while tanking just spams it.
---
Yes, they are awesome. Dwarf only rp.
---
Good point: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm
---
I just got feline swiftness and a few crit talents so got a while until that helm, but furor is probably good idea anyway at this point
---
You mean those things that bind on equip? That you can just get another leatherworker to make for you?
---
Valid response. Either way I approve
---
Threat isn't the concern with how many jobs you pull, you lack the defensive capabilities of a prot warrior and need a strong healer to help if pulling big as arms
---
Follow up to this. You can obviously be a strong leader as a non-prot war but it’s harder for others from a healing/dos standpoint. 
---
Being non-prot gives you more group opportunity as both a dps or de-facto tank.
---
Yea but you shouldnt be obsessing about a shitty ring that is better for others in your guild. You are just screwing over people who actually need that ring for your own selfish gain. 
---
You should be able to clearly see that the ring will leave you with too much hit in an optimal setup.
---
Learning a language, sure.  
---
Learning an instrument? It's just as much something that involves entertainment and skill. And I don't think everything you do in life you should be doing to be super proud of, just do what makes you happy.
---
This. Is. Amazing.
---
My favorite past time.
---
I guess the faction balance thing is a somewhat valid excuse, but the reason I always thought to be true from playing back in the day was that the main class designers came over from playing the warrior class in EQ and they were super elitist about pure vs. hybrid from their days playing that game. I remember reading old forum posts they had made basically shitting on hybrid classes, saying their role was to buff/support/heal and nothing more. Furor  specifically had a vendetta against paladins held over from his EQ days. He actually organized a protest to crash a server because he was upset the paladin class could tank better.
---
Ghostcrawler came on board for BC and fixed a lot of their bullshit.
---
Currently looking forward to Blizzcon, expecting D4 to be released. Haven't played any non-Blizzard games for over 5 years and not really interested in anything else either. Don't feel like missing out :)
---
Actually I've heard of using those ranges (from every player to every player and enemy) to attempt to triangulate players, so you could at least have a relative location to the boss. As far as I know no one has attempted it, or maybe it's just not possible, I don't actually know. I know it'd be harder in Classic due to the significantly smaller list of available quest items to check ranges with.
---
Someone who didn’t know dwarf priests were better at the age of 12, and decided to go full nostalgic and recreate my character from 2004 with knowing that fear wards existed
---
It was an absolute nightmare for me on a horde dominated server.
---
With 20% chance it seems more understandable I havent seen one yet. 
---
But I guess there are quite a few people farming. So if im not able to farm outside peak hours the gold/h feels like its gonna be low..
---
One person is “rampant”?
---
Its about finding balance, once I have my shit together I’m going to game on wow. It’ll always be there, but my prime won’t.
---
&gt;long as healer is decent
---
How about you go prot so that way you will be decent.
---
This makes me want to hop back on my lvl 8 gnome warlock on grob
---
you shouldnt raid as maces tbh, but if you did it's the same as swords.
---
as soon as I quit wow back in 2011, I just started buying motorcycles and rebuilding them/maintaining them etc... motocamping was the end game, but the money pit that is restoring vintage motorcycles was the leveling grind. 
---
Now I got an 85 ford bronco that's built for off roading and is constantly breaking down due to the nature of the hobby and age of the beast.  Just another grind where overlanding is the endgame. 
---
If it wasn't these things, it'd be some other grind with an endgame.  It's just how we're built.
---
what weapon is that?
---
FYI they weren't still looking 2 hours later, they were just chain running the dungeon.
---
Though this story is definitely made up.
---
Kite her around a tree and use the tree to los her spells! Scatter/conc-shot/wingclip pet to keep them together. I killed her twice with only one mana pot this way!
---
I’d give myself a 1.5/10 at least. I think night elves gets the 1
---
Agreed, the level 35 alt is a druid which I initially made for the alchemy transmute but thinking of leveling it up to 60 for healing. Also currently waiting for the Onyxia PUG to fill up as we wait for a druid healer, 0 druids in over an hour of LFM :D
---
You haven't done shit child. Get off the internet.
---
It has nothing to do with less time playing with your guild.  
---
Guilds will break up and people will leave if you are giving BiS loot to people who it is not BiS for. Your guild's loot system basically ensures people will never get optimal gear.   
---
By providing people with a means to get the gear they need, we keep people playing all the way through Naxx, thus playing MORE with our guild :).  
---
We'll see how your scrub guild with band of accuria hunters handles AQ 40!
---
When you’re too weak to turn the computer off and eat something other than hot pockets and Mountain Dew
---
On my server there’s a guy that gives away lionheart crafts for free. It’s really screwed me as an armorsmith.
---
2 years running.  I had to move cross country for this gig, so we're in a rough transition until she can find work out here, but she's otherwise pretty fantastic.
---
Heck yes, High Elves for Alliance?!
---
There's a setting in Interface Options to turn off chat channel invites
---
A lot of non-RP guild names get reported and forcibly changed on RP servers, so you'll rarely see guild names that don't have at least some plausible RP origin.
---
When I quit playing wow my junior-senior year of HS.  I believe it was right before TWOTLK came out my life changed for the better. I was playing 2-4 hours per night on average.  During vanilla days prob 4-6 hours per night as a young teenager.  My friends all played so we were still “hanging out” just weren’t at each other’s homes.   Once we all quit (thankfully we all quit together) we started doing so many other things.  
---
We already played high school sports at a varsity lvl so we definitely dedicated more time to that as well as socialized and did other things. We still regularly played video games as halo 3 and COD4 had just come out, but we actually had a social life outside of wow.
---
We were hardcore in a hardcore raiding guild and had cleared all but the final 2 bosses from Naxx before we all hung it up.  Idk what the deal breaker was. We just kinda lost interest together and once one quit we all did.
---
Now we’re all back into classic and we’re playing 3-4 hours per night after work.  I love this game but I hate this game.  I haven’t been reading. I haven’t been watching tv.  I haven’t been doubling up on gym workouts.  I’ll play for a few months but I can never go back to that vanilla lifestyle.  (I haven’t played since 08-09’ prior to this).
---
You aren't try harding content but you are obsessing over crappy loot and are more concerned about personal loot than your guild's success. If everyone in your guild thinks this way, it isnt gonna last.  
---
Think about that for a minute.
---
I think I've done this with every character at crossroads. Orcs fit the best
---
Looking at the screenshot... Your friend was dead too 😁
---
Glad to see congress is still paying close attention to the important problems facing our country.
---
I used to be in this same situation when classic first released waaaay back when. I was such an altoholic that I don't think I even had a max level character until WotLK because I just wanted to try everything.
---
You know what got me to break this cycle of wanting to try every class and race combination and see every starting zone, etc, etc, etc...
---
Having friends who played the game. Nothing was so motivating to get a character to max level than hearing my friends having fun running dungeons and raids together. Why am I playing alone and running low level dungeons with random people, when I could be experiencing the end game content with my RL friends?
---
Get some friends, get the motivation. Even if they aren't RL friends, just having a group of gaming buddies you enjoy playing with might be all the motivation you need.
---
Oops, yeah. Isn't that risky with all the lasher packs right there? I feel like you'd just get mobbed, dazed, and killed before you got on the ledge.
---
Yeah I was looking forward to helping my guild as well, but they decided to migrate from Gehennas EU to a dead server (Earthshaker). Not really planning on following there.
---
I mean I have to be realistic and I'll do as much preparation as the guild requires. Don't wanna slow everyone down.
---
Ideally I would wanna do it without studying every mechanic and every pull though.
---
Just a silly person tweeting about something they most likely know nothing about. I'd be surprised if the representative has ever even played WOW.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18203/eskhandars-right-claw
---
He may have been... :D
---
What I liked about wow is that there's always little things to do, with (at least in Classic) none of them being obligations. In most other games you very directly play the game, like in counterstrike for instance, and there's not a lot surrounding it. WoW just feels like more of a full experience to me.
---
Just wanted to mention if you're into the big guild thing and only a little into RP Grobb has those guilds as well. Some of the biggest guilds on the server aren't on this list. But those guilds are more standard pvp server guilds with similar kinda lame names. I am in one lol.. I like it only on RP server cuz of IRL friends. The guild I am in works for me but I really honesty love Grobb even though I was initially against it. Like this guy said it's just a great community of people with even faction balance. A lot of hardcore RP guilds but also a lot of just normal pvp server style guilds as well. A little something for everyone.
---
Can't you just have a range detection to your target and make the numbers smaller the larger the range is? Seems like it'd be pretty easy to do.
---
Nothing about attack timer, nothing about trackicng crusader procs for AR. Cant exactly call it "maximizing"
---
As a 60 warrior now and a 60 warrior in vanilla, I do not recommend ravager for solo play.
---
Nice and simple guide.
---
 One thing to note: thistle tea shares a cooldown with whipper root tubers, so if you're taking a lot of AoE damage on a fight you may want to consider popping a tuber instead.
---
Go try it for yourself then. You can easily see when you use FD you often don't drop combat for several seconds even with pet on passive. It is an issue with batching just like rogues complaining about vanish.
---
Yo for real though fuck enclave. I’m glad I’m horde on their server, love me some bigot killin.
---
I mean it kind of makes sense in a fantasy sense. Who are you more afraid of, the spellweaving wizard who can rain ice and fire upon you, or the guy holding a sword?
---
Yep!
---
Interface Options &gt; Social &gt; Block Chat Channel Invites
---
Just wait until the next expansion, you'll be able to level your bronco up to 90.
---
Still, the only reason you said anything was that you were hoping for a response, or to guilt trip them into returning the thing. There's no reason to send a message, but every reason not to respond to one sent to you after you sniped someone's auction.
---
That is not why it isn't on the list. It isn't on the list because Steppenwolf (the one who wrote the guide) didn't know the BDS boots would be in the game from release.  
---
He also didnt know about HS cancelling which would make hit past cap much worse for fury warriors to the point where you shouldn't take any hit past the yellow cap.  
---
He hasn't updated the guide with this new knowledge, probably cause hes too busy playing and updating other resources.
---
I know no interface changes will save if you disconnect from the game, press something like alt+f4, or maybe even press exit game and then click exit now instead of logging out normally. Try changing it, press logout, wait the full 20 seconds, then close the game and reopen it.
---
Most definitely. I’ve been able to fund two level 40 mount purchases through fishing alone, mainly because I can’t seem to keep my attention focused for long enough to hit 60, LOL. STV has great potential for gold making with inland pools for greater sage fish and oily black mouth pools on the coast (but they can also be fished up out of pools).
---
Once you hit 35 and fishing level 300, buy about 20 aquadynamic fish attractors or have a low level engineer make them, take off all you gear and run to the coast of azshara. There you can catch raid tier fish to sell on the AH, or make cooking leveling kits to sell in major cities. Both have good gold making potential, but the latter is VERY lucrative.
---
All of this is possible in a pre bot fishing world. Winter squid food (the +agility one) sells for a ton, like 12g a stack, and until botters hit the scene and drive the price down they’ll sell for a ton. Honor buddy is gone now, so I don’t think anyone makes fish bots anyways, but that’s not my expertise since I’ve never been a fishbot scumbag. ;)
---
Are you playing Classic on a computer from 2004? Are you using the average internet connection speed of that from 2004?
---
The game was originally designed with these problems somewhat in mind, thus the simplicity of mechanics and whatnot.
---
But I'm guess you aren't and that you wouldn't do it even if given the option, thus you don't truly want Classic yourself.
---
There was a level 35 hunter in my guild last week who was talking about how he was neglecting his real life to play classic. I don't know how nearly 2 months to reach 35 could really cause you to neglect your life, but hey who knows man maybe he just levels on fetch quests.
---
Wdym ? That's indeed my point, spell batching is for telephone wire internet.
---
Well yea... you can't really be expecting to kill things quickly if you aren't a damage build...
---
Try respecing as HotW/NS spec. It offers the flexibility to run dungeons as a healer, as a tank, and a dps. Plus it's great for PvP if you're into that.
---
Should be happy if you get anything more than vendor price for them, i’ve vendored several
---
It’s a way that RPers have fun. They are based out of whatever town they choose for their lore purposes. It’s a way to give a reason why guild A is constantly found defending Crossroads from attack or maybe the Alliance Guild for Ashenvale will be around to respond to travelers or adventurers in need of assistance (for PvP, although sometimes they help in PvE).
---
It’s community driven World PvP at its best.
---
But if you ask what the benefit is, the answer is fun. It’s fun for this group. Just like people on standard PvP realms have to make their own fun for world PvP, RPPvP players have an added layer of fun because they get extra fun out of integrating themselves a level further with lore and actual Role Playing.

For those who raid in a pvp spec. Do you use Hemo or SS in your rotation?
---
All they have to do is randomize the existing dungeon experience. Change patrol paths. Add more rare spawns like Jed in UBRS. Add items with random stats to loot tables, flesh out the unfinished towns, increase the recipes, tailoring, and other profession abilities. All new continent should be capped at lvl 60 forever and the dungeons and raids as well.

He killed 3 out of a 4 man group on his own, and the last one alive had under 10%. That's a loss to you?
---
Then we are in agreement.  Thank you for agreeing that the Classic community is no better than the retail community aside from what many claim.
---
Vendored mine thinking I’m daggers full time...picked up a Krol blade now instead :)

\#No changes

Nah, if that guildie messaged him to be ashamed because he was butt hurt that he lost an item dont run shit with him

Congress is such a fucking joke rofl.  This guy should pay more attention to the rampant vagrant drug addicts and illegal immigrants sapping his constituents tax dollars, not videogame shenanigans.

Hurricane begins every event in Booty Bay and most nights of the week we'll have 40+ at the Gurubashi arena doing our 5v5 PvP tournaments.  It's a pretty sweet zone to call home.  Comes with direct zeppelin access to Orgrimmar!

Lmao. "Omg, you want to see your heals? That's such a fucking gateway to Titanforging."
---
The fuck is wrong with you people.
---
Same
---
I'll tell you what's *not* good at farming: any Shaman spec. Omg I am so broke please help.
---
Yea man 100%. I been getting fucked by huntards lately lol as well. But yea.... omg so much guild drama too lmfao. I just been eating it up. I don't spread rumors or anything but it is funny to listen to. Funny part is a lot of the people I play with are like mid 20s or older as well. It's just like.... how the fuck yall causing this much drama lol. 
---
But yea I missed vanilla so much and classic proves that. I just feel home and I love it. My teenage years all over again, but a more adult perspective of it.

I put myself in the shoes of the person who bought 40g worth of stuff for 40s and I think I would have reacted to the situation differently.
---
Jesus, this is what we pay them 6 figure salaries for?
---
Why do you repeat exactly what he said?
---
I mean I usually am always just using heal rank 2-4 depending on how much damage someone has taken. I usually keep a large AF greater heal on my bar though for those moments the tank is taking huge damage. Even at the max rank of Heal, greater heal has more burst and is useful for certain situations. I'd say in general Heal rank 2 and 3 are my bread and butter but it's always good to have more tools ready to go. Hell, I even use max rank prayer of healing in conjuction with inner focus on occasion. No better spell in a priests kit to burst heal an entire party.
---
My friend keeps his bnet as appear offline for some reason, and proceeds to get upset that he’s been on for a few hours but no one came to play... because we can’t see you online until we log in game and see just your toons name on our friend list

Sweet! I was in their retail guild on emerald dream, I'll have to roll a character there then sometime
---
Mograine alliance here.

What's your rotation?
---
Heya Guildy :D
---
This is the perfect situation to highlight how big of a piece of shit Domon is on Herod! Sooo happy I found this thread. This fucking degenerate ass hat is one the kings of Farm and AH botting. He’s been spotted in Winterspring, Felwood and Eastern Plague non responsive/wont ever respond to msgs. Essentially mindlessly farming with the same combo of spells over and over.  And then this piece of trash instant undercuts all of his auctions. The best part is you can literally watch this dude run back and forth from Org Ah to the mailbox with the same exact path. Don’t take anything this fucking piece of shit says srsly he’s a scumbag and just trying to push the already negative shadow around him to someone else. Fuck this dude!
---
The +1% hit bonus to the whole party was pretty nutty. Comes out to like 75 free hit rating at 70or something like that.
---
I never played Vanilla because I was immersed in FFXI. I ended up moving towards the end of BC because half my Linkshell left for WoW. I played for 8 years, bounced around to a few other games and ended up back in FFXI. Now I’m here for Classic, we’ll see how long I last but if I weren’t playing WoW, I’d be playing something else. It’s all fairly cheap entertainment.
---
Who cares?
---
it was only one ISIS training camp, they were just having fun trying to get into shape stop overreacting. /s
---
I really love the feature of Healcomm. But my problem with it are Hots. If I cast a Renew on our MT other healer might think that a heal is coming but it isnt.
---
I absolutely hate it for healing. You can heal someone well before they take lethal damage but their death gets batched in with the heal and you can't heal a dead person so they die.
---
By "we" did you mean you and your pet? JK, but cant imagine how else a group of 3 (I think thats how many it takes to summon him?) would wipe to pyro lol.
---
This guy represents California... what a surprise
---
That's not fair... I have a mage port me there at least every 4 days.... to make my moon cloth and promptly hearth the fuck out of that shit hole.
---
By going just Last Stand, you miss out on one of block/defense/armor, better Shield Block, and much better Shield Wall. These are very useful. Even Shield Slam has it's place in 5 mans.
---
Haha I do this every time. Great meme
---
Had a similar problem with the key. Was lucky enough to find a “key” run.
---
Wow so funny
---
A couple people mentioned it. I didnt originally put them in cause it's almost entirely unrealistic. But I've added them with an asterisk.
---
Got a level 18 alt I'm only playing duo with a mage friend. Going into holy for consecration and then not really sure. Wanting to dungeon run a lot ideally. Assuming tanks are in short supply on this server as my main horde one.
---
Well shit that right there blows my mind, learning something new every day
---
Divine strength is worse than 1 handed specialization in every scenario where you'd be using 1 handed weapons. The block rating from strength is so small to be non existent. 
---
Let's look at it from a threat perspective. One handed specialization is basically 10% more threat from white damage. Divine strength is dramatically less. 7 strength = 1dps. Most prot paladins have 200 strength or less at Max level, because you need to prioritize other stats. Let's say you do have that 200 strength - that's only 20 strength, or just shy of 3 dps. Thats a pitiful amount. You're more likely to have closer to 180 strength to boot, so you'd actually end up with 18 strength instead. 10% damage might be small, but it's a multiplicative increase and is better for threat generation and damage than 10% strength.
---
When I said endgame, I meant endgame farm for money :)
---
Raiding is still the endgame content for everyone (that's interested in it).
---
Seems like a completely reasonable comparison to me!
---
Only really better than other rings if you are fighting crit cap. AKA kinda good, not absolute always BiS as others claim.
---
aah it resets threat completely ? Do you use it before you get aggro or only when you get it ? Cause if Onyxia would turn to me for example her cleave or breath would fuck others :D 
---
So far i have been using gnomish cloaking devices in some cases to reset aggro lol
---
If you don't have a 100% mount by phase 2 you are going to absolutely rinsed
---
Do you have an example I could see?
---
As a druid healer, I try to never use my big heals. This story makes me sad.
---
It depends on how I'm playing. If I'm focusing then I want to minimize my downtime and play efficiently, but most of the time I have a show on my second monitor, or I'm snacking, or I'm browsing reddit and I appreciate the down time to focus on other things.
---
I like both depending on my mood.
---
Honestly if I wasn't addicted to WoW as a teen I probably would have gotten into trouble, gotten a chick pregnant and be in a worse place in life. WoW was something that kept me grounded and oddly enough, it kept me focused.
---
Honestly I’m kinda glad retail has declined over the years as has my addiction.
---
If your 33 and fish STV is amazing for floating wreckage, firefin and oily blackmouth
---
In my experience, people who say this are trash and are usually just salty because they get looked over by better players. There is nothing wrong with trying.
---
This guy is actually UD. You can see the edge of Rune of the Guard Captain in his trinket slot. Not sure what effect is making him human. Some Halloween thing I guess.
---
Do you have an example build I could look at and follow?
---
I've edited the image to remove the elixir of greater agility. And this will also save ME money from my own raiding. So I'm happy. Thanks for letting me know man.
---
No, that's literally what I just said.
---
Yeah, and still I think it's a dps loss vs say mass of mcgowan/cho rush(or mirah) with flakameguard gauntlets or even devilsaur.
---
Would be working for me if I never played wow.
---
I agree it isn't like Herod full with queues, but we still have 2 layers and it's pretty busy everywhere. I love it.
---
Because they didn't know it existed.
---
That is horrible... Condolences friend

---
I think for me the key behind "viable" is whether or not you need gear from that instance (or higher) to tank it. Generally speaking, shamans can't tank content in a natural progression order. They need gear from those instances to tank those instances.
---
Of course you can say "But a literal god playing with his acolytes who are perfect dps and a perfect healer can do it". Memespec enthusiasts will definitely use that argument (and have at me in the past).
---
But in my mind viable means "realistic expectations about party members" as well as realistic gearing.
---
I didn't have much time to fish so my numbers won't mean anything,
---
But I fished the pool on arrival and got another one 20 minutes later, fished another 40 without seeing one, then got called to help guildies do 5 mans.
---
Is there a definitive explanation for how Reckoning works in Classic and what situations you would use it for in PvE? I know there are a ton of old vanilla-era build guides out there that include a version of Reckoning before the 1.12 changes, based on how it worked originally in vanilla, but no longer works in Classic in the post-1.12 version. I've also not seen a whole lot of super clear comments about how it does work now and why you would, or would not, choose it as a talent in current PvE builds.
---
From using this talent myself for quite a while, all I can say is that I never saw any visible indication in-game that it was actually doing anything at all. This was when I also had Redoubt talented, which triggers on the same condition (receiving a critical hit), so I had expected that there would be some noticeable proc at the same time from Reckoning.
---
I read some comments in response to similar questions about it, which said that the way it works now, in Classic, is that when you get crit, it just silently resets your swing timer, which has the effect of giving you an "extra" auto-attack. For such a high tier talent, that seems like a really meh effect, even if an extra swing also comes with a possible extra Wisdom / Light or Righteousness proc.
---
So, my question is, does anyone know from using this talent exactly how it does work now, and based on how it does work, is there something not obvious about it that makes it really good even though it might appear like it's not doing much, or anything, that is directly visible? Also what are the situations when you would want to use it in normal PvE? Is it a good talent for tanking 5-mans in like a 31-point Prot setup? Only good for open world AOE mob farming? Or is it only really good for cheesing duels and other PvP situations and not really a PvE talent?
---
No, but you'll have the impression of it because of the higher kill speed.
---
Let's assume you have infinite mobs you can kill. Farming alone you kill x per hour. If you now group up with someone who also kills x per hour, you suddenly see the drops of 2x per hour.
---
So in short, it doesn't change anything in terms of drop rate, you just perceive it as more as your brain only acknowledges time spent rather than mobs killed.
---
It's called EQDKP. You do stuff outside the raid like farming consumables (or simply send gold, because currently we are preparing to buy ingots). It's a good way to keep people from simply raidlogging once a week.
---
You can't spend 1000g per week to earn 1000DKP. There is a cap of 40 DKP whereas we earn 400 per raid. This ensures that you can't buy your item, however it incentives playing outside the raid.
---
Yeah was thinking that or I go buy a skullshield not sure if it's worth long term
---
You gain extra healing from spirit also, about 3.
---
how does pursuit of justice work? is it 68% movement speed on first mount and 108% on epic? Im probably stupid
---
Optimizing your rotation makes you a mouth breather?
---
A part of the charm for me is reading stuff people like you write. Hilarous and unedicational at the same time!
---
I used to use Critline for that, but I don't know if it has a version for classic.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' "bad things happen - &gt; therefore everything is the same therefore nothing is good or bad" "argument" of resignation.
---
Right?  The general level of content on this sub is so incredibly low, half the front page posts for the last two weeks are someone showing off a loot drop, or tanks complaining about dps.  
---
This video was fun and interesting.  I enjoyed it.  Some level of effort went into it other than taking a screenshot of a felstriker.
---
From a healer perspective, just make sure your pet isn't constantly taking avoidable damage. For example, don't use a pet on Shazz. It will get AoE'd and I don't have the mana or patience to keep pets alive. Same with Baron. If your pet is getting roasted, I don't have mana to spare and heal him. I'd say just take the dps hit on certain fights and be ready to use mend pet if it takes damage.
---
No clue what you're doing, but I have that happening so rarely that it simply doesn't matter.
---
Yeah people blaming 1 video game is just nonsense. Most of those people would likely waste their time on other shit if not for WoW.
---
Really basic question, but what are the best seals to do lower lvl when lvling? 
---
Atm I just run up to a mob with righteousness, nuke them and reapply it. Is there any point in the crusader seal/judgment later?
---
&gt; The whole point of classic  
---
Depends on who you ask.
---
Dalrends are even prenis until phase 3 anyways.
---
I'm not entirely sure when they pop it? I'm a tank. Ony is pretty easy so a lot of the time the guildies don't pop it.
---
I'd imagine you can probably pop it immediately before phase 3 or if you're afraid of taking a second fireball in phase 2.
---
If it weren't for video games my life would truly be completely different anybody else?
---
Meh. Still rich blessed and happy
---
The aura is nutty on paper but it gets problematic when your party members try to itemize around it because they either don't get their yellow cap in which case they basically *have* to have you in their group (and alive) or they don't in which case you're only helping their white swing; still good obviously, but less crazy good.  It's always nice for the draenei player though.
---
Here, you dropped this: \
---
Ony was ez mode before DM was released lol
---
I am unsure why and no one I have talked to knows either but Devilsaur spawn times are reduced and it kinda sucks as a devilsaur farmer. I mean.... yea it's easier to farm them but it's fucked the devilsaur economy up. The server I am on is weird but idk... ever since layers were removed I figured it would be impossible to get devilsaur but its been the opposite. Hardly that many people farming them compared to what they used to plus faster spawns. I already have an epic mount and am decent at getting to the spawns but now it just feels like I gain so much less when I get a skin. Stealing them from horde used to feel amazing... still does but not as great haha. Especially knowing it will be back up in only like 6 mins instead of 12-16.
---
How do you even log in to wow classic since its from the battle net launcher? Must be hard not to play classic at all.
---
I use recount, what makes Details better?
---
are they allowing server transfers?
---
You have no clue what u are talking about. Not even 25% of guilds will clear naxx in 2 weeks especially if they are lazy consumers like you. Enjoy wiping on loatheb
---
&gt; Hammer of the Northern Wind
---
Don't think they will get much more expensive. Might sell them for 50g its a lot for that weapon and buy something else you need rn
---
Maybe your server is different, seems extremely doubtful to me, but all bags but mooncloth and runecloth sell below cost specifically because people use them to level and are in overabundance.  Everyone leveling tailoring will make silk and mageweave bags, and so many people then also dump them back on the AH when they upgrade.  They're worthless as crafting for money. 
---
Mooncloth doesn't count for leveling discussions at all for multiple reasons, so its right out. 
---
Runecloth bags only sell for maybe 10-15s over mats at this point since the pattern has been *farmed 24/7 for months* and plenty of people have it now.  I've had the pattern for about 3 weeks now and I'd be surprised if I've made even 5g profit off selling bags.  
---
I don't think there's much if any money in tailoring, certainly not 30-50g, that's just outright ridiculous, at least an order of magnitude off.  If you can make 3g back while leveling tailoring in less than 4 months you're a damn legend.
---
If you look closely you'll see that I added some information that might help people if they see that the mobs still have red names and think something's wrong. Good luck buddy.
---
yeah i would need blessing on alliance or tranquil air totem as horde (but most ppl dont put those it seems) 
---
Heard some ppl respec into demonology for imp threat reduction but that spec seems kinda bad for pve in other aspects
---
He fixed the second larva not the first lmao
---
Nobody commented "nO cHAngEs"?  
---
Seriously... I also would like the health/mana bars under my char.
---
Care to explain why? I don't know how the scoreboard differs so I don't have an opinion either way. But it'd be nice to hear the argument for/against.
---
You sound pretty racist to me.  Are you going to talk about black drug dealers shooting up the streets next?
---
Teach it the highest rank of fire resistance and stamina, and control it better. If a boss drops aoe on the floor, or casts an aoe around itself, move your pet out of it. It's a simple "get better at pet management" issue
---
Are you brain dead?
---
Hey man, sorry I'm relatively new here, however when I see comments that straight up shut down someone or something without a try of debate I tend to check that person's history. And yours sadly is overwhelmingly spewing hatred and aggression mate.. Wanted to make a short MC video to try and convince you but I don't think it's worth it after reading the way you're inclined to address people.. Have a good one and hoping thing go better with you IRL.. All the love.
---
How do you set up your character sheet to display these information? Mine doesnt look like this :(
---
spawn times got cut in half for whatever reason. Sucks ass as a devilsaur farmer lol
---
Racism is not a important problem our country is facing?
---
They won't take a warrior regardless, it's all for HoJ and want literally zero competition.
---
thats fucking hilarious
---
More like heroic strike after 20. Sunder after 20 is almost always better.
---
We get it, you're on the spectrum and you're the best player on the planet. We'll still be doing the same content as you at the same time because it's hilariously easy and over half of us have done it before, including the tanks that are aware what their BiS is and they don't care because they can do this stuff without one ring. I'm sorry you guild has to try so exceptionally hard to have fun.

Move on with your day.

Lol I blocked this guy as soon as I saw his trade spam. Something about giving LW a "free" salt shaker
---
Also if they themselves aren't using details! or tiny threat, then yours is basing it off their combat log which isn't very accurate.
---
Locks themselves may have no mobility, but they sure are great at making their enemies pretty “mobile” 😏

Yeah it must be this ,not everyone has it (you can notice that by not being able to see talents ,cause as far i know you cant disable that annoying feature in details)

And when tank doesn't have it aggro calculations are off.
---
Thank god I saw this post, I need to sign up before the deadline and let everyone know I can go
---
You seem like a reasonable person.
---
haha no, but there should be a "I'm looking for my friend I used to play with so we can play classic together" megathread...
---
I miss you Relkyx! *sniff*
---
They allow Gnomes, too.
---
Nothing wrong with letting lose appropriately, everything is wrong once it becomes a pathway to nihilism.
---
Runescape is honestly infinitely more addicting than WoW if you get into it. There's more to do and the grinding is a lot longer. As someone who played both, I don't understand how people can get addicted to WoW to any extremely unhealthy amount. Maybe if they're addicted to PVP but that's kinda rare. Otherwise you just get BIS gear and raidlog once a week.
---
True, my bad.
---
This is incredibly amazing; unfortunately, I’m from EU. If I were to roll on NA, would there be any huge downsides?
---
Wut..
---
Not only it is not possible to get exact range in dungeons, but it is not possible to get neither direction to target, nor camera rotation angle, nor camera vertical angle **in instances** (where healing is important)
---
What is "maybe possible" is to attach healing numbers to target nameplates (and suffer from 20yd nameplate range)
---
I became a resto healer IRL, I think I had a good balance.
---
Friend of mine got four succesful revives in one night with his.
---
Suffice to say he hasn't won a single piece of raid gear yet.
---
Ditto, use a password manager. Lately, they changed the in-game store to no longer allow passwords to be pasted from clipboard. Stupidest thing in the world. I don't know my password. It's long, very random, and a pain to type while alt-tabbing from game to pw manager. Ugh.
---
I'm not sure if they also disabled paste on the login page, but wouldn't surprise me. Much annoying.
---
I don’t know, I got to talk to the director of manned space flight the other day and had a small hand on Mars 2020 and the Orion Launch Escape System. So I don’t know, some of those things came about despite my avid WoW playing.
---
&gt;Life, uh, finds a way.  
---
FTFY
---
I like this build a lot and might move to it so I can still somewhat kill things
---
Is it an exploit to:
---
1. Buy materials cheap
---
2. Use professions to create some other item from those mats
---
3. Vendor for profit
---
Even though it might me a small profit per item, it can scale hugely if you are able to make good deals on mats. So my question is, it exploitive behaviour to leverage this for gold making?
---
Yup, learning when to run and how.
---
So this joke is going to get reposted 3 times a day minimum for the rest of classic, yeah?
---
I grinded the black dragon mobs in burning steppes while waiting for groups. The casters are very easy to kill and they drop a lot of silver being elites + black dragonscales if you are a skinner.
---
Hunters can solo the bosses in end game dungeons by kiting. Hunters can also sell runs for bosses that drop gear people need.
---
Tribute runs in Dire Maul and Ring runs in Mars can net you an additional 30g an hour if you have the customers lined up.
---
I like the utility of deep prot the stuns shouldn’t be discounted they will help keep your mages alive. Cheaper sunders nice but if I’m going high threat rotation is on the back burner.
---
Who the fuck sits in ungoro

Stay on your PVP server.
---
Your pet is going to die a lot in MC. There's a lot of aoe damage, especially for melee. 
---
To mitigate this, you want rank 4 fire and shadow resistance and rank 4 greater stamina. Like u/Zeteck mentioned, you shouldn't have your pet out for bosses with constant aoe damage like Shazz, Baron, and Rag.
---
Other than that, you need to be vigilant watching your pets health. It's more mana- and time-efficient to pull your pet back when it has less than 1,000 health and mend pet between trash pulls rather than having to rez/feed it. This saves you time drinking as well. If your pet does die (and it will happen a lot), be prepared to rez it as soon as the current pull ends.
---
I believe you need epic mount for 3 pull strat
---
Most people hit up the arcane tree to get clearcasting and whatever you get on the way there is just a bonus. Int to armor isn't worthless in 5 mans as you will inevitably take damage sometimes and...that can be nice. The talent to not resist your arcane spells is useful because you sometimes will want to cast Arcane Missiles or Arcane Explosion. Overall they're not great, but the idea is that they're bonuses on the way to the clearcasting talent(s).
---
(Also Improved Counterspell is hella good for pvp.)
---
Thank you, I hope you get one as well!
---
Low level AH/Bank alts are very common
---
Look, somehow they racked up!
---
Sorry but this is not true, there inst a situation where you wouldn't use this even if your not crit capped. The Agi is huge and the hit will expand crit cap but also benefits whites. You have another ring slot to use say quick strike (not that a rogue should get this over a war), AV ring, etc too.

1% crit chance is only worth 7-8 spellpower? Damn why would anyone ever take any of those +1% crit chance weapons when you cold take a weapon giving 20+ spellpower then
---
Niceme.me
---
I believe you, you clearly know what you're talking about.  I've thought about this a lot. But it seems weird because a lot of times when I'm rage starved, an overpower procs a flurry and I suddenly have rage whereas I probably would have just been auto swinging for a while to get any.  Then again auto attack is such a large majority of dmg in parse.  I often find myself wondering if the swap is worth it in the end when I'm low rage and have no other buttons to press.  But I find it really hard to not press it when it always seems to result in a (perceived) positive gain.  So I can totally understand why someone would over value it
---
Even if you do that you'll spend so much time looking for the tank that others are going to lose patience and leave.
---
There is no "one and only reason". People do and like what they have at hand, so the aviability of Mc Donalds and Coca cola and their price is actually a reason why some people are fat.

Right but you won’t be back to the spot we fought at, that quickly. 
---
Takes a while to get anywhere in Classic. 
---
Way to lose despite cherry picking though.
---
L1 works for everything.  I waited until my main was 60 before leveling my bank alt to 5 for the DE loot bump...it's been able to DE everything i get in endgame with no limits.
---
Right, but when you're flying no one else sees you, also when they were brought to the mainland you could circumvent a lot of the player hubs.
---
God human casters look funny. Grats though I'm jealous

Cause TBC will require less. No need for writing new story and making new stuff, just update the old game and drop it.
---
Again, we get it. The only way you can complete content is by tryharding it to the absolute max. Other people don't have the same problem and can just have fun.
---
Move on.
---
Those tanks should have stayed here: "You could have chosen to be a tank in the current expansions, where every dungeon is five minutes long and every raid is linear. You could have chosen to have insta-threat and insta-queues"
---
I've grouped with some exceptional tanks (always try and recruit them to my guild), and I have grouped with some terrible tanks (always grateful to be running with a guildie or two that can pick up the slack).
---
&gt; If the item received only benefits one person (whether by being equipped or sold, i.e. you're playing with strangers and you aren't a group that plays together, just a pick up game for a dungeon or quest or whatever), then anyone who will use the item should roll need and anyone who will sell the item should roll greed.
---
I do agree that I was getting off base, and conflating many points within our discourse but I also appreciate the discussion. Thank you for keeping it rational and articulate. 
---
I hope this isn't "pulling the rug from under" or fully redefining the issue at hand but I'm revisiting this from a later point in time without catching up with the entire thread.
---
In a perfect world, assuming everyone acting in accordance with these principles I'll fully admit and agree with you --- this is the intent and the best practice of the loot system.
---
I do believe though one of my first points was addressing unfortunately we're not in that perfect world (only in regards to the scenario of PUGs and grouping with strangers.)  Furthermore, to that point I think it's reasonable to hedge this risk on high value items. For this I'll define as Epic BOEs. 
---
The degree of which you need to hedge is dynamic. If I'm enjoying the group and they seem like great people, and the tailor needs Truefaith pattern --- have at er man. If someone communicates they're looking for an item and acting in accordance with those statements, or if it's something that aligns with their class and spec. Sure, all great. If they go on to sell it, well some people are like that and things will work out.
---
I will still likely be one of the last to select greed though if I don't know how things will play out, if there wasn't much talk of what we'd do if running into a random epic BOE, that's where I'd perceive the risk to be higher.
---
You may say that's selfish, or am I simply acting in accordance with the reality we face and the world we live in. It's anecdotal to suggest bad or selfish scenarios happen often enough to warrant this attitude and one can even argue you're a product of the attitude you express, but going back to vanilla retail days I've had wonderful groups and I've had ninja'ing groups. It's equally as anecdotal to suggest it doesn't happen nearly enough as I'm suggesting. 
---
To wrap this up though, if I'm in awesome groups, just to the point where the group is chill and we're having fun. I'd rarely think twice about smashing that greed and letting someone have it since I'd be happy for them. Alternatively, if no one's said a word and communicated they're specifically farming an epic BOE drop I'll be hella cautious on how to proceed
---
you can use them, but not craft them
---
Na since blizzard servers are dogshit it will just be a rage inducing lagfest. Sucks that a billion dollar company hosts worse servers than pservers
---
Because everyone wants to be like vanilla.  Everyone has a positive mindframe as the game encourages social interactions
---
That definitely makes sense.
---
More DOTsssss!
---
Shatter is useful in most cases for trash. It's better than Winter's Chill at least (which only you benefit from, and whether or not you actually benefit is complete RNG anyway. You might get 10 crits in a row or 0 for a whole boss fight). That said, the best way to utilize Shatter is to nova + CoC because the dps aren't going to wait for you to cast Flamestrike for crits, and you may lose a lot of novas in the 3 second cast window. (You could still definitely try it, though. Some groups are better than others.)
---
I never saw reserving used the way it is now though. Basically anyone making a group or pug just puts whatever they want on reserve. Ive seen 5 mans where 2 friends start it and reserve like 5 pieces of loot. Or BoEs
---
Thanks for confirming this, I was fooled!
---
Downranking is not something you want to worry about until you have a decent amount of +healing. 
---
There are two reasons for downranking. The first is the most obvious - if using your highest rank would overheal, you’re better off using a lower rank that will still do enough healing while costing less mana. 
---
The other reason for downranking is that if (and only if) you have enough +healing on your gear, lower ranks have more healing per mana (HpME). Without any +healing, the highest rank will generally always (for all healers) be the most mana efficient rank for the given spell. 
---
As a paladin in particular, you don’t need to downrank in dungeons even if you have some spellpower / bonus healing. The reason for this is that ideally, you concentrate healing into big spells (max rank Holy Light) and then wait as long as possible without casting anything before you need to cast again to keep the tank / group alive. If you can go without casting for more than 5 sec, you start regaining mana again which will make you last longer. 
---
The only exception is a long fight where people are constantly taking damage. In that scenario you may want to downrank FoL.
---
Bronze Dragonflight signet, master dragonslayer and Don Julios are all better rings unless you are specifically fighting crit cap.  Hit past yellow cap is overrated by many prebis lists and players.
---
popping 16 bogling roots every 10 minutes is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more trouble than it's worth.  That's like cutting off your weiner and stretching it and then sewing it back on to gain .01 inches.
---
1. Shadowed Unit Frames is easy to adjust settings, not as complex as some of the others
---
Well in that case shamans are viable as tanks up to level 50. Because I've only tanked every dungeon I've run. Up till Sunken Temple, which I could have tanked pretty easily but chose not to because I didn't know the dungeon. 
---
Shaman tanking has just been really fun so far so I hope to stretch it as far as possible.
---
&gt; Can't be hacked if you don't know your own password.
---
Not only very wrong, but also isn't even funny. #confused
---
I staggered nagaland and the abotalypse because I could see myself logging on, doing all the daily stuff and felt done with wow for the day. I even took time off.
---
Even bgs got super grindy IMO. To have high rank honor you had to grind a LOT.
---
Honestly if you are deep tank the points are better spent in the int. White damage means very little for your threat , Mana to cast spells is important
---
When you call someone out for being wrong, but you're also wrong.
---
It's 8 runes. You probably forgot the bridge above golemagg
---
Except... Troggs
---
100% bad item, warden staff was already better, but now the DM tribute wep is easy accesable ur item is useless sadlt
---
Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for. I'll definitely follow this and do the quests to get xp and gear. Really helpful. Did you just make the list based off personal experience?
---
With #onechange comes great responsibility
---
No shit a level 1 needs help to "solo" Hogger. Would it be better if he made a video called "I die to Hogger at level 1"?
---
If you get the other faction mad enough for them to bring 60's when you as a twink are probably killing 5-10 levels above your level already, than you have won and you can go to sleep while they try to camp you.
---
My 19 twink has beated a 38 shaman, 33 warlock, 30 mage, and multiple 20's already.
---
One in the park in Sw, many ppl forget because it got destroyed in wotlk 
---
Also there is one outside dire maul
---
I think the most I ever did was just under 370 sustained single target. I haven't seen any parses over 410dps, so yes Ret potential damage is way lower than other classes. My guild brought me because of buffs and debuffs. In 40 mans I ran Nightfall Axe for the spell power buff to all of our casters. Arguably a net percentage of their buffed damage was brought by me, so they figured why not have me as 1/40th of the raid? I could offheal when needed and with Righteous Fury, I could pull small adds into the Tanks' cleave/TClap range for easy pickup. I played it like a support class, because as mentioned, it wasn't capable of high dps. It's just really fun in my opinion.
---
The reason is they are eating/drinking too much. You can eat at McDonalds and drink coke everyday and not be overweight.
---
I have leveled arms and can tank dungeons just fine, all the way up to Sunken Temple so far, I might change to prot for BRD and above but please don't feel like you have to switch.  Once I got sweeping strikes and the level 30 class quest done to get the axe it made solo questing infinitely better.  I still always quest vs. green monsters but that's okay, I just lurk in LFG waiting for the right group to form while questing or just start one myself.
---
I'm sorry to hear about your guild mate passing, I'm sure she's in a better place.  Sweet screenshot though!
---
The build you linked looks perfect. You definitely want maxed tranquil spirit and reflection for raiding. You shouldn't need Nature's Focus for anything.
---
I'd like to see them announcing both tbc and wotlk realms. Leave classic realms on vanilla content, but allow to freely transfer characters from an "older content" realm to a "newer content" one.
---
It's not a good talent because your regen in combat is pretty bleh anyway. Allowing a teeny tiny portion of it to continue won't net you much in the long run. Taking talents to ensure spells hit harder or you have more utility is more important IMO.
---
Some people want to play for top damage efficiency etc.... stop telling them how to play.
---
This is what passes for content here now?
---
So this is why so many trolls use deviate delight...
---
No not at all. As long as you're not fucking anyone else over you do you. The entire point of professions is to take mats and turn them into something more valuable, doesn't matter if its to vendor or to auction.
---
Grobbulus players represent!
---
so much its like 5G just to post it up
---
Seal of Righteousness is better than Crusader (SoR is your go-to until Command). Judging Crusader can be worth doing on mobs that die very slowly (elites or mobs with a lot of health).
---
I tried going with a reckoning build and it's extremely lackluster. The /sit exploit does NOT work in PvE, and there is no visual indication that reckoning procs other than redoubt, like you said. You could probably find an add-on that alerts you though.
---
It's has some use in dungeon tanking, but it's worthless for raid tanking because if you get crit, you're pretty much dead. 
---
The main use for it is when you're at level 60 and start stacking thorns type effects. With a good show spike, something like skullflame shield and that engineering shield other talents like holy shield and blessing of sanctuary, enemies can take several hundred points of damage every time they attack you. So you can pull large crowds of enemies, let all the crits roll in and massacre them with all your extra auto attacks. 
---
But that only works at high levels. As of right now, the only other use i could see would be when you're healing in PvP and store up a bunch of reckoning stacks. Combine that with SoR, a weapon like ironfoe/strong proc weapon, an enchant like fiery or lifestealing, and maybe even HoJ you can do a massive burst of damage to whoever is harassing you. SoR is an important part of that setup because it procs off every reckoning hit, and it also doubles your proc rate for build in weapon procs and enchants. If you're lucky and using all the stuff listed you could get off like 8 hits at once plus all that holy damage and enchant procs.
---
I'm leveling a farming alt. picked warlock since i'd never played one before.
---
Holy shield / reckoning is actually very consistent damage. But that deep into prot
---
Yes max rank FoL for throughput, rank 1 for efficiency, max rank holy light sparingly to save a life (be wary of trying to save someone with a larger slower heal, sometimes this will end up letting them die before the cast goes off).
---
The 3 piece set bonus modifies the judgement debut so everyone is getting 10% more healing from JoL. It’s very good for a melee heavy raid.
---
Either is good depending on what you need more of.
---
No horde claimed the Badlands? Shat are they doing this is such a hot spot
---
This is like the most common opinion on the sub.
---
this is some guy who just started playing rogue 2 months ago and thinks he is competitive because he does 600 dps on lucifron and the other rogues in his guild do 300.  I guess it serves as a decent guide for someone who randomly stumbled upon a raid-ready level 60 without ever having played rogue before, but it's literally the most basic information available.
---
You don't even use a mount for doing 3 pulls, other than getting to the GY from the instance entrance. Iceblock pull, double shield pull, then iceblock pull again, don't even need to use snap.
---
which DM weapon are you referring to?
---
Justice - D.I.S.H.
---
I'd never heal an emp run with a 54 tank. Good god, talk about being carried by the healer. There's no way a 54 tank would hold aggro efficiently on the later part of that dungeon. Emp is level 59.
---
That's clearly a pvp spec.
---
He's going to be surprised that a bunch of fellow autists sympathized with the poopsocking loser in his story?
---
Thanks. Wouldn't the stat reduction and chance-on-hit bonus of Seeping Willow offset the slower speed of Twig in PvP though? I keep swapping back and forth between the two and Twig legit only adds 1 more damage to my weapon swings, and I can assume Command procs.
---
Anyways, if Seeping Willow is better for PvE, would it be worth it to invest Crusader Enchant on it? I don't know I will get a better weapon until raids.
---
with most mc boss fights taking about 30 seconds the dagger one should prob be more like bs &gt; snd &gt; bf + ar &gt; bs x3 &gt; *pool* &gt; snd &gt; bs x3/4/5 using thistile tea if needed &gt; evis  
---
you will evis a 3/4/5 cp if its a 20-30s fight.
---
On the slightly longer 40s-45s fights fights i usually hold off on AR + bf until crusader procs. if I'm 15 seconds into the fight and no crusader i just go for it.
---
I don't see The Enclave (A) on this map. I'll just assume they control all territories
---
It isn't, you make it sound like WoW is so intensely interesting and engaging that real life doesn't compare, when most of the reason it's so compelling is because it's built to appeal to your most base instincts. There's a difference.
---
As a main priest healer in MC, I 100% agree with this.
---
chest is from BRD emporer, trying for the strath chest tho
---
That mainhand he has is much better than dalrends main hand it appears he’s using deathbringer which just overall is better
---
Yeah it seems hunters, tanks and druid have ez time with loot in MC.
---
Yes I am shadow. You can solo the succubus's, you los their shadow bolts by the rocks. I haven't tried it yet. It was talked about in the priest discord. There is as youtube video of a disc priest soloing it.  It was just slower.
---
I went there as level 54 orc shaman, no one was there, even the guards stopped giving a shit.
---
 I was there for more than 30 mins and saw 3 allies no of which was 60.
---
Holy shit I forgot that existed. That was so cool back then
---
Anyone with a handle on economics?
---
The ones who do the most flaming are the ones like you telling everyone they are no life mouth breathing tryhards everytime they whisper a word about optimization. Just let people play the way they enjoy shit.
---
He's speculating.  Opening ceremony hasn't even started yet.
---
If you aren’t padding your parse on smoldering corehound corpses, are you really a mage?
---
sure, but why would it be a bad idea to do a dry run alone if it's possible?
---
Ok I'll break it down. We had 5 people in the instance and a shitty 59 rogue still out in searing gorge. No mage so only aoe before boss was a dps warrior who died on aoe part. We were so slow killing the pack before boss that 2 or 3 were still up when boss aggroed. Tank died and we were all dead with boss around 2%.
---
It turns out that when you wipe the boss despawns and door stays locked.
---
MC nowadays is trivial at best.  I just raid healed a run a few nights ago and was the #4 total healing with the least overheal of all heals as a 31/20/0 spec.  You do not need to spec into resto at all to be a useful and efficient healer when raids are running high number of heals with the stat of dps in this late vanilla build.
---
How’s your gear? Is it possible they are just so stacked they have the extra rage to dump? I also wouldn’t be surprised if they are using rage pots on CD to top logs
---
What’s ACLG?
---
Lol totally fair for all the lost lives, homeless people your absolutely right, also fair for him to take campaign contributions too. Yup makes sense to me
---
Good to see since I'm on grob.  Now I just have to get past level 25
---
Chuck Norris and Ragnaros had an arm wrestling contest and the loser had to be the first raid boss.
---
I don't want classic+
---
I want tbc+
---
Yes you can tank. Unless you totally despise your looks, it's not worth it UNLESS you just want two warriors
---
Thunderfury says hi.
---
No spoilers, but there's an entire demo area that isn't listed on the Con map. 
---
Anybody want to guess what colors the led case fans are glowing?
---
Ye, you got me. I'm in tears!   
---
I'm definitely not just bored at work, trolling an angry keyboard warrior!
---
Should I do herb/alch or mining/blacksmith on my warrior? It's currently only lvl 18 and I hope to start playing it more. The alchemy seems good because then I could make my own and I seem to use a bunch, but having my chars name on the gear I could one day makes sounds good too
---
The offhand hits don’t register as HS. If they did, the count would be far, far higher than 11-15.
---
Some bosses have threat reset mechanics that threat meters do not account for. For example Ony has a threat reduction knockback and the fireballs in phase 2 also reduce threat. So you're probably seeing your way behind the tank when in reality the tank has had their threat reduced drastically that hasn't been accounted for.
---
I can't imagine so, but it depends on if they've got enough other good stuff to talk about/announce/etc.
---
Kinda what I expected but wasnt sure. Thnx.
---
I told them at that I give up and am going to bed.
---
No it’s not. But if you wanna be a tank I’m highlighting you won’t be post 5-10 mans. Luckily op doesn’t want to raid.
---
We can help you, but we need more details. 
---
Ok for real though, your heal rotation for a roughly correct level healer in a dungeon, is wait till the tank is at 50% then start casting your highest rank heal (not the fast heal the regular one that changes its name over the course of leveling) do it twice. Your tank should be back at 100% after two casts, if he is full after one either you didn't actually wait till 50% or he doesnt have enough hp for this dungeon. Then you wait, as long as possible to repeat that 2 cast. You will regenerate mana if you can wait for longer than 5 seconds so its in your interest to batch together your casting. Don't use PW:S unless the tank is dying ( i.e 25% or less) and if you do, use the shield then the fast heal then a full heal, and he should be better. 
---
If a dps is taking damage and its not a boss? Let them deal with it. If you try to heal both the dps and the tank you are suddenly more than doubling your healing threat generated and chain casting, both bad things for your longevity. If it is a boss, well you probably want to heal the dps enough to keep them alive, so make sure they are above 50%
---
Lolwut?
---
Go home automod you drunk.
---
Hmm interesting, I think 1 of the problems with it is that you do not know the orientation of the other players/mobs relative to you. 
---
To explain what I mean imagine everyone is standing in a line in front of you, now rotate this line 180° around yourself and every range check will still be exactly the same.
---
That is probably the main issue, maybe it is possible to further nail down the approximate locations of each player by knowing in which direction they are facing.
---
I guess HS is number 1 because it basically replaces your white hit. The better your gear (and buffs) are, the more rage you have and the more you use HS instead of white hit. So a very geared fury uses HS on almost all his white hits.
---
And we got da best mount, mon.
---
The gear that drops at level 58 in Outland so far outpaces the junk you get in those vanilla dungeons. I know that when I played tbc it's one of the reasons I never did them. That said, they could update those as well to make a smoother curve.
---
You can have one of each in your bag but they overwrite each other if u try to use them.
---
I've had good luck requesting side quests from people doing arena anger forge runs.  But you gotta research it and lead it sometimes, so be prepared.
---
Yeah maybe it depends. I dinged 60 about a week before DM release and just started raidloging about two-three days after it sl I doubt much changed.
---
I just hit lvl 51, What is the best level to start it do you think?
---
I can't login either.
---
I 100% thank Diablo 2 Multiplayer for teaching me to not be a dumbass.
---
Nah, me too as well....
---
As a shaman, I make my own groups and because I am a shaman, I need on all healing gear, spell power gear, and enhance gear. I also run as a tank because I'm the only tank that doesnt res on orbs. I make warrior tanks obsolete. New meta!!!
---
samo
---
Been clearing weekly and we have no caster weapons
---
9 mages and 4 locks and we all have blue weapons
---
Down it is
---
The problem with this whole content phase thing is that we will all be absolute BiS before the next phase comes out.
---
So yes, everyone will be in BiS BWL gear by the time AQ comes out and c'thun will be a cakewalk without any flasks.
---
Fury prot is not better for threat for fresh 60s. You won't have enough hit or crit gear to out-threat deep prot. Shield slam is way better when you're undergeared than bloodthirst.
---
I wouldn't make bags before mageweave, but you seem to be misunderstanding- I am not saying that you are going to make profit, just lose less money by doing things that  the wowhead guide doesn't cover
---
What's that about trading the item? Is that an addon or something special for legendary items?
---
Got disconnected and can't login.
---
same, im on Flamelash
---
Then don't and just switch to feral 5-man tank spec, because you're gonna be going back to strat for a long time trying to role against casters who dps 5-mans but heal raids.
---
Enchanting or Alchemy
---
I've been channeling Drain Soul for 3 minutes now while a bear keeps hitting me.
---
If you spec balance, but don't go Moonkin, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Cheers. I really recommend an AH alt by the way. Saves a lot of time and bag space just mailing yourself everything!
---
99.9% of regulation in WoW is automatic.  If that guy got five of his friends to report the OP, then the OP would be punished maybe even banned, regardless if he did anything actually wrong, because of the automation system Blizzard uses.  Reporting for offensive name, language, spamming, all work this way and I've been seeing it abused since Classic launched.
---
yeah, same here, flamelash.. could it be due to blizzcon or something .-.?
---
&gt;Everyone knows too much, to the point where there's no spots where you can really grind in peace.
---
Grind dungeons. You don't have any competition.
---
May I ask u sir what addon u use for exp tracking? (top bar)
---
Depends on the content. In MC, the only CC apart from Executus is gonna be Banish so you can multi to your hearts content, and on Executus the adds will be CC immune by the time you get back from kiting an add.
---
Yeah, same here...
---
The port to Darn takes you right to the moonwell. The one in SW doesn't.
---
Obviously not everything is the same. It depends on the enjoyment you get out of it. My point is that people waste time in a lot of ways - but if you are enjoying yourself, who cares? It's up to you if you want to view it as wasted time or not.
---
My gear is pretty solid. Full BiS/pre-bis except missing Onslaught Girdle. Have ony tooth, lionheart, AotDW/Flurry on an Orc, devilsaur legs and gloves, striker’s mark, quick strike, etc.
---
My damage definitely isn’t “bad”, I average around 8-900. But I’m certainly not pushing 1.4k like some of these guys, and my damage distribution is completely different, which leads me to think I’m doing my rotation wrong—prompting post.
---
I think you do know. And that's why you made that clickbait title.
---
Those talents are not good
---
lol mara is trash, I ran it for a while before DM came out, its inferior to just farming essences in the real world even with herbalism
---
Dates for phases would be my only guess.
---
:)    The BEST side of online gaming.  That and sweet transmog.
---
I know how to do it, but either herb prices are insanely high in your server or you get very lucky with greens.
---
50g an hour with Lasher and Herb farming is impossible on my server.
---
But isn't your advice just a shortcut to short term happiness. You're saying who cares indulge in your vices so you feel good (what makes you happy) whilst at the same time critiquing Western culture for being too focused on happiness.
---
That's crappy advice, if I eat too much I'll be happy in the short term but then I'll get fat and in the long term that will make me unhappy.
---
Same goes for this, if I play wow all day I'll be happy in the short term but you're gambling with an 80 year life span (if you're lucky) and in the long term if all I've ever done is played wow and haven't achieved much else in life I'll be unhappy
---
Do the D.I.S.H
---
Healing you could go in 1-2 levels lower than the start of the range I listed for sure.  Tanking you'll want to be 1-2 levels from the minimum level I listed.
---
No need to get all snitty.
---
If they run out of "end game" stuff, like, all of it, they can *replay the game with an alt.*
---
Replay value matters, right?  I mean,  it's why we're playing a ten year old game.
---
Nah. I  Just launch classic wow's .exe instead of bnet client.
---
You can start as soon as 52
---
I can log in just fine.
---
Herb/Alch is better for when you are 60.

Yea, out of my league haha. Wish I could help more. Let me know when you find out! I’m tanking these days but always love more information. I’ll keep an eye on the thread

Idk what my play time is, I'd guess about 12 days, but in addition I played for a lot of vanilla and some of BC (over 100 /played), and have only ever seen one world-drop epic, in a UBRS 10-man raid a week or two ago.
---
Yep, some weird stuff started going on, then I tried to relog and couldn't. Can't log in currently.
---
I've never COD once in my fifteen years of wow.  Lol.
---
Just happened minute ago on Pyrewood Village realm.
---
This is when having good guildies comes in handy
---
Very cool
---
Are you kidding? You get the hit needed in like one day
---
I've played on Incendius since launch and I love it. It feels like the Horde has a little larger population, but they might just be more aggressive. Still very fair and balanced.
---
same here
---
I believe the tipping point is somewhere around 25-30 seconds. If your fight is lasting longer than that you should start with crusader. Shorter than that save your mana
---
Just tried to logon to Flamelash and checked here, it seems to be the only server that is offline in EU.
---
I feel bad for the one flagged player in there.

Even in csgo, its frowned upon to focus on the number of kills and instead to just focus on getting that sweet 16th round. Yes dropping a 30 bomb means you did a lot of great in that game, but winning should be the focus, and sometimes you play a role that does not translate to big kill games.
---
Mostly correct imo. I wouldn't switch to crusader unless it's a boss, because that mana can be better spent (holy shield, consecration downranked, savinf judgement of the righteousness to act as a pseudo-taunt)
---
Dude I may not 100% believe him, but it's really not a very far fetched joke considering the context... I'll allow it
---
You don't have to, seems like the biggest issue with hunters saying it doesn't make much money is ones that aren't doing it right.
---
good.
---
Actually you didn’t add anything since the mobs won’t attack you.
---
you can see people using the sword with a similar effect in onslaughts parses
---
username checks out
---
I've done two runs by just saying LFG for BRD and we ran the dungeon. Some people have also stated "Lfg BRD quest run" cause it shows you basically want to run the quests inside the dungeon
---
Pally power is best and most intuitive to use imo
---
It's about a mmorpg experience, which is generally shared with other people.
---
Just change the flying system so you can't fly indefinitely on a mount and give them cooldowns.
---
Well you done shot down my dreams or accruing internet points! 😭
---
Diablo 2 remastered announcement with release during Blizzcon please!
---
Until you go against range, and can't do anything against them.
---
Besides, Reckoning spec got nerfed so hard once they made the guaranteed Crit from /sit not proc abilities that unless you have the strictest of timings (easier said than done if you have latency issues) it isn't really worth more than Ret as a leveling spec.  You're better off going Ret, and actually being viable in dungeon runs.
---
For PvP though that's a different story, Reckoning can be pretty sick.
---
For those of us who arent "role players"...can you explain this? The RP guilds pick random towns to populate?
---
We’re stout*! See you on the battlefield!
---
How much is the difference between DM Tribute and Mara? My hunter doesn't have Engineering.
---
Also do you think a hunter and priest could do DM:E Jump runs?
---
That’s a combat event :)
---
Hunters are fun. You have to time your abilities between autoshots and constantly strive to get that 100% perfect aimed shot cast. It's very dynamic.
---
I think at this point yes. WAY too early for any information regarding any further WoW Classic progression passed Naxx. I think MAYBE there is a slim slim chance they will say anything next year at Blizzcon about an expansion or something that would come in 2021 or 2022. I think this year you can expect Phase 2 and 3 information though.
---
Unrealistic how? Rouges are all about attack speed and youre talking about maximizing dps
---
Kinda similar to the argument whenever some government is criticised (e.g. China or Russia ) their media goes "but the west does this bad thing so all critique no longer applies"
---
I have farmed DM east with a druid and although it's tough to learn which totems to drop and when(especially the last boss), we finished it in about 15 min once I got it down.
---
I believe is mac address based, cuz when I lose connection with my router internet, I pop my phone lte and auto log in without asking me the auth code
---
Obviously, PvE servers are lame
---
40! did some noob banking to ensure it at 40 with 10 g to spare :D
---
&gt; but flasking for the first clear of bwl, and other raids is pretty reasonable for guilds that want to try
---
.... Why?
---
You will have literally no problems with your numbers going into bwl.
---
Yeeeee!!
---
no clue Im still working on trying to get it down clean.  i'd stick with mara this ones pretty hard tbh
---
Should be auto on.
---
I believe spy has a setting for only displaying KOS characters.
---
Nice enchant.
---
Shield slam is also only 20 rage so between that and the reduced sunder cost, it’s a lot easier to hold threat on multi-packs. And concussive stun is really good for that target at 33% you’re about to lose threat on, but will be dead in 5s
---
I'm a UD with edgemaster that's just a costome lol
---
absolutely not!!!
---
They watched streams then rerolled to be le uber pro AOE clear mage legend.  But don't know what they're doing.
---
can also do a CoC if you dare get near the trash packs
---
Incentivizes trying to top meters instead of playing objectives and focusing on winning.
---
This game is the majority of my social life, so pretty much the same with less fun.
---
One but I was duel box'ing it since hes going swords I wanted to get a main hand off him.
---
It shows up as a small little green bar. They'll see 45% not marked as green so they'll still heal them. I mean, "Wow a heal is coming for him to go from 50% to 55%, I guess I'll cover the other 45%". You know?
---
Correct, can also do some of lbrs.
---
I run by lowbies all the time and don't 1 shot them. Same concept really. If it's a 5v1, it's not very honorable to kill the 1.
---
It's not a big deal if it happens here and there, but when a server is 65-70% one faction, it happens constantly, and it's not very fun for the minority. 
---
To the original post: It gets better once you're level 40+. Horde feel bad it's so uneven, and attack you less and less the higher you're level. Try to group up to deter getting camped. The only caveat is at 60, game is back on. Most instance runs you'll need to plan for a 15 minute delay to drag your corpse to the instance , or stay in large groups.
---
If it's really causing you to want to quit, may be best off transferring when next available.
---
 Source: 60 Ally on skeram.
---
you must be doing them wrong
---
I play alliance on herod and don't really have any bad experience to share.  Granted,  I form and tank all my dungeon groups at 60 as a prot pal, and pug raid as holy. Don't know if that affects it,  but I try to bring a good vibe to my groups and usually get one in return.
---
I am pretty sure i went into MC and got a countdown before getting saved a few times. Could be a later thing i guess.
---
Sucks of all the BOE Epics I got one of the worst ones
---
He was just taking your measurements.
---
All of them.
---

---
Ghostly Strike is excellent for solo leveling. While active, your dodge is close to 40%. This makes your grinding uptime so much higher and efficient due to rarely taking damage.
---
aged core hound gloves
---
But that assumes your ip address had been rotated. I never tested this with blizzard but for other platforms I have to  reauthorize daily because my ip address changed
---
First? If one where an amoeba on a planet many lightyears away, living under the biggest rock around, without an atmosphere so no sounds.
---
There are other posts on this, but its not worth leveling an alt just for farming gold. 
---
Let's say it's 100h to 60 for your mage.
---
That's easily 5k gold you could've farmed on your warrior. 
---
Say you make 65g/h on your mage, add the time for leveling.
---
After another 100h, your warrior would've made 10k at 50/h and mage 6.5k at 32,5/h
---
Add another 100h, warrior is at 15k and mage at 13k at 43g/h
---
Next iteration you break even and start gaining from the mage. After at least 300h spent 
---
If you want a mage, sure, but not for the sole purpose of making gold
---
Hello everyone. A friend and I just started new characters yesterday and I’m wondering how good a shaman and a mage will pair. I rolled warlock but I really like shaman so I might re roll since I’m low level still. Just wondering if anyone has an experience with this combo or can speak on it. Thanks!
---
There’s a lot of tricks and routes that you wouldn’t know until someone tells you where to go. Certain mobs are expected to be skipped, faster paths to the boss, etc. You might as well just get someone who as run it before tell you where to go, you only need 1 run to get up to speed
---
hahahaha fuck it, we shall proceed with no caution whatsoever!
---
Lowbies only get fort :P
---
Low expectations so you can only be surprised? ;)
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I'm not sure how I feel about it all. It's a love/hate relationship with WoW...
---
Yeah, how fucking random...
---
I’ve been Fury Prot since almost fresh 60 and it’s been the best. I can quest/farm if I need too, I can tank pretty much anything (haven’t ranked Rag yet, working on FR), and can even go as DPS in groups when I want a break from tanking. 
---
I do miss Tac Mastery, but having the variety has been great. Highly recommend 0/31/20. You can take 3 in Cleave over 3 imp off hand if you will mostly use a shield. I only Dual wield when my healer is stacked or once fight is under control, or just trolling lol
---
I swear yall have the wildest interactions with people.  Worst I've got is some dude being mad because I tagged his named mob, and that was like 30 levels ago.
---
It's also significantly better for your brain and health. It has proven benefits whereas excessive stress and repetition from video games has detriments. Not to mention the real social aspects of playing and performing music, and the much more rich depth of the field. These hobbies are not comparable.
---
Yep I'm UD fury / prot with edgemasters.
---
I just feel like the (negative?) extremes are more extreme and insular this time.
---
Back then there were also dicks, nice people, elitist players, casual players, knowledgeable players, clueless players, good players, bad players, all kinds of people. But this time the dicks are beyond dickish, nice people are hiding in their holes afraid of everyone, elitists are so elitist they're always raidlogged, casual players are focusing on being casual beyond reason to the point of actively failing, knowledgeable players know so much that it is kinda pointless, clueless players know so little that it would take active effort of average players to stay that way, good players are way beyond what we considered good back then but the really bad players are so bad compared to the average player that it seems they are on a level bot software could exceed easily.
---
you sound like agent smith smoked took 37 bong hits
---
&gt;  it doesn't take long to get to major cities.
---
Says the Mage.. :D
---
I have not tried with spirit buff yet. Just got rank2 of it though so I'll try this weekend
---
Oh wow, a post almost TEN YEARS AGO by someone that doesn't even work at Blizzard anymore. The ToS has been completely revamped since then. Back then, ninja looting used to be explicitly against the ToS, but now they have changed the policy to "Even if you say everything is free roll and ninja loot, we will not resolve loot disputes. It's up to the players to not group with ninjas." Imagine I linked that same post you did to justify my reasoning about something, when policy might have changed.
---
before classic came back I was just playing ff6, recetear, stardew valley, harvest moon instead. i just really enjoy grind games. I know it's a skinner box but it's a fun and creative skinner box with nice art and music and stories. just gotta be careful to not let it be all I do for too long
---
And for people who don't have English as native language, it's the best school for language... well, maybe except moving.
---
I shit you not, even though I never learned actual grammar and rules, for the most part my English has been better than most teachers through both high school and university studies.
---
I've always had pretty hard time convincing my English teacher that I don't study for that class at all.
---
If you are going to be playing Horde, just quest out of the first zone to make it to the Barrens. You want to grind humanoids so you can get good vendor trash, cloth, and greens. Take up skinning to grind on some animals inbetween. Later levels there are some animals with good drops.
---
Barrens I recommend goblins and harpies to the north and dwarves to the south. The dwarves drop a good amount of wool which still sells well. When you move to thousand needles there is a big area of centaur in the middle of the map, north side of the road. They drop a good amount of cloth, vendor trash, and greens. Once you level up higher you can move to the shimmering flats side and grind Basilisks and Turtles. They drop a bunch of vendor trash that sells well.
---
Once you get high enough you can move to Arathi Highlands and grind Dabyrie's Farm. It's horde only mobs and they drop a ton of cloth and greens. After grinding there I would recommend killing the higher level Gorillas and tiger/panthers in STV towards the south of the zone. You can also go to Tanaris and work the coast pretty much from 40 to 50 killing turtles. You will make about 5 to 7g an hour there. Once you get to your 50s you will just grind Humanoids/undead in the plaguelands.
---
How that helps!
---
... not really.
---
there's only a handfull of BoE epic who are truly valuable.
---
edgemaster, krol, boots of avoidance, stockade pauldron... basically warrior stuff ( + sash of mercy for non-priest healer).
---
there's very few non-warrior BoE epic who are worth getting excited about.
---
Can't say about other plataforms, but has been working with my wow account I dc sometimes a lot, that I even have a macro for my password to auto log in when I dc...
---
I just hit lvl 22 and it feels like SoC does less damage than SoR, am I not seeing something? How do I know when seal of command procs?
---
I tend to use the LBRS wolf for MC as you can get him in combat to do Furious Howl automatically. And he sits next to you buffing you with taking little or no damage.
---
I know Bloodsail Buccaneers has at least two guilds that do this, both Horde.  They RP two competing mercenary companies, one's based out of BB and the other Ratchet.  Not sure how they fight each other though.
---
I would think 2 pts aggression is better for eviscerates during AR+tea or finishing a fight under 60 energy
---
Sadly didn't work, nothing i seem to do is changing the issue.
---
2% damage on everything is not worthless in MC, it works on 7/10 of the bosses.
---
F
---
Those guys are like the punching bag of the server at this point lol... maybe they will make a resurgence in phase 2
---
Golemagg is a Giant, and Magmadar is a Beast. They're not immune to poisons.
---
Baron, Garr, and Rag are elementals. They are immune to poisons.
---
I want some of that.
---
I notice people rage quit dungeons alot more now instead of toughing it out after one whipe.
---
Yeap, like hunter barrage.
---
Yeah but imagine that there are 6 other SM-sized dungeons, all just for 40-45, with intricate quest chains that take you back multiple times. People generally wouldn't do them. The gear at max level is better, plus there are many of them so finding a group for some would be harder (especially true of UBRS, as a 10-man). They'll never be chain ran like they are now for gear. Hell, the only real reason people still chain run SM is because the wings are so damn short. Nobody is going to chain run scholo in BC.
---
Im fairly certain they did not say that but if you have a link I'll happily look.
---
How can anyone be surprised you did it with buffs. IMO its totally legit and was cool to watch. I'd be into any similar content, like soloing dungeons or what ever. Good job!
---
I wish I had seen this meme in 2007. Before I let WoW, specifically the Wrath of the Lich King Expansion, really take the reins of my life. I started in OG classic in 2005 during high school, and was really engaged in the social aspect of it. Casual, social gaming became steadily more addictive with each expansion until WoW was literally the only thing I wanted to do. I planned my life around it, pulled at least one all-nighter every week, ditched social and family commitments, put on around 20 lb of pure fat, and put even MORE time into the game when my ex fiancee cheated on me and I kicked her out of my place. 
---
One snowy Saturday morning in 2009 I was feeling particularly exhausted from a demanding raid. I had been awake since 7am on Friday. The raid hadn't gone well, and the guild leader had just finished chewing us out on Ventrilo for our failure. We were to report back at 3:00pm and several guildies set out to prepare flasks and whatnot for the second attempt. I logged out and decided to catch some sleep. On my way to the bathroom, feeling tired, sad from my recent breakup, and shitty from being berated (I'm sure two energy drinks and two microwave dinners from the night prior didn't help the shitty feeling), I saw the dust imprint on a ledge from a photo frame. The frame, removed during the breakup, used to hold a picture of us on vacation. I was on the verge of tears remembering the good times and knowing that all remained of those good times was an empty house, a dust imprint on a ledge, and WoW. 
---
Then I proceeded to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. Have you ever caught yourself just staring at your reflection in silence for a long period of time and not really knowing why you're doing it? That's what I did that day, and I hated what I saw. Raw, bloodshot, sunken eyes with wretched black bags underneath, pale skin, greasy hair with a strip flattened out by hours of headphone use, an unhealthy paunch belly, skinny, legs and arms that once looked toned when I had bothered to work out. I decided to no-show for the raid, and I quit WoW that day. My life has improved with each passing year, and I know it would have continued to spiral downwards if I hadn't quit.
---
If you can balance WoW with work, social commitments, family, relationships, self-care, etc. I'm not trying to judge you. I'm happy for you, and maybe even a little jealous because I can't be like you. Reliving Classic WoW is a constant temptation for me, but one I know I cannot involve myself in. 
---
TL;DR, this heavy meme wrecked me
---
Are you gatekeeping wow UIs? Lmao
---
None of these sucked...these ARE World of Warcraft, you're just being a fucking purist.
---
Hub cities especially are one of the coolest things in WoW, everyone hanging out in the same place. You're trying to pretend IF/Org in Vanilla aren't the same way?
---
This is wrong
---
SoC proc scales with both AP and SP.
---
The coefficient is 20% of SP
---
They don't, but basically all the main hand hits land as HS (in theory, if they aren't cancelling, which they wouldn't if they have tons of rage to spare) so you are getting the HS benefit on your off hand (showing up as white damage) and even more damage from main hand which is constantly HSing.  None of this hurts your rage situation all that much (at least not like it does early on) because of other factors like # of hits gear damage crits etc keep that machine going.
---
While i'm generally in the "#NoChanges" camp, it's QOL things like this that I'm completely open to. Also, fix our fucking character stats.
---
where do i get that?
---
Lmao that’s dirty but I like your thinking.
---
It sounds like with Seeping, you have to keep them glued to you for it to take effect, not sure exactly how the proc works with the stat reduction. Twig is going to deal similar damage, with no rng effect but a lot of extra stamina.
---
I don't think crusader is worth it, maybe if you have a raid letting you go ret I would throw it on, but for dungeons it is overkill as an investment.
---
Back in actual vanilla around christmas time, my friend and I made characters named things like "Fatherwinter" and stuff, wrapped coal in wrapping paper, and COD'd it to everyone we could for 1g with a note that made it seem like it was some christmas event with a rare item. 
---
We both got our accounts suspended for 3 days :(
---
So go with details.  Unless your on a potato, use what works.
---
Confirmed back online.
---
I disagree. Logs for my last MC run showed most fights I was at 25% overheal or less. Domo was like 8% and Rag 5% with largely Chain Heal for spell usage.
---
i want classic and that's it. no bc .. no wotlk ect ect..  classic and classic only.  i want my shaman wielding a 2h. i don't want to be forced to dual wield.  wotlk killed all actually skill and turned the game into an aoe fest.  no .. i want a game that takes thought and skill.    
---
no expansions! no changes to mechanics or classes.
---
Taken directly from the fight club dps faq:
---
&gt;Be mindful of your GCDs, this is fairly important but regardless of whether you're horde or alliance you want to be (outside of execute phase) prioritising BT &gt; WW &gt; heroic strikes/hamstrings. What this means in a real life example is that if you do BT into a whirlwind, you now have 4 seconds of filler in your rotation. What you should do here is try and squeeze in as many hamstrings and heroics as you can without costing yourself even 0.5 seconds of time with BT being up after the cooldown ends.
---
I don't think it was peak, but BC was definitely an improvement upon Vanilla, anyone who doesn't see that especially now that Classic is out is simply blinded by nostalgia goggles.
---
Classic is fun, BC was just iterated to fix issues and unfinished content, nothing but an improvement.
---
It’s the only semi reliable threat meter atm.   Nearly everyone uses details.
---
The thing is you should be using slice and dice a lot as your finisher and eviscerate as a filler, so the 2% bonus ends up being much more effective than the seldom used 10% bonus.
---
Tanking is the most stressful role to play in WoW. Followed by healers then dps.
---
Most people don't want to feel stressed while playing a video game.
---
I don't think the RP is that strict but I wouldn't know either.
---
if your settings on classic there shouldnt be any grass lol
---
I play on the same server. Lagged alot, thought it was my internet. Went for a quick walk to the store, and now it seems like the only server down.
---
It's a level one character made as powerful as possible. Its still a level one though and is solo.
---
Guess who's back
---
classic experience ended with the patch that killed 2h winfury.    
---
/thread
---
Happens to alot of people, theres a moment when the payment processes you run out of time, so the game kicks you
---
Been there, done that
---
Haha these guys are jealous as fuck, lets see any of the haters try to do this..
---
Great job OP
---
Umm who the fuck said I thought that? Learn to reading comprehension. I said there weren’t this many guilds on servers consistently downing ony and doing other raids. That is 100% true because servers were nowhere near this large. So back then you didn’t have to worry about this.
---
Sorry, I was referencing Vanilla in that instance.
---
Don't feel bad about this one, that guy was being dramatic. Sure it's nice to attempt to group up for a quest mob, but the respawns aren't that bad, most people won't wait, and you didn't know it was a quest mob anyways.
---
Ah, thanks
---
WOWWWWWWWWWWWW. YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE. Ive been flying to Auberdine for the well there.ni never knew that little pond in Darnassus was a moon well.
---
For tanking did you mean 1-2 levels from the maximum?
---
Your literally saying no to all the easy fixes to what you want. 
---
If your being that picky, I’d start learning lua. 
---
-seriously, I would and even have myself because I want something I can’t get too, but damn...
---
Blizzard made their name with this gritty ui lol right. More like shitty
---
Yarp if it slows em, shapeshift breaks 'em.
---
That's s bot does stuff aitomatically. A mod wouldve had to undo what the automod bot did,  which some mod did.
---
Then why the fuck are you commenting on a guide meant to MAXIMIZE rogue dps?
---
He is obviously being sarcastic, and that is where the WOOSH comes into play
---
I’m not sure how telling you that you’re right, but that you misunderstood the core point of the post is “snitty”, but that’s fine.
---
I’d argue that more people are playing the game for nostalgia than replay value. Hence the massive drop off in players from release.
---
As a healer who pugs, I say yes.  Ten thousand times yes .
---
Yeah sure, but perhaps they could be reworked a bit to make them better for leveling rather than just completely forgotten.
---
It wasn't. Inspected and saw WW, a part of me died.
---
He can, and healers will hate him and mages and rogues and...
---
There is small sb emulator running.  Can PM me for info.
---
I'd probably be a drug addict or an alcoholic like the rest of the people in my family, I obviously have the addiction gene.
---
It's like I have this itch that needs to be scratched and escapism entertainment like video games and movies scratches that itch luckily, because there there are worse things like drugs, alcohol, junk food, and porn that I could be using to make that itch go away.
---
it was just bad luck on a patrol - if FD was working correctly, what i did would have been fine... but since it isn't, i died cos i had no other recourse
---
Nope! :) lol
---
There is small sb emulator running. Can PM me for info.
---
psh i dont think the race matters that much.  but im speaking from tbc experience though. but i havnt been like *oh if i was *insert race here* i would have won!* theres always other places to improve.
---
Get a fucking haircut, Allen. You're like 45.
---
Needed.  It makes a complete cluster fuck pug mess turn into a reliably enjoyable experience. 
---
Go prot
---
That stuff about blade flurry only matters if you’re cleaving tho
---
Yeah but they're far closer than a tauren or a gnome
---
You need to either learn to read, or learn to type.
---
It still works. For rogues, you can stealth up to the door of UBRS and /target Jed from there. If he is in your instance, you can target him no matter where he patrols.
---
In what perfect world are you making 50g an hour as a warrior?
---
I mean yeah there are righteous orb farm or dm jump runs but that require other people. 
---
In the long run it is absolutely worthwhile. 
---
Split raids having an alt etc. 
---
I really don’t think the trade off is that bad. Plus I’m alliance, open world farming is a little out of the question when it comes to consistency.
---
At work so I can't really give you a link. Just type in HealComm WoW in google and you'll find it. I don't think it's on Curse but it's out there.
---
Fury Prot it's one of the best OH's in the game I use a DB MH
---
Just checked myself this morning, thank you!
---
No joke, WoW probably actually saved me after my dad died.
---
As far as I could see back when he died my options were being suicidal or putting my energy into the game. It's helped me through the darkest time for me.
---
Red.
---
just go fury raid spec, fury talents benefits tanking more than arms and prot isn't needed pre-raid
---
Definitely more of a symptom than a cause
---
I mean sure, you have to take 1 minute in stormwind to get to the well.  But most people, if they knew, would rather stay in SW than take a port to darn and then have to make their way back.
---
It isn't that strict, most people have TRP mod which allows others with it to understand your level of commitment to RP. Lfg is still spammed with lfgs. If you party up with someone and they have TRP and their profile states they hardcore into RP. They will most likely not respond to you or accept your invite unless you roleplay it out. But most just run the game like regular servers and only go into RP heavy for special events or if someone else with them first.
---
Yeah after having stealth for so long I just couldn’t live without it on a PvP server haha
---
That's for tank.  
---
Cat only need Devilsaur set, that's ~200 gold.
---
&gt; acting like the majority of people want it is just false.
---
It's equally false to state the majority doesn't want it. Neither of you have any data supporting your opinion so stop using the word "majority". 
---
&gt;The main people who want it are people who just always want more.
---
I personally want tbc more than vanilla but I wouldn't bother playing wrath. While tbc added a couple features that I didn't care for, class optimization and improved itemization make that expansion so much better to me. There are so many dead talent trees/hybrid specs in classic and everyone's fighting over the exact same gear, it lacks the variety tbc had.
---
Yes and yes. RP is almost exclusively reserved for the /say and /yell channels.
---
I wish :( And I want to transfer my classic char to bc too
---
Okay how about this?
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
Doesn't look like it has changed much...
---
my point is.. youre not supposed to be up there.. like that place between moonbrook and auberdine or whatever with all the trolls dancing.. i dont think you can get in there... the place next to stormwind with the dude camping next to the river.. the place next to stormwind between stormwind and burning steppes where the dwarves are fighting that drake.. places you just kind of like.. cant go.. or they dont want you to go or whatever..
---
So what server are you on now?
---
I'll remember this for leveling a warrior as an alt.
---
Fishing for it is hard. Better to bring water elementals.
---
Source? 'cause afaik that's utter bs.
---
Can you share yours? I cant find it on twitch app, only the retail version :/
---
Nope, since you get fol after level 20 it's full scale all the way.
---
You can talk out of character but I imagine that making fun of others doing RP or disrupting others doing RP can get you in trouble. I've heard that on RP servers you can have your name reported and changed if it isnt RP enough.
---
Same here. I usually pop a troll potion and keep up well fed bonus but usually can do one after another. Only have to really eat if I get a bad pull and get 3 mobs on me.
---
I'm curious what the reasonable replacement would be at 42.
---
Me to! However like 5 days of that is Fishing/AH flipping
---
Woops - meant 1-2 levels ABOVE the minimum I listed :X
---
Specifically mentions scamming, 1month old Blizz post
---
Sucks too.   I’ve been learning lua just to get one of these up again.
---
You never realize how much you rely on some things.
---
I loved this! The lvl1 twink bracket is underrated, or did u just start a whole new scene??🤩 i remember in vanilla, to have a awsome bank alt was a thing, with all these impossible and cool stuff. There was a guild of bank alts on my server, and they did a 10man Gamon🤓 i also want a lvl1 twink! Which are the best classes, and what is BiS?
---
Putting Raptor weaving aside, you also have to manage your pet and listen to melee class calls on top of your personal calls.
---
I’m a material scientist (although still working on my graduates degree so I’m a scientist on paper?) so I do indeed batteries :)

Not working

Just report it
---
Fair enough
---
Uhh sure give me a sec
---
To be fair he took all of the worst talents possible.
---
haha that's a fair point. guess I forgot what thread I was on when I typed that
---
In any case tho, you cant tell someone they're playing the game incorrectly just because they use a different spec. They just aren't min/maxing is all
---
The demons show as hostile but won’t attack since they’re technically pets. Besides the bugs, the mobs that are hostile are mosty ogres of random types throughout the instance (though the same ones each time), as if they were just missed accidentally.
---
OP said race, but I think he means classification.
---
Flamewalkers and nagas are a race, but in the game they are classified as humanoids.
---
Processor is:Intel i7 6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, Motherboard is: Asus Z170 Pro Gaming, Video Card is : GTX 1070 TI, using windows 10
---
An Arms Warrior (or any 2H Warrior) using nothing but Hamstring will actually do less damage than a Ret Paladin who is auto attacking and casting Judgment. The Paladin also brings a set of blessings and can still Cleanse friendly targets while auto attacking.
---
Rivenspike is just an outright good preraid Mainhand, it's not being used for its proc.
---
The armor debuff Annihilator grants is called shatter armor and does stack with Sunder.
---
The recipe is 25g on your server???? It’s over 200 on ours! I got my recipe while tanking on my warrior,  everyone picked green and I won.
---
In one 12 hour gaming session I won:
---
Savage gladiator chain
---
True faith vestment pattern
---
Carapace
---
It’s Kyle damage bro man
---
Turn on auto self cast an remove anything to cast at yourself.
---
Armor is ugly too, even end game it looks like someone dipped each finger in a different color of paint and just flicked it at your character. This bothers me the most I would say since you can't try for a specific look which imo is huge in an rpg.
---
Here's your bis, black pants, blue top, brown gloves and two bluish swords etc, you can tell when they made this game with the way questing takes you all over the place and armor never matching, they didnt communicate with one another at all or were just lacking direction altogether in the game.
---
In case you’re not being sarcastic, I think you’re an absolute top lad for listening. Takes a whole lot of courage to own up to a mistake. Props to you my brother.
---
Honestly, I don’t RP that much myself. I only recently got into it by rolling a character on a RPPvP server. The major differences I noticed are that people are more willing to ‘give’. Buffs, chests, drops, gold, anything. Instead of “what the fuck is this shit luck”, they go by “man that’s unfortunate” and pm’s are more genuine.
---
For example, this ongoing halloween event where they’re burning the massive doll, people actually gather up and sit around to see the burning of the happening. More emotes.
---
Nothing too major.
---
I’ll have to test this tonight
---
Is this a template? Or did you copy or paste it from a different post or something? There's a post or two like this every day, virtually *identical* wording, no fresh ideas in them, all things the player base is already expecting.
---
I wonder if "of the Whale" gets sad.  It's so underappreciated compared to the other greens.
---
I agree with the statement above, to many witnesses in the molten core. Its a one way trip to the Stormwind stockades.
---
Meanwhile on retail (depending on the expansion) you crit for millions and it doesn't feel impressive because it's too big for you to appreciate.
---
Nope that's fair game m8.
---
It's cunty, but fair.
---
It's hard though. Will they go up in price? Maybe a little bit, but the reason they're so cheap on some servers is due to some servers just being more casual than others. Most hardcore guilds rolled on the bug pop servers so there just isn't really any demand for lotuses on some servers because no one is popping flasks atm. The only people buying them are people who think they'll go up, but that might not be until BWL or AQ and if the handful of guilds running those raids already have lotuses stockpiled, there still won't be many people actually buying them on the AH.
---
This is 100% incomplete for Grobbulus. All horde guilds home is EPL - Lights Hope Chapel and Blackrock Mountain. Just ask any Ally player on Grobbulus they will confirm.  
---
\- Source : Ally player of Grobb
---
&gt; One example and it's "rampant".
---
Apparently you either need to eat, breathe, and sleep in WoW so much that you know who this particular character is, or waste time googling around trying to find context from his singular example in order to see how rampant this actually is.
---
I’m only 42 on my mage but I crit up to 600 on frostbolt, makes me feel good lol
---
That is not how I saw it.. I dunno
---
If you're almost only going to be tanking, I would probably go holy until consecration like you said, then go prot to get improved righteousness for extra threat gen. After that I'm sure you can go a few ways, either keep going down prot for blessing of sanctuary or you can go 5 points in ret for reduced mana cost on seals to help keep you going longer.
---
“You heard the most prevalent opinion here first!”
---
That is literally what I expected.. because I just made a rogue for the first time ever a couple days ago.. Ive never played any kind of classes except for healers my entire WoW career.. and I was like, "Really? I can do that with a rogue?"
---
yes i do. i will have to look into that later when i'm home, thanks for the info!
---
This exact post only a couple hours ago.  Cool.
---
Ohyeah, because healers getting floating combat text truly was the real death of WoW. 
---
What a fucking baboon you are.
---
Would also be cool to duel other twinks, since there are no bgs. Summon them to IF and challenge to a tournament., summon to Ewelyn starting zone and gank all the start ups🥳 This was so cool, my mind started racing. More lvl1 twink content wanted!
---
I swear if Diablo 4 doesn't have an Auction House on release I've lost all hope
---
I didn't even do DM yet, it doesn't have any of the pure tanking gear you need as prot
---
There are varied opinions on this that’s for sure. 
---
Personally if they ever add xrealm or Dungeon Finder I’m out.
---
Nice!! I’m working on this type of playstyle. What spec are you running? I’m moonglow/ht cause I still heal often.
---
Assuming that the difference between a warrior and a mage is only a 15g/hr increase over the warrior.  
---
Mages are completely self sufficient, it's totally worth making one for gold farming.
---
But again:
---
75% of damage from white attacks, SS, garrote X 2% buff = 1.5% damage increase
---
15% damage coming from eviscerate X 10% buff = 1.5% damage increase
---
Is my math correct here.  I need to do more than 15% of my damage from eviscerate to make it worth getting the 10% talent?
---
I pug, when’s the last time you had a warrior go “What’s tanking?” or “what’s aggro?”, because in vanilla that was a common occurrence
---
I have a buddy Fury Prot that I've tried doing 2man jumps with but we don't have the damage or the mana pool. Have had to settle for 3man which really cuts the gold income.
---
RP is secondary to us from a mechanical perspective; we're still semi-HC and one of the foremost raiding guilds on the Horde side. Most RP-heavy guilds on Grobb are indeed very casual with the 60s typically pugging MC for gear. Then there are others on this (non-exhaustive, mind you) map like Kindred, MERCENARY, Blood Legacy, or The Shattered Company—and obviously ourselves down in that corner—that are 10/10 with defined core raids.
---
I can't speak for Alliance guild progression because they're all lowly reprobates and usurpers anyway. I suspect a few of them at least know the sharp end of a sword when it skewers them.
---
Sounds like excuses instead of heal logs.
---
That's the most classic wow shit I've ever seen
---
Do you guys not have PCs?
---
Down the line, I’m sure they'll add expansion servers. I think they'd be foolish to just update the game as a whole, given that people were playing on private servers the moment BC launched, pretty much, but a lot of people will like the option to progress. But they'll likely leave Classic classic.
---
It would be really cool if they finished the overall view they had for classic originally, back in the day.
---
This video explains some and how they ended up cutting their vision for classic short when expansions came out 
---
https://youtu.be/tRVtSpLPPBw
---
It doesn't scale. It would be interesting if it did because then druids would want to have a +damage offset to swap on before boss fights to buff the tank with thorns.
---
Actually I'm Moonkin pve spec here but I usually roll this one  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tsxhMtsZZVtfoco](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tsxhMtsZZVtfoco)  or   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhzLZxG0oZVEboMo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhzLZxG0oZVEboMo) . Moonglow is totally fine for pvp in my opinion, maybe change some talents to fit pvp playstyle
---
Did you update your addon? I think the drop rate was added in one of the recent updates for AtlasLoot
---
310 for corehounds. You can get 305 with the skinning enchant for gloves.
---
Clickbaited hard wp
---
 don't hate the player
---
diablo 4 looks like a diablo 3 new patch.  who the actual fuck cares LOL
---
.....No.. I never thought of trying to kill Hogger by myself at the lowest level possible... unfathomable..
---
the lifesteal scales 100% with spellpower. The fire damage does not. It's still stupidly efficient. Cheaper with also quite a lot of sustain is Uthers Strength trinket. Usually goes for 20g instead of the 300g for a skullflame but has a fairly noticable effect on leveling.
---
If your that into grinding it out, go focus on grinding some mobs that drop Runecloth and at least try for exalted before you buy it.
---
I knew about the class color nameplates in chat, but how did you get the level next to the name? That’s so nice
---
So basically retail then?
---
Dope. Like,  so dope. If I didn't play two accounts and they're both decent geared (pre raid bis looooooooooooooooooooooooooow pop server),  I'd reroll now. Great ad.
---
Is totem twisting in 5 man's even worth it unless you have a full melee group?
---
More people want wrath than they did vanilla. Change my mind.
---
The way to beat hunters is HoF and a swiftness potion, no joke I keep them solely to beat hunters and escape ganks.
---
Someone posted a video farming lotus on one layer, with a one hour respawn. Which is EXACTLY what I said. So you disproved yourself.
---
There is a ton of problems with classic that they could fix that wouldn't ruin the game, this is why i've been against the "nO cHanGes" people since the beginning. If they didn't make retail so bad I would probably just stick with that.
---
As far as I know, this does not reset threat.  It forces mobs to stop attacking you for the duration of the potion (6 seconds), but if you're still highest on threat when it ends, you will get aggro again.
---
Same. Picked my life backup, feel like I could've been further ahead than i am now though.
---
I thought he tinted that himself to show the dragon lol
---
Is that with also selling runs or just purely from the silver and loot you sell afterwards? How geared do you need to be as a warrior to make this viable as well. Genuinely curious because I have a buddy with a 60 Warrior and he struggles to find something half way decent to farm that isn't profession driven.
---
Ty in advance.
---
Ah gotchya. Thanks that's a perfect guide for me to follow as I do these dungeons. At level 42 as a druid, SM cath is the lowest dungeon and only SM I would want to do if I am focusing on xp mainly and gear?
---
Found the lotus farmer.
---
Original. Hence the wording "As controversial as this may be and as **frequently** that it is talked about"...
---
 It may be an echo of many similar postings because I believe the community as whole feels feels the same way. Case in point, if the progression stops, so does the player base. It boils down to risk assessment by Blizzard. Do they either risk the game becoming stale and losing their subscribers, or do they add content and risk losing the players who want to stay 60 forever (who will inevitably get bored and unsub anyway). The choice is pretty clear to me.
---
Ah sorry, wrong red shirt guy. I was talking about the guy from last year that asked after they announced the silly mobile game if the announcement was an "out of season April fools joke" and the dude on stage was lost for words and began to stutter a bit because he didn't know what to say lol
---
The amount of images who think frostbolt spam will save them in wpvp from a dedicated rogue is amazing
---
If expansions come out flying mounts will as the zones were designed with flying in mind.  Some content would literally be inaccessible. If they put out non vanilla content it will most likely be bc and wotlk.
---
I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet but if you were in a party and the party leader was part of an MC ID that killed bosses then you got locked to his. ;)
---
Yep, seeing as there was only 1 other paladin, prot specced like me then yeah I was. I came for the head and to roll on the bag and I will be next time and next time and more and more till I have that stupid helm. Any other stuff and even if was allowed I'd not roll on it because I'm a meme spec
---
Yes,  but they seem more focused on the higher pop, “streamer” type realms...go figure.
---
You can't compare Tank viaility with Dps viability (I'd argue there is no such thing as a dps spec being not viable). 
---
In terms of tank viability, yes there are degrees/levels of it. 
---
Before spending hours on chatting. Do you think paladin can tank raids relatively easily?
---
Ofc
---
Oh actually it doesnt. I played like twenty lvls thinking it does. I just tested by taming a new pet.
---
Would work great. Mage can give you water, you can heal, you can both do damage.
---
So you photoshopped a "leak"?
---
OK.
---
If you're efficient you're wasting less time.
---
Lets not.
---
agreed
---
Loved the editing!
---
What is the reasoning behind having Boomkin but not using it when you have a free opener?
---
I'm sure the dudes that were laughed at for resisting 'harmless' changes back in the day don't seem like baboons to your dumbass in hindsight right? :D
---
All good, see you in 6 years when you're on reddit signing petitions for "Classic Classic WoW"
---
I see other people with him in the video... its not solo.. Do you not see the pane of buffs across the screen on top? I dont have that many buffs even in a 5 man instance..
---
That sucks it should be skill rewarded rather than time rewarded
---
Could have been, but in my case it hasn’t. I quit WoW. Now I’m a medical student. No vices in sight.
---
I've played since late 2004/early 2005 and b4 classic had onlyh ever had one BOE drop in my "presence" I was running UBERS back around patch 1.10 and the Alcor Sunrazor dropped and outta 10 peeps I won the roll. Sold it for 550 gold
---
Now in classic I've seen a multitude of BOE's drop. Saw two pairs of Boots of Avoidance, one of which I won as a Warrior, seen a Skullflame shield drop and while solo'ing the quest chain "In Dreams" I got a pair of Stockade Pauldrons to drop. Other than that I ain't seen very many Professor plums, blues, I mostly always find greens.
---
I did MC healing for about a week before I started leveling a warrior. Those 5 minute buffs drove me mad.
---
It was literally all over the woweconomy sub when classic dropped, I think TSM is completely fine. Sniper just wasn’t being read as an add on and was getting people banned. I was just giving a warning in case a ban happened he could try to appeal.
---
But pallys get to do 100% of their single target on top of the cons. On AoE pulls a ret can pull close to equal or ahead of warrs, rogues, hunters, etc. Depending on the number of adds.
---
I'm not about to do the math, but I'm pretty sure with average drop rates, you'd need to do 12 UBRS runs, 7 jump runs, 12 DM tributes and 2 full LBRS runs in one day. And that's assuming you're the only one in each group rolling on those items. That's for 6-7% hit and you'd be taking Voones Vice Grips and passing up a reward that's potentially better later on for fury DPS.
---
You could also spend 1200g and buy lionheart helm and 2 tribute rings, but that's generally not possible for fresh 60s. 
---
Either way, that's kinda beside the point because even a deep prot warrior will also be going for that gear. But deep prot can generate much more threat while working towards it than a fury prot can without it.
---
Pairs well, you have heals and totem buffs which are good for mage, and you both do ranged dps which is nice, or you can tank for the mage a bit which is always helpful
---
I guess if one day a gigantic dragon cleaves the park right into the ocean and no one will bothered.
---
&gt; 2 questions, what's your spec and what gear are you using. I'm a rogue and this sounds like a blast
---
This should answer all possible [questions you could have](https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin).
---
In the interface settings you can change that so Spy only alerts you if the enemy is on your KoS list
---
You know you don't need to explain it to me right? I understand the distinction. I'm merely stating what "solo" implies to some people.
---
Feel free to argue the definition more if you want but..... that's besides the point. 
---
If one person explains a reaction that OTHER people have, it doesn't mean that that one person shares their view, just that they understand the others.
---
Thanks
---
Swing and a miss
---
having the same issue after buying eye of shadow and hide of heart. I dissed alchemy and went for mining/herbing since a lot of similar zones. Made me 100G in a day
---
maybe they should make full cgi movies instead of games.  d3 was a joke then they tried to make some mobile garbage and had to scrap it now they're pushing some trash 5 years too early that looks like the same trash they already have.
---
Cool so looks like I'm not making it to 60 haha
---
So layering is finished then, finally.

---
Shit. Bad time for me as Im going to New Zealand for Exilecon for 2 weeks on the 11th LOL
---
Nice. The content was slow. Really hyped for phase 3.
---
Really hoped for an early battleground announcement! Phase 2 in 1 1/2 weeks is really great though!
---
I would love something like this.
---
 Is there any raiding guilds that are actively recruiting?
---
 All my friends quit playing and I'm basically alone on my server. I will 100% reroll any faction.
---
 ^Someone pm me please.
---
&gt;200 gold per hour
---
(X) Doubt
---
You can skin just about everything in Desolace, and also a ton of skinnable mobs in arathi. Definitely worth checking out
---
Perception is very strong, and borderline OP in arenas if BC is released.
---
Seriously, every alliance arena team benefits hugely from having at least one human.
---
Then it isn't laziness. It's stubbornness.
---
This would be awesome, but from Blizz's viewpoint - 1) Develop new content 2) Reuse old content (BC). Hmmmm, :(
---
&gt;I can't speak for Alliance guild progression because they're all lowly reprobates and usurpers anyway. I suspect a few of them at least know the sharp end of a sword when it skewers them, but I don't assume competence beyond that point.
---
This is possibly the best insult i have ever heard.
---
Good luck farming or leveling or doing literally anything except wpvp in a week and a half
---
"You're only going to make 45 gold and hour because of the instance reset. But you could make 200 gold an hour if there wasn't a reset cap"
---
In other words. Hey look another video about the same rogue pick pocket route that's already plastered all over the internet.
---
FUCK IM STILL LVL 52
---
Yeah give yourself some fast walking boots, solid weapon with enchant, elixirs, potions, and bandages. Only fun way to level a warrior lol
---
Logically I know the chicken isn't worth it but every time I see a moonkin out in the wild it makes me so happy and does make me a *tiiiiiiny* bit jealous. I actually got jumped by a Moonkin horde the other day and I couldn't even fight back because I was just in awe of the chicken.
---
My investment in caster dps is because I really do enjoy the caster dps. I was Heart of the Wild/NS for a while until I met a few other balance/resto druids in my guild and after talking with them for a while I made the decision to switch. My goal endgame is to primarily heal (if I can get into raids with my guild). I kept 5 points in Furor because I do tend to hop into kitty form or bear form mid fight if needed, and the extra rage/energy has been nice, but I'm not sure if that's going to hurt me when I start end game content.
---
Guess I will never step foot into LBRS/UBRS
---
Thank you sir !
---
I am boomkin because of PVE , didnt want to respec . Mainly mana
---
BRD
---
I’m running basically same as first one but with 5 points in starfire.  I feel like the 11 in feral are good but sometimes I feel the charge is overated and can be worked around. And points are better else where. The starfires w the crit modifier are just sick tho. The trick is making the space to get them off it seems. I have fun experimenting w things. Thanks for posting! I’ll watch ur vid again lots of good stuff.
---
🙄I’m not even 60 yet
---
This nerd heard about the thing you can do with sappers and was tunnel visioned on that. What you said, which is obviously correct, doesn't involve getting to sapper bomb people.
---
Point is that enjoyment is either a superficial metric or just attributed superficially, and again, not everything is "up to you"/"the same"/relative. 
---
Especially where you then have things like guild drama and long passionate discussions about why this or that in the game is unfair, it becomes obvious that people start using it for something else than enjoyment, which is a problem because it shows that  game, whose purpose is exactly that, now usurps other "roles".
---
Black lotus
---
Thanks for info m8
---
This is way too soon. I haven't had a chance to reach level 10 yet and I know a lot of casuals like myself with busy lives are in the same boat.
---
We needs to start a petition immediately for Blizzard to slow down the phase releases!
---
Thanks man!! Does this work for you 100%? As it seems like not an official port.
---
This is stupid. Majority of players arent even 60 and its going to become impossible to level
---
Another game, probably
---
Moonkin is for PVE raiding only. If you want to PvP at all, you want to go NS in some form.
---
Moonglow is very strong for solo PVE as well as PvP.
---
As for your build I am questioning Furor, which is wasted points without feral charge or something of the like.
---
-5 Furor +5 Tranquil spirit for sure.
---
I’m never riding the boat to dustwallow marsh ever again
---
The majority dont want it. Theres just a lot of I want more people out there nowadays. Like you said you want xxx. The majority just want the core of the game back. The vocal few just want more.
---
Are warriors and paladins really that slow to level, with 1.12 gameplay mechanics? (Wasn’t it super slow in vanilla before this patch?)
---
I know it’s way slower than BfA, and it’s way slower than leveling a hunter in Classic.
---
The perfect level for us to farm honor of you!  Grats. You are now essentially a roaming boar NPC.
---
the only off hand available is from timbermaw rep
---
A guild mate who is there says patch with world bosses and honor Nov 12
---
This is the way I do it, but I also use a g13 plus razor naga combo, ymmv.
---
1.  Remind a couple easy to hit keys to alt,CTRL,shift, whatever -pick 2 or however many.
---
2. Then make mouse over macros for each spell your using - I find two ranks is fine but you can do 3 for overkill.
---
3 . macro that shit:
---
[@mouseover,nodead,help,nomod] [@player,nomod] rank of spell you normally spam to top off;
---
[@mouseover,nodead,help,mod:alt] [@player,mod:alt] emergency o shit inc rank;
---
Repeat with other mod keys for whatever ranks you want
---
4. Use bartender/Elvui/whatever and bind the keys.
---
Looks like I have a week to finish leveling before I get farmed to oblivion.
---
They're moving too fast tbh. Meh.
---
Yep, if you're looking purely for XP, Cath is what you'll want to run.  Bit longer of a dungeon than the other wings too, so the XP/run is better.
---
These are great for low levels and dirt cheap on my server.
---
I literally don't know what you're doing wrong.  I'm not even trying to farm gold and I've got 400 of it, having spent at least 600 more since getting to level 60.
---
Questions:
---
* What are you spending money on?
---
* Are you using an auction addon?
---
* Are you using a bank alt?
---
* Why are you running princess as a priest instead of just end game dungeon grinding?
---
* Have you tried going for rare enchanting formulas?
---
only scrubs not made it to 60
---
Phase 2 coming next week. lmao
---
I asked this question a couple weeks ago.  The universal response is that Tribal is the best both from money-making and for Devilsaur BiS set.  Dragonscale is 2nd best b/c black dragon set has good resistances on it, but if you're Alliance you don't have as much of a market for it b/c no shamans.  Elemental clearly the weakest of the 3
---
For those of us that can afford to own a home here, it’s about as nice as it gets. The weather is unbeatable, I can mtb/surf/ski in a single day if I want, better looking people...
---
I certainly wouldn’t live here if I had a wife and kids and we were crammed into a little Cracker Jack apt
---
Thank you! I had a feeling that I'd have to swap out Furor for something - my points in Furor I justified by thinking "well I tend to switch into cat or bear form mid fight if I'm running low on mana, so it's nice to have the extra rage/energy," but looking back I think I just made the decision impulsively when I first respecced.
---
I think I'll end up having to respec for that for sure.
---
finish your hillsbrad quests boyz
---
Open a ticket and a GM will clear it. Happened to me as well
---
That's amazing, so many guild headquarters... Rp pvp really is the shit
---
Here we go fellas
---
If you have some money I think engineering is crucial for leveling an alt, especially warrior. I have my warrior with the highest level dynamite he can have, and I can take on 3 mobs every time dynamite is off CD. It's amazing. +150 dmg aoe at level 10 is BROKEN
---
I still haven't left the starting zone yet, too soon! I just want to enjoy the game, blizz
---
ye i already got 30 days played at 60
---
168 and 208
---
Paladins are fine if you go ret. after about level 30 you can pull atleast 2 at a time.
---
Warriors - slow as fuck
---
Worked last night.
---
Thanks for letting me know! Good job on the achievement. Lots of people hating on you but I thought it was a fun experiment.
---
Man, if they’re this set on speeding up the schedule I really hope they already have the future after full vanilla planned out and are just not telling us.
---
Ditto. I would have just been playing a different game or doing something else entertaining but unproductive during the height of my playtime. Real life hit me at one point and I stopped playing the game as constantly and got my shit in order, but I'm not about to blame the game for my bahavior. It just did the best job of capturing the attention I was willing to devote to escape.
---
Does Ion look like he's been crying all morning or is it just me?
---
Ahh thats cool, i like those little differences
---
Yes. Playing completely solo can be and is a fun experience.
---
Actually he did. So get fucked? Thanks
---
I kind of want to roll an alt on a PVP server just for the absolute shitfest but mankrik is comfy
---
How well does a '90 bronco hold up?
---
I believe the experimenting is most important since you find what really suits for you. Before, I really couldn't play without feral charge because feeling to interrupt warlocks sometimes really seems necessary but lately I learnt to play without it. Even playing without NS is interesting aswell.. I really appreciate it man, feel free to hit me up anyime ! :)
---
 If you lose the ability to cast more than 2 ranks if it’s important to him
---
Need to get my mining up before the 12th. I'm never gonna see a vein in the wild again.
---
Time to hoard essences of water/air/fire/earth? Open world farming is going to be next to impossible for a while.
---
It's not hard to get gold as any class on any server. 
---
You're an alch.  Either go farm herbs (dreamfoil, plaguebloom, icecap, silversage, gromsblood), or farm dungeons with herbs in them.
---
On your princess runs are you picking all the ghost mushrooms on the way?
---
Otherwise just get a good static together and run dungeons efficiently.  You can easily make 50g per hour off of dungeon silver drops + grey drops + bop's.  Get you UD strath's down below 30 mins and people will want to run that shit.
---
Alternatively, get 2 other people and do imperfect tribute runs and sell the chest if no one needs and something good drops.
---
Real life is a shit tier game. Everything is stupidly time gated, progress is insanely slow, the tutorial takes forever and the there's barely any end game. Oh, it's also pay to win as fuck.
---
With a hunter it can be. You get a pet. You can always find a guild and play with them. Maybe even make some wow buddies.
---
Lasher farming in DME as a holy priest is a pretty good farm. For me it has been over 40g an hour, not including the random blues/purple and 16 slot backpacks I've found. My only char is a holy priest and I have epic mount, truefaith, hide of the wild, helped my wife with her epic, etc. Dinged 60 on Oct 14.
---
He probably spent all his time leveling with AoE farming and forgot the rest of us actually have to do quests and kill "their" mobs from time to time.
---
I'm 56!  Time for us to get our asses moving!
---
Any news on if paid transfers are arriving?
---
I'm A disc priset and I solo lashers for gold in DM east. Having herbalism makes it pretty decent gold/hour.
---
You do need 6k + mana for this cause else you won't have enough mana for the final holy novas and you will die or have to use pots which sets you back.
---
I bought some cheap intellect pieces on ah for the pieces that basicly only had healing power.
---
I rotate between using inner focus on one pull then power infusion on the next one.
---
both.
---
sometimes they just do a normal runt og et some gear, like UBRS or Molten Core.  
---
But other times they play 'In Character'  Basically you act out a 'play' together with other players.  Often there is a script, a story with some main plots.  Like one guild has stolen something from another guild, they quarrel, others get involved, meanwhile the Horde / Alliance is a threat, dwarves want X, Elves want Y,   Everybody is pissed at the undead, or the Defias Brotherhood, or whatever.  It can be quite chaotic, but the idea is that somewhere OOC (out of character) somebody keeps track, most likely they have a discord for this.   you don't have to follow the script obviously a lot is improvisation.  But it's nice to have some backbone to fall  back on.    And not everybody has to be the hero, you can also roleplay being the barmaid.  But then you hear some posh elven lords discuss their battleplan... so maybe you sell this information to their enemies, the rival dwarven clan...  the possibilities are only limited by your imagination.   the game world just provides the background to the stories the players make themselves.
---
Welcome to classic.
---
Let us hear your economic analysis so that you may educate us.
---
Sure. Hunter is one of the best classes to play solo, as you can even solo same level elites in most cases. Don't be afraid to socialize with people in the game for dungeons and group quests, though!
---
Any source? Any info? This is a bad photoshop for karma. Get this shit the fuck out of here
---
I was told all the retail players would fuck off back to BFA by now damn. This sub was never good, but I didn't think it could get worse...
---
Which is why I disable tracking HoTs in raid frames.
---
Everyone has there favorite version of the game. It really doesn't matter what anyone wants. People want there own favorite expansions. That doesn't mean people should push for it to come out. It just splits the community more.
---
Seriously...was driving me nuts.. ended up downloading an addon for it.

Because retail has been in a slow dive since wrath hit and it’s a complete fine mess no one wants. 
---
Add to that, the fact that some of us are 15yr invested in the game, and we’d rather have a reboot done right than see wow go under. 
---
And nostalgia
---
So you would take away 10% damage, for 10% healing which would give you more flexibility in being able to heal/dps depending on the encounter, or dungeon etc.
---
I have ran moonglow for many months on private servers into now for my guild early raiding. (Now I have since gone feral full time as we have 2 other druids who are resto full time)
---
Moonglow you are able to farm really easily, and able to swap to more +healing gear and be able to heal in raids and dungeons quite easy.
---
If you're low on mana, you usually have potions, demonic runestones, or mana potions. If you shift into bear/cat when low on mana, the extra energy/rage wouldn't do much. Most likely leverage bearform more, as you won't have a ton of attack power stats, and shifting to bear gives you much more survival. (As well as maul is harder hitting)
---
Have you tried getting a job?
---
Can’t a normie brag about his crits without being called a ding-@-ling
---
All FAP mats was bought out within 2 mins of announcement. GG
---
Mice
---
Still shows a big annoying message in your chat log
---
But didn’t, and the mods are responsible for creating and using the bots, so my stance is correct.
---
Majority isnt even lvl 60, so he isnt wrong. I am okay with it, but I think it would be smarter to introduce phase 2 early december.
---
Did he stutter?!? *Better get to 60 boys*
---
Shadowlands... no new class, no new race, 4 new zones and that is it? It could have just been a bigger patch lol
---
I jumped into the game with a guild, but not many friends in it already. My first week I was randomly invited into my healer's discord as we kept running the same instance over and over and made some great new friends! I talked to them more than my own guild for the first few weeks!
---
Wow classic is the first wow game I’ve ever played. 
---
Since blizzard just announced the shadowlands expansion, would this mean that many players would switch from classic to the new expansion? 
---
If so, would players from bfa retain their gold and gears, which would mean that if ai switch to the new expansion, I’d we well behind? 
---
I really enjoy playing wow so if anyone can give me advice what I should do to prepare, please let me know. Psa, I would prefer playing as mage in the alliance side
---
Which class?
---
Honestly if you aren't 60 at this point.. or even 50 at this point what is going on? The game is 2 months old. It takes 6 to 7 days in game to hit 60. It's really not that hard
---
Let me be clear, I'm 60 and have been waiting for Honor.  This is exciting AF and I cant wait to start ranking.
---
Now for my concern -  2 months after release we get phase 2?  Is this pace going to continue? If so, this game is going to be out of content in less than a year, granted most guilds will still be farming BWL+ for items.  I'm growing more and more concerned that the phases will be rushed out so they can make money on releasing an xpac.
---
How many groups are actually min maxing debuff slots though lol. That being said if you are hitting the cap which most groups don't then yes you shouldn't rupture or it might get knocked off. Evis is the smarter option.
---
Dude i remembering leveling my warrior solo trying to do the quests in the silithid cave and i would just have to wait 30 or die. Was a nightmare.
---
when i saw the buffs I instantly thought about how many people will rant about it .. not realizing how much effort it needs to do something like this .. unique new and entertaining keep it up!
---
You clearly didn't watch the cinematic she set him "free" of the Helm of Domination
---
Daggers are  BiS for tanks.
---
Swords are BiS for rogues.
---
Its that simple.
---
So for people playing WoW for the first time what does this mean? I’m not in a PvP server so this means nothing, right?
---
I really wish blizzard announced how fast this would go before release. I didn't want to deal with queues so I waited a month to get Classic. I didn't realize that would put me so far behind. I'm not 60 yet and I'm not looking forward to being ganked endlessly.
---
Yeah, it's definitely not 100% true, but it's often assumed and more common than not. To the point that quite often whoever is party leader will auto-pass to the tank, which I've never understood as it's not like I need to be the party leader for anything in dungeons. If you don't want to / can't lead through the dungeon, you have to basically state that when joining the group if it's a PUG.
---
However, you can just put up a map and a dungeon guide on you other monitor and be good to go. Generally there's not much in the way of mechanics to most dungeons outside of specific bosses, and the guide will give you the two second summary.
---
Coming way too soon, seriously
---
You have plenty of time, Im lvl 32 and Im only moderately worried
---
Thank you all, I’ve done everything mentioned except upgrade ram and I’ve seen some noticeable improvements. I currently have 8gb of ddr4. This is a link to what is currently in my pc. 
---

---
Do I buy another 8 or get 1 16? I have one slot free on my pc for ram. Does brand or anything like that matter or I’m good as long as it’s ddr4?
---
Rupture is not useful in classic raids due to the debuff slot it takes up.
---
I mean, I pugged it half a dozen times between 54 and 56 and never had a wipe, complaint or a healer going oom. I'm prot and had 2%hit and +5 weapon skill, so that probably helped with threat.  The geared dps had enough sense to wait a few seconds before going ham.
---
Honestly the triple firelords before MC by far hit harder than anything else in that place.
---
The rogue quest for the thistle tea recipe.... I looted the chest before pickpocketing the patroller. So i had the zanzil crap on me that made be be able to be seen even while stealthed. I was a fresh 20 so the pickpocket mob was orange to me and 3 shotted me when i fought him.
---
Ended up having to fly to SW get some venom sacks and make some anti-venom just to finish the quest...
---
this is where you are wrong. Most people are 60 already.
---
Exactly. Why role PVP server if you can't handle a more aggressive play style?
---
There was a shocking amount of "check out my UI" posts which literally just had ElvUI. One addon.
---
What does phase 2 have anything to do with you running blackrock spire?
---
Thanks. That makes sense. Hope you don't mind me bothering you, would this respec be better suited then?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/51005030025013--505103105015](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/51005030025013--505103105015)  I took the points off from Moonfury and put them into Gift of Nature instead.
---
Only if crit capped otherwise you will use don julios or bronze dragonflight over accuria.
---
Lol of course they are. Blizzard was dead wrong about Classic, and they definitely don't want to continue to be proven wrong. They're incredibly arrogant.
---
That strategy is less effective when there's two prices involved though.
---
I mean...no sane alchemist is buying crystal at 45g if the market for arcanite bars is 35g.  And the blacksmiths aren't raising their valuation of the arcanite bars just because the miners want to up the price.
---
Anyway, good luck with the union...
---
MS / Execute should pad out your single target dps nicely. Execute is a lie since you quite often overkill by a lot, but the purpose of the charts is to flex, not reflect actual player utility, so...
---
Same but I'm 43 lmao
---
Yes but puts a much bigger strain on the healer and dps if shit hits the fan.
---
Nice! Good plans for sure. As long as you're hit capped and have decent crit, furyprot is fun for sure.
---
Lol!
---
200+ is an absurd amount of time. Should take no more than 7 days or 150 hours.
---
I have used AtlasLoot for a good while now, never seen the drop rate on the tooltip, so didn't even know that was a thing.  
---
Then a few days ago I also downloaded [AtlasLootClassic](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25185-AtlasLootClassic.html), and THEN I got the drop rate in the tooltip.
---
Go resto
---
I like this comment a lot
---
So basically you don't want to put in the time or the effort but you want the game to wait on you? lol
---
Wait your arcanite bars are only 35g? Where are you? Can I come?
---
Ty! Ye propably bettee!
---
Haven't even finished downloading, waaay too soon!
---
Pretty good if you're using it to help your buddy evade the police in a car chase.
---
i still haven't installed my client yet, way too soon!
---
PvP before christmas is a massive mistake
---
You’ve obviously never leveled an enhance shaman
---
I don't know if "stack lots of buffs" is exactly an original strategy.
---
RIP level 48s
---
Icyveins is not a streamer, it's a website.
---
Swords are better vs lower health enemies and high mobility fights. Daggers are better in long fights and single target fights.
---
The sword spec talent, in all honesty, doesn't make a huge difference either way. It's, maybe, like 3 or 4 dps per minute, and that's being generous. But please do run the numbers, lemme know, it'd be interesting to see.
---
Good place to camp level 50s for easy honor.
---
I think the only range gauging you can do is based off spells
---
Well, look at this way.
---
The “decent” players bsck then focused on one character and got really good at it for years.
---
Classic hits 15yrs later and more than a few are maining new classes to get a fresh look at the game, and that means learning from scratch.
---
Give it a year and they’ll be back to being “decent” again.
---
They had better have a HUGE panel planned to get into some details because that reveal was really, REALLY thin.
---
agreed, im not sure why they did it this early and i really hope they explain why at some point. maybe it really does make sense, but i dont see how right now.
---
Rice
---
The why role PVP server if you aren't capable of handling what the server gives you? Roll PVE, it's much easier for a casual gameplay.
---
presumably hes gonna get camped on his way in
---
Enh shaman is tough on rag due to the fact that his targeted knockback ability only hits players with mana. You basically need to try and find a place (range 12?) that is away from both other melee and the tanks. The enhance shaman in our guild puts on healing gear and totems twists for melee since its pretty difficult to position correctly, and any mistakes cause major issues for other melee. I'm not saying you need to go resto just advising what our shaman does.
---
"World PvP" will get worse.
---
Speeding up what schedule? They never gave us a schedule for them to speed up.
---
He doesn't sell runs, just purely vendors the items and gathers the silver. He said making heavy silken bandages with the cloth is a good way to make more from the silk too.
---
I don't know how geared you have to be, but I know my buddy is in pretty good gear. He also specifically crafted a dungeon set that has lifesteal so that he can do it more easily, but he's been doing this since he dinged 60, his runs have just gotten more efficient with gear.
---
people are treating phases like expansion packs that make previous phases somehow irrelevant. Its pretty amusing
---
Mageweave is the next step, then Heavy, then runecloth, then heavy runecloth. Some of the recipes are in weird places so make sure to google the location, first aid is a must as a war
---
Fair, lol.
---
Still love how i'm getting stealth downvoted and nobody is debating the actual math, though.
---
Ok what about a dungeon then, or 10man UBRS.  Eviscerate or rupture?
---
HOW DARE THEY IMPLEMENT PVP REWARDS ON A PVP SERVER!!! OUTRAGE, GET YOUR PITCHFORKS!
---
I agree with this, I feel like they are pushing this out way too fast.
---
I guess you're just the most skilled warrior here.
---
BRM is a common pvp hotspot
---
In the long run indeed, which my post stated after 300h of farming it will be worth it.
---
Dm east is above that, boosting in SM is baseline 60g/h + vendor drops, probably depending on server.
---
T5...
---
I feel like if you're going all the way to moonfury you should take Moonkin form.
---
You're already sacrificing so much healing... 
---
I personally think that the moonglow healing spec is very cool, and makes druids really pretty efficient healers, particularly with high crit.
---
Not everyone has the same amount of time to play.
---
Maybe take that as a sign that you should do something else in your life then. It's not really a problem that your bored with a game there plenty of other ways to spend your time while you wait for the next phases.
---
It happens. Wiping is very common in strat undead as you can pull mobs easily by accident due to many mechanics of the dungeon(fears, bug crates and eye of naxxramas for example) or just due to how close they’re all packed together. Some times you just have bad nights and the more you mess up just increases your chances to mess up again(like running back after a wile and pulling or a pat res pawning after time). These things just come with running that hellhole of a dungeon but will be decreases with experience with it.
---
Fully geared 60's camping flight points, hot spots, etc. to gank the more casual leveling players doesn't promote a very fun atmosphere. I have been looking forward to the honour system, and I love PvP, but it's just too soon too be a fun state for the majority for another month or so.
---
ITT: people displeased that blizzard isn’t going at *precisely* the speed they want and calling it “early” as if we knew what the dates originally were going to be
---
Late December was like okay, that’s pretty quick.
---
November 12th?! This is crazy soon, at this rate we will have nax by summertime.
---
It’s more fun with friends but it could be fun solo, make some leveling buddies and ur set
---
How many times are you going to post this?
---
Having a full time job, wife, and kid keeps me from overdoing wow. I want to play more, but I literally can’t. It’s nice and sucks at the same time
---
I literally hit 52 last night. RIP
---
better*
---
Honor system is coming November 12th.
---
They pick towns as their ‘home’ and defend.
---
Are you mentally handicapped? Using a modern monitor or addons etc. doesn't disqualify you from being against official changes to the game.
---
That's the same as: "You say didn't like the new 2018 Ghost Busters remake, so you aren't allowed to buy the 1984 version on Blu-ray and are only allowed to watch it on VHS"
---
In moments like those it’s worth taking a step back and remembering it’s just a game, and then you can appreciate the hilarity of other players getting angry and personal regarding some pixels. 
---
I appreciate that’s easier said than done if you suffer from any form of social anxiety, but in any case taking a break wasn’t a bad idea. I’m sure your own performance in future runs will be a lot smoother, everyone at some point (including those who were raging the loudest at you) have had a bad experience at some point where they immeasurably fucked up, so don’t take it to heart.
---
A study of my uncle says it's a recipe for alcoholism and depression
---
They better not kill off all the cool heroes from WC3 or make them evil for no reason.
---
True comparison numbers come from actual player caught online not character level data, plenty of people already have and alt or 2 already.
---
D/l and run the Census plus mod yourself to get true spread of the levels of your server vs the number of player/individuals on.
---
Ahhh shit, I'm questing in Tanaris, RIP me.
---
Meh. Maybe when Phase 2 hits and Anathema is actually useful
---
depends how much you play. I suggest doing all the quests you can in each zone before moving on. If a quest is green, still do it. Honestly there will be times where you are just grinding mobs 1-2 levels below you, and that actually is good.
---
I log there every night after checking. Do a lap when I can. Early in the morning I'll check it then fish nightfin in eluneara. After work I'll stay there and check it then fish squid. You just have to get lucky and find them.
---
This has 3k points. Dudes - you really feel this way, you already know what you have to do!
---
Can we convert the party into a raid? I’m in
---
Well the average parses are around 35-40 seconds, but yes that makes sense still since the tail end of the fight is just Execute
---
Welcome to WoW!
---
&gt;  would this mean that many players would switch from classic to the new expansion? 
---
Who knows? It's possible, but people who are heavy into classic either just came for Classic or switched *from* retail already. My guess is Classic would lose a few players, but not an extreme amount. But that's just a guess.
---
&gt; If so, would players from bfa retain their gold and gears, which would mean that if ai switch to the new expansion, I’d we well behind? 
---
They would retain their gold and gears, but that does not mean you would be *that* far behind. Back when I played retail (vanilla, WotLC, and a bit of Pandaria), every new expansion would effectively reset everyone. Your old gear would get quickly outpaced (lategame raid gear would be about equal to starting quest rewards in the new expansion zones), and the influx of gold would mean overall inflation, so having a bunch of gold stocked up isn't that big of a deal.
---
Just as an advisory, the retail game is totally different from vanilla. More classes, more features, more grindy, more min-maxing. I don't think you'd want to transfer your classic character over to retail (if that's even possible, not sure if it is). My advice would be to just start a retail character if you want to try retail. I think vanilla/classic is far superior, but that's just my opinion. If you're worried about losing the progress leveling you've made so far, just put that out of your mind. Leveling is much much *much* faster in retail, and there's numerous ways to get instant level boosts if you're into that sorta thing.
---
1. Using a modern computer with a modern internet connection changes the game ENTIRELY. As said, the game was at many times balanced and designed around it.
---
You think it's only skill which allowed people to clear MC within a few days? No, them not lagging like crazy made a massive fucking difference. 
---
2. Addons changes the game ENTIRELY. Also, lmao, you're using ADDONS yet whine about such a minimal yet convenient change like healers getting a floating combat text? Get out of here with that hypocrisy.
---
3. Your comparison sucks as you're comparing apples and oranges, lmao.
---
&gt; You seemed irritated.
---
Just some advice, but I’d be careful assuming someone’s emotional state exclusively through text. It’s just a personal observation of mine.
---
&gt; Hmm.  Is it different than most games?  There's typically a drop off after a little bit, right?
---
Well I guess it would depend on the game. Plenty of games see growth... like wow did when it initially came out, for example. 
---
You seem to have this habit of not addressing the main point and honing in on something else entirely. You completely neglected my point about nostalgia much like you ignored (and largely misinterpreted) the point of my original comment. Just another observation.
---
I am just going off current rates. Raid will average 4-5 of each class, with perfect drops need around 40-48 pieces of gear to fully gear up a class. Drops won't be perfect and you will get redundant pieces once people gear up some, so its going to be more like 60+ pieces. 
---
So with 2 pieces of tier gear a week per class, its going to take 30 weeks.
---
Yes I did say that for most people since this is a beginner friendly thread that ret is better since I knew that micro would be the biggest obstacle for most players.
---
It honestly isn’t that hard to master if you’re a decent gamer, even with mid-latency issues it’s all about understanding the timing with the swing timer bar and it’s a certain rhythm once you get the first reckoning proc it’s easier from there.
---
To the guy said that it’s janky, sure it is if you haven’t got past the learning curve. 
---
I just wanted to correct the OP saying it’s ‘the best leveling spec’ when it’s not when you take a high skill paladin player comparing both specs side by side for leveling; prot/reckoning will always be faster no matter what. Sure doesn’t work against range or casters but that’s like 20% of the mobs leveling on the way to 60. Plus it makes you into a better player and engages you more as opposed to auto attacking and watching Netflix. Super strong in pvp as well obviously.
---
Don't remember saying that
---
THey may have pooled rage, but more likely they're popping a mighty rage potion.
---
You sound “big boned”
---
Not really. It's more incoming damage for a few seconds then you switch to sword and shield and go like normal. There isn't actually much mitigation you take from talents when you go prot specced anyway.
---
You dont need to be 60 to kill a 60, there was a 42 warlock on my server corpse camping a 60 warrior.
---
Majority of current 60s arent even that geared yet.
---
It’s possible he’s using a bot sure.
---
But as somebody who snipes a few items a week off the neutral AH I doubt very much that is the case
---
This doesn't take into account alts, i have a 60, 40, 11, 6, and a 1 so it would look like 20% are 60 based on my characters.
---
HEY! He said he was sorry, ok?!
---
Slow the fuck down blizz.........
---
Of course not, but the game fosters a better community because the community is required.
---
I hope they do!
---
As someone who often sorts by cheapest and buys anything below vendor value, or just cheap in general.. idk why you'd report him for buying your stuff? It's your choice to put it up.
---
GL! :)
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
&gt; Honor system
---
If I remember correctly its sort of like a ELO system. You get more points if you kill higher ranked people. You loose points if you’re killed, kill a NPC, or very low level PC?
---
Then after a week all your honor gets totaled and you get ranks? Which give you access to  titles, and equipment?
---
Im digging deeper into the parses and it seems this is the answer. The key thing I was missing is that in every one of these parses all of the warriors are starting the fight with 100 Rage based on the resource logs.
---
I guess I'm just in a trash guild that takes too long between killing adds and ready checks for boss LOL
---
Well based on clarifications from the commentator, they just worded their reply poorly and weren't really flamed. But I agree. If a GM or raid leader is truly *flaming* people for mistakes / poor performance, it's not cool in a video game. If they're handing out some performance critiques to try to help people improve, that's perfectly fine.
---
Yeah I meant my mechanical squirrel lol
---
there's a lot more people in SW than darnassus tho
---
Pog
---
I end up using a bandage here an there, but given my warrior is an alt i can funnel gear down to him to make me much stronger against same level stuff. Also dungeons as tank gets good exp, esp when rested
---
Majority? There are more than 55%/60% people who've reached level 60 already. I mean come on, the game's been out for more than 2 months, even if you'd worked 40 hours a week, then you should have reached level 60 already.
---
I think it’s gonna be fine, the ratios of farming groups to players is just too low. We might encounter that kind of thing once or twice but it’s not gonna be that bad.
---
This is what my bank is full off right now. I’ve also started stock piling things like mojos for ZG bloodvine pieces and ironweb spider silk for naxx resistance gear (drops a shit load from the spiders in lbrs). It doesn’t cost me much to save them now and I know people will buy them (at least to some extent) when those phases arrive.
---
It’s amazing solo. Hunter, Mage, Priest, and Paladin would be your best classes too for various reasons
---
no, you don't need to be prot. i've geared up as arms in vanilla and doing so now too. if you find you're not holding aggro well, let the dps know to like.. hold on for 2 seconds before going apeshit. have a pally for salvation or shaman for WF totem. mitigation wise, you should be pulling 1 group at a time and using CC anyway. mad AOE on everything when you're all still in greens is not a good tactic.
---
I anticipate fewer people will be peacefully responding to my /wave. 
---
Oh well, https://i.imgur.com/gO6Lumt.gif
---
It is possible that is it because the people are older and more mature. For example my grandpa played vanilla wow and he is very nice a little strange but very nice
---
Living the new American dream, realized since 1912.
---
Right... 2.5 months is too fast is my exact point.  Most people figured early-mid December for honor, which would be closer to 3.5 months from release.
---
I've got no issue with them going quickly through phases 1-3 because MC is dead easy and most somewhat serious players have it on farm by now.  That being said, if we keep going at 3months -&gt; new content, theres a chance lots of people wont see full clears of Naxx or possibly AQ40 before the xpac drops.  That's my concern.  I want to see all of Naxx this time around without having to join a hardcore guild.
---
Why are the Kul Tiras Marines at Menethil?
---
How does the one based at Andhoral even function when the city is completely occupied?
---
So many questions
---
People are acting like getting honor on kills and 2 world bosses drastically shift how they play the game. This phase while welcome is one of the lamer ones.
---
I keep seeing this but I doubt it. I'm a gamer and can't sit down for more than 2 hrs for any regular game. But for WoW classic? ... Oh boy. I can play for 6-8 hrs. That's not normal
---

---
Wanting to pvp as heal/reckoning, just wondering if this build is sufficient for healing BWL. 
---
One other thing is which talent should I choose for reckoning build? Spiritual focus or divine strength?
---
It's complete fanfiction at this point. Sylvanas just capable of doing anything, like a certain little green orc.
---
That website is no where near correct.
---
&gt; And a question. Is it possible to make a macro with casting a spell not the latest rank? I need it to see a "note" on my spell icon which rank is it.
---
#showtooltip Shadow Bolt (Rank 1)
---
/cast Shadow Bolt (Rank 1)
---
As long as you aren't using an action bar addon that hides macro text, you can name your macro to identify the spell rank on your action bar. Let's say you make the above macro for Rank 1 Shadow Bolt. You could name the macro 'SB 1' and that text would appear on the macro button when you drag it onto your action bar.
---
Gross
---
I'll be more worried if they rush BWL and AQ
---
Queues weren't an issue on anything but full servers, you could of started after the first week and been fine
---
A minority of the playerbase will benefit from phase 2 releasing this early.
---
Yeah, phase 3 is the most important of them all. Double weekly pve content and BGs.
---
hahahahahahha
---
Are you starting magmadar with a full rage bar? I assume all the top parsing warriors do.
---
Loosing sponsor
---
Thanks for the response, this is all great advice! 
---
I haven’t quite figured out how to see what mob/bosses are targeting while I’m healing. Once I do that’ll prob help with predicting damage a little better. 
---
How do you think about raid heals when you aren’t assigned to a tank? Things can get pretty chaotic with 35 people running around killing adds (ex. Rag phase 2)
---
Are there any EU players on NA servers (and vise versa)? What made you decide this? Also, what are the negatives? 
---
Thinking of rolling on Grob NA as an EU myself
---
&gt; Like, go play Classic on a computer from 2004 with a connection speed from that time and enjoy!
---
Yeah ok, because watching the original lion king in HD is the same as watching the new live action version lol 
---
Funny part is, there is no argument against #nochanges, which is why all of you always resort to twisting the point to absurd levels just to be able to reply with anything :)
---
Because if you don't do that the only thing you can say is 'I don't give a fuck about actually playing Vanilla, I want Vanilla but with changes that I personally agree with" 
---
&gt; Floating combat text for healers NEVER caused any issue, we know for a fact it's a harmless change. What the fuck are you even whining about?
---
Haha yes, silly me. Of course changes don't add up over time :) After all, we have nearly 2 decades of history to prove this. Which is why we haven't spent 10+ years trying to get the original version back. Oh wait...
---
And yes. I had exactly the same character the first time around in vanilla.
---
So it is even possible to do it within 2 seconds, manually? Doesn't this mean you'll have to sit there for long stretches of time spamming some buttons to perform your sniping?
---
I’m mostly just a little disappointed because I was literally gonna start buying out pvp stuff today. Just kinda unlucky, can’t really complain
---
I played both on private servers (and originally) and I can't really hate on anyone who likes TBC. The content was really, really good. Dungeons were hard, raids were hard, zones were fun, and class balance was almost identical to vanilla. It kept the charm of the original game and just added more stuff - a true expansion pack. (Unlike WotLK and beyond, which felt like a completely different game.)
---
Classic is still the best though.
---
Once this sub blew up it went to total shit. There’s nothing to do at 60. It’s the right call. MC and ONY are like 5 hours of content every week. Easily clearable in a night. Then what? I for one am hyped. Lvl 50s will continue to dungeon grind like they do now. Instances will continue to be camped like they are now. It won’t be that huge of a change.
---
God I fucking hate this sub.
---
If you're not 60 yet, an MMO is not for you. MMOs are time sinks. If you can't sink time into it, you're going to be behind. Accept it.
---
What selfish, narcissistic personality does it take to think that a game of millions of players needs to wait on you. Even a casual player should have been 60 a month ago. Not 60 yet means 1) you're not that dedicated to the game and 2) you suck, so why would the game be based around you rather than the people who actually are involved with it.
---
[Well, then...](https://media.giphy.com/media/g1O7oRh9nhCbS/giphy.gif)
---
They should totally do this in an expansion.
---
I was hoping the info would be current with Classic data but an interesting read none the less.
---
Unfair is completely the wrong word, and exposes a sense of entitlement. If you think that, you're playing the wrong game
---
yeah farming mc for 8 months with nothing else to do would be AMAZING
---
lol no they aren't. There's maybe 10-20% level 60s. Maybe more maybe less. Wowpop if you can trust that data says there's 8298 alliance players levels 20-30 on Faerlina. And there's 1841 level 60s on Faerlina. Thats 22% vs just levels 20-30.
---
Because they are used to hunter or mage being able to faceslam one skill.
---
They faceslam heroic strike then wonder why warr is so hard
---
This game is highly addictive and has some type of differentiator that sets itself above the rest (whether that's good or bad). There's no other way to put it.
---
Faerlina, too. I'm jealous of their Horde/Ally split, but I am glad I'll get to actually play the game in the next couple of weeks.
---
You are 100% right lol.  So:
---
**83%** of damage from white attacks, SS, garrote X 2% buff = 1.7% damage increase
---
**17%** damage coming from eviscerate X 10% buff = 1.7% damage increase
---
From this math, if you are doing more than 17% of your total damage from eviscerate, then it's better to go with the +10% talent.
---
'Laughs in Faerlina'
---
Meh
---
You've got 12 days. You can do it
---
I went 55-60 in a weekend, there's hope with 2 weekends between now and the 12th
---
a CPU is built by a few cores, and multithreading is how each core can co-operate. Instead of each core working on their own, multithreading makes sure all cores work together instead.
---
huge bummer for me
---
Rogue:
---
Is the shadowfoot stabber good? I have thrashblade amd dimensional blade of the monkey sword spec, but ive been dying to go daggers. Is shadowfoot good enough to go daggers and is it better than thrash?
---
&gt;Bruh, it's almost 3 months after release. If you are not 60 by then you are the exception, not the rule.
---
The game came out August 26th. It's far closer to being just over 2 months than 3 months at this point.
---
Any idea how many hours a day should I play to do it?
---
Mine takes more than 2sec to push the search button again
---
OMG I don't even have computer, internet, and I won't be born for 3 months. Need 15 yrs to lvl IRL! Slow down Blizz!
---
You should try out for waterboy next season, you seem like you might be a good fit!
---
Why are you guys acting like you won't be able to do any level when PvP is out? You act like the game dies for you just because you aren't level 60 yet
---
Originally it was the only RP-PvP server for NA, and people like to plan ahead. When they put in an Eastern server as well during the first week due to the high numbers (DD server), only a few moved. There is still a wide range of time zone people on Grob, including myself (Central).
---
lol no you are so wrong
---
With tsm you get a alarm sound when someone tries to sell cheap, then you click one or maybe two clicks to buyout
---
"everyone who plays more than me has no life" grow up
---
No, if on a PvE server nothing will change. If on a PvP server opposite factions will be more likely to fight while out questing. Until you hit 50 I wouldn't expect much difference.
---
I think TSM has the function where it checks the newest auctions on the 1st page regularly and auto buys them when they’re a certain percentage cheaper than regularly on the AH.
---
Yeah, and that's fair enough to sort stuff by cost. I would hate to lose my stuff like that, but I would be able to accept it as I do my very best to be faster than that and they snipe it fair. 
---
It's just that it happened multiple times now, by the same player, and within 2 seconds.. I dunno, it just seems too fast if you don't know what's happening.
---
Join a guild and make new friends!
---
Then you counter attack the horde with your group/friends/guildies... Thats the point of pvp... 
---
If you dont want that to happen, if you dont want open world combat then go normal realm
---
Ah i was saying that is the mindset, not advice. In reality. Whatever. Ya know?
---
Long enough to have at least 10k gold stocked up. I'm fucked and so are a lot of other people that planned on ranking thinking they had at least another month to prepare
---
Yeah but of course I'm stealing the joke, totally improbable that two people out of thousands thought the same thing, right?
---
yeah i used that for a long time till i got quelserar.
---
I'm screwed, no characters even close to 50 as yet. In an amazing guild not too worried.
---
Yeah getting Hammer of Grace is rough.
---
I lead a group of lowbies on a full clear of BRD. It was a cool experience. Took us slightly under 2h without wipes.
---
Snowflake generation
---
FUCK
---
Nothing is being removed. You can still experience everything at your own pace
---
Sure, i mean i'm 54 and i played every single day, i think i have like 7 days /played right now. My friends are 57, 58, and 42 right now. I think that's fairly normal. Especially if you enjoy doing world pvp, fishing or just having fun while levelling.
---
Can only play maybe 4 hrs a week I'm only 43.
---
Games been out for two months, level faster.
---
The game isn’t going to wait for you like retail.
---
You can see lvl 1 bots in booty bay behind the AH sometimes. Definitely have a way to monitor auctions.
---
I am coming from max total in old school runescape so all of this is new to me. I am happy to hear everyone is so helpful :)
---
The Lion's Sword. 
---
(small RP guild)
---
What are you giving that tank in return? People have limited time to play. Why should someone else go out of their way for your benefit? What are you bringing to the table?
---
Transmute to 3 elemental fire
---
Classic will get updates eventually. All I’m saying is they can do it without turning it into the mess that is retail. 
---
They will probably keep a small number of servers Classic and update others in some way. 
---
The mistake would be updating it exactly like before and repeat past mistakes.
---
I can't imagine not being 60, most the people in my guild have alts above 40 and at least 20 people have alts at 60.
---
Noob banking?
---
I remember when I was a kid, I would think how silly rp severs are. Now I am kicking myself in the testies, because I honestly should have rolled a rppvp server. It looks like a blast. There’s like a whole another layer or an RP sever that I was never able to appreciate.
---
Stupid beast!
---
And, tangentially, you kinda seem like a critical jerk.  But maybe you are just not great at expressing yourself by text.
---
I'll give the benefit of the doubt.
---
Assuming your giant supply will sell in an over saturated market when 30+ other people try to do the same thing you do, and potential buyers just farm the mats themselves when they see all the price gouging.
---
I would love to see blizzard pull a bungie and get away from activision
---
You're right. Let's release phase 2 in April, phase 3 next January, phase 4 in 2022. Just to give everyone plenty of time. Who cares if everyone stops playing as there is nothing left to do. Who cares if casual players signed up for harder realms and now scream not fair. I'm down with waiting. Take your time level 36, we are all waiting on you.
---
Exactly.  So if the pop was split up into 2 layers, there will only be 1 now.  There will be queues again.
---
Noob question...why is Stranglekelp so expensive?  Pretty easy to farm.
---
Just find the clip of monkeynews getting 3 Crystal's from 1 vein. Will give you hope.
---
talented rupture will do more damage than eviscerate, especially on armoured targets, but it faces major issues in use, in PvE taking up a debuff slot is unacceptable for how little it does vs eviscerate, and in PvP it is very likely to break CC and end up biting you in the ass, though decent in the right situation like kiting a warrior
---
I take notes from quest chains, NPCs, dialogues I like and made some cartography. Just trying to do the same when I was kid, having fun (even if it's cringy).
---
I think he is referring to the fact that new content to play will bring player back to the game for a little bit on release it won’t be to the extent that it was before but it is likely to increase queue times
---
Don't be ridiculous.
---
I always play solo. Sometimes when doing a quest you can invite anyone around and vise versa. Then carry on solo afterwards.
---
DPS, drinks for the healer and other casters, cc where needed, and a portal at the end if anyone wants it. Why the fuck should the tank be the only one to benefit? My time is limited too
---
I can't believe you're still so upset about this. Move on man. See a shrink.
---
all the top comments are about people complaining, and i keep scrolling and not seeing anyone complaining
---
I think that's the reason why most of the streamers we're doing dungeon grinding. However if you enjoy the world PVP it's important not to rush it.
---
Hunters are the easiest matchup for me only in a duel scenario. 
---
If it’s wpvp it’s different because they can keep running (but they won’t kill me either), so no one really wins or they kind of do but it’ll take a long time to kill me in open field, or if there’s los then no one wins or he loses imo.
---
You need to be holy reckoning or ret reckoning spec (though spiritual focus would help especially if you’re not confident vs hunters) with sword and board. Save freedom for wing clip (dispel conc shot) and keep blessing of wisdom and devo aura. 
---
Spam that startattack stopattack macro as reckoning spec and stun to heal when you need it. You need some gear to pull this off I assume, I’m in almost full t1 but even if I was in blues I’d be confident beating all good geared hunters in a duel 1v1 scenario.
---
If you’re not reckoning spec then gg, it’s favoured for the hunter unless you severely outplay or out gear him.
---
Now if it’s an orc hunter your chances are lower because the racial is broken.
---
Something valuable like the demons in North Felwood. They drop corrupted soul shards for your whipper roots, felcloth, demonic runes, etc.
---
Exactly, but farmer who’s growing more food, he’s not necessarily pursuing money, he could be pursuing legacy, growing the family business, trying to get a good year to store for the bad one, lots of reasons.
---
The pursuit of money plays itself as when the goal is just wealth, then we become morally flexible on the methods we chose to pursue whatever field it may be.
---
Like a farmer who would steal better seeds, or sell a mule, but says it’s a horse
---
Come at me bro I am 43 and ready to kill all level 60 *shakes nervously*
---
Hm... I don't have AS much gold as I'd like to, was hoping to sit on close to 2k with a 3-4 month buffer on raid consumes, right now I bearly have the buffer, and only a fraction of the gold... Big yikes from a semi-hardcore player, should've spent my time more effeciently :P
---
That's totally fine. Casual wow is completely okay. They built PvE servers just for players like you. Take your time without punishing others.
---
Yeah, ok. Who need’s a life anyways?
---
Updates, sure. Expansions are what happened to give us what is now Retail.
---
You mean, you are not prepared?
---
Stay outta STV, friend
---
Not saying I'm against it, was just answering his question.
---
The game is not catered to you, if you want that casual experience then modern WoW is created with you in mind.
---
Back peddling lol
---
Chuck Norris can play Russian roulette with a fully loaded revolver and win.
---
Apparently so!! 😭😭😭
---
If you have other hobbies it's really pretty normal. If playing wow is the only thing you do for fun then maybe not. Just depends how your life is set up If you have 2 level 60s i think it's fair to say that all your free time is spent on wow and nothing else, or you dont have a job/family at all.
---
Not that insane, over the course of the past few expansions shes gained random powers out of nowhere. If anything she should be weaker now than she was previously. 
---
Man, should have just got her to solo deathwing and saved us the trouble. She should have easily been able to kill garrosh long before we had to deal with WoD.
---
The story writing is patheticly hopeless and incoherent.
---
I'm talking about names like "trinketthis" that can be reported and changed. I know people that had this happen.
---
I think it's awesome!
---
Kind of hope they release WSG as a phase 2.5 like DM was phase 1.5, makes the content release a bit smoother
---
I don't work at Blizz dude. Are you suggesting they don't know how many people are 60 simply because you don't know yourself?
---
&gt;Well I better stop fucking around and get to level 60 or I will be having a very bad time
---
Why do you think it will be any better at 60?
---
There's no reasoning with you, is there? If you follow the logical conclusion of examining the utility of drops, BoPs would go to the classes that can use them best, and BoEs would be evenly split, which is the fairest for all. Your way grossly benefits some classes more than others (is there even an expensive shaman or rogue BoE that drops from monsters that's relevant at 60?) and opens people up to ninjas taking loot, which the commonly accepted way prevents. The only benefit I can see is that there is a cool feeling of equipping gear that drops for you, but in the end it's just a feeling and most of the BoEs that are rare enough to be concerned about are so rare that you can't go out of your way to farm them so everyone will still have to farm gold for their BoEs
---
CONTENT RELEASING TOO FAST REEEEEEEEE
---
(To be honest, not at all a shocker that they are announcing the pvp patch now at blizzcon which is massive, just wish I had more time ROFL so much more to do! SO MANY MORE BOMBS TO MAKE!)
---
They're likely doing both.
---
Ah yes the classic “I’m bad at video games because I have a LIFE”
---
An excuse older than this game.
---
Have you looked at the realm list recently? Any realm that still has layering will show "Layering" for the population.
---
Most haven't had Layering for a couple weeks now. Last I checked there were only 4 US realms that still had it.
---
Would you accept a player that’s both new to wow and RP? It’s okay if not!
---
Well your saying you wish you took your time, I'm saying it doesn't really matter.
---
Nothing yet.
---
No but from what ive heard Phases aren't supposed to be longer than they were in Vanilla, so supposedly Phase 3 is December.
---
11.12.19
---
I think they will have to keep some servers Classic only just to keep the #nochange crowd happy but I really don’t think they will need nearly as many servers as they have now as Classic. 
---
The updates they do decide on though can’t just be the same as they were before or it will just slowly become retail and nobody wants that.
---
NO LIFERS rejoice lol
---
I'm saying that they have given us no reason to think that the amount of 60s is even a metric they care about at all.
---
Yep. It was a response to the Achimonde beam radars.
---
Why are you assuming there is going to be an expac? Or that it would come soon after Naxx phase?
---
Just buy a pair of trash white gloves and get the +5 mining enchant on them. Very helpful because small thorium and rich thorium are usually in the same zones
---
It can't autobuy, it makes an alarm sound and flashes a button. The player has to click the button, but it's not hard if you are set up and running the scanner.
---
Blessing of light is a large chunk of your +heal. It works out to be something equivalent to like 600 +heal for holy light, so doing rank 4 HL in dungeons from 50+ is great.
---
What are these for that make them worth hoarding? Not being a dick, just ignorant
---
I mean, sure, but theres also a lot of customization that can be done. I've spent several hours with elvui making profiles for my different setups like mobile,desktop,gamepad, etc.
---
Love this! It seems to me that Gadget is always filled with Ally though, anytime I stop by I always go stealth and get out as quickly as possible. They tend to be very aggressive and dgaf about the guards.
---
So they just don't have a bunch of classes in their guild? Do they take pugs for raids then or something?
---
Darrowspike, Barman Shanker
---
What class are you?   
---
This ring is really not that great. Maybe for a bear tank, but still there are better options.
---
I mean, did you start at launch? 
---
43 is the halfway point, so almost certainly not at your rate.
---
&gt; They're feeling pressure to provide content for the top 5%
---
We also have to take into consideration, the top 5% are going to be the ones playing month after month. They were the ones pushing for classic in the first place.
---
The majority of the playerbase, this is a theme park, and they will be gone once shadowlands launches.
---
That's decent but you could go faster
---
Playing EU from NA. During the week it can be tough to find groups at 3am EU time. On the bright side, a lot of farm spots are totally empty. I had my run of hearthglen for 3 nights in a row with nobody there at all. 
---
Ping is about 150 and is noticeable in open world PvP but in instances it's been fine.
---
Unyielding maul is better until P5 because you can put an iron counterweight on it
---
Damn cool
---
Preach my man, tired of these casual retail players plaguing this community.
---
get improved expose weakness and a druid tank
---
Then it's a good thing they don't make decisions based off how many people it "benefits".
---
are you from the future
---
Not worth it.
---
took me 12 days of /played to hit 60 :(
---
and i did it weeks ago which is really making me feel like both a huge scrub and a huge nerd while reading this thread of people saying casuals won’t have done 7 days /played by now. thought i WAS the casual.
---
Ah, makes sense. So most mana efficient would be to use a heal and then attach a power word fortitude stam buff to someone who needs to be rebuffed xD.
---
The only content is 2 world bosses (not a target for casuals), and PvP system (JUST world pvp, not bg's) so there's no real content for casual players in this patch.
---
Wow, that guy has no idea, that's rough.
---
Jokes on them don't have 155g.
---
It's honestly due to having full world buffs. These warriors will be rocking 50%+ crit and never have to worry about not using heroic strike. 
---
You really dont have to think about a rotation when you cant even dump rage quick enough outside of execute phase.
---
Pretty sure I got a letter in the mail from one of them a few weeks ago randomly. The letter was an invitation to some drinking festival they were hosting and have time stamps for activities, who was going to be there, and contact info etc. It was really cool to see all that effort go into it, and I'm sure they sent that to hundreds of people. I didnt go because I was busy the day or two they held it, but I do see them all over and they are nice people.
---
Nov 12
---
Its really buggy. The inquisitor dude never spawned for me once.
---
Well, I honestly can say I'm having a good life. Work for myself, earn good money, wife, healthy and lovely kids, big house, plenty of hobbies.
---
Some days I wish I was a basement dweller with no responsibilities and could play WoW all day.
---
With how slow you are going you'll get farmed at lvl 60 anyways by being with far superior gear
---
I'm just excited about my new Illusionary Rod, that Crescent Staff was getting worn out.
---
TBF, SW:P is the strongest dot in the game.  So that isn't a good comparison.
---
Doesn't change the numbers does it. Its not surprising that level 60s would have alts close to level 60 because they are super hardcore players.
---
Yeah, just gotta get to 270 mining for that... lol
---
I did not keep my professions up to date, clearly.
---
1. Take Impale
---
2. Yes 9% hit for yellows and whites.
---
3. Edgemasters don't give +2h swords.
---
best blue weapon end game is an axe. i wouldn't put 5 points in mace anyway due to dr. i'd spend that 5 somewhere else if i had TUF or hand of rag. also, having 5% crit means 5% chance your MS will crit, which is a huge plus in PvP. i have had hilarious sword spec procs delete people though so that's also fun.
---
Wait..... your saying BRD wasnt fleshed out?
---
Darrowspike seems dope, Barman doesn't seem that good since It has such a long bleed thats gonna break my blinds/gouges
---
Thanks! My nubness has been reduced a bit.  I've been fishing up a stack+ in less than an hour.  Just sold a couple stacks for cheap...Guess I know my path for gold for epic mount!
---
Best place to farm Stranglekelp?
---
Possible, yes
---
Should sell higher on ally as well if you are horde.
---
You're saying you don't understand why it would be easier to pvp against level 60s *as a* level 60.. as opposed to like level 51?
---
Totally get that and its yet another thing I find great about RP servers in wow and other games, its the other people play-acting that bothers me after a while.  
---
So for instance I've got a buddy that does historical battle re-enactments as a cavalryman.  Dude is an awesome guy when not in character but after being around him for an hour while he's in character (a lot of them stay in character while at camp on their multi-day re-enactments) I just have to get away from him.
---
yeah, total failure on that too.
---
promised it'd be gone a few weeks after launch, broken promise.
---
now we got mega servers, that's going to be real fun when everybody returns for pvp.
---
I'm sure myself, and many others, don't even play retail. I came back for Classic, after having not played WoW since Lich King. You're not better than people just because of your game choice.
---
If your not roaming with a group and already geared your going to have a bad time. Fresh 60s are just as screwed as a level 57.
---
There's a sea of hidden comments cause of downvotes
---
I agree, but it only gets people hyped up that are lvl 60 and PVP interested. You will burn out a lot of people that arent 60 yet because they get farmed to no end. Many wont care because "hurr durr fuck casuals" but the majority isnt even 60 yet (but close to it)
---
Thank you for this! Definitely a few on your list I wasn't aware of.
---
You grant full honor at level 48 and beyond.
---
Give yourself a fighting chance, there are going to be camped areas all over the map, BRM is going to be a death zone.
---
Good luck if you're on a PvP server, seems like everyone is an engineer this time. Competition for every level of ore is insane.
---
that isn't the only way to make money
---
No it feels pretty damn different. In 2004/2005 the entire population was learning the game from square one. Probably 80% had never played a MMO. People were much more willing to explore, experiment, screw around, socialize, and take their time. 
---
The culture now is much more efficiency-minded. Makes for smoother dungeon runs, but it's a littler colder and less friendly game than it used to be. It was inevitable, and it's way more social than retail, but still.
---
Well take your time and enjoy the journey, there's no rush. As I stated I like carrion birds, they eat meat and fish so they're easy to manage, they have an area of affect attack that reduces the enemy's melee attack power, while also generating threat. So, your pet will be able to hold the attention of alot of enemies, enemies on your pet is better than enemies on you. 
---
The classic community is very friendly and helpful  alot of the time, most people won't mind giving advice or help in some way. 
---
Good luck on your adventures young hunter.
---
Phase 2 is coming, honor points but no BGs. My recollection from Vanilla is most PvP took place in STV, Hillsbrad, and Tanaris.
---
With so many 60s where do you think most of the players looking to rank up will be? I'm thinking the entrances of DM and Blackrock Mountain might be the most popular spots?
---
haha great list thanks. I've got Blackstone already, and will be getting the Devilsaur set soon. I can afford it right now but I'm only 54 and would rather just save up another few hundred gold and get my epic mount before putting money down for gear. Thanks for the list!
---
They already do
---
There FAPS - Free action potions. 30 seconds of stun/slow immunity. I play a hunter, and these basically give me a massive advantage for those 30 seconds!
---
more like 2 hours, 2.5 if you count travel time
---
a holy priest's sw:p is certainly worse than a warlock's coa/cod/corruption
---
Me three. Though this time round I got my gf hooked too so it was bad for both of us. We were both feeling depressed whenever we weren't playing WoW, the house was messier than it has ever been, we were both taking days off work to play WoW, etc. Super uncool. 
---
She wants me to come back to WoW but I ain't having it (and we only play together so that means she isn't playing as a result).
---
Thanks for the detailed reponse. It seems like unlike in Retail I'm going to need to actually level to make money. Makes sense lol
---
Really happy to hear there are no major bots left!
---
I will consider changing professions, this early into my 'career' I think it's not too late to switch. Thanks dude!
---
Ah good point on the gloves didnt read closely. Thanks!
---
CBH hasn’t organized any PVE raids to this point. The max level players typically raid with PUGs or other affiliated guilds. Clan Hammersong just downed Rag for the first time this week with a couple CBH folks.
---
Right it builds their fragile egos to pretend they are somehow better at something when in reality they just spend more time playing a video game...life goals I guess.
---
There's always dungeon grinding.
---
Spiritual focus is probably one of the most important talents in the holy tree for holy reckoning for pvp. 
---
You’ll be hitting like a wet noodle with sor so divine intellect &gt; divine strength always if your holy reckoning since your primary role is healing and your main damage comes from reck bombs once people focus you in battle. Not really there to constantly melee.
---
Yes it is sufficient for healing in BWL, you should still top the charts if you know what you’re doing.
---
I would consider dropping 2 pts out of imp sor since it only affects the baseline spell (even then the sor coefficient for sp is hot garbage in classic compared to pservers) and put it into the fear/disorient resist talent, but that’s only if you pvp a lot and face a lot of locks/priests etc.
---
Sorry for your loss, OP
---
Grobbulus is rp-pvp
---
That’s not what I said. I’m saying g the release schedule shouldn’t be tuned to the top 10%. The top 30% would probably be about right.
---
BiS mitigation, but aren't you using Band of Accuria + Blackstone Ring to be hit capped anyways? 
---
Mitigation's not very important in this phase, but threat is paramount. Our bear tank literally never equips that Dark Iron. There's just no reason to.
---
Or maybe it just isn't really an arguable point. Those are things that exist.
---
But if anyone can argue an inarguable point I'm sure it would be a professional redditor like yourself.
---
Man, I miss IF bank.  I went horde this time around.
---
You can submit it to me, either here on Reddit or in-game on Grobbulus - or to any of our guild officers. We're always looking for new members who are a good fit to help us spread the hospitality and comfort of Elwynn Forest across the whole of Azeroth :)
---
Like wtf? This scares me so much I cant play that much I’m only lvl 37 and I can only play on a laptop. This patch might literally make me stop playing.
---
Right there with you bud. It was bad enough even with layers, now without layers it just feels pointless to even try when you can make the gold and buy the product so much faster. I was working on crafting Force Reactive Disk. I spent so many hours doing nothing in the game except farming RTVs (high population server and no layers) and only looted 4 of the 8 I needed. The rest I purchased with the gold I made selling Thorium Bars.
---
I mined ~360 ore to find 4 crystals, so that was what, a 1.11% drop rate for me?
---
What about Mind Flay?
---
I’ll check it, thanks!
---
Having 4+ hours a day to play is something a lot of people don't have.  If I don't starve myself of sleep, I get 1.5 hours of gaming a night due to taking care of my son and the house.  I'm so sorry that you think having a wife and a job is burden.  A lot of us don't stop working when we get home.
---
Didn’t know, I’ll check it out.
---
&gt; Hope you don't mind me bothering you,
---
I'm knowledgeable and experienced, please ask away. Happy to share as much as I can.
---
That build you just linked, is standard moonglow spec, which is very potent for PvE, (healing or flexing to DPS as needed as a caster) as well as able to hold your own in PvP. You won't have feral charge, but you can still really do a good job in pvp none the less.
---
For the natural shapeshifter tier, it's either that, or improved thorns, so I would prefer natural shapeshifter over I think it's 4 or 5 extra thorns damage. It gives you better survival chances. In PvE if you pull threat, while healing or damaging you shift to bear to not get globaled, in PvP you want to be able to shapeshift into travel a bunch without draining your mana.
---
They use it for PvE. For non humans (alliance only) daggers or dagger+db is BiS p1-3 and p3-4 swords, p5 daggers p6 swords. Felstriker with it's proc is equal to CHT.
---
I tell kids these days about Shadowbane they would never be able to handle an MMO like that.
---
Let me put it simply for you. She managed to break the dominion over her free will and escaped Arthas' subjugation. That ALONE is proof of her sheer power, arguing otherwise is fruitless. 
---
THE ONLY other character who broke from Arthas' will was the Lich Rage Winterchill, who guess what - served as a leader of one of the most dreaded forces known to Azeroth, The Burning Legion. But yeah, they're "too powerful!"
---
Just admit your argument is emotional in origin and not based on known lore.
---
No one did though, try google any video or vod. U won't be able to find a faster 1-10 hunter run :p
---
I read somewhere like 30% of players are lvl 60. Perfect. We are at the perfect schedule then
---
I got 60 by week 2 and I had more or less free reign of these pools for a week on stalag. In my experience the drop rate is honestly true. Cant recall if it was 30 or 40% but it was unusual for me not to get at least 1 per pool. There are what, 6 pools up every hour~ so I'd just chalk it up as bad rng. Couple times I've checked I saw people out there now so I dont even bother.
---
yeah cause of this, some guilds will ally with complementary guilds to raid together, in this case lots are in the Menethil Accord
---
You want even casuals to be able to see the majority of naxx? That will never happen. If we want the vanilla experience then most people should be gatekept out of the endgame raids now as well.
---
I'm a casual. I can't play all day like those steamers do and get to 60 in the first week.
---
Blizzard needs to think of us people who have actual lives and families and work 80 hours a week.
---
How does he not realize this?  Surely you'd eventually wonder why the cities are full of level 1 characters selling items
---
Quel is amazing so if you can get one cheaper get one. Otherwise a lot of my friends in high class guilds we use daggers for tanking. Storm for one has all of their warrior tanks have Perd and CHT and are killing it on the TPS. I have Eskanders claw as a horde warrior and it is working really well. But i have always been a huge fan of Quel, especially as human.
---
I disagree, this should have been far sooner. Now we finally have something to work toward that takes actual time.
---
Unless you're a druid swimming is no fun.
---
So every person should wait for you and your group of friends because you did other things beside lvling? 
---
I’ve been playing very casually and even rerolled server to skip queues and I’ve been 60 for 3 weeks.
---
Its gonna be a shitshow, cant wait. The schedule is fine, they are moving forward with the same pace as EU vanilla release. They just need to bring BGs way earlier than expected though.
---
It's glorious. Been horde for 13 years so went alli
---
Thanks for the info and no, I started 3 weeks ago I think. Just did /played I have 5 days.
---
Hi, /u/Nihilk

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dq9a5t/quick_question_guys_does_respec_cost_go_down_in/). 
---
That’s a you problem. Solution? Quit your job and equip your poop sock.
---
Feel like phases are too fast so far too?
---
Lvl 37 here and a pretty good gamer. You guys are wow elitists and u dont recognize it. The games been out for 2 months and youve probably spent almost 20 days of those on wow.
---
Hemo takes up a debuff slot, so you'd want to get the green light from your raid leader.
---
Why? Those are basically worthless on my server. Leveling fishing is so frustrating because of the time investment and that the fish almost vendor for more.
---
There are people that enjoy world PvP but can't nolife it to 60. I'd even wager they are the majority of the current players on PvP servers. Releasing the honor system this early with no BGs is a mistake in my opinion.
---
Just bought out all the mats for 400 potions for the low low price of 10g.
---
The amount of times I see "first flying mount" posts whenever this bug happens is nutty.
---
Looking forward to this a lot.
---
For those who are complaining: you chose a PvP server. Sorry, not sorry.
---
Lol no, you’re flat out wrong. They said they would be at one layer by phase 2.
---
Skip the point in Revenge, imo.  Pop it into parry or something else.
---
0 for 2. Try again son.
---
If you dont have full pre bis and a guild easily farmily mc and ony you arent gonna have a good time.
---
In the water....
---
Holy shit
---
He could've been playing a day after Launch without queues.
---
Of course they will
---
Yea that’s what I thought. I stupidly grinded up to friendly, only to find out it’s not available till phase 5. I feel like elemental fire will be less valuable in phase 5 though since less people will need fire pots for MC?
---
Don’t tell them about the tram!
---
"Most people aren't 60 yet" bro if you don't have a 60 yet it's 100% laziness on your part. 
---
Over 2 months plus rested exp is ample time to hit 60.
---
Am druid...but honestly, fishing holes provide more than swimming for herbs.
---
So just pull a group then cast GBoK? Never heard of that.
---
I have a 27 alt druid is that good enough or are there mobs?
---
It’s titled under humor, boys. My man is joking
---
Whut
---
guess the tanks on my server don't care much about that. all I see is ARENA FARM / LAVA RUN etc. yeah I'm not gonna try to join those and ask if we can do vault
---
How many of those 60s log in almost every day compared to how many of those 20-30? I feel like that literally means nothing.
---
Yes as I said to someone else, I misread it, as I wanted to say, good luck farming anything in open world of the next month and a half after it launches. As every zone is going to be a bloodbath.
---
stop lying
---
Yea things like this doesn't matter if you have fun playing imo. I just wanted to have enough gold and watched some videos about mats etc. (its for free aciton potion)
---
Dude chill out, there’s tons of people that leveled their first 60’s on private servers (where almost everyone is a try hard) and they were competing on already established servers. You’ll be fine
---
Your only chance is p3 a weapon comes out called nightfall. That weapon is the only reason most guilds would consider bringing a enhancement
---
April fools was a while ago
---
*no one did it and recorded it and shared it though.
---
:-P
---
If this is a joke at the guy who stole it from the first guy then 5 stars
---
You aren’t alone bro. We all go through dark times and it feels very lonely at points along that road. Talk about it with someone you can trust.
---
No way that’s true.
---
Blizz never stated they wanted bulk of playerbase at 60 for phase 2.
---
It's simply differently aligned priorities regardless of how many people are still in the middle of leveling.  Easily observed evidence/data and statistics would point to most of the playerbase not being 60 yet.  It's irrelevant to the release schedule though.
---
That’s so cool!  And smart.
---
My husband and I play in an office next to each other and have a wall of sticky notes to keep track of similar things.  Right now it’s mostly a list of friendly horde we’ve met, lol.
---
I mean kinda? It makes it better joining a guild tho.
---
Unless you are a gnome
---
Post the error here perhaps ? Screenshot or text.
---
Nah, games should never be catered to casuals. If you aren't 60 yet you're probably also a higher risk of quitting than a no lifer.
---
LOL  
---
No, you entitled baby. The group does not exist for your benefit. You make the \*calls\* because you make the pulls, there's nothing more to it than that. You have zero right to only do the parts you need at the expense of everyone else as any other group member.   
---
Get the fuck over yourself.
---
FINALLY WE GET TO PLAY THE OTHER HALF OF THE GAME
---
If you're unable to put more than 2 hours in over two months, I don't know that you're the type of player they're trying to cater towards.
---
I dinged 44 today. I expect I can hit 48 by 12th November. In a PVP server with extreme unbalance in favor of the other faction (as all of them).
---
Not looking forward to this.
---
Plenty of people leveled in vanilla after honor was released, stop being so dramatic
---
Yeah I've been getting dibs on all the offpieces since might has been dropping on like every boss and our warriors are decked out. They prioritized ony head for all tanks, so maybe BoA will be the same.
---
Except they never gave us a set timeline. They just said it's going to be 6 phases. So again, they aren't speeding anything up because there was never a baseline to go faster than.
---
I mean he did say hunter, not paladin
---
I will respectfully deny that you and I have the same definition of "very casually" if you've been at 60 for 3 weeks.
---
And to be clear - I'm not sure the hate on the release pace is warranted since it's just the honor system coming with phase 2, but I just hit lvl 56 last night and I feel like I've spent *too much* time playing. I feel like 80% of my free time has been spent playing WoW.
---
When did I say weeks?
---
Imagine not being able to read.
---
You can easily hit 60 in 11 days if you try. Once you get to 53 just do BRD, then lbrs at 56 and everything at 58. Leveling in the 50s actually becomes much faster than the 40s and ur gonna get your endgame gear at the same time
---
I'm saying 1v1 is very rare out in the world. Getting stomped by a group is just as bad at 55 as 60.
---
that's catering to casuals imo and i really dont like that. i feel like mmos are at their best if they cater to no-lifers
---
you didn't think starting a month later then everyone else would put you behind? good god the logics of some people
---
You mean, he got to level 10 with zero assistance? Get this man a medal
---
What do you mean? You mean more casual players don't log in everyday?
---
No, they should release it like it was released in vanilla, how is that not the most reasonable expectation? So wait another 2 months or so then release it?
---
I'm glad they're rushing this phase.  I'm not even 60 and I want honor, and in 2 months BGs.
---
Not necessarily the auto mod bot just looks for phrases.  Either way the mods restored this so you are actually incorrect. I get that the mods aren't great here, but if you want too shit on them do it when they actually screw up and not when they are doing their job correctly.
---
Love that pet name. “Meatspin”
---
Outside of a single quest run that wouldn't be efficient exp wise. Just get the mage to lvl 26 then aoe level to 60 is faster than 99% of methods.
---
Booty bay bourgeoisie. I love it
---
stop playing frost then. 
---
You know elemental mages are a thing right? It plays off scatter combo. You freeze people in place and scorch them for amazing crits and they give back mana if you spec into it.
---
Im fine with phase3 getting a bit rushed .as long as we are in that phase a long time,  it's a lot of content
---
There is nothing for 60s to do but grind players in the open world
---
Why would Blizzard cater to a bunch of people who log 5 hours a week when they could cater to the people who are on 20 hours a week.
---
The war is kind of fun though just last night I heard of some ally’s on the sandbar west of grom gol. Scoped it out and yep 6 of em. So I gathered like 8 horde and we killed them. They came back with 10, we came back with 15 they came back with 20. Eventually it was 40v40 outside of grom gol it ended with us wiping them and we stormed their little base in STV then darkshire, then lakeshire then goldshire. They met back up with us outside of storm wind and we died. Then we hearthed out, but it was great fun.
---
DKs only come from questgiving NPCs, not players.
---
Enough to get 2 levels per day.
---
A one legged boar on half health.
---
Took me 6 corpse runs to get into BRD yesterday. Horde have that shit camped at every entrance.
---
why? jw
---
If you get more money from vendoring oily blackmouth than selling it on AH I think it's time to reroll on another server tbh.
---
I would be. Its not a ring that should ever go to a dps over a tank.
---
You dont have to be 60 to experience wpvp
---
Discombulator Ray, it could be used to dismount people, not sure if it still does.
---
Also current BiS for Rogues.
---
Hey mate. Just wanted to say that I thought Classic wouldn't be able to take hold of my life like it did when I was younger, for many reasons, but I was wrong. And this time it caught my gf in its tendrils. 
---
I had to quit for the both of us (we only play together) cause we were both being affected, to the point where we were calling in sick to work for several days at a time to play WoW (and while we never consciously stated that WoW was the reason, you and I know better), and other areas of our lives were suffering. 
---
So yeah, stay strong mate. Continue listening to your brain, cause it's generally smarter than your heart (despite your heart's good intentions). 😁
---
This will probably come off as too personal and forward but.. I was questing in the barrens a week or so ago and it hit me like a ton of bricks.. 
---
here i am at 35 years old no job, significant other and not really any better off than i was 15 years ago doing the same thing, same grinds, same behaviors. 
---
Certainly not going to blame wow for all of that but god damn did it hurt.
---
Sadly I can't be a turbonerd this time around. I no longer have all day to mess around in pvp and do pve. I did a ton of pvp back in vanilla and mostly skipped out on pve so this time I am looking to spend my few hours a week in pve. I may roll a rogue on a pvp server though just to try it out though. I likely won't even be 60 by the time phase 2 comes out, I am just shy of 53 right now on my main.
---
You aren't playing on one of the big servers right? It's not a question of if someone is ganking the question is how many raids camping blackrock.
---
You arent the only one. Depending on your server and faction it might be better to level alts or tap out till p3 or reroll to PvE realm. 
---
I ran into a major death in the family that took me off line for about a month so I'm behind. I don't know what my plan is, my guild has the raids on farm at least and it old geared so I can call on help if their around. 
---
 I figured I had till Dec to get ready. But oh well I have a bank full of oily black mouth and strangle kelp I can at least make bank with to boost my cash flow.
---
Yea man, the game is already 15 years old. Dissected and optimized to every degree. Let's spread the content over 5 years. SeemsGood.
---
This already took ages, if your not sixty by now your already screwed yourself once this game out anyway.
---
imagine quitting because someone plays smarter than u
---
Because they know those players logging 20 hours a week will stay no matter what. And they make up the minority.
---
Somewhere deep down we all want to believe that Blizzard's still got it.
---
Props to Lyle for the great screenshot \^\_\^
---
There are indeed ghosts all over the ruins.
---
Yeah they don't care about the amount of 60s. They care about making money. I'm reasonable sure that they're just trying to keep things "fresh" so that people don't get bored and stray away from playing altogether.
---
However, if this rate of release keeps up, I'm afraid that releasing things too quickly will actually be what pushes casuals away from playing the game. As a level 56 I don't think phase 2 coming out is a huge deal. It's just the honor system. But I really do wish they'd just let the game *breathe* a bit for casual players. Maybe after battlegrounds since that'll give everybody a little something to do.
---
&gt; If you want to ~snail it till~rush it to 60 that's your choice, everyone else might not want to ~wait~have phases rushed however.
---
Works both ways yo.
---
Phase 2's release though was only ever limited to when layers collapsed in to one.  Has nothing to do with leveling speed.
---
i’ve played private servers for years and I want a slower release of phases. most others do too. we’re still farming tubers and consumables. APES members, who people actually know now, mostly agree that this is way too fast and bad for the game.
---
Honestly you'll learn as you go along. There are people with 15 years experience and people with 0 years; it is what it is. The point of the game is to have fun. You're not competing for money lol
---
I can assure you that the average person did not hoard stacks of blackmouth oil
---
Okay, I had never really thought about it and was curious.
---
Replaced by better rings in upcoming phases for rogues, but not replaced for tanks.
---
Yeah I sometimes ponder this but it takes approx. ~10,000 hours of concentrated practice to become an expert at a skill. That’s 416 *days* /played time just to master a single skill. Idk about you but I have never come close to a fraction of that in /played on WoW and don’t plan to. Especially when you subtract AFK time etc. I think for me this helps put the amount of time I spend on WoW in perspective. Maybe i’m just justifying but I know lots of normalcool people who spend more time shit posting on reddit/browsing instagram than I do on WoW.
---
Who said 5 years? I realize some people seem to have infinite time to play the game.
---
Fake garbage
---
Lmao i just hit 48 on my main
---
What does being a good gamer even mean?
---
I tried to focus on the video, but I can't get past the female nelf swing animation.  It's so bad.
---
That is not true at all.
---
Just ask that one guy who solos with his friend in a party all the time. It's all about the intimate gameplay.
---
should have went pve
---
I knew it was going to be a shitshow off the bat when they said servers will have more people.
---
You can’t. The closest you can find is month + old data from before blizzard stopped census from running
---
I've been wanting to roll on grobbulus for a while because large scale world PVP is my favorite part of the game, but I'm extreeemely casual (just hit 37, started a couple weeks after launch) and rerolling is a pretty hefty endeavor. Oh well, that's life.
---
Great, thanks for all of your help! Don't think I have any other questions right now but I'll probably respec into that proper Moonglow build this weekend.
---
I heard Blizz announced that in phase 2 they will be deleting all non 60 characters. Is that true?
---
*When you can’t beat actual records is start making ones up
---
May RNGeezus have mercy on your grinds
---
I agree with this. A lot of trash pulls in dungeons (esp ones with low hp mobs) end up with nova + CoC + arcane explosion shatter combos as finishers. Plus, it's satisfying to see big numbers blow up on the screen. :) 
---
Boss encounters are rarely long enough in dungeons to make good use of Winter's Chill imo. If you are regularly running 5-mans with other frost mages it might pay bigger dividends, I guess.
---
At 2 months we're still very much at that point where if you are 60, it's very safe to say you don't have much going on in life outside of WoW. That's still like 3 hours per day since launch.
---
Where the hotly contested ERPvP zones?
---
Why doesnt blizzard want us to know server populations???
---
It pretty much is when you have raids on farm
---
You are making it sound like we can’t get expansions without making the same mistakes again. 
---
I think we can without screwing up what we love about Classic.
---
Same. I should have went with a PvE server. I don't have the time to get good at pvp, do dungeons for passable on level loot or grind gold to buy the gear. I'm holding out hope that the thing I enjoy most about the game, the slow questing to 60, won't be further ruined by people sitting on my corpse for "honour".
---
Why did you pick a pvp server?
---
You got to 60 in about a month.
---
Let's say average /played to 60 is 7 days (in reality, it's closer to 10).
---
That means you played 5-6 hours **per day** on average.
---
That's no-lifer status.  Don't be in denial.
---
only scrubs not made alts to 60
---
hurr de durr
---
Nothing like ELO. Elo aims to be a number representative to your skill. Honor is literally just the cumulative killing of the opposite faction over and over and over again. It doesn't take into account how, when , why you killed them, just how many you have killed essentially.
---
Thank God im leveling a Rogue so I can hopefully stealth away from most situations
---
BGs will kill wpvp just like they did many years ago. Group up and enjoy the battles while they last.
---
I’m currently at 445 hours so yea your 120 is like nothing lol.
---
then be smart and spend all of your money on blackmouth oil. 
---
People will need them for free action potions. They WILL be expensive.
---
Always easy to see the the old WoW adage show itself...
---
"You're a no-lifer if you're ahead of me, you're a scrubby n00b if you're behind me" no where the player is.
---
Druid, mage are very self sufficient.
---
Ok so what we just wait till 2023 to release anything new?
---
Trash in general, Garr, Sulfuron, and Majordomo. Lucifron and Gehennas too, but mages should be decursing.
---
There is nothing comfortable with a 50g respect cost.
---
aight, will do
---
i have a warrior lvl 42, and first aid in 300 (runecloth cheap) and use bandages that heal 100% are amaizing. first time that its feel like cheat.
---
I know what you're trying to say I think? But you're adding nothing to this discussion, insulting others, and making a fool out of yourself. Kindly leave. Kindly. Leave.
---
Comparison is the thief of joy.
---
Live your own life.
---
Imagine thinking WoW has ever been a hardcore game lol
---
&gt; How many groups are actually min maxing debuff slots though lol.
---
For MC, very few because it really doesn't matter. But you don't want to pick up bad habits.
---
Cool thanks. Where did you see that out of curiosity?
---
Is this related to processor speed in any way? I swear my AH search button used to take several seconds to light back up after performing a search or changing pages. On my new PC it feels like it lights back up nearly instantly though.
---
It's an indicator of how close they are to reaching a point where their character literally can't get any better. Making your character stronger is the primary driving force in an rpg, without it things get boring.
---
But you don’t seem to care about real life because you’re so busy playing WoW
---
I think most people were hoping to reach 60 before p2 which is why it makes them feel rushed. WoW PvP community has never really sought challenging fights (hence premade - premade dodging, excessive twinking etc) so people are understandly worried that the 48-55ish level zones are going be a slaughterfest at the flightmaster because people are trying to farm honor points.
---
Not his fault OP didn't take the time to do 5 minutes of research.
---
idk, i have over 3k gold, dont really care about that
---
Bro its literally how much time you have to play. Its not complicated.
---
The average age of WoW players in 2006 was 29, so the average age of Vanilla WoW vets today is 42. Yet the average age of those at levels 50-60 in WoW today is probably not 42, heck on my Classic WoW youtube channel 99% of my views come from the 25-34-year-old age block.
---
Either you beat the 1-60 record or you don’t again I don’t find 1-10 to be an impressive feat it literally doesn’t matter and shouldn’t be ranked imo.
---
Sadly no, the only spot as someone else said is as a bot for a specific weapon come phase 3 called nightfall - https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall
---
But beyond this, enhancement doesn't bring enough to the table.
---
Id like to know too
---
I have never gotten a queue on my server.
---
If you wanna cheetah it till bis that's your choice, everyone else might not want to rush however.
---
I enjoy furyprot. Not neccesary and makes run go cleaner imho, which is a must if you wanna charge money etc for runs :) also its not horrible if u gotta grind some mobs
---
No idea
---
Its a fun experience, honestly.
---
No life? If you're not 60 by now you're actively trying not to be.
---
I never said I wanted to be on the cutting edge of Classic.  I'm more than satisfied with my leveling pace.  I'm hitting my goals and probably will hit 60 before 2020.  I have no issues with that.
---
I'm not looking to delay the game roll out.  I understand that a lot of players only want to raid or only want battlegrounds.  I also know that a lot of people are still leveling and pushing through the phases too fast will destroy the game.
---
MMOs don't require 6 hours a day.  No game does.  You are choosing to invest your time into it.  Saying that someone who can only play for 90 minutes a day is being selfish is absurd.
---
Yea the most I can find is anecdotal and I see values everywhere vs something concrete :)
---
Lot of guilds doing it in 2 hours even.
---
Have you never worked in a office setting? the politics and drama that I see is cancer.
---
Met my wife playing WoW. I was her raid leader at the beginning of Cata. Stopped playing when we started dating, then picked it back up a bit in MoP and now Classic. Been together over 8 years...
---
Still keep in touch with many, many friends through the game, too -- some from before I started playing, others I "met" first in the game.
---
My life would certainly be very different if I never started playing, but I don't know that it would be better. I think probably not.
---
WoW has literally never catered to unrepentant maladjusted losers. 
---
It was conceived as a much more accessible game, as evidenced by the myriad people who are doing just fine while still being functioning members of society.
---
Oh my, what's happened at Blizzcon??
---
Nah, shouldn't have to wait too much longer though.
---
Are you trying to say you don't hit hard? Because if that's the case I got news for you.
---
Because I’ve made choices in my life that allow me to spend all my time pursuing my hobbies 🙂
---
This is amazing.
---
I know for sure that if the mob is grey to the higher level, that decreases exp alot. I'm not sure if there's more penalty for &gt;10 lvls or if it's all equal
---
typical 2019 plebs who read guides LUL
---
Aight cheers for fast answer. Quest runs and some easy gear. Thanx :)
---
Correlation does not equal causation. Especially with only speculation. Do you understand my explanation?
---
Maybe they'll allow PvP to PvE transfers
---
Welp, looks like I’m going to be camping dungeons from 48-60
---
That's untrue, hunters remain amazing through BWL and most of AQ because Ashjre'thul is brokenly powerful. They suck more in Naxx because they haven't upgraded their weapon since BWL.
---
Feral druid will never be the top, but they still put out competitive DPS, more so when they get significant gear upgrades in AQ.
---
would still be the same
---
I actually enjoy farming gold etc the least. Thats why I bought tons of mats cheap early. That way I dont have to farm that much later on and can play more pve pvp
---
Nobody is saying you have to read every quest detail or farm aimlessly.  But foe folks that aoe grinded to 60 or took time off work to powerlevel (which I won't fault, that's what they wanted to do) kind of forced this situation on themselves. And if they don't wanna log in more that's fine, no big deal. But to make a reddit post indicates some level of complaining, and complaining about something you chose for yourself is kind of silly.
---
Rogue get Alcor's Sunrazor / Krol Blade and Shamans get Sash of Mercy. Preventing ninjas from taking loot is the only good reasoning for everyone to need an item, but the logic follows that if it's to stop items from being ninja'd then the item should then be given to the highest roller that'll actually use it, if the person that won it pockets the item then they're no better than the ninja.
---
Lots of BoE's aren't rare though, many require you to be in the right place at the right time (fire resistance cloth boots from Dire Maul are BoE), so some can be farmed, and the other's that can't like BoE greens with good rolls and epic BoE's, but even they should be given to the person who will use them, that way the result isn't greed, it's need. The fairest possible system if you want to account for gold being perfectly split in dungeons / raids would be to have everyone get an equal cut of the gold, so a 'seller' taking the item, selling it and then distributing the gold, but that'd only be a surface level solution, there are lots of other things you could factor in, like the tank / healers not being able to make as much gold outside of dungeons, tanking taking more durability damage and having to repair more / bringing more consumables, warlocks needing to farm up soul shards in their own time for the sake of the whole raid / dungeon ect, if you were to somehow factor all this in to get the fairest outcome then you'd have a weird split of what people deserve and don't deserve. All of that effort when you could have an equally fair option of having people that'll use the item (meaning 100% efficiency on it's value) using it, whilst other people have no right to even consider it theirs.
---
The fact that some people act as if they've lost out on an item they have no right getting outside of a greed roll is astonishingly selfish, it'd be like if I'd try to get herbalists to roll out their Black Lotus because I'm in the same group as them, they're a herbalist so they get the lotus, tanks are tanks so they get the shields, blacksmiths are blacksmiths so they get Plans, that's literally the fairest way of distributing things, if you're not happy that you can't roll on as many epics because you're a rogue or shaman then feel free to play a different class, but you'll just be in the same situation when you can't roll on a Sash of Mercy or Alcor's Sunrazor.
---
I was factoring in the trash runs for BoEs on the second day, but yea if you already had the BoEs 2 hours/week is super not worth it.
---
Your welcome!
---
That hasn't been a problem because most people aren't self absorbed narcissists. You should follow their example.
---
Okay now u are talking like no one ever been to raid with enhancement shaman in phase 1. Is that really that bad ? U have improved wf totem that's better buff for warrior and rogue...
---
I'm gone the second they do that. I want Classic+, not flying mounts that kill organic player interactions/WPVP and all my 2 years worth of gear progression being wiped out by level 62 greens.
---
To everyone saying honor is coming out too fast, here is some perspective on this timeline vs the original timeline.
---
It was 135 Days from wow launch to Honor being released. Lets hack off about 10 days somewhat arbitrarily to represent how much down time there really was at launch.
---
It will be 77 days from classic launch to classic honor release. ~62% of the time that vanilla had.
---
We knew that the release schedule would be faster, but this represents about 1/3 faster release pace vs original. At this rate Naxx will release 8/14/2020 with TBC theoretically opening 12/21/2020.
---
I don't think that's necessarily too fast, but just wanted to give perspective.
---
Time to bring out the INVIS POTIONS!
---
(I'm not kidding, invis potion can really help to get to these dungeon locations or at least closer, or FAP so you are CC immune)
---
A layer is basically a sub-server of a server. So if you and your friend both logged into Herod, you might end up on Herod 1 while he goes to Herod 2. Grouping would move you to the same layer though.
---
It was Blizzards way to fight overcrowding while everyone was packed into the same zones, and no servers will have layers once Phase 2 starts.
---
they are only going to depreciate
---
If you play 3-4 hours per night? Sure.
---
If it's like 1 hour sessions including travel time to/from city and quest hub or dungeon?  Most signs point to no.
---
Trinny
---
I was actually trying to calculate this last week and I couldn't figuere anything valuable out. A 60 and a level 18 xp value was reduce by around 60%, but when I added more people to the group, we were receiving more experience than original for the same mobs. I tried to develop a formula, but everything I tried ended up being a dud.
---
&gt; You are making it sound like we can’t get expansions without making the same mistakes again.
---
People are complaining *about* expansions. Like, their very existence is a mistake to some people. You don't think there'll be a lot of people who don't think Blizzard will make mistakes *in* those expansions?
---
&gt; I think we can without screwing up what we love about Classic.
---
I think someone can. I don't work at Blizzard.  But people will still think there are mistakes no matter what they add. People will think adding an expansion was a mistake. 
---
What you love, what you consider to be screwed up isn't universally shared. Any significant change they make will generate outrage. And if they just keep adding expansions, there's really not a whole lot difference between Classic and Retail. People will just say different things were a mistake and different things "broke the game". Two sides of the same coin.
---
It kind of is if you are the type of player feeling rushed lmao
---
by design, casual players aren't competitive in that pvp system at all, so if you're the type of player that thinks 3 months is too fast then the phase 2 has little to nothing to add.
---
I don't think it will happen, but I think it's would be cool if it did.
---
Vanilla promised so much that they gave up on.  So much of the world was unfinished, hyjal, tol'barad, uldum, to name a few.
---
It would be interesting to see where that would go in vanilla.  
---
Also TBC introduced a lot of stuff I didn't like.  Though I think it did introduce a lot of stuff I did like.
---
All in all classic TBC would be safer.
---
I think the biggest thing though is that I have zero faith in current blizzard to do classic + properly.
---
Noticed :)
---
Yes, I can confirm i have anathema with SP, and will swap to benediction to heal.
---
What a bullshit argument, because there's literally no middle ground between Nov 12 and eternity.
---
You're shit at the game if you think you need to play wow for most of the day to get to 60 in one month.
---
“One death” omg you guys are trash, peace.
---
If it's gonna be trouble for level 48, how will the new players even play?
---
I wouldn't know. My guild raids but I don't have an epic mount yet, I help my guild members with random things, and plan to level an alt. So I think there is plenty to do outside of farming honor.
---
Hunters have a standard 12 second rotation that includes a multishot and two aimed shots. You can learn the muscle memory for this rotation and execute it without even having to look at your screen. Not using multishot is a massive loss in single target dps, and doubly so once you're wearing 8/8 T1.
---
Its actually one third of the day. All day everyday.
---
The bigger issue is the level 62 greens make Naxx mostly pointless.
---
because, spriests are best shadowyboys
---
Lol, you gave me a good laugh at work.
---
What about the guilds doing 30s boss fights, that a 2h night?
---
The original sentence you're referring to says **holy priest's shadow word pain**, aka no spell power stacking no talent. Which is still better than rupture.
---
So nothing you've said so far supports, "that isn't a good comparison."
---
bald undead for that xenomorph look
---
I do wut i like
---
The pvp system WITHOUT battlegrounds IS next to nothing. No rep factions to grind. Just meaningless honor points and if youre really dedicated maybe you'll get rank 3 or 4 by world pvping all day.
---
PvP system without BGs is just weird
---
What easy fixes are you talking about?  I made it clearly exactly what I wanted.  O I see, your name is argue with you.  Gotcha.
---
I don't mind them speeding up the pvp rollouts (honor, BGs), but I'll be really disappointed if the pve/raid release timeline is too fast.
---
Nah, TBC, although good, was the beginning of the end. Gear progression was completely obsoleted by 62 greens, flying mounts killed wpvp and organic player interaction, you had dailies, just tons of stupid shit that pushed the game towards what is now retail.
---
Agreed its been over 2 months
---
I'd say not using a guide and figuring it all out on your own is more hardcore haha. Assuming it also doesn't take 6 years.
---
He didn't say it would die  he just said it was at its best when we had the honor system and not bgs.  And he is correct.  That's where the infamous south shore raids originated.  It was a good place to farm honor because of the placement of the town's and graveyards.amd.whem.bgs came out the best place to fa.honor was in bgs.
---
You can 1v1 people even as resto.
---
You can even talk to guilds let them know you can go resto and scoop up enhancement gear as offspec, in preparation for phase 3 when they will need someone to hold nightfall and you can be it!
---
This tier, it's all about the chainheals from resto shamans unfortunately. Even next tier mana tide is REALLY important. (Fights get really REALLY long)
---
Where did you ever give an average? You gave the min and I gave the actual min and a guestimate of the max. How the fuck are you going to try and lecture me on "average" when that was never even brought up or discussed? If you think 60-70g is the average than you're insane. 
---
All of my sales have been people right by, besides guildies or friends who I have come there. If someone isn't nearby I vendor and move on. You brought min to the table and I brought max and now you're incredibly salty about it. Besides that you've already shown you fail at these runs so I assume you do lose money.
---
Anyways I have 1,600g in 2 weeks to show for it so if you don't believe it be my guest and keep being bad.
---
Just re-rolled on a new server like a week ago, thinking I'd have 4-6 more weeks to push myself.
---
...I just dinged 15 last night.
---
reaching endgame requires a pretty hardcore time investment.
---
Eh, no one engages if they don’t have the advantage in wpvp while leveling. I’ll just be waiting for someone to go to 50-75% health while fighting a mob to engage like everyone else lol.
---
They are in med school and dedicated 6+ days of WOW time in 2 1/2 months? Your friends are either:
---
1. Not in med school
---
2. Non-existent
---
&gt; Yeah, druids can do it. Their inability to become crush immune is compensated somewhat by armor and health. Paladins, unfortunately, don't have it as easy.
---
Sure, it's harder for paladins but over the years we've been able to quantify just how long it takes for paladin to come into play. Typically, we are talking about 1-2weeks. People are disregarding paladins because they cant tank immediately after a raid is released, its silly.
---
and burn the shitty SW auction house to the ground and give us a proper one.
---
Lvl 30 hillsbrad alliance rogue quest, gank horde pulling multiple mobs at hillsbrad farm for honor while giving none to the 60s that come to hunt you down.
---
Unless you talk with your raid leaders about hemo taking up a debuff slot you shouldn't raid with it
---
Raid leader is making us rush. Down to 1 hour 33min of MC content a week. We do 20-man Onyxias now, so thats like another 8min.
---
Arms Warriors don't have enough rage to even use Mortal Strike on cooldown (Alliance side). If you're at that point where you're using other attacks, then you're getting less uptime on Nightfall than a Ret Paladin, and you don't bring blessings or cleanse.
---
Ret Paladins are not really a thing but they have two valuable niches. One is Nightfall. Two is cleanse.
---
K
---
When did I say I was dissatisfied?  Nothing in my comment suggests that I am demanding the game cater to my schedule.  If anything, the crowd that is rushing to 60 is the one demanding things to do and that is how we got BfA, an endless buffet of options to gorge yourself on after blowing through content you care so little for, you need guides and addons to hold your hand the entire way.
---
I'm more than satisfied with the way the game has progressed and the speed at which the phases are rolling out.  The fact I have limited time doesn't bother me, like you are somehow assuming it does.  If I put raiding at 60 as a priority, I'd be doing that.  I am getting my money's worth and enjoying my time.
---
Who?
---
theyre called dungeons
---
Ready check before the last dog pack
---
This is hilarious. Some of us do things outside WoW when we aren’t working bro.
---
6 days played to hit 60 minimum. People have done it in less but it’s not common.
---
2 months + a week, 70 days.
---
6/70 = you have spent almost 1/12th of your life, 2 hours a day every day playing WoW.
---
Maybe that’s not no lifing it, but suggesting that those of us that play less are “trash” says a lot about how you view life... I don’t play every day, sometimes I log in for less than an hour. I’ve got other priorities and based on the responses I this thread so do many others. I don’t think we’re out of line saying this phase progression is quite fast.
---
Hey I'm still trying to get down Mara solo runs for my Blackstone ring, hitting the same trouble with getting halfway done then fucking up
---
Blizz fools is every day :(
---
That shadow damage makes my Warlock drool.
---
WoW Classic isn't vanilla.  The majority of players aren't wondering around aimlessly, they're maximizing their time getting pre-bis, clearing raids with half the people, and will be grinding honor in whatever is the most efficient new meta.  Nobody will do city raids when DKs are out. Period. Nobody will be looking for wpvp any more than they do now (which isn't much) when BGs are out.  Phase 2 honor without bgs is the only thing that will make wpvp actually relevant to most players.

You no lifers. Im still in character creation

Full clear since week 2 of Rag &amp; Ony.

So far we got 1 brutality blade. We have so many rogues...  
---
Got my deathbringer a few days ago though. That's awesome for me but globally our melee are starved of good weapons it's ridiculous.
---
the mistake they made was putting bwl and bg's into the same phase.
---
The answer is always mount first if you’re a miner...I can’t believe the number of broke people with lionheart helms crying about not finding rich thorium.
---
Same feeling here. I loved DKs when they rolled out and all the Lich King stuff in WotLK. I feel like it's a jab at nostalgia like that Legion expac was, though. I don't expect anything good.

---
More complex than spamming a frost bolt though?
---
LFD isn't content, it's a game mechanic.
---
Again, vanilla people need to STOP trying to shoehorn vanilla design philosophies into future expansions. Don't like flying mounts? Want to rank up in PvP by jumping around and not attacking the enemy? Want to clear the hardest PvE content in the game casting one spell? Then you are not prepared, and you should STAY in vanilla.
---
When does BRD loot tables change? With phase 2?
---
(Like HoJ going to Emperor, for example)
---
You know, I stayed away from it for my main to 60, but honestly I look up a lot of shit online anyway. Might as well have it right in the game. Plus finding quests is a fucking pain
---
Yes but also I've seen plenty of people on Grob with names like "Throbbingdong" and "drbillcosby" so it's definitely less well-regulated than people made it out to be.
---
Agreed. First, no ones paying 70g to buff their spell damage when there are 20 other dps in the raid. The only flask that can get sales is Titans for the tanks, and that's not that common anyways. Lotus is just too expensive.
---
&gt;Let me put it simply for you. She managed to break the dominion over her free will and escaped Arthas' subjugation. That ALONE is proof of her sheer power, arguing otherwise is fruitless. 
---
Look at any lore source and it'll tell you that happened because Ner'zhuls power was waning, not because Sylvanas herself was especially powerful. Her other banshees managed to break free at the same time, so are they also powerful enough to accomplish a feat thought impossible by the dude who cleansed the Ashbringer and shattered Frostmourne? Those banshees were killed by Kel'thuzad solo btw.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtdbm-i8PFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtdbm-i8PFk)  
---
\^literal cutscene from WC3 explaining Sylvanas didn't know why her will was her own again, because it had nothing to do with her, or her power. Arthas mentions "with my powers drained, I can barely command my own warriors" so it was not just Sylvanas and the Banshees. At the assasination, it's Kel'thuzad and his small band of minions vs. Sylvanas and her Banshee sister. Banshees are wiped out effortlessly and Sylvanas immediately runs. You're projection when you're calling his argumentation emotional in origin, buddy.
---
I mean if your playing that casually why does it matter too you? No offense every1 plays differently just curious
---
ye, it's less than a major mana potion (1350-2250mana)
---
same boat. ONWARD!
---
As a sixers fan and seeing this live. I appreciate this.
---
You didn't take the time to understand the context of what I meant by meaningless. You cant collect a meaningful amount of honor points and actually progress through the Honor system without BGs. So no, the points arent meaningless, but they're meaningless in the sense that you cannot reap the benefits or rewards of collecting them yet
---
This is actually really cool. Idk if I can do at a personal level when communicating with people but definitely can get into stuff like this.
---
No. I play on a PVE server because I know getting ganked on the way to a dungeon would annoy me.
---
All of the answers to this question have already had their prices inflate. You should probably worry about what items will go up in price for p3.
---
Ok so remove damage numbers and break damage meters then.
---
LMFAO this fuckin sub man
---
So phase 1 will be 77 days long. If you expect to get to 60 in 200 hours then you would need to play 2.6 hours per day to get 60 before phase 2. This feels like they are releasing phase 2 waaaayy too early.
---
TOO SOON, YOU HAVE RELEASED HONOR TOO SOON, BLIZZARD EXECUTIVES
---
If your FD is getting resisted that much you're doing it wrong which doesn't surprise me. Also lol at complaining about an extra 30 seconds added to a run.
---
That's fine, that transaction would fail on my end anyway.
---
At 25 days played you should both be A) less excited about a “50g” drop and B) know that almost no one is actually going to pay 50g for such a useless item.
---
If you can get 20g for it, I would consider that a great success.
---
I'll get around to getting the last of the flasks but it seems like for now only titans is worth bothering with.
---
You a rapper?
---
It's a mud is clearer than dirt situation.  The addition of water doesn't actually do anything to clear anything up.
---
Both are too biased without further conditions.(name tracking, multiple polls, etc).  Without the addition of those, high level characters count for more than one person and that throws off the %'s significantly.
---
Honestly a third of players being max level actually sounds too high compared to most successful MMOs.  There are significant factors contributing to that difference - namely, fewer newly starting players, a playerbase that leans to being more experienced, and a playerbase less interested in exploration/experimentation.
---
Focus on what's going to jump up in value during AQ phase. The prices started going up a few weeks ago
---
It is fair because everyone has had ample time to hit 60. If you're not 60 yet, that's on you.
---
"so far behind"

Here is a minor pro tip for you: buy as many small eggs as you can right now.  They are very cheap on the AH, like 1s-2s, and every player will need 5 of them for the christmas event quest.

If this video was called, "How to Mine Dark Iron Ore in BRD as Rogue Solo" I would have upvoted it. Instead it's some garbage clickbait title.
---
Ahh, the rare /r/classicwow /r/nba crossover episode.
---
yes even ''so far behind''
---
You could just make an autohotkey script to click it for you I guess.
---
could u tell me which ones to buy before they explode in price?
---
How'd you get to the Shadowlands?
---
90+% of grob players are not RPers. No one's forcing you to partake.
---
At 60 you gain honor from killing anyone lvl 48 or higher. 48+ zones will be a bloodbath while lower level zones should be more or less the same as now.
---
That sounds pretty fun, I might have to check that server out. Any tips for a first time on a RP server?
---
Same. when I moved out I didnt have internet for 2 years. most socially productive time of my life.
---
Yeahhh boi!
---
I need an adult.
---
Millions of players already waiting for BWL? Yeah, sure man.
---
Bruh, I only lvl my main with my fiance and we don't play every day at all as our work schedules don't sync up. We're lvl 55 on our mains. My dad, who only plays on the weekends and has multiple alts is lvl 56 on his main. This is also on a RP-PvP server so normal questing has always been interrupted by PvP skirmishes and running off for RP events. We're all super casual.  
---
If you're not close to 60 by now, you really weren't ever going to get there.
---
Zandalar have a good alli community.
---
Everyone is so efficient these days. Imagine a server where people cannot google WoW info and have to figure everything out for getting advantage
---
So at this pace, phase 6 by Christmas?
---
Ya, but I am the site IT.
---
Well sure, but considering one of them gets rooted with wing clip, you can infer you aren’t meant to run away from him.  Another enrages and wipes your slows, but does 1 damage while stung, why run from an enemy doing 1 damage a hit?
---
That’s impressive, I have 6.
---
RIP my level 53 druid.
---
I guess luck is relative and all but this makes me so mad lol. Got my hem from Wyrmthalak on like forth run but the others took me about 10-15 kills each. Not the most pleasant farm haha
---
Lmao you obviously have not fought really good rogues if you win every time. Even Xaryu loses to rogues in duels... and he is considered to be one of the best mages in the WORLD...
---
Hilarious downvotes
---
Meh it's not that bad but yeah it still sucks. If I try real hard I could hit 60 by next tuesday with fresh leveling greens lol. Its gonna be rough
---
Classic hard ;(
---
I think his point is that we're at 350+ dps now, without any gear past MC. We'll be 500+ by Naxx and it'll be pretty simple.
---
A lot of times people WANT to work overtime for the extra loot.
---
Sometimes they even ask for it. I've seen it in construction.
---
Jobs that don't pay overtime and require you to work more than 40 hours a week are exploitative, and that's what I get for being the office person and not a field person.
---
The leveling part of the game is going to grind to a halt. You know how people generally are nice to one another and let people quest? Say goodbye. Also, Flight Path's camped at every popular zone and death squads roaming. Some just for fun murdering lowbies and anyone who comes to defend them.
---
&gt; People will camp lower zones because of the easy kills.
---
And get minimal honor.
---
Lower level kill = lot less honor even if it is super easy. If you kill a max level player you get maximum honor, and that's your best chance of grinding your honor required per week to rank up.
---
This will be accomplished on an all-new, cutting edge phone app! Stand by for more details!
---
You must not know about R11-R14 grind or Naxx/AQ40.
---
I agree it is overrated and a lot can go wrong to fck over the entire run.
---
Joining ‘Saving Princess’ runs, compared to trying to create a quest run was infinitely easier. People see ‘Quest run’ and seem to think “I get nothing out of this”
---
It's not pandering to anybody though, most people don't really remember vanilla before the honor system and dire maul because they were released very early in the life cycle of the game and not many were level 60 or even close to it yet. They aren't part of the 'progression' of vanilla like the raid releases are.
---
How do I PVP against Priests (as a ret Paladin)?
---
Is there any Youtube Channel for this stuff?
---
Good. That way we can move on to classic + sooner. Most guilds have mc on farm, there’s nothing to do except farm shit right now. Honestly this game’s content is far too easy atm. Bring the “harder” shit.
---
You have the gayest looking character I’ve ever seen
---
What's your /played
---
On his own? He had an elite dragon npc helping him.
---
&gt;I'm only level 25! 
---
&gt; I am the REAL player base
---
Lmao
---
Stealth helps a lot for most dungeon locations, and I happen to play a druid on Stalagg. Invisibility seems to be a safer, if more costly option due to only warlocks/hunters being able to detect invisible units.  If I can't stealth, most parties just leave me alone if I bear form and just sit down/walk through their CC because it takes them at least 30 seconds to kill me because I have 6k hp, over 10,000 armor, and 2k instant heal.  However, I just find it a huge waste of time/gold to use consumables when I'm just trying to help a guild member farm HOJ or picking up a few pre-bis.  Should I assume that I'll be ganked constantly while trying to dungeon farm once Phase 2 starts?  I so far have enjoyed classic's social aspect such as cooperating with randos and guild members on farming pre-bis, raiding, and other pve experiences.  The PVP portion has been okay since helps add some irregularity when farming dungeons, but isn't a constant annoyance because most groups are more focused on getting pre-bis gear.  With the honor system and no battlegrounds, players are incentivized to camp dungeon entrances because there will always be a consistent stream of people trying to gear up.  Already on raid days, BRM is inaccessible without multiple ghost walks because people are just AOEing the shit out of the entrance and the honor system isn't even in place.
---
You can maybe find a guild that is not serious about raiding. But they will likely for one not clear a lot of the raid and also rely a lot on pugs.
---
Aside from this, you can possibly find a guild that allows you to go to Enh. Specc once Phase 3 hits, because Enh. is actually important P3+. But only one single Enh. Shaman per raid. Many guilds also already have deals about this. Our Enh. Shaman for P3+ was already put in stone 6 months before classic released.
---
In short this is how I hear it.
---
* If I want to tank a dungeon on my time, I don't reserve anything.
---
* If someone wants me to waste my time to tank for them, I will reserve something.
---
* I don't care about DPS since I can replace you at will.
---
To me it sounds like you're acting entitled. (Holier than thou sounding).  Here are some counter argument points.
---
* You can replace DPS if they want to come with you. If you can't find a DPS, you can't do the dungeon (same logic applies to healers). 
---
* You develop a reputation on the server based on how you treat people.  Treat enough people like crap and you'll have a hard time doing "X". Mostly involves groups for dungeons or trade interactions.
---
There's minimal content being added. It's fine for the minor in-between content upgrades to come out after 3 months, as raid tiers are going to be much longer (probably 4-6 months at a minimum, with AQ being longer)
---
Yeah, and I get it, I just wonder how good the money really is.
---
Im not even level 40 yet, im so fucking fucked fuck
---
They are private server guys though.
---
Is your shaman switching to Agi totem instead of windfury for execution phase? There is apparently bug with rage generated by WF once said rage is used for Execute attacks
---
Seems like many of the people posting here have had a way different experience than I had tanking in classic . Everyone has been really nice and it’s been a lot of fun running with even PUG groups . People seem to be just happy to have a group together than having everything go totally perfect .
---
Hash the numbers out on a dps spreadsheet like bloodmoon and you will see its still better.
---
Ehhh we can still build rage for free off of him CHOMP
---
How to burn yourself out and have no fun leveling lol
---
I'm afraid we'll have people that would help alts and refresh those that leave halted on their leveling or leave the game if it's as bad as predicted on pvp servers. With the faction imbalance and general disparity between those with all the time and those without or those that started late, had life events ect. 
---
If they really cant accomplish anything they'll most like bail. It's in part why I think p3 will come sooner. Not to mention the performance issues occurring along with major bugs like FD that they can't figure out or fix. 
---
We dont know the pop
---
Noice.  I will do that thank you

---
Phase 2 - World bosses, and pvp ranks.
---
&lt;-- My guilds Shaman leader.
---
Improved windfury adds a total of about 6-15dps to the raid. It is not even worth skilling into it if you go full enh.
---
The point is to not make the game only for people that don't have lives. If you lose the casuals, wtf are you gonna be doing while playing classic? Who are you gonna world PvP with and against? BGs?
---
If you think we should get Naxx before 2028 you're not a REAL classic player. REAL classic players spend atleast 10 hours a week jumping around the bank in org.
---
Why do hunters no longer name their pets ? I'm sure there is a handful of reasons but cab anyone tell me as a hunter player why you wouldn't rename yours ?
---
This is rushed.......  Sub numbers/playtime must be dropping.  Not good.
---
The worry is that you will get murdered endlessly for wpvp
---
These can be fished from blue spots on water during rain, mouse over the spot to check what fish is there
---
GL farming these in p2 :)
---
If you aren't 60 by now, you are a fucking idiot and should uninstall the game. And if you have only 10 seconds a week to play WoW classic, dont fucking play it and go play call of duty or something else that does not require you to level to 60 so you can enjoy its content. Nobody fucking forces you to play. GJ Blizzard, looking forward to Phase 2.
---
&gt; This is ridiculously soon even for hardcore players wtf.
---
This isn't adding that much, pvp system that hardcore players have been planning for, for a while. As well as world bosses, once again has been preparing for.
---
I am going to be spending my next few days preparing the warlock alts to help mass summon raid team to world boss locations to contest them.

As a nightelf priest, how long does it take in /played to go from 1-60?
---
Phase 5 (AQ) is going to be one of the longest phases.
---
Phase 3 should be a long phase as well, as there's a ton of things being added, and phase 4 isn't adding much. (ZG not being that impactful, with the dragons being much more so)
---
Millennials are pushing 40.
---
So these are hotspots for guilds I take it? Are there actual planned events to raid the enemy faction in the same zone or like what I mean I think I understand but I’m real curious, 
---
I’m a heavy pvp player. This looks right up my ally, but I’m not an rp player. I think I could be one, but again not heavily. This just looks incredibly more interesting than a regular pvp server where people just bitch about being ganked. 
---
I love how the players create their own content like this though holy shit, I wanna see some videos or something about this.
---
It's easier, much easier to add in breaks and moderate TV watching than with games such as WoW. I doubt you hear about people losing jobs just to watch TV. People lose jobs playing WoW, even breaking relationships.
---
My only question is wouldn’t the heal value be more important to see on the character frame I mean when I used to heal I spent more time looking at health bars than my party members physical toon.
---
How many people are going to be able to put that time in? What happens if they alienate everyone else? This is classic, not retail, the whole point was the balance between casual and hardcore. If you lose the casual, might as well just turn this into retail 2.0
---
Even though this is an obvious joke tbh I'd prefer slightly slower releases.  I'm 60 I've got some raid gear but pushing stuff quick feels like they're trying to preserve rapidly dwindling numbers.
---
There’s no buffs in retail either though. He just sounds like a dumb asshole lol.
---
6 months per non-raid phases? Wow people would be quitting and going back to private servers for 4+ months.
---
This phase alone was mostly getting to 60, and MC is really REALLY boring.
---
BWL is probably going to last a bit longer, but the in-between is fine being 3 months or less.
---
Hello , 
---
I would like to start the Timbermaw Hold Reputation grind . Which are should I farm it in ? Winterspring or Felwood ? 
---
Is there any difference ? 
---
It's a risk vs reward decision.  Which means that if I can kill 10 lower players faster than I can kill 1 higher level player and get similar or more honor, which do you think I'll be doing?
---
This isn't an one sided endeavor.  If you are hunting other 60s, you are also being hunted.  If you are after 48s and 50s, you'll be the sole hunter for a long while before 60s come in to chase you, if they bother.
---
Thus, if you can't farm 60s or high level players, you'll farm what you can.
---

I'm not sure why you would think the classic crowd is less elitist, I would actually think more.
---
Can someone ELI5
---
Just admit you no lifed the game its not a big deal. Its a fun game. But it is what it is. I've definitely played too much lol.
---
When are the BGs rolling out?
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
Mining and herb nodes are different , I don't think (and I hope) they  would change something so fundamental it'd be like making arcane crystals drop at double drop rate
---
If i cant reasonably put in a couple of hours straight, I wont even log on most days. Keeping a strict schedule sucks sometimes lol
---
God help the people who are in your guild
---
Am I missing something?  Why oily blackmouths?
---
I wasn’t aware of this bug. We do have one enhancement sham we bring for totem twisting but I’m not always in his group.
---
Is there somewhere I can read more about the bug you mentioned? Seems janky that rage generated a specific way isn’t being calculated into execute damage?
---
As someone who has a level 35 rogue and a 36 warrior .. I for one, am shocked. Shocked I say... And a little scared.
---
"Haha, this is fine." ._.
---
This is awesome
---
Hey same server same faction as me. Kinda cool. See you in azeroth my dude!
---
That's why there is loot and there is prime loot. Prime loot is stuff like Onslaught, Accuria, BRE, Spinal Reaper ToEP etc..
---
The chances are miniscule that 10 warriors already have BRE, therefore the newcomer will have to raid for couple weeks or months to be eligible to roll on such rare items.
---
I will see that its better if youre full world buffed because of crit cap.
---
Crystal, heroine, Classic.  All the same.
---
Dad?
---
what? killing lowbies and NPCs that don't give xp reduce your honor, don't think we'll see  too much griefing against noobs if people care about their honor rating
---
"This is just a stunt that literally anyone could do, given the money and time." applies to SO many popular things. Doesn't change the fact that its interesting to watch and experience without having to spend all that money yourself. Grab the stick out of your ass, looks like its up there pretty deep
---
You can barter that you can also roll for your offspecc. Or that you become Enh. in P3. You can also just switch to Resto during raid night and then switch to Enh. again. You just need to farm 100 gold more per week. 
---
Enh. is btw extremely stupid to play in raids. Your shocks? You won't use them. Fireshock adds a debuff as does Frostshock (though it might be viable on bosses). Your ability at the end of Enh. Tree (Elemental Strike or something like that), you won't be using this either. It adds a debuff slot and this is a Nono. Literally all you do is autoattack and maybe switch between WF and Grace of Air in a 10 second tact to double buff the tank group.
---
I'm leveling warrior rn I'm at 53 I dont feel slow at all.
---
ofc playtime is dropping if there's only 2 hours of endgame content at the moment
---
again, either you can't read, or you're intentionally misrepresenting what he said. he said he didn't realize starting a month late would put him "so far behind" because he likely didn't expect the content to be released at the pace blizzard is setting. you reply and ask him "hurdur how do you not realize starting later will put you behind". ofc he realizes starting later will mean he's behind, that's basic logic. the key words here are "so far". which is why my first assumption was that you lack the ability to read.
---
You subscribed already?
---
Jeez... Get a life.
---
Honor without not even 1 BG is truly the dumbest decision, I get they want to kill classic but why make it so obvious. Server imbalances will just become way worse now because of no way to farm honor except in open world. 60-70/40-30 servers basically going to be hell for the faction with less players since every single tryhard PvPer has no option but OWPvP until BGs come out.
---
I started quite recently and will be nowhere near 60 when P2 hits, but at least I have a bit over 10 stacks of Blackmouths
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/di3z1p/careful_not_a_meme_how_classic_changed_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I have found it in that post. Its surprisingly batching issue 😂
---
I'm somewhat with the no changes people but also think it's silly that they are against QoL changes that don't alter the core gameplay. But I also think it is silly that a lot of people are begging for content a few months after release. That being said, I think it wouldn't hurt the classic progression to release BGs at the same time as the honor system. It would also give a lot of these geared 60s a place to play, rather than the gankfest it is about to become
---
I don't think you are, but If you are spamming ''lfg'' and wondering why no one wants to make your group for you, then yes you need to stop immediately.  I've seen healers, dps, etc, all do this for literally days and wonder why they haven't gotten a group yet and ended up on a lot of peoples ignore lists. 
---
You seem to be just fishing for people looking for healers, which is fine if thats what you want to do, but seems really inefficient  
---
As one healer to another, just type ''lfm'' and your world will change drastically
---
He’s talking about ganking
---
According to what timeline?
---
Ganking is the new shitposting
---
For unforgiven, tank for the free orb out of live strat and you can just grab the head gear when nobody else wants it.
---
For dead strat, tell them you're rolling on the cloak and if they don't like it, they can find another group.
---
Totally agree on this.  I know it was not in vanilla but no reason not to enable this an interface option since it almost certainly present in the current client.
---
Addons are not the same.
---
Reagent for Free Action Pots. A very useful consumable for pvp
---
4 of the fishes and one Stranglekelp is used to make Free Action Potions, which are nice to have in PvP
---
He's right that your statistics are completely useless.
---
If every 60 had 1 alt, then automatically 50% of the server is 60 but in reality you can't distinguish by account, in reality 100% of the players have a 60.
---
Cey about it being early elsewhere. MMOs are not the genre of game for giga casuals who can only spare 5 hours a week.
---
lol.

Please no.

If we go TBC onward. I will play TBC but I will never raid.
---
I wont bother raiding in vanilla either. It's all getting replaced so who cares?
---
I enjoy "finishing" a game. It's an MMO so it never really ends;but expansions just lengthen the story and make all end game content you did worthless.
---
It's a game so it's time wasted but c'mon. I dont like feeling like all those hours are now worthless.
---
TBC is fantastic. And I will quit when its announced.
---
I dont want to go down the same rabbit hole as last time. Let's change things this time around...

And a 3rd blue form Kromkrush is what Op is missing.

Sounds like a super made up story tbh.  Why would you tell a story instead of taking a picture with your phone like everyone else who thinks something hilarious has happened and must be posted on reddit.
---
Is elemental more viable ? I have no problem with that but healing seem really boring
---
phase 3
---
I'm at 36 days /played since classic release...
---
I really hope they dont do that. Honor days before bgs are a one time thing. Better to have the full duration and then we have the rest of classic wow to do wsg
---
Love this
---
Ah I see. Sounds like WF is still potentially higher DPS, from the white swings alone, but the extra rage is getting dumped into the previous execute. Not sure how much of a difference you’d see during execute phase with GoA, particularly if you’re already blowing Reck during execute phase.
---
&gt;Wpvp didn't die until flying mounts. BGs had nothing to do with it.
---
You're seriously say this *as* we're watching server faction populations become ever more one sided?

I'm never afraid when I see a pally, I cant wait to fuck their day up

Rookie Question:  Why is everyone talking about mining/engineering in the face of upcoming pvp?
---
Cool thanks for explaining it!
---
Bwl will be more than enough challenge for a bit.
---
Yes.  November 2019 and 2023 are the only two options.
---
You're not providing any advice, you're just yelling at people.
---
My first MMO. It was ahead of it's time!
---
Wild how salty everyone is about this, was pretty cool to see. Quite honestly anyone expecting a level 1 rogue to kill hogger without buffs is an idiot. And even with buffs it's not easy mode! I guess any accomplishment in the game where in-game buffs were used shouldn't be considered an accomplishment lol
---
They actually initially said that it was for the first few weeks.
---
Quality shitpost
---
Ive had a lot of really over the top interactions. People seem super emotional and unable to not take things to 100 over small things. For instance I mentioned hitcap for rogue being 9% so maybe dont stress so much over getting the entire BiS list that it all isn’t necessary and people lost their minds tons in my guid are /ignoring me.
---
Noice, I kind of regret not doing this now haha. All of the gold I’ve made from AH sniping is just sitting there. Any idea on good things to invest in for upcoming phases?
---
I hate high level bluenames
---
Thanks for the reply! I think I might go for warrior as I’ll have fun on my hunter in PvP anyway. I couldn’t play mage, their play style is just far too boring for me, so warrior it is!
---
Only killing NPCs will reduce honor. Ganking lowbies does nothing.
---
You're fooling yourself if you think you're going to be able to do anything just because you're not worth honor to level 60s.
---
The zombies run towards the boss if you activate it (by running in the boss "room" and back out") without killing the boss.
---
What is your /played? Has to be at least what.. 7 days? That’s over 2 hours a day if you played since launch. Not really casual IMO.
---
Just saying right, as a tank main, leveling prot. I'm totally ok right? 
---
Yeah, no one gonna camp me.
---
This looks like a double down brag but I think you may just be saying you gave 6 gold.
---
I wanted to try out PvP this time around and so I leveled up to like 44 on a PvP server.  I recently started over on a pve because my experience was almost exclusively level 60's corpse camping me and only once did I have an actual fight with someone around my level, but even then me and a guy i was questing with were jumped 4v2 and we managed to kill them.  Then they came back with like 10 guys and a level 60.  Point is its really frustrating and PvP players (in my experience) have a very spiteful? Outlook on the game.
---
Isn’t this kind of a shit post tho?
---
I've seen this post a couple times now... You guys are reporting the scammers right? If there's a chat log showing you agreed to X and they didn't honor it and tried to scam you, I'm pretty sure that's against the ToS and they can be suspended/banned for it.
---
In all honesty, I would've had a better social life and accomplished more in life. I started at young and got super addicted, I don't regret it, but at the same time, do?
---
Maybe the majority of players on this subreddit but I think you underestimate the amount of casual players out there not min maxing

i agree on that. wasn't trying to say his expectations were necessarily realistic. just felt your original reply was misrepresenting what he said.

---
Yeah, my guild we had it done in 2 hours and 1 minute last week. Onyxia is about 10 minutes or so from start to finish. I get on for raids mostly at the moment.
---
If that was true, and someone like me who invests 120 hours in 2 months is not enough to play, classic would die within the next 6 months because of it. 
---
There's already retail for that mentality, what would be the point of classic otherwise.
---
If you’re just now thinking it’s time to invest in something, you’re way behind. Right now is the time to sell overvalued items and buy them again in a week when they correct.

Same bro. I don't remember any time in my life that I didn't spend gaming. Its all I do at this point
---
Oh gotcha, that makes sense. I’ve been playing this game for so long, and I still know so little.
---
But why, even if the goal is to milk money wouldn't they be interested in prolonging the phases.
---
I just started playing for the first time this is kinda depressing lol
---
Killing lowbies doesn't affect your honour. Only killing civilians does.
---
No other banshee ever comes close to this supposed power Sylvanas has, and she still died from a severe case of bullet to the face.

Her power spike is a complete asspull derived from a cut storyline in Legion and the "behind the curtains" bullshit from BFA. It makes no fucking sense.

---
For Union guys? the pay is real good. For non union guys, its a toss up.
---
Ah shit, I won't make it to 60 so quickly... was fun while it lasted, I guess! :D
---
It is possible. You should get there in 3-5 days. The more you play, the faster you’ll get there.
---
The most efficient way would be to get a leveling guide. Google one and buy it if you need to.
---
&gt; Phase 2 in 1 1/2 weeks is really great though!
---
It really isn't.  Without a bundled BG the honor system being released by itself is going to be the death of 99% of PvP servers.
---
I have no idea but hopefully there will be people gathering in southshore and tm to grind against each other (or other areas). I think city raiding will be more likely but the downside to thst is the dishonorable kills.

Idk, I'm kind of excited to experience the world with World PVP as the only option to farm honor. It's going to be a bloodbath out there.
---
alot of slackers/noobs/ppl who started late thats leveling now, did the same from u swapping from a low server to a higher pop and its a noticeable different between players leveling now and then.
---
My real vanilla experience was 20 Horde 60's on a roof in Darkshire murdering everything in sight while I coward behind a table in the inn
---
I have, they ban people who teach dumb people lessons too.
---
5-6 hours a day it is extremely possible, install Questie or WoWPro, grind dungeons, or just farm.
---
You have plenty of time, just be intentional, plan what you are going to be doing ahead of time, so you aren't being inefficient traveling all over or jumping around Orgrimmar.
---
This. If they want to slow down after phase 3, I don't care, but a lot of us really want BGs.
---
All this and no alliance to fight
---
You played yourself
---
What no flasks? 
---
What a goober.
---
On a serious note, dang son.
---
If I had to guess, they'll likely drop one or two BGs early, much like how they dropped Dire Maul early.
---
I wish people would drop this BiS mindset, its pure cancer. You have to gear an entire raid group not just one elitist dude.
---
Say your raid has 2 dagger rogues, 3 sword rogues and 5 fury warriors. You really honestly think those 2 rogues should have to roll against 5 other people when in this phase there are only 3 possible upgrades for them, whilst the fury warrior can take any one of 10 drops as an upgrade?! (excluding vendor trash)
---
No it didn't.
---
I am an adult
---
I mean, if you're pissed that your progression is going to be hampered because people are going to kill you for honor, why did you roll on a PvP server? That's always what it was going to turn into, if you weren't going to have time to hit the cap in the two months you were given, you prolly should have rolled on a PvE realm.
---
This phase honestly should have come out sooner. It only really offers content for the absolute most hardcore players. Honor grind is gonna be whatever for the vast majority of players, most people won't ever even see a world boss. We'll have waited two and a half months for content most people won't even interact with, and then we'll have to wait another two and a half months or more to actually get Battlegrounds and BWL. In terms of timelines, that seems find to me, as people will have about 5-6 months to hit 60, do a bit of MC/Ony in preparation, and then go into BWL. If you're not able to hit 60 in 6 months, you're probably not able to raid either.
---
PvE servers exist.
---
Agreed, I honestly was hoping for PvP to be like in another couple of weeks to finish setting up a couple of things. I'd accept them releasing BG's in like 2monthsish and then delaying bwl a bit more if anything, like to make it in 5months instead of 4 or w.e
---
&gt; Which means that if I can kill 10 lower players faster than I can kill 1 higher level player and get similar or more honor, which do you think I'll be doing?
---
Anyone serious about the grind, are going to be hunting max level targets en mass. My squad is preparing for BRM hunting entire RAID TEAMS. (Yes larger risk, but the payoff is MASSIVE even if we are overrun)
---
Also hunting 48-59 targets, they are much more spread out in leveling zones, thus slowing down your honor gains/hr.
---
Also you can only kill someone 3 times before you get 0 honor from them for that day. And camping low level zones you will run out of honorable targets rather fast.
---
Incendius is actually pretty even as far as populations go. And there are a few pretty solid alliance guilds there as well. I think phase 2 will be a blast.
---
Stop it, this is how we get retail!
---
Play. If you don’t have a farming group just quest until you’re blue in the face imo. There are questing guides, but really killing stuff at your level or one above would be ideal. 
---
Dungeons will likely be a hindrance unless you can get some run throughs. 
---
They say 45 is half way to 60. From now till the 12th at 6 hours a day you have roughly 3 days of played time. I’m going to say it’s unlikely.
---
Raid pvp! 40ppl invading Thorium Point/Grom Gol/Blackrock/Scholomance/StrathUD entrnace Will be a salughter house
---
&gt;Despite what everyone says, he is not going to get banned.
---
Intentionally scamming players is against the TOS. They absolutely will do something.
---
Not saying he didn't play a ton the first week it released but he averages 12 hours a week.
---
Child's play compared to some of the stuff in MMOs that predated WoW lol.
---
Agreed, it’s an engagement/subscription trend that’s driving this.
---
&gt; Should I assume that I'll be ganked constantly while trying to dungeon farm once Phase 2 starts?
---
Started a week ago on my server, there would be groups just camping the tunnel leading to BRD, would take multiple attempts to get to the portal. Expect this to be MUCH harder once phase 2 and people will be doing it not just for "lawls" and are farming it for honor.
---
I am just hoping this means Blizzard will be splitting battlegrounds off of phase 3, and call it "phase 2.5". (As they did with Dire Maul)
---
It is far more dependent on the player than the race/class. It could take anywhere from 6-12 days playtime. Most people consider levels 43/44 the halfway point to 60 in terms of playtime. The quarterway point is probably in the low 30's. If you can reach that level, you can extrapolate.
---
Locks generally want the ZG Tailoring set, for the hit, and to get the set bonus crit, you need to have 300 tailoring.
---
So it depends if you want to level tailoring to 300 again when ZG drops.
---
Well shit. I was just talking last night with the guild about how I hate doing dungeons and would rather just not play than dungeon grind. I'll wait and see how things look when this rolls out, but there's a good chance this will be the deal breaker for me.
---
&gt;ke they subtract more from certain viewing angles than they ad
---
oh i'll have a think about it,
---
Horde in Lakeshire?  Magistrate Solomon has security here well under control here.
---
Theres written step-by-step free speed-level guides with a quick google search my brother. Combine this with the addon 'Questie' and you'll notice how fast you level up if u just did questzones&amp;dungeons before
---
It will hurt the game for many servers, yeah.
---
Blizzard should release content based how how each server has progressed instead of blanket pushing everyone forward.
---
Some servers are absolutely ready for this, maybe even last for them.  But not mine . ...
---
On the other hand, why would people who weren't looking forward or at least accepting this roll on PvP servers?
---
Vanilla didn't have a million level 60s ready to murder everyone 24/7 when honor came out. This will be nothing like it.
---
All these flavors and you chose [Deeprock Salt]
---
They are enforcing the blue post on terrain exploiting from all the way back in 2005, pretty sure they will enforce one as recent as 2010.
---
I've been on grobb and the only time RP happens is random interactions at Zeppelin's and other times of down time or randomly in the world. Unless your looking for a RP interaction you don't have to worry about it
---
I can't believe how big of a game changing experience it was to learn WW, I didn't think much of it since it was basically a normal attack but it made playing a Warrior feel *so* much better have spamming Sunder to fish for Overpower procs.
---
&gt;but I hope there's been some foresight put into this because I don't predict it goes over well.
---
There hasn't been, and your prediction is spot-on.  A standalone honor system is going to be the death of the vast majority of PvP servers.  At best Blizzard sees players bleeding out in the first couple weeks and does an emergency patch to release a BG, but even that's probably going to be too late.  Worst-case scenario they let the entire phase play out and all but a couple of the actually balanced PvP servers are going to be 95/5 splits by the time phase 3 is out.
---
They rushed out DM earlier than they said they would (in a vacuum not a big deal, but sets a precedent), and now phase 2 is coming 70 days after launch. 
---
Phase 2 is going to be the *worst* phase with the most people quitting. PvE servers won’t have BGs, and everyone who isn’t 60 on a PvP server will be getting farmed mercilessly. 
---
Phase 3 will be out before February, and my hot take is it will be out first week of January.
---
Yes and no. Retail is for those that only have 4 hours to play a week and want to still be involved in everything. 
---
Classic is for those who want to play the original hard game that took time and effort to succeed in. Yet it’s not a new game with new information. We already know all the content and strategies so we’re ‘progressing’ at an unnatural rate. 
---
However, further raids will have hard requirements like all Ony cloaks and dps checks that will Not be able to be fast tracked and will slow us down. So there will come a natural slowdown of those of us that have been burning through content. We don’t need 8 months per phase because the no-timers can’t level fast enough to play catch up.
---
Not sure how you managed that. the faerlina scan in my pic took about 20 min. It would be a lot shorter if they ever change the addon to not do all the "41-50" then "45-50" etc failed scans since on most server you will always get &gt;50 if trying to scan 2+ levels at once.
---
One thing I am hoping blizzard does, is split BG's off of the BWL phase, and call it "2.5" as they did with dire maul. (Since we're already living it, as phase 1.5)
---
Hoping that them giving us such short notice is because of blizzcon hype, and helping to pull more numbers in, and going forward they give us much more time to prepare. (Like 3 weeks to a month)
---
I dont get it. could someone explain?
---
Damn spriests getting all the hate today :-(
---
Probably will, hopefully before too much damage is done. I'm just really disappointed to not see 1 BG pushed into phase 2. It makes no sense, servers have way more players than they did in Vanilla. If you are level 40+ as the less represented faction on a server you are literally not going to be able to level from now until BGs come out.
---
I dont know what im looking at
---
Rend buff as well if you can time it right with a mind control
---
lol the terrain exploiting post is from 2005 and they're still enforcing that one.
---
&gt; If you actually want to do the math instead of being an asshat
---
I DO want to do the math, thanks for handing me the tools. Your own figures:
---
1600 - 900 = 700.
---
700/120 = ~6.
---
You did 6 hours of DM for a total of 12-18 runs, let's go with 15 runs since you say you fit in at least 2 runs and 'sell all the time'.
---
&gt; Average means jack shit if you're going by hours. 
---
&gt; Are you seriously telling me to calculate an average in an rng game?
---
Discussion over man, I think this should be your top comment, alongside the fact that you did 12 runs.
---
Now go tell people you earned 1600g in 15 runs. Also, 15 runs is what I do in **one** day of DM. I know this because I bring only 3-4 stacks of invis pots each time. I love doing the runs too, it's a break from the AH. But you need to brush up on statistical averages, the meaning of RNG which **demands** we try to give averages, and you need to tell people you've done 15 runs so they can take all your words with a huge pinch of salt.
---
Just finished crafting some pots, back to the grind. Peace, mate.
---
30 mages 10 healers sounds like a plan
---
Sunder Armor is lvl 10 (warrior quest for defensive stance) and Overpower is lvl 12.
---
People never got to experience Southshore vs Tarren Mill, the epicness of massive world PvP.
---
Soon as bg's launch the world pvp DIES. People spend the majority of their time after BG launch in queue, in bg's or raiding.
---
Would love me some BG's in between the raidlogging
---
Not sure what people are complaining about...those lip gnome dickwads are still gonna gank lowbies regardless of whether or not it rewards them with anything.
---
100000% agree. Considering in actual vanilla we only had pure ranking world PvP for like 2months ish last I checked?
---
BGs will literally make no difference here people already sit around ganking people just for fun. Even with BGs there will still be a large player base that would rather get honor through ganking people because unfair fights are easy to win then coming up against an evenly matched player. The majority of the circle jerk gank parties probably won’t even do BGs when they come out since it would take skill.
---
Thank god im not playing with you
---
sure you will, it will just take 8-12 corpse runs :)
---
Kill mobs, then kill more mobs, then kill mobs some more.  Minimize your out of combat time as much as possible.
---
I feel like BWL is going to be when they slow their roll a bit. Having three raids to get gear from, and BWL is going to be the first real wall in the game
---
I actually am following allyroute but it seems to me that it is dragging on
---
How much of that has to do with the proc though?  As a Lv58 epic it gets an automatic DPS advantage over any non-raid item.
---
No server is ready for OWPvP only honor system. There's too many players and people are too tryhard. If you're not 60 on a server with a horde/ally imbalance(so all of them) goodluck finishing a single quest from Nov 12th until the day BGs come out.
---
Can recommend bloodfang, high pop but no queue, basically 50-50 faction balance.
---
"I flew an airplane around the world 5 times without landning" Would be the appropiate titel then. And it would still be stupid xD
---
After BGs are introduced, the madness will go away. Anyone serious about the honor grind will be spending time in premades rolling pugs.
---
People 100% won't share their good investments, otherwise they wouldn't be good investments
---
I'm too busy protecting healers and other ranged DPS for that.
---
What should the cutoff for an honorable kill for level 60 be in your opinion?
---
But bloodvine set is BoE so cant I just have my guild tailor make the set for me?
---
It's just elv ui
---
I guess I'm glad I've been on a fishing kick-- but now all the nodes are gonna be swamped.
---
Too late
---
Optimizing categories that no one else cares about is a speedrunning tradition!
---
That's your fault for rushing the game and not trying to explore the true vanilla spirit. Let me guess- you rushed 60 in 5-6 days playtime and went straight into hardcore dungeon/raid runs.
---
I have a playtime similar to yours and I'm still only level 55. I've probably died in excess of 200 times (even as a hunter with feign death, as any other class it would probably be double that).
---
Ah...good to hear this. Lots of salty people from Grob went there expecting it to be some "grass is greener" type situation. Nice to see they either regret their decision or re-rolled lol
---
no, no lifer status is getting to 60 on day ten of the release (me)
---
Isn’t bloodvine set BoE so cant I have a guildie make me the set?
---
Cries in hunter
---
Yes but we were discussing dps here with spirit, not tanking or healing.
---
"It looks more like a duck. They should call it duck Island."
---
Decent? its a full server you know that right?
---
The Alliance they're trying to kill aren't flagged for PVP so all their attacks aren't doing anything to any of the Alliance players
---
For the people on the PvE servers and the dungeon dwellers, its going to be next to nothing. For everyone else, it's the main incentive.
---
Yeah, but what *else* are you going to do?  MC/Ony take a couple hours *at best*, there's really no PvP incentives.  You can farm gold but there's so few gold sinks that what are you really going to do with it all?
---
Farming BIS dungeon gear is really the only thing left to do.
---
It's all about the choices we made for PVP vs. PVE
---
It's going to be a bloodbath trying to get into Blackrock Mountain - that's for sure.
---
to make an echo chamber of feelgoodery to offset the baddie feelings
---
Queues?
---
This is just you having a greedy bis mindset as a rogue.
---
Why should 2 rogues have 0 competition over the most competitive items in the game, melee weapons, especially when swords are better for them?
---
Why should warriors have to fight over the remaining sub par weapons that rogues also roll on while rogues get certain weapons all to themselves?
---
Rogues already get a full set of tier gear to themselves, they also want the weapons  to themselves.
---
A dagger rogue is just a rogue in pvp spec trying to snag prio on pvp gear. Swords are pve weaps for rogues. Daggers are pve weapons for tanks.
---
Daggers should be treated like pvp weaps for rogues, given to them after the main tank gets his  BiS pve weapon that benefots whole raid from threat.
---
2 dagger rogues can deal with one more person competing on loot with them. Furys deal with half the raid competing for their loot.
---
Reflectors too
---
$60 patch for OW
---
The Diablo game that everyone saw coming yet still looks disappointing 
---
Hearthstone is still crap
---
New Retail XPac looks insanely disappointing and seems to be trying to capitalize solely on nostalgia for when retail wasn't garbage yet fails at it. 
---
It's genuinely sad when the most exciting potential things out of this BlizzCon is games that are about 10+ years old getting relaunched or remastered. And the Schadenfreude that's sure to come with any kind of QA and the inevitable shit storm that will follow it
---
yyyes, and they put on that as intended.
---
i don't get exactly what you mean, but if i remember correctly the server technology is a modern one that they have porpusefully botched to emulate older connection.
---
i said it's cherrypicking because not everything is the same, and it is for specific reasons. some things are a reaosnable compromise and some others are intended effects.
---
60
---
Just by the amount of opinions on this topic Blizzard should look into Classic+ on a serious level... I for one and many on my friends will stop playing after the next couple of phases. I am just hanging around for the honor system myself. But! if the tweak Classic and complete unfinished or unreleased content that was meant for classic I would stay and explore... which is a double edge sword for me because I am investing to much time in to this game already.
---
Where the squids at? :(
---
Lol as if Blizz reads this sub
---
is honor such a big incentive that people don't even kill the opposing faction unless they are rewarded for it? 
---
Here I thought people like wpvp because it's fun. Getting honor is not going to encourage me to attack horde more than I already do. Why is this so world changing for people?
---
lol id argue the majority of people who play on grob don't and will never RP. as long as you aren't a dickhead to the RPers(not hard) you're fine.   
---
I don't RP generally but if I see some shit in the wild I like to join in for a bit. It can be fun.  
---
Amazing server tbh. It has its faults(namely a few guilds) but beyond that, great. Great PvP, some great PvE guilds, decent economy, great large community, just about all you could want/need in a WoW server. and RP if you want!
---
Doing hard shit solo can be half the fun! Get creative, use all your abilities and whatnot.
---
It's also an opportunity to make friends on the server, even if it's just finding out who's cool (and who's *not*).
---
Well, most people will have to be reported for anything to happen unless a GM just happens to have free time and sees names he doesn't like. It would be super hard to regulate every name with how many people are currently playing and making characters.
---
And Shamans.
---
As the the water breathing tho, Hydrocane from Gnomeregan is a pretty easy game and helps immensely with any water based shenanigans ;)
---
&gt;to get the set bonus crit, you need to have 300 tailoring.
---
The set itself is BOE, but the set bonus requires Tailoring to activate.
---
Grob is hands down free the one of if not the best WoW server in classic. Many many people don't RP and as long as you don't harass the RPers its fine. Everything about it is 9.5/10.
---
It's definitely easier for them to push out content since it was ready a long long time ago. I think a lot of people are freaked out because they are playing again, this time with families and jobs and a lot less time. They are saying it's too fast because they didn't come close to completing P1 content and P2 is coming out. I think the people who are done with P1 are quite content with the release timing.
---
Also you have to tank the boss wich is really bad if you want to blizz like 40+ mobs you gonna die for sure there
---
I mean just about every estimate for phase 2 was about 3 months from launch and we're getting phase 2 in about 2 months and about 3 weeks from launch.
---
What?  No they don't, they're infamous for letting scammers run rampant, they have a hands-off policy on trade.
---
Yeah I'm on Horde Herod and it's pretty great for the most part.
---
You'll be grey to all the 60s, no honor. They'll be looking for lvl 51 and up.
---
What do the pots usually sell for once PvP is OLDK
---
I am just tossing out what I'm guessing. I'm not counting my runs or the gold and you're tossing out my good run so can I toss out all the bad runs I did too? I'm not actually sure why you're diving 700 by 120 even but alright. I just know if 2 weeks I made 1,600g.
---
If I do 3 runs in a row the minimum I've made is 60g the max I threw out as over 160g based on rng even though you know I had a 900g one in 1/3rd of an hour. What is your estimayed average? You still haven't given one and if you're saying it's 60g then you're obviously a moron since that's the min. What I tosses out means absolutely nothing, just like averages means nothing. If you go there and do 3 runs in a row you will at least make 60g. At best over 1,000g lmao. Not bad for an hour of fun.
---
Glad the discussion is over, you're pathetic. Cya.
---
Well, I guess is time to level my lvl 12 mage
---
I feel like someone needs to edit in a Wil-E-Coyote sign while he sapped in mid air.
---
PogU Tob kc?
---
If you're good at the game then it doesn't take 8 days to 60, more like 4 or 5 depending on your class. I ended up with 5d14h to 60 and I had maxed all my professions including fishing. The problem is that many players can't sit through 8 straight hours of AoE grinding SM. So they have to go the slower route, combined with playing less.. yeah they will lag quite far behind.
---
Im glad I just decided like last week to buy mats for lvling eng 3 times.
---
I only play naked IRL
---
You can easily play the game 1-60 as a hunter solo but your going to limit yourself from the full world of Warcraft experience imo. What makes classic good is that you can create good friendships with random players in this game and come to rely on these friends to tackle even more difficult content. Your character grows and your friend list should grow as you level.
---
Sounds like he needed for OS. If you don't like it put him on ignore and don't group with him again.
---
WAIT WHAT
---
awesome, thank you!
---
Floating between roles in the span of a single fight is very different than the ability to run a dungeon, insta spec swap and do another.
---
I do a lot of wpvp. This is true.  
---
It also happens to be true that 95% of alli that solo on grob (at least the 60s) are garbage at pvp 90% of the time. The good pvpers(alliance has quite a few) run groups of usually 2-3 sometimes 5.   
---
the "hurr outnumber" argument is so dumb. like you said, both sides do it, its world pvp, if you don't have friends you're wrong.
---
The pvp trinket that's not even out yet
---
Yeah whatever it’ll drop again maybe it was an honest mistake, but at 60, you should know your class and what gear you need and don’t for the role you signed up for in that group
---
All by personal choice. No one was forced to circumvent those areas.  Which goes to my point.  You would force everyone to play the game as you want to play it, but did you play it that way?
---
Piggybacking on this thread and hoping for an answer:
---
If I’m planning on going gnomish for BoP items and then dropping/relearning goblin, what level should I get gnomish to before dropping so that I can get all BoP items?
---
Get better at being objective. 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#
---
If your raids have 2-3 hunters sitting in the top 5, stop pugging.
---
And these figures are with EXTREMELY geared hunters (low parse count = more loot for low pop classes) as well as hunters being at their best in Phase 1.
---
Watch this tank hard in Phase 3 through 5, then recover somewhat to sit at maybe 4th spot for Naxx (once casters take off).
---
I agree with everything else though, hunters have great utility - certainly more than Fury Warriors and rogues.
---
&gt;They have more utility than any other class. 
---
I wouldn't be so bold as to park them above mages though - or even locks from a raid standpoint. Mage is the literal embodiment of utility
---
&gt; I understand you're a Hunter, and the idea of not being better at farming gold, have more mobility, being less dependant on a mount, having more access to good gear, MAY scare you.
---
Don't really understand what you mean here - pretty content with my class as I said, we knew they are solo PvE bosses. I'm just mentioning that the 'boss DPS' metric you mentioned is off by a mile, and I'm not even being biased here - history proves it, logs prove it.
---
the "derppp outnumber" argument is so dumb. like you said, both sides do it, its world pvp, if you don't have friends you're wrong.
---
Its seemed like theres 60+ alliance camping hillsbrad for the last week on incendius.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
I’m still a low level so I’m more focused on grinding gold for a mount and leveling so I guess it would just be for social reasons lol
---
Dagger warrior is actually bis dps.
---
Dagger rogue is not bis dps. Its a pvp spec that doesnt keep uo with swords. 
---
Why do warrs have to pass BiS pve weapons to you for pvp?
---
Idk, every PvPer in my guild would rather do BGs than OWPvP but if OWPvP is the only option that's what they'll be doing and they'll relentless drive alliance off the server ruining OWPvP forever since all servers will end up like 90/10 faction split if OWPvP is the only way to farm honor for next 3 months or something. Not just that but many actually care so little about OWPvP in comparison to BGs that this won't even get them to play the game outside of raid logging. Everyone is just sitting around waiting for BGs it feels like. I'm pretty concerned the guild I spent months building will just die if BGs don't come out ASAP and I also hate to see server imbalances get worse cause 90/10 servers just ruin the game for me.
---
Lmao yasssss
---
Story-wise, I’m down with the premise. But then I remember that this is still retail wow so it doesn’t matter.
---
A 56 rogue can pretty easily kill a level 60 mage. So if the mage does kill the rogue back, they get nothing? Similarly, a 54 Warlock is no easy task for most every class, even at 60, but they should get no honor for that either? I definitely agree that 48 seems like a participation trophy, but I think 54-60 is definitely not cowardly.
---
&gt; 6 piece T0 
---
sorry, what is the name of the 6 piece T0 gear?
---
I don't think it'll be that bad. You get more honor by killing 60s, so the players who really want to rank will just make a deal with a guild on the opposite faction and repeatedly kill eachother 10 times a day then pick another guild to farm. It's the most efficient way of ranking so that's what's gonna happen.
---
Heroic strike doesn't use the global. You're supposed to do two hamstrings in addition to however many heroics you can
---
I really hope it doesn't pan out like people are predicting. I fell in love with this game as soon as I started playing and was thrilled that I got to experience it like this since I didn't have a computer that could run it when I was in high school in 2004. Now it kind of feels like I wasted my time playing it because I'm just going to have to give it up in a week. Especially not encouraging when the consensus among spr srs gamerz seems to be "Sorry but you weren't actually supposed to enjoy Classic unless you already knew everything about the game and could breeze through the leveling process like a seasoned pro."
---
lol why? stop being a lazy shit and google stuff on your own. entitled baby
---
Honor without BGs was how it was in Vanilla. It wasn't a big deal back in the day and it won't be now. My noob ass managed to lvl on a PvP server when I had no idea what I was doing months after the initial launch of Vanilla. Plenty of others can manage the same. Go play Retail if you want BGs right NOW. JFC.
---
To each their own. I prefer BC over classic as the class balance and pvp changes were to my liking, all have pros and cons
---
Oof, phase 2 before the more casually players can reach 60. RIP them. I only made it to 48 but kinda lost motivation to play now, this definitely wouldn't have helped though.
---
If only there was a type of server where people who dont like world pvp could roll and still be able to do bgs when they come out...
---
Seriously, there is no shame in playing on a pve server, so why dont you?
---
&gt;solo
---
&gt;Has soulstone
---
ok buddy
---
pressing 3 buttons is very hard
---
Play retail or move on. I'd rather classic remained classic and if I run out of content I'll play something else.
---
Why is there always at least one stupid comment about how someone else can't possibly be enjoying themselves because they can't imagine wanting to do this
---
Also why is this sub full of so many casuals. Is it mostly boomers or something
---
Definitely. This kinda feels like the casual crowd is getting punished for being casuals. A December P2 would've been a bit better, having all of November to get to 60 would have been perfect for me personally. But I'm not getting 60 in 10 days, I'm going to be right around 50-55 and hitting cap is now going to be significantly harder...all because I couldn't cap in a couple of months. 
---
I actually think P2 released this early is going to push some people away from the game. I'm curious to see how my experience is going to change, and worried that I might find myself more frustrated than having fun.
---
On my medium sized server there are at least 6 horde guilds with all content on farm for 2+ weeks. Two of them with multiple raid teams. So that is something like 400 level 60's with nothing to do but hunt opposite faction.
---
GO BACK... DONT COME THIS WAY IT JUST LEADS TO AN ALT... A FUCKING ALT.
---
This might be it. I couldn't find the original article but this would make sense.
---
Well, i think the important thing is that we keep growing. it's not that offroading or welding or oilpainting are inherently better than playing wow... just stick and move. Don't do the same shit for a decade solid.  It's nice to go motocamping from time to time still. or play wow classic, to visit old hobbies and enjoy the nostalgia. but keep growing. that's all.   If i'm still doing the same shit on my bronco in 10 years, that's a problem. 
---
I'll probably still be off roading, but I hope to take it to the next level. Maybe learn to tig weld etc...
---
100% disagree. I wish all content was released now.
---
The lore is getting comical at this point.
---
Watching the features presentation right now... I just don't get what makes people excited for this stuff. More flashy cosmetics, more crazy customization, more theme park zones... I mean, does it look good? Yes. But it's probably hollow and unfulfilling. Still can't shake the feeling I had when I finally realized that in the first month of BfA.
---
I mean, if you like retail, fine. But thank God we have Classic now.
---
He means the reverse, once he CCs, he moves behind the mob, and the mob turns around to face him.

I get it all the time with Hammer of Justice.

Maybe a fellow hunter can answer that, but since all gorillas have 2.0, I don't that he would be different

"rogue one"
---
I watched the guide for that on netflix, and the only thing I learned about playing a rogue in an hour and a half is that everyone's gotta die.
---
You sound like the type to get pissed off for receiving an unauthorized whisper or invite lol
---
Lol, good point. I can imagine all the idiots flying around in that stupid thing too.
---
You're probably right. I wanted to have far more consumables for phase 2, but this is what I have. About 1000g worth isnt so bad at least
---
Honestly, I'll probably stop playing since I didn't hit 60.  Kind of a bummer I was hoping the pace would be slower than this.  I'll never get to end game content.
---
Laziness?? Do you seriously believe that? I'd done an average of 3 hours a day EVERY DAY since release and only made it to 48. That's going hard imo, most adults don't have anywhere near that much time each day.
---
I love PvP, I'm complaining because this IS going to hurt the game badly and I want to play this game long term... but all my friends are already quitting and guild is fading. It's depressing.
---
Except they are right. WoW was intended to be a friendlier replacement to compete with EverQuest. I don't know if you ever played EQ, but I'm guessing not. The grind and level of punishment for fucking up were *intense,* unreasonably so by the standards of current releases. Part of why WoW was such a runaway success was because of the warcraft IP and the game is just fun to play, but no small part of it was because it was so much more noob friendly than its competitors.
---
The person who greeded is the only respectable person
---
Youre trying to run mid 50s parts with 60s clearly.
---
must have been TBC cause I dont remember this in WOTLK
---
Cool, this has been posted about 100 times by now. It will be removed soon.
---
its not the actual lich king, its just bolvar taking the reign to keep scourge under control and slyvanas is powered spastic cunt lol
---
Think I'd rather live to 53 doing what I enjoy rather than slave away at some dead end job just so I can live out till 70-80.
---
Sounds like hell.
---
My friend without kids or a house says that studies have shown that people that aren't married and have no kids are happier. My point? Studies are bullshit. Try your best to make yourself happy, but dont look to studies to tell you how to do it!
---
My point is that everybody knew this was coming at some point. As such, if somebody sees this as a bad thing (generic timeline concerns aside) , IMO it's two possibilities:
---
- they hoped to be 60 beforehand so they can do the ganking
---
- they rolled on a PvP server  ut don't really want to PvP
---
Wow... I’m speechless you couldn’t figure this one out yourself lmao
---
&gt;No they responded that every tool is in the game to combat this behavior. 
---
Which is untrue, there is no tool built into the game to allow a horde guild to communicate with an alliance guild to counter a group using out of game comm channels to cooperate across faction lines and monopolize the devilsaur spawns
---
I always thoght Chuck Norris walks over Jesus.
---
Get em. Lol
---
This way Blizzard can milk the Classic Cow for a longer period. People probably bought longer subscriptions anyways so for as long people are subscribed new content will not be released earlier than planned. I don't expect them to release a BG unless they see a massive drop im subscriber numbers, which is the point that they fix it by introducing 1 or 2 BGs early.
---
I hate to see Blizzard like this as they were always the prime example of a company that cared for it's customers and its games. Nowadays it seems like the only thing they care for is money. I hope they prove me wrong.
---
What's thorium res?
---
Gave this an upvote due to recording on your phone and the in and out effect. Low quality and I can totally relate
---
I wouldn’t have my house or my son
---
It is.  Sell all that and buy flasks.  Probably too late for that
---
No, there certainly is a lot more for them to do.
---
For me p2 came too surprising. Thought about end of November and now im stuck with too little too
---
Chuck Norris tears can cure cancer. Too bad he never cries.
---
Sounds like your friends and guild are me better  suited for retail
---
5 small eggs are already 1g on my server.
---
I went rogue as well for the same reason and actually enjoying it a lot more anyways. Good luck to you as well!
---
why the fuck isnt there a guild controlling the LITERAL BEST PLACE TO FARM ESSENCE OF WATER IN FELWOOD???????HUH
---
Great answer, thank you. I’m 18 prot/33 Ret with pretty sub par gear. So not deep enough for the ret bomb build. Appreciate the insights and cheers :)
---
what about Plate of the Shaman King, the chest from Omokk? do you fell like its worth it to go full deathbone and not use this chest?
---
It's not too late for them to introduce official support for this at Blizzcon...
---
I havent leveled engineering. Am i fucked for high level engi stuff?
---
I’ve never truly played wow and thought pvp was the way to go. Didnt even know about the honor system.
---
Not too late to farm the mats though.
---
you can download the full combat log and there are programs that will go through and "parse" the log to analyze in detail what everyone did during the raid. This is great if you're trying to figure out how to improve your dps by comparing to people who are higher than you and seeing what they are doing differently.
---
It's also a means for elitists to be shitty to people who they don't perceive as good enough.
---
Im level 41 and I still havent found a guild and dont know anyone else who plays really. Ive still had decent fun.
---
Fucked does not begin to describe your situation.
---
bads gonna bad...
---
this is the honor system. way larger scale thing than any raid. its a good thing this is being put in now rather than later but people don't understand that and are upset they're taking 6 months to hit 6. even super casuals i know hit 60 weeks ago.
---
thats super lame people shouldn't do that
---
If they ever make a WoW 2 they should make this more of a thing. Add trade routes where you can drive caravans of goods (archeage style) and escort quest NPCs to controlled areas and I'd be one happy player.
---
I mean... that is kind of the leveling experience for vanilla... I didn't follow a guide or anything but I had 14 days /played before I hit 60.
---
What level are you now?
---
Don't you have to be at least level... 13? 15? to enter the instance?
---
Well... whatever it is, I hope we see it!
---
It's still decent if you're herb, otherwise not worth it.
---
&gt; If you have a life, spouse, family, kids, major curriculars, etc and can only play a few hours a week then the reality is an MMO is not a game type for you.
---
Silly me, I thought I was having fun all this time but it turns out this isn't even the type of game I enjoy.
---
Can't wait for all the posts crying about DKs.  IIRC you lose like 10% of your bar.
---
"people who aren't 60 yet are far behind" lmao. Behind who? People who play for hours everyday? It'll take most people like 10-12 days /played before they are 60. The the game has been out for 2 months ffs. The VAST majority of people who have full time  jobs and spouse are not gonna be 60 yet.
---
Fel is closer to 1, and even 2 vs. 4 is EXTREMELY far off. That's literally 25 runs vs. 50.
---
this sub is: classic good retail bad. even tho I agree with them
---
Sounds about right
---
Fel is closer to 1, and even 2 vs. 4 is EXTREMELY far off. That's 25 runs for mh vs. 50-100 for fel.
---
I remember when I did SM cath, we had 3 people inside and the other 2 were on their way. I was tanking and said “hey, let’s clear some trash while we wait”.  Since there was only 3 of us and there wasn’t really a rush, I was only pulling one mob at a time.
---
Well I got kind of distracted and forgot about the other two guys who were on their way.  Turns out they showed up for like 5 of my pulls and I didn’t notice until this mage goes “sorry, this tank is way too slow, bye.”
---
All he had to do was ask why I was pulling one mob at a time and I would have started pulling normal because I didn’t even realize he was there.
---
Barrage + the set effect of course make it even better. I'm not at all advocating against multishot, I'm just saying that if it causes you to pull monsters that weren't engaged, it can be bad times in dungeons (in raids it probably matters less unless breaking sheep). Hunters have feign death to drop aggro in case they pull on themselves instead of their pet or player tank, but even so there still are situations where multishot can be a problem whereas aimed shot generally doesn't have a downside other than the channel time.
---
Westfall players be like &lt;shrug&gt;. Wish they’d give us a bg so we could do some PVP though.
---
He might be, but he is also without Frostmourne. Frostmourne gave Arthas so much power. Bolvar doesn't have that. But I agree. It was kinda wack
---
So you aren't gonna back up your bullshit? I r surprise
---
Dark pact is just fine, i have zero downtime and it allows me to juggle 2 or 3 mobs a level or 2 above me with fear, dotting, howl of terror and draining. By the time I run to the next set of mobs I'm already most of the way back to full mana and i only lifetap in dire situations now or if I'm at full health. If you have a bit of spell damage and improved lifetap, then drain life recovers around 50% more mana that is uses.
---
Is there any way to see realm populations for Classic? I saw one before, but it was a while ago so I was hoping to see an update. It also showed the faction balances for the realms.
---
&gt; WoW Classic is averaging 78 days per phase 
---
Can you really "average" something when there's only been one?
---
Dude, its so lax, to the point where even myself, a moderate rp'er feels we could have more rules. Either way you can literally just play as you would and most likely noone would care.
---
Blue post on the 8th stating that layering won't be removed yet on all servers.
---
WoW on Dad mode /salute.
---
I'm only half way to my epic mount, I wish I could spend more time on the AH since I have 30 or 40 greens on a bank alt I can't find time to price and sell. 
---
My tailoring is mostly leveled though and I have a bit of prepaid BiS but I play a shadow priest so I don't expect PvP to be too much trouble. 
---
I've found this play through I'm far more focused getting exactly the right stuff rather than wasting time crafting and rolling on less than ideal items. I wasted so much of my wow time in my youth lol
---
I can't wait for the honor system so I can get the trinket and my boots and glove which are BiS if only for the glove added effect.
---
He swims over him. And because these are making me feel nostalgic:
---
Chuck Norris' tears can cure cancer; too bad he never cries
---
For the most part this guy is a beast, the time and effort it takes to learn your class this much, learn the game inside and out fair play to him.
---
Sylvanas obviously has maxed out her artifact power and is in full titanforged  epics. Plus Lich King isnt even level 120... hes stuck at 110 in legion patch.
---
Then. Don’t. Roll. On. A. Pvp. Server. FFS.
---
yea but it works for all the people. You can mind soothe several mobs and just pass near them with all your party.
---
Why would you be?
---
First time parent here. I thought I would be able to squeeze some Classic time in with a 2 month old. I logged 23 hours of play time and ended up just cancelling it. 
---
Sometimes I miss being able to play for 24 hours straight. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yeah, and they won't be doing any content beyond BWL, probably MC at the most, definitely not AQ40 and Naxx, just like back in vanilla. The pace of the game didn't revolve around them back then, so why should it now?
---
There's an assumption that each release phase will have the same timing. I don't think this will be true once progression raids start popping in.
---
Either way, 1-2 years was about the length of time I was expecting.
---
You can enter Dead Mines at level 10.
---
P2
---
&gt; you can just corpse hop once or twice
---
"Did leveling take you more time than it was supposed to? Well now it will take even longer because you have to do a ghost walk every three minutes to get anything done."
---
Thanks, it's like overdraft fees but in a video game. Very cool.
---
funny enough i reported this post for not blocking usernames
---
On Shazzrah it did. When time went back one hour in my country, it also went back one hour in the server time.
---
Kinda like having player equivalent of Defias Pillagers to spice the game up: dangerous, can sometimes avoid, can engage
---
Just respec to holy once you're doing raids (or healing for endgame dungeons). As long as you don't respec too often you'll be fine
---
No way is server progression gonna be faster than original launch. 
---
It took 19 months to get to Naxx.
---
Phase 2 is probably dropping quickly because it’s literally 2 world bosses and an honor system. 
---
Phase 3 has FAR more content and probably won’t drop as quickly
---
I'm guessing phases 2 and 3 are going to come faster than subsequent phases because there's no new raid content until phase 3.
---
It however increases your utility.
---
Imp revenge, imp concussion blow (which is off CD every pack with a bad group), 2 secs off taunt to pull aggro off shitty DPS attacking your unmarked target ignoring skull and cross.

Interesting. Good to know!
---
I joined the gold shire inn staff..... They were fucking weird even by internet standards. I'm a 38 paladin looking for a new guild if anyone has suggestions. I just want an active guild that likes to have fun, nothing overtly serious.
---
I actually agree with PvP being added this close.  It is absolutely needed for the PvP Realm feel.  I just hope we don't see BWL for at least another 4+ months.
---
31/0/20 Is just too good, you get less Mana on heals/totems 3% hit AND 5% crit for healing and lightning spells. Ele shamans are almost as good as POM pyro mages to just insta gib people, specially if you're an engineer and can land a grenade. Elemental mastery can affect two spells at once if you time it right, pop ele mastery and queue up a chain lightning and start spamming earth shock. Both will be free and both will crit. The amount of times I've just turned and insta gibbed someone ganking me with that combo...it never gets old and it's super satisfying.
---
Not a single Enclave tag? Like them or hate them, them being absent on this makes it super inaccurate.
---
You’re the guy who complains about getting a 95 on a test
---
Being the lich king alone wasnt what made arthas powerful. He had frostmourne which bolvar doesnt
---
Right. If ones goal is to rush to endgame it is for sure the smart play.  Now Take that 7 days (best case scenario) and spread it out hour by hour and imagine that most people don’t have the luxury to play even 2 hours a day, that is what casual means-life doesn’t revolve around the game. 
---
 But guess we will all see how it pans out. Being on a server where my faction is already easily outnumbered has made questing a pain in the ass during peak times due to just getting stomped on, if this phase 2 makes it worse, I doubt I will continue. It’s not a challenge for the other faction, it’s a cakewalk. PvP server was a choice, yes, but being outnumbered 3 or 4-1 wasn’t. I suspect if indeed this phase 2 goes the way people in here say i suspect many will end up quitting or changing servers. But perhaps people are blowing it out of proportion how bad it will be.
---
dude was still wearing wrath gear, bound to get his ass kicked
---
Noted, but as a shadow priest you would think that you would want spw not hpw. never played priest but yeah. It’s a game blah blah i know i just hate to see it. an upgrade isn’t an upgrade though, as a lock i wouldn’t roll on something that isn’t suited for my class, like a sword with atk power
---
There was less players per server and there wasn’t an armada of bored players fully decked in BiS with nothing else to do.
---
For leveling horde players it will be mostly ok. For alliance on some servers however it will be ridiculous and will make imbalance even worse.
---
I was hoping that when you finally got the mine it was going to be gone or a sap at the very last moment.
---
Shit I’m still level 37, been levelling since laugh, got a priest to 33 and rerolled
---
Dude it takes like a week and a half playtime to reach 60. The game has been out for 2 months lmao. That is multiple hours EVERYDAY since release. You think people are lazy if they haven't done that? Take into account that not everyone decides to level easy mode and download questie.
---
If you are 60 now you either play HYPER efficiently, or you play a fuck ton. You can't set this as the treshold for not being lazy.
---
No. I'm on a PvP server now and played vanilla on PvE and it's exactly the same for my experience.
---
I would venture to guess that the P is part of it, for two reasons:
---
1. A number of people feel that PvP is the ONLY way to play, hence some elitism from the outset.
---
2. Gankers and unsporting PvP is way more easily accomplished and not necessarily easy to stop, especially if a region or whole server is weighted more heavily towards one of the factions.
---
On PvE my only particularly negative PvP experience thus far has been skulls camping Westfall NPCs. It's inconvenient, but really all it does is stop you from turning quests in for a bit. Unless you flag yourself you're pretty much safe outside of a bit of annoyance. The majority on my server so far seem to be content to live and let live (after all, they chose PvE not PvP in the first place) and occasionally you'll even have cross-faction cooperation to clear paths of mobs or help with elites.
---
"You're trash if you haven't spent as much time playing this game as I have" Lol
---
If a millionaire won a $10 giveaway why would it be unfair for them to claim a reward, especially if they have to put in effort to enter the giveaway? It doesn't matter how much you have, if you put in the same amount of effort to earn something, you should have the same right a someone else to earn it...
---
I don't have any vested interest in helping a random PUG progress, nor do I have any expectation of them to do the same for me. If I PUG a dungeon run, the mindset is transactional. Be polite and efficient and get my BoPs with the expectation is BoEs and cash drops will be split fairly. With guildies and friends it's different because there is continuity- I ran DM East 73 times with my guild's main tank because he wanted Quel'Serar. In return, he agreed to help farm dungeons so I could get prebis when I get my warrior to 60. 
---
You keep returning to this idea of Need vs Greed as if it's a community standard because it's the default loot system in the game. It's up to players to decide how to split loot and the overwhelming consensus that I've encountered is that it's just a way to declare priority for rolling, nothing more
---
Speak for yourself. Im a lot more exited for world pvp than BGs
---
What if I never played WoW before Classic and I'm at level 41 right now on a PvP server? Is there any hope for me? Should I just cut my losses and find a different game to play?
---
There is a middleground.
---
&gt; You're not providing any advice, you're just yelling at people. Why would anyone be grateful for you being here, even if you weren't lying out your ass.
---
Read his last comment or the entire thread. One of us is BSing, and it wasn't me.
---
&gt; Screenshot your 18k with proof
---
How the fuck am I supposed to do that? Give you an imgur album with all my alt banks? On top of not being comfortable with sharing my stock, if you have a more elegant way of doing this, please let me know.
---
The fact that you instantly write it off as lying just means you have no clue or have trouble believing that someone could amass such wealth. It's really not hard. And, like I said, I'm not even considered a big player. I didn't abuse layers, I didn't join any mafia. There are people with 6 digits.
---
Like I've said in every thread like this. They need to emulate what jagex did with their "classic" version of runescape. You had the no changes people, and those who wanted some extra content.  So they implemented a polling system in game to give the majority a say in what comes into the game. That way everyone gets a happy medium. 
---
 Ifeel like that is the only way to keep everyone happy and to keep people from feeling cheated out of a beloved game that people have been waiting years to get back. 
---
If people feel they need straight up classic only servers. Poll it. 
---
If people want expansion servers poll it. It only makes too much sense.
---
Lol you can enjoy it all you want, but don’t complain when the world moves faster than you can keep up because you don’t have the proper time to put in.
---
Ha!  I am almost 57.  i should be 60 by then.  PHEW
---
lol wut
---
There were plenty of people the first month crying about being banned for roof camping towns. Not sure why they would enforce one thing and not the other. And the only person who could prove a ban happened for scamming or being a ninja would be the scammer or the ninja themselves and why would they self-identify on here and make it easy to black list them for their entire server?
---
What add on is that that shows all combat text on your character?
---
Already lvling a priest alt for the guild. There's no saving me.
---
Of course shadow priests want spellpower not healing, but like I said it's an easy mistake to make. 
---
And how shitty is your gear and rotation that a sword with AP would be an upgrade?
---
Decursive is your best friend. The guys topping dispel charts probs all have this addon.
---
Who cares, Sylvanas is such a played out overpowered trash character at this point. Her kicking the Lich Kings ass is beyond stupid.
---
Sylvanas fan fiction, the expac.
---
Sure and releasing a phase without even a new tier of gear does nothing to inhibit those still leveling up and their experience of end game. Maybe getting there will be a bit more difficult.
---
If you res carefully and use CDs, you can make it in only 2-3 deaths. Not too bad
---
What quest?
---
You actually have no idea what I own besides not having pursued a career. You're either an idiot, or a self-obsessed hard-working person who doesn't understand how money works beyond a paycheck. Either way, let's face it, you will never do shit beyond make your boss look good. Thanks for your concern though.

It's inaccurate, yes, because it counts soulbound BoEs I used before like Hurricane/Warmonger in the total, along with all my engin trinkets, but those add maybe 300g tops. Go ahead and minus however much you want off the top.

'Inane screaming' - you mean, actually telling someone who has no idea what statistical averages mean how to calculate a statistical average and discard outliers?

In fact, of us three, you're the only one being inane right now.

That depends entirely on the job.

bruh ive got friends who play like 3 days a week IF THAT who have 60s. this sub has the whiniest casual normies i swear.
---
I have nothing against pacing but it seems that the motivation is not player happiness but revenue. Which is totally logical from a pure business standpoint but not always the best for the players. My point was not that slow pacing is bad, but that money-driven pacing is bad.

In the last week my game has started getting lag spikes every 30 seconds that last a second or two. I thought it was limited to cities but it happened in scholo last night too making it unbearable. I haven't changed anything in the game, and even disabled all my addons on another character and still have the same lag spikes. I've checked my MS and it's consistently around 20ms so I don't think internet lag is the problem. Anyone else have experience with this?
---
Even just dropping WSG would be ideal.
---
What you actually said was "I’m saying that if you aren’t 60 TWO months from launch than you are trash."
---
Which ironically is improper English. If you could stop with the arrogant and aggressive comments I'm sure we could have an actual discussion, but until then I suppose I'm priced into my own immature responses.
---
If you're level 5 and you have the opportunity to go from a white dagger to a green with +1 stam, I don't see why you wouldn't take it. If you're in a group, consider how big an upgrade it would be for others, of course.  But if you're past about 20 and a nominally mdps or tank item is an upgrade, your gear is absolutely terrible. Can you give a reasonable example where your situation might happen?
---
This joke fell pretty flat tbh :p
---
The cutoff is 12 levels at 60 so pretty close to what you're asking.
---
The game was not always built around the hardcore nolifers lmao. That's jjst bullshit. And no, they won't be doing naxx. That is not relevant. The honor system being out heavily affects the people who are not 60. Naxx being out doesn't affect people doing MC.
---
&gt;Far behind who? More like far behind what? Far behind the phase progression that Blizzard is doing, lol.
---
That is not the point you were making originally lmao. Your point was very obvioulsy that people who are not 60 yet are just slacking behind what could reasonably be expected with normal amounts of gameplay. You were wrong.
---
He never said it was a burden. Just a time sink. I'm so sorry you volunteered to kill 18 years worth of your free time by spawning a child...

At my plant, you work 84 hours one week, but then have 7 straight days off.
---
Brilliant
---
Is Recipe: Transmute Elemental Fire in the game yet?
---
Honor without BGs for a phase has been the plan literally since they announced how the phasing would work. Why is everyone so surprised..?
---
when its a priest its hard to tell if its malice or stupidity.
---
if a mage had done it? stupidity for sure.
---
but if they wanted it for a heal set etiquette would be to ask the person healing the group if they needed them, and only take if they don't
---
Yes congrats you know what an outlier is but not averages lmao. Not surprised you still won't toss out your average figure. Nice end of discussion too. Oh, btw just did a run in 20 minutes (with priest and zero resists) and staff and ring dropped. Warlock bought the staff for 50g and warrior for 30g. Vendored the rest for 15g and will get another run in. 95g in half an hour, man tribute runs are so bad!
---
Same here, rerolled to Alliance to be with my mates and am only level 35. STV is gonna be fun.
---
Oh, I know. I'll at least have a fighting chance though haha
---
What tram?
---
It's not just any old video game. To treat it so is what's really nonsense. People have died playing this game for a reason. To pretend every video has the same effect on humans is just dumb.
---
I would've just played something else. Let's be real, I don't have any hobbies or ambitions. I just want to play video games.
---
Maaan I've put my time in... that's for sure. But compare playing WoW to watching TV. What's the difference? And even if it's bad, WoW is, at most, a symptom. Not the disease.
---
I've leveled my rogue 7 days played, paladin 6 days played, and hunter at 52 3.5 days played.  It's not that hard if you use a questing guide.
---
I love it. Can i have a link to that ragna picture?
---
With phase two coming they tried to add the mob Robert'); DROP TABLE LootDrops;
---
Little Bobby LootDrops we call him, used to farm him all the time back in the day
---
0.97^150=0.0103
---
1% chance of happening.
---
I’m referring to the shadow priest needing on a healing piece as above
---
Can't tell if trolling.
---
Thankyou so much for this! I've been stopping by moonglade when I go to winter/az and was a pain in the ass!
---
"I soloed Hogger as a level 1 Rogue...
---
WHAT?
---
..Twinked to hell and back"
---
oh.
---
Which is quite good already, when we thing about it.
---
38.5 dmg, with no spell hit will have 17% resist so 32 dmg. If the boss hit every 2 seconds, it’s 16dps. Multiplied with the 145% of threat, it’s 46.3 tps.
---
Of course it will change with the attack speed of the boss but still, quite useful!
---
What part of easy mistake don't you understand?
---
Same. My life was geared around video games in high school - had no friends and got a lot of my socializing in through vidya. I’m grateful for that because it gave me an outlet when I was pretty unhappy otherwise. It served its purpose.
---
I spent 250 days on my vanilla character before uninstalling and getting my act together. Now run a company with nine employees and playing wow feels like a reward (with the occasional late nighter), rather than a ball and chain. Gonna hit sixty this weekend - at 58 now. Shoutout to calamitous intent on heart seeker!
---
Don't come crying to this forum when the game dies if they wait 3 months to release any BGs.
---
This. I was waiting for the horde rogue to show up
---
Not having enough time to play a game, or maybe not enough desire to play it constantly doesn’t amount to an excuse, just a reason. Do you honestly believe there are people who equate some sort of personal self worth to their gear and level in WoW? I mean, if one does equate being level 60 and having cleared content to self worth, sounds like those are the folks needing to pacify their actual insecurities in real life.
---
You seem poorly informed about the viability of Shadow in Classic. Only reason they aren't more common is they take up a debuff slot on the Boss.
---
Broken link, troll. You're done
---
Aw hunby, I’ve been playing for 15 years.
---
This isn't original vanilla, it's nothing like it. Players have changed, servers are way more populated. It's going to suck.
---
Are you holy? Is that why they took so long to take down?
---
it’s the age of information where ignorance is a choice. An easy mistake (while we both agree not a major one) can be avoided by taking an extra .02 seconds to read
---
I’m not interested in having a discussion with you, nor was I the person who started the aggression in this thread. At this point anyone who comes into this comment thread can get bent.
---
I would ask you to explain how it’s improper English, and while you’re at it, to explain why at your age you don’t know how to use “irony”... but your idiocy is so unbelievably uninteresting to me that I might just block you instead.
---
Actually, yeah, that’s exactly what I’ll do.
---
Reading over his guide, I think his model of healing is fundamentally flawed.
---
Consider Intellect vs. MP5. In a 3-minute fight, 1 MP5 restores 36 mana. If you have the spec he recommends for Resto Shaman (which I also have quibbles with), then 2.29 Int = 1 MP5 on a 3 minute fight.
---
The reason this is important is that "3 minutes" is the standard bar for gear check fights in MC/BWL - Geddon, Ragnaros, Vael. It really doesn't matter that MP5 is fantastic in a 10-minute fight when every 10-minute fight is a pure execution fight where mana normally isn't an issue.
---
Or consider +healing vs. mp5. 1 mp5 yields an extra 0.1457 Chain Heal (Rank 1) per fight. If you cast 33 Chain Heal (Rank 1), 1 +healing will yield 0.0661 of a Chain Heal. So the actual ratio should be more like 2.2:1 +healing:mp5 for a 3 minute fight.
---
And Chain Heal is the spell that makes mp5 look good. Again, consider the 'gear check' fights. Those are all fights where your Resto Shaman are doing the heavy lifting on tank healing. When you use downranked Healing Waves as your healing model, mp5 is an atrociously bad stat compared to +healing.
---
Quest up to lvl 32. Then go SM for spell cleave until 42. Then head over to zf spell cleave Grave Yard. At 52 make your way over to BRD for another marathon of spell cleave.
---
The Lich King wasn’t all powerful, we’ve fought worse since. Players characters aren’t the only one in that get stronger with time. Plus him not being at 100% or willing to use that power to its fullest, while she is empowered doesn’t make it “beyond stupid”. That’s just your bias.
---
A blur of squares and colours. Nice.
---
Time to hit level 60.....
---
Any year now....
---
Well it's funny you say compared to rogues and warriors, because respectively they have energy (which replenishes quick) and rage (which is its own resource mechanic). IMO it feels like just about any mana using class has SOMETHING to help with mana, EXCEPT with hunters where perhaps you could call mana as something only for special attacks rather than a resource you burn through like a mage or warlock. Perhaps this is a side effect of IIRC hunters being supposed to use focus but it not making it in (note that pets DO use focus). With agility stacking auto shot hits so hard that a lot of things like serpent sting don't scale nearly as well even if they are sometimes useful. Arcane shot is pretty much universally considered horribly mana inefficient unless you NEED something fast.
---
Personally, if it's a single target burn I just only do auto shot and slam with aimed shot. If it's AoE I try to make the most of volley and occasionally explosive shot, and consider multshot a secondary AoE choice if it fits in. If your group goes hard on AoE chances are they'll be drinking too so you as a hunter drinking isn't a huge deal, and it's not like you're useless if you just autoshot to passively regain mana for a pack or two.
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
---
People can always take a few weeks or month off and return when what they want is released. No idea why you're being so dramatic
---
you rly are a spoiled kid arent you
---
Don't come crying to me when game is dead 2 months from now.
---
They're going to have to rush BWL cause PVE servers will have nothing to do.
---
https://imgur.com/a/9o2lEx6
---
Literally none  have ever played retail, most sat on private servers for years. All played a lot less retail than you for sure.
---
Definitely not
---
Just go shadow while you level. You can still heal all dungeons.
---
We not gonna talk about &lt;Elevator Operators&gt; on the southern barrens? That is absolutely hilarious.
---
thumbs down on the sudden announcement for what seems too soon.  I play more than casual but less than hardcore and i don't feel anywhere near ready for this.
---
By rules say or yell should be in character. The rest is up to guild or party. More often than not guild chat and instances are the same as on other realms.
---
People are quitting because there's nothing to do. Go level in dungeons or play on a PvE server.
---
The set bonus is crit chance. The hit is available on the actual pieces.
---
You'll probably have decent luck if you group up. That's how I got through Felwood.
---
All the quitters left the PvP servers when transfers were open (to go to ally 10:1 PvE servers). 99% of 60s on the servers you mentioned know what they’re in for, and stayed out FOR that reason. Some people like having lots of bad players to kill
---
Also, Classic is an MMO. It’s not retail. Grouping up is an ESSENTIAL part of the game. I’m not a social guy, but I’m not gonna sit on my warrior and sulk because I lose 1v2s. I’m gonna group up
---
I know but I have more fun going into a healing beneficial spec.
---
Oh man, now that was a unique game! Aged terribly though...
---
guilty :`(
---
Yeah I actually got a little upset watching that, some of the gameplay features are cool but they've just added so much bloat over the years and you have Mary Sues easily soloing some of the most powerful lore characters 1v1. I much prefer the vanilla Sylvanas.
---
I can't even with their content releases strategically timed around the name reservation period. They know people's subs run out around 12th.
---
I was really hoping someone would come along with the real math!  I would be interested in the derivation, does your formula assume perfect GCD utilization on proc?
---
Enough people take weeks or months off and guilds die. They never recover and not everyone will come back, actually a lot won't.
---
Where exactly do you expect to find an even fight in world PvP?
---
99% of the time you're either the hanker or the ganked, in my experience at least.
---
Well a lot of people believe that TBC will be more popular than Vanilla so maybe he just means they are doing classic just to get to TBC/WOTLK.
---
I just reset it for 10s as you said and learnt Bite from a spider in Arathi where I walked to all the way from Undercity just to get this ^^ thanks again!
---
I decided to pick a realm none of my past friends played on, make new friends while leveling and just enjoy the game in my own pace.
---
And i still enjoy making more friends even if im 60.
---
The only wrong way to play classic, is to play it if you don't have fun doing so, anything else is completely valid.
---
It makes sense to announce it next year when most classic players left (around AQ/Naxx a lot of ppl will leave). At this time they should announce TBC with char transfer from classic-&gt;TBC so a lot of people will start playing to prepare for TBC. Now its too ealry "from a business perspective"
---
You'll have a harder time leveling unless you do nothing but dungeons.
---
Maximize healing power for MC maximize mp5 for onyxia if your guild is doing 20 mans etc. Depends on kill speed.
---
1. Collect 3 keys from LBRS to get a key (Seal of Ascension)
---
2. Enter dungeon, try /tar Jed , come out, reset and repeat until you succeed.
---
Very true, I rolled a hunter back in MoP so I got so used to focus hunter its hard to adjust to using mana. Between pets not scaling with gear, aspect of the viper not in yet, and nothing really helping with mana, I can understand why hunters get a lot worse as the phases will progress. I'll still stay true to my range loving troll, but its gonna be a task to try to optimize him.
---
I sold 300 ore the other day after farming for several days. I can't even remember the last time I got a crystal. Has to be somewhere between 300-600 ore since my last crystal. Funny thing is... earlier in the expansion I was getting crystals fairly often... to me it seems like Blizzard nerfed the drop rate but that could just be my bad luck I guess...
---
&gt; WHAT THIEF FUCKING TAKES THE TOWER WITHOUT THE POWER CORDS AND TWO OF THOSE EXPENSIVE ASS ASUS SWIVEL MONITORS, ALSO THE PS4 PRO/SWITCH CONNECTED TO THE 4K TV RIGHT BESIDE IT, THEN LOCKS THE DOOR ON THE WAY OUT...HMMMM
---
A thief who apparently holds a grudge against your gaming, methinks...
---
When I get into a game I tend to stick with it for a long time. If WoW stops being playable for a month I highly doubt I'll be coming back as I'll most likely be focusing on a different game by the time it's worth logging in again.
---
"Studies are bullshit" might as well shit on everything else then.
---
Also these is what research says in a shit ton of studies, not just one.
---
These studies are not supposed to tell you how to be happy, they are just indicators saying that people with that factors tend to be happier than without. And very importantly; not just happy but satisfied with their situation overall, which makes happiness way more stable and also acts like a security net that support you in times of crisis. A relationship gives you intimacy and stability. (btw. people in high end career paths tend to have stable relationships). A house gives you stability and the feeling of having something that lasts and makes you think you lead a successful life because these are the markers for happiness/success that are deep down in everyones unconscious right now, plus financial security. Same goes for a degree. 
---
I mean you can try to be the one guy that says he doesnt want any of that, but first of all its a lot of work to think like that, because you are fighting the current markers for "happiness" in most people mindsets, which are there for a reason, deep down in your unconscious. And even if you manage to be that "woke" or have that perspective, lets see if you can keep that up in time of crisis. Fact ist, most people cant, and thats exactly why there the data is showing these results.
---
Well you could find a niche as a Nightfall-loving hunter. /s (That said, I've memed up some amusing times with wing clipping ravager, and even put the fiery blaze enchantment on it.)
---
My understanding with hunters falling off is it's less to do with pet scaling and more to do with pets just sometimes not being that usable outside of like the wolf howl. Pets are a vital part of the hunter class and yet you'll be expected to hold back your pet for any number of reasons, or otherwise have it die quick if you do send it in. It's a nontrivial loss of DPS and utility whenever your pet is not viable. Another aspect of it seems to be a gear issues, where like the AQ set tries to make more use of arcane shot a thing but it's just a fundamentally inefficient ability compared to other options. In raids you likely won't be afforded a slot for serpent sting (if even hunter's mark), so that's more tools pulled away from you.
---
No. Be Alliance, if you must, but not a gnome.
---
It's very possible they will be camped yes.
---
But likely only by one faction (whichever is dominant on your server, probably horde).  It will be especially bad in the first couple of weeks but then i'd expect it to calm down a little.
---
Once battleground go down i'd think it will mostly stop.
---
It's all just guesswork at this point though - but people will definitely be hungry for honor and camping outside 50+ dungeons will probably be the best place to get it
---
This
---
You don't do a quest to get that key you just kill a boss and loot it
---
You say worse than cat dps as if that was a surprise or as if cats were the worst dps spec of the hybrid classes when in fact it is the best, excluding fury warriors. 
---
Since you brought up logs you can go check yourself. There are feral dps who cracked the 700dps on rag already. None of the other meme specs has managed more than 500 except for shadow priests who still havent managed to reach 600. It takes a lot more effort for a feral druid to be even decent compared to other specs, but if put in the effort they shit all over other hybrids.
---
Yeah I might as well just go shadow then. What level is it worth it to finally make the switch back to your healing spec?
---
i would've enjoyed more pits-of-death as borders. Like in Burning Crusade. White-water rapids would have been cool. Boiling acid or lava could be used in some places.
---
For the swamp of sorrows example, would have been a cool effect to have the trees become to dense to travel through in some places. And then all of a sudden - desert. It'd still serve its purposes and the ruin in the blasted lands would be more stark.
---
What about rams?
---
Genuine question - why do people block out their names? Like anyone gives a shit to find you. We don't even know the server lol
---
Same man. I'm a druid. Only 45 though. I'm just gunna be questing and walking around everywhere stealthed haha
---
Why?, they will lose subscribers who know that classic+ wont be a thing. Tye expansion will have to have a 2021 release date, so those who want to play tbc wont sub yet. It makes no sense from a business perspective.
---
There are screenshots and logs in this very reddit post.
---
Go take a look you strangely anal scrub
---
Probably around 52-55. At that point most people dungeon grind BRD/UBRS/DM to 56 but I'm sure that's doable as shadow as well. Depends if you'd still like to quest, but there is a shit ton of pre-raid BiS in BRD you'll be wanting so dungeon spamming makes sense.
---
Maybe you just arent very good?
---
Nah blizzard would be too risky, just iceblock to get them all stacked, frost nova and flamestrike/cone of cold
---
Well you don't have much options, just walk a few meters right to the first packs and this should be enough to track.
---
Because the guy recording, Skarm, is fairly well known from private servers. He has a bunch of youtube videos and guides from private servers and I was under the impression he really knew his shit when it came to classic wow
---
I just did it cuz i thought it was a rule that posting in game names wasn’t allowed.
---
&gt;And Chain Heal is the spell that makes mp5 look good.
---
Is it? Doesn't it have the highest healing power scaling co-efficient in the game?
---
Then you started to level at STV casually at 7pm
---
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
---
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
---
&gt; Hit low 50s and then run dungeons solely for gear. You'll hit 60 long before you get everything you want anyway.
---
Agreed. I (mage) was in dungeons or questing while waiting for groups from about 52 on, and only had about a third of my BiS before 60. Though I have particularly bad RNG luck.
---
Is that a rule? Lol
---
Would make sense I guess.
---
That's up to you. But if you want to be optimal, you'd want to be 300 Tailoring for the 2% Crit Set Bonus from the Bloodvine set, whenever that comes out. 
---
You could do Tailor + Engineering, and just buy mats. :)
---
/who lane_cruiser
---
Is there a way to send my Gold to my char on the other faction?
---
I'm looking for a cross faction player on 'Lakeshire' to trade gold with.
---
I have Gold on Horde side and I would like to transfer it my new char to Alliance side. 
---
You have a Horde char. 
---
I give you 10s on Horde side. 
---
We log in Alliance. 
---
I have Alliance char. 
---
You give me 10s on Alliance side.
---
Of cousre more than just 10 silver. rinse and repeat.
---
What server are you on?) You can easily 45-60 just in dungeons if questing becomes impossible, you’ll just need to tank to find fast groups.
---
That mask has much sadness behind it
---
I’ve literally never gotten one. Multiple afternoons in Winterspring—zilch.
---
Sarcasm is so strong with this one I had to downvote it to show my appreciation.
---
No - that's just dumb. I think reality is absolutely complex enough that people who are/are not exposed to certain things can have vastly different outcomes. 
---
Your entire life can move down a different path just by meeting 1 particular person, or landing one particular job, or having one particular experience, ect ect. 
---
The only idiot here is you, and you are not better than them, as much as you'd like to be.
---
You dont have to buy any skill, its just the mount and it costs 900g
---
Make sure your internet drops out at least three times a day
---
Why? I'm already 60 and looking forward to it. Just stating it won't be like how it is was.
---
What? Um, no.  How does this make any sense from a gameplay standpoint.
---
Thanks bud!
---
No people were saying Phase 2 and 3 in actual vanilla were a month apart so its should be a month later.
---
Death Ray takes 240 gnomish to create which I believe is the highest gnomish created item that can be used by goblins.
---
Probably a low pop realm
---
Why are some people faster as a ghost (dead)?
---
there are a million videos if you just google it...
---
Too soon smh....
---
FUCK IM ONLY LVL 37
---
8-10 is p standard
---
only two that goblin engs cant use are the gadget teleporter and the world enlarger. The access to bombs outweighs the usefulness of these two
---
This sub’s quality took a slight nosedive after release...
---
Did you check if it's an FPS drop?
---
Thanks for sharing your story! Best wishes to you and your girlfriend!
---
Good ol Yaany.
---
They asked me to craft some of their Devilsaur stuff a while back, said they couldn't tip much.  I said whatever and did it.  Assumed it was for their main, I craft the stuff for bank alts all the time.
---
Then noticed them undercutting me on the AH all the time, very very quickly.  Declined when they asked me to make more.
---
They will undercut ANY price.  So once in a while I throw up a set of gauntlets for like 45g and wait for yaany to undercut and quickly pull mine off the AH before I go on my way to a dungeon or something.
---
I just undercut them via trade chat, way easier.  They have another account they work with that sells on trade chat.
---
So you can hit 60 twice on 3 hours playtime on average in 2 months? That's 180 hours to level 2 toons or 90 hours for one i.e 3 days 18 hours for 1-60.. Yeah, really slow paced world record speed..
---
Duuude, you don't even understand.
---
Experiencing the magic first time is much more fun than minmaxing. I'd trade it with you instantly, just to be in your shoes. And I think most classic wow players would.
---
There's no fun in putting the same ol items on AH on 35th alt. At least not to the same extent.
---
prices for certain mats were higher in the days leading to DM than they are now. problem is knowledge. everyone knows now.
---
Break use to by my favorite now it means bad neews
---
Use your hearthstone.
---
Did this shit 12 years ago. Wasn’t even new then
---
I'm just inventing PC's. Please slow down!
---
Resorting to petty name calling just makes your terrible argument even shittier. Basically "destiny" bullshit which is illogical. I never even said I'm better than anyone so check up on that dyslexia that you have.
---
If a person has an addictive or lazy personality, or whatever else, they are much more prone to failing and will LIKELY fuck up with something else if it wasn't this one video game. You can't just not get exposed to a million additive things in life lmao, what the fuck do you expect them to live in a bubble? Clown.
---
The idea is to save the oily blackmouth fish. I am saving all of mine until battlegrounds launch. Because nothing is more valuable on warsong gulch than a stack of free action potions. So I plan on auctioning off my oily blackmouth at that point for a good profit. I just sent them all to a bank alt for now.
---
i wish there was. Tell me if you discover.. this sub one month after release turned into not such a good sub anymore.. cant pinpoint it by i miss allthose threads without pictures
---
Farm gold and consumables, get rep for your professions, level your professions, farm recipes for them, help guildies, farm rep, gank the other faction etc
---
I leveled as shadow from 1-60 and healed some dungeons along the way but I think you could be ok if you put 5 points into Wand Specialization, 5 points into Spirit Tap, and the rest of your points anywhere you want.
---
Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap are the most important talents to help a priest kill faster and minimize down time.
---
its fine, only small percentage of players care about ranking up. and they probably aggregate into a certained areas where it will be easier to get honor. 
---
Many private servers launched with honor system from the get go (imagine that), and ppl still quested all the way through and played finely.
---
these supposed "honoring madness" is seriously overblowned. and rewards that reachable for most players aren't that worthy really. i mean excluding r13 r14, tier gear is on par.
---
So really most players don't realy care about ranks.
---
Still there maybe a hype for a week or two, but then it'll settle down and it gonna be pretty much as it was. Again apart form the certain areas like blackrock mountain where ppl gonna be farming honor.
---
I have a feeling that they're going to release WSG ahead of other Phase 3 content just like they did with dire maul. Reason being all lvl 48+ will be getting corpsecamped, so there will be a demand to get the PvPers into battlegrounds quicker. This also gives some new content to prolong Phase 2.
---
He framed or purchased from AH a reagent that was cheaper early on, and about to be very valuable. Now he is going to start selling, and make a lot of gold.
---
Night Elves turn into wisps which have faster movement speed.
---
If the only PvP you like is balanced team PvP, then a PvE server and BGs are for you. PvP servers are all about the imbalance and a sense of danger.
---
Why are you mad that she's so powerful? If it were someone else with the power, would that be better?
---
I can't read apparently
---
BWL isn't an issue, it actually came out only 2 months after the world first MC clear  in vanilla and only 5 months after EU release.
---
Also having farmed MC for months isn't a big advantage, most of MC's gear is trash and will be replaced in BWL quickly and you don't need it at all to clear BWL
---
MC is just not fun for top guilds they need something interesting, BWL can hold their interest for a while
---
They should keep a fast pace until BWL is out and then slow down
---
How? You can't wrap items that can be stacked and coal can be stacked.
---
I dont mind phase 2 in a couple weeks. Wouldnt have minded it in December either. Guess we will see phase 3 in March then.
---
Way better than the one topping the sub right now.
---
Thank you, I couldn’t find this direct answer anywhere.
---
xpacs will surely be their own set of servers, otherwise, we just go back down the "give us classic road"
---
At least I really hope they are. I've got time for Classic/TBC/Wrath all day but want them seperate.
---
If only you had been walking slowly away
---
Queues return on the 12th
---
Rate my setup :)

Too real, dude, too real.
---
It takes less than 3 hours to get to level 10... so probably joking
---
I'm glad you have so much free time.
---
Please someone tell Blizzard to wait with phase 2!
---
BGs might come out earlier just like Dire Maul ?
---
If you're in the 20s to early 40s, not a ton is going to change. But the enemies who may have been content to let you pass with a /wave or /nod a week ago, will now be more inclined to fight you, because there's now an incentive to doing so. But on the other hand, as more people are hitting 60, those areas are thinning out anyway. Just be prepared to fight or run when you do come across a red name.
---
If you're level 48 to 59 (or even a fresh 60), things will be worse, because level 60s will get honor points from you...and the people who have been gearing up and raiding for a few weeks now, with little else to do, *will* be coming out to find victims. In that case you may want to play during non-peak hours, or stick to dungeons during peak times...or just hope for the best. 
---
But honor points aren't a new concept, and millions of people were able to level in vanilla despite them being a thing. The idea that it'll be "impossible" is a typical Reddit overreaction.
---
Now upgrade that mic. Snowballs are shit
---
It's ok. You could line up the monitors better
---
&gt; out of content in less than a year
---
what did you expect? there is finite amount of classic content.
---
Classic is great for many reasons.. but there's a ton of great work implemented in retail. You'd have to be blind not to see it.
---
I get that it's bloated and the story has holes. Doesn't mean there's not also greatness in many areas.
---
The dead raid members near the whelp trench tell a story.
---
How did you forgot the magic dust? Free CC while you can heal or prepare a big dmg spell. You should buy mine finest hand made bio magic dust, 60% magic 60% dust, 120% useful. Buy your own in AH today!
---
You realize it's 2+ hours per day from release to 12th to get even close to what you're describing here? Even at blazing fast speed leveling times you'd have to have played on average more than an hour every single day to even be 60 on the 12th.
---
That isn't necessarily hardcore, but it doesn't seem realistic to expect the majority to have invested 4-5 hours every single day for 3 months like you probably have?
---
On the "back then" note, no one had full raids decked in pre-bis and MC/Ony epics ready to camp leveling zones 3 months into vanilla.
---
I get that you're bored, but you are putting a bizarre amount of time into the game.
---
It's not the game's fault you didn't listen when everyone told you lvling would be slow. Of course re-starting will be putting yourself behind everyone else. This isn't rocket surgery, buddy. You can still enjoy the game without crying like a little bitch about ganks. PvE servers exist. If you don't like being ganked, roll on a PvE server. You don't have to worry about being killed by players or having your game play interrupted in ways you don't want and  can fully immerse yourself in the adventure.
---
True. But the hit is the main focus and the crit is only a bonus if the player wants it.
---
Probably won't matter since you'll just get it banned for buying gold anyways.
---
images are full size and exactly as clear as actual WoW client at 1440p.
---
3 screenshots for 3 different servers at around the same time in the evening.
---
=)
---
I have exactly what u describe from elvui on retail but I dont use elvui for classic so idk if this helps
---
choice.
---
What is the cooldown on [Transmute: Elemental Fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25146/transmute-elemental-fire#comments)?
---
wowhead says 10 minutes but some people say it's shared with other transmutes
---
It's because people hate being pigeonholed into doing something.
---
Why don't you play a tank and be part of the solution instead?
---
Thanks! I think so too
---
no way its spooky there
---
Phase 2 and 3 were definitely more than a month
---
In action shot!
---
How long can people keep saying "the vast majority of folks aren't even 60?" 
---
 Come on dude. Be realistic. The majority of players are already 60. The curve has come and gone. The people still in their 40s leveling are WAY behind. 
---
I'm not knocking people for leveling slow, I'm just saying, let's stop acting like most people aren't 60 and for the love of god don't quote some 6 week old player census BS.
---
lmao, upvoted just for the comedy :)
---
definitely not. Palatanks help a lot but still.
---
2-3 mages? Your tank would get oneshotted by the 2pack felguards that cant be cced by mages
---
And the event with the 4 groups of orcs is hard as well without mages, so pick your poison.
---
Always a critic.
---
insightful
---
Incendius. Thankfully I am a tank (Feral druid). That's probably what I'll end up doing
---
There must be an internal issue with the keyrings, 99% of keys are levelling and P1, so holding it back is just a massive fuck you to our bag space otherwise
---
FYI Fade doesn't work in pvp.
---
Doesn't really matter, honestly, because all you need is that little push to get things rolling. Level 30 orc ain't gonna know the intricacies of the honor system, only that you are rewarded for killing the ally so they do it
---
No because it has lead you to exactly where you need to be.
---
Im just saying what I heard
---
It will be messy the first few days and all the popular areas will be camped during prime time. Life will go on eventually tho.
---
In before people try to pimp out their dying servers. 
---
Your options are: Gehen, Firemaw, Shazz or Golemagg. If you play alliance you will always get outnumbered 5 to 1 in the world. Have fun
---
I’m in the same boat. She is only lv42
---
I asked the group I play with, who knew more about the game than me, and they all said it would be fine. Sorry I didn't come check with you directly. That was my mistake and I should have been more responsible.
---
gyg
---
My guild has 2 shadow priests right now including me. I'm only at 56, other guy hit 60 yesterday. But I *did* out-dps him in brd yesterday too (we had 3 priests including the healer lol). It might not actually be a competition to get a spot between us though because we probably have a big enough guild to have 2 separate runs
---
Now that I think about it more, I think we might have used mining picks. Either way, it was just some worthless item in wrapping paper. I think they eventually changed it so that you couldn't mail giftwrapped items but I'm positive it worked at one point.
---
Yes it's literally impossible to play in contested zones. The only way to get levels is to grind boars in your starting zone
---
Feels very ad filled but ya was a 'hard'  20 question quiz. Kinda click bait imo.
---
During p2 ranking on a healthy realm, ~5g per pot
---
woo! as an ally jealous of the wolf mounts.. they have floppy cheeks! so cute!
---
**Not a post to complaint about the release of Phase 2** I don't play very casually but in retrospect having my girlfriend's first experience playing WoW be on a PvP server may have been a bad idea.
---
Do you think there'll be *any* changes to it? I don't care that I won't get R14 but I do have genuine health concerns for many players, it simply doesn't promote good health at all as it was in vanilla.
---
Much rather it was a skill-based system than a grind until you die, or cheat, system.
---
Thanks! And yes, it's done with a pen. But below that, is the same layer on pencil, then I do it on pen :p and then... I use my finger to erase the pencil creating shadow, and rubber for light.
---
Zeal+mirah
---
i was implying shadowform :/
---
and have your epic mount!
---
So pally's typically don't declare their off-spec needs at the start of the group, and just roll on multiple specs during the run? I just am trying to learn the expectation of playing with hybrid classes.
---
Oh snap really! I got the idea that 60s were just killing everything - atleast there is some discretion
---
Yea. Though it isn't needed if you have good healers
---
More for me ;)
---
I see a sperm. Theramore being the body and the path being the tail.
---
Is it seriously gonna be that bad for lower levels. Im level 45 and all these comments are making me a little nervous, im literally not gonna be able to quest? Why did i reroll at lvl 25 three times im so godamn stupid.
---
No you can’t. Gold only tradable in your faction, that’s why people get pissy when their server is favoured in horde or alliance side because that means they will have a better economy.
---
I'm totally aware of timing CD's with a double sader proc if viable, but any tips that I might be missing on weapon attack timer?
---
I followed the wowlive guide and im standing at 58 with 5 Days 20 hours.
---
any daggers at all
---
we got mageblade and the leaf on our first night tho
---
2 people rolled greed actually. But I had this drop in a brd group too yesterday. Before anybody rolled I just typed out "everybody need". It's the easiest way to make sure nobody ninjas (I lost the roll btw)
---
Like I said, I don’t think it’s need any of the things i listed attached to it. But the #nochange crowd cry very loudly about any changes. This way there’s at least some gating to it.
---
Can I run from Stormwind to Booty Bay on lvl 19 rogue?
---
You are right once you have Reck but it's not available at every boss
---
There's a lot of talk about laziness, but if everyone blamed their issues on laziness - how could we as a society analyze underlying problems and come up with solutions? The excuse is lazy in itself (haha).
---
In my case I think it's emotional neglect as a kid that led me to choose games over my parents while really young- and indeed my parents suffered much more severe neglect from their parents. Society is moving faster forward now than during any time of history, so I'm hopeful solutions may not be 100 years away.
---
You know damn well they won't.
---
Sounds like you should reroll then. One of the main reasons people play classic is because you can do what you find is fun, without feeling like there's a checklist of things to be doing once a week (ehem, dailies...). If you're bored of playing, quit. If your server is dead, move. If you are still having fun, keep on going!  Complaining about the release of phases will do nothing to remedy what you're feeling. Make your own fun my dude!
---
You really don’t need that much gold to play at a relatively high level, at a certain point people just like messing with the economy and making lots of it.
---
Down by the coast closest to the Wormbog theres actually a section you can get over. A mountian pass. It's by the Crraaaab People. Craaaab people. Look like crab.
---
The trade off with the usual pre raid BiS sets is that they are pretty hot swappable with upgrades. Your kinda locked into that 6pc and without it your dps falls off
---
It's literally like 2ish hours/day on average, even with a full time job that's more than doable...
---
Didn't alliance just get 2 new races announced?
---
Shadowmeld?
---
What are your key schematics?
---
Yes. It will be slow going and possibly painful, but yes. Just take the road all the way. At least you'll have the flight path for later!
---
My memory isn't perfect and I leveled like an idiot and insanely slowly back in vanilla, but there was definitely honor way before I hit 60 back then and it was fine.  People are blowing this out of proportion just like they do with every announcement.  Like how they thought sharding would destroy the game and never go away.  But anyways I would love for them to just release WSG right now.
---
We're down to 12min Onyxia and 1.5hr MC and this is TOO fast of a release.
---
Getting kind of late.  Everybody is asking what you are and there is likely to be oversupply that will actually drop prices drastically early on.
---
just pull mobs into his blizzard, because he wont have mana to deal with them. easy kill, -10% durability and a corpse run
---
Yeah ours isn't terrible. We'll see how it scales.
---
That's the same way I went from windows 7 to windows 10. Without my permission.
---
they said layers have to be gone by the time of phase 2 because of world bosses.
---
they also said multiple times that their plan was to be rid of layers [before](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760) phase 2.
---
&gt;First, we’re absolutely committed to reducing to one layer per realm before our second content phase goes live, and the sooner we can get there, the better.
---
ion also actually [promised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=357&amp;v=jYuUD0o-Nz8) (6m) it would take only a few weeks
---
As a member of Kor’kron Guard I am so happy this has been shared , more knowledge about the alliance has been given out and it’ll be even easier to start wars ! MOK’GRA
---
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Or maybe it’s reversed.  BWL before BGs.
---
I recently quit Classic for similar reasons. I already have 2 60s, and I was playing for about 14 hours a day. And this isn’t the first time I’ve played too much. Finally I decided I’m never playing wow, or any other games for that matter, every again, and instead working to improve myself every day.
---
Since the day I quit, it’s like a massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders, and my motivation to do everything meaningful that I was neglecting for classic has skyrocketed.
---
y
---
This is not too soon. We need pvp honor system. We don’t need phase 3 for another few months, though.
---
You’ll have to actually damage an enemy to get honor from the kill.
---
[Here](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6d95ff322296cee8d8e374d79881de6/ebcc67460290ca97-ce/s640x960/30ab3e2b25f4b8671839def86850c5dcd5fce913.jpg) fixed that for you
---
Everyone over here talking about the honor system and what not, and I'm just like bring on the fishing extravaganza
---
Yeah Whitemane seems pretty 50/50 to me
---
Why can’t people enjoy PvP but also acknowledge one of the few inconveniences of a PvP server? Do you truly believe that people play in PvP servers because they enjoy corpse runs?
---
What are we supposed to be looking at here?
---
Why don’t you like that?
---
Ah yes Gnomish Cloaking Device
---
Of course I'll call people who DIE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME idiots, because it is idiotic by definition. Literally anyone is better than them at that point.
---
You're literally implying that most people with this personality would take 1 thing to change their whole life as if it was their destiny, you're so full of illogical shit. Most people would find something else that's addicting, that's the truth and most likely scenario. Not playing one shitty video game won't cause their whole life/way of thinking to change. 
---
&gt;its definitely possible (though not likely) you could have a person who would have become a doctor if they hadn't found WoW.
---
Making specs viable by pigeonholing them into a small gearing corner makes them pretty shallow classes in terms of potential theory crafting.
---
If we're keeping with vanilla style, we need a nice vomit of items varying in quality to let players decide which is the best to have.
---
Free Action and health potions are a really safe bet.
---
You are probably low parse since you're specd for aoe. Every mage should be AP frost except for 1 or 2 for winter's chill.
---
How much crit%? 16-18% crit for me. I’m at 60 running mix plate leather mail. Have like 50%bis gear. Usually the yetis don’t take me that long. Just wondering where the diff in dam is coming from
---
Blackrock Mountain gonna be LIT
---
Blue sapphire seems way more rare to me. Have gotten around 20 crystals but no sapphires
---
for spicy mages replace the image with edgy frostbolt
---
1 person rolled greed. We were 4
---
Dead trees and big stinky mushrooms. But those sun shafts though!
---
Literally everyone there is not flagged for PVP, so the attack was 100% ineffective.
---
[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Target\_markers](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Target_markers)  
---
The macros on this page does something like that but its manual, not automatic... pretty much manual cycling through markers on the target your cursor is over. If I understand it correctly.
---
I've tinkered around with a couple UI add-ones, and I always come back to [Titan Panel Classic.](https://i.imgur.com/2i99ePb.jpg)  Let's you toggle and re-size almost everything - Combat log up over my portrait, both portraits moveable as well, chat window resizeable and moveable, etc.  It's good stuff.
---
So it gets bad mainly from level 50 onward? Dungeons are a good idea
---
I go:
---
5/1/0
---
0/5/0/2
---
0/0/2
---
5/0
---
1/3
---
Damn and here i thought i had time to level an alliance alt on stalagg
---
I’m not really sure I understand your question, but if you asking about the fastest way to level from 30-40 that’s definitely SM runs. You can start with grave yard at high 20s then lib at low 30s, arms at mid 30s catch at high 30s. 
---
If I misunderstood and you asking how to level till 30, rfc from lvl 15, WC from 18, and sfk from low to mid 20s till you hit 30.
---
If you meet some random stranger I don’t think he will mess with you unless he outlevels you or he has someone else with him.  With that being said there will probably hunting parties.  Probably a group of 5 players that just roam around looking for solo questers.
---
Don't worry shadow priests get ignored for like all of classic outside of anathema and pvp gear.
---
Yeah I typically charge in SS then whirlwind then switch to sword and board ant tank. That’s probably the standard arms tanking rotation. Can you send fury/prot spec?
---
I’ve just completed [Into The Scarlet Monastery](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1048/into-the-scarlet-monastery) on my 36 rogue. Do I take the sword or the necklace? Am I right in thinking both my weapons will be replaced in Arathi soon anyway? Quests give [Silent Hunter](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=679/call-to-arms) &amp; [Sword Of Hammerfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=680/the-real-threat).
---
I currently have [Outlaw Sabre](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16886/outlaw-sabre)  &amp; [Murphstar of the Monkey](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1207/murphstar), with no necklace.
---
People who attack gain mana, this is a useful debuff that's a dps improvement for most of the raid
---
Any time you ask this sort of thing, you need to first explain what your model is.
---
I think the problem with most of the guides on the web is that they have a completely screwy healing model. They're advising gearing/specs based on someone who only ever logs on for raids, is never called upon to provide any utility (beyond dropping totems) and is concerned about their average performance across bosses/trash rather than their performance in the situations where performance actually matters.
---
There's only one talent in Resto that I'd never take under any circumstance: **Healing Grace**. This is a comically bad talent and pretty much everyone who takes it does so because they don't understand how threat works. The only advantage taking Healing Grace confers is that when your raid screws up, the *other* healer gets killed first. Indeed, the fact that some healer is going to get killed strongly implies that it's a 'negative value' talent - you'd much rather your Mail &amp; Shield healer get slapped in the head than your Cloth &amp; Staff healer.
---
**Totemic Mastery** is strictly based on gear. If you're a pure Resto, you're probably going for 8-set T1. 3-set T1 duplicates this talent, so most Resto Shaman who are more than a few weeks into MC don't have it.
---
**Nature's Guidance** is really a question of "are you playing a healer or a shaman?". Nature's Guidance is one of the best bang-for-the-buck talents in the entire tree but it's completely useless if you're not using the full toolkit. If you're only ever going to raid, you can probably skip it - most guilds won't be having their Resto Shaman interrupt spells or slow mobs (even when they should). If you plan on ever running content outside of a raid, it's absolutely essential. A single Earth Shock can save thousands of points of damage you'd otherwise need to heal.
---
**Healing Focus** is another one of those "do you only log on to raid?" talents. It's just not very useful in most raids because getting pushed back probably means getting killed. In 5-man, it's critical and I wouldn't even bother playing a Resto Shaman in such circumstances without it.
---
**Tidal Mastery** is another easily skipped talent. Criticals for heals are only +50% and they're even worse than that due to overhealing. While it does work with Ancestral Healing, it's just not worth the expense if you've got any other options.
---
**Ancestral Knowledge** (in Enhancement) is a commonly taken talent, but it should only be thought of as some place to dump talent points that you have no better use for. 5% more mana translates into more like 2.5% more healing since half your mana comes from places that aren't your base mana pool. In terms of impact/talent point, this makes it less effective than Tidal Mastery.
---
Personally, I tend to view 12/0/39 as a 'sweet spot' for a general purpose PvE Resto spec. You have to sacrifice some on the Resto side, but you get 10% more effective hit points against raid damage and the ability to contribute some extra damage with near-zero mana.
---
I was asking for what’s going to give the best stuff outside of XP. 
---
Answer still might be SM runs, but is it greens and blues and silk from SM or is it some furbolg camp that I’ve never heard of where they drop some rare enchanting recipe and rep turn ins.
---
Im not quite sure but I if I remember correctly its somewhere along the lines of buff &amp; debuff register and some option to show cds or cds with bars
---
There is no trade off because with dagger specc the 6 piece bonus is straigt up better than swapping for t-pieces. Even 4 pieces is better than the p-server BiS list
---
No ninja looting, just another case of failure to communicate.
---
Paladin didn't say that he'd roll on off-spec gear, warrior didn't mention that HoJ was effectively reserved for him.
---
You're good, I come across as harsh when I get too playful, my bad.
---
/cast feint
---
\*Everbloom intensifies\*
---
You're trying so hard but getting nowhere. You're pathetic. Why don't you **LITERALLY** (you seem to like that word) go fuck yourself. Ahahahaaaaaa
---
The PvP changes were the worst thing about it
---
Is it actually lag, or perhaps a video issue? (i.e., when was the last time you updated your drivers?)
---
Played a bunch at launch but was offline all of October for work. Looking to come back and reroll. Now that we're phase 2, what are the decent PvP servers that have a reasonable population and decent H/A ratio?
---
If you plan to raid up to Naxx, it is wise to do your best to rotate tanks and keep a big roster of them. There is a fight that essentially requires 8 very geared tanks.
---
Just make sure you always have someone who can make use of tank drops in your raids. It might be a good idea to find out which DPS warriors are most able to and most willing to tank, and pass extra tank gear to them / give them chances to MT for experience.
---
Yell it for the 48-59s in the back.  Preach!  This is a terrible decision.
---
If you die on the boat don't release cause when you load in new continent you rez.
---
yeah and most of those didn't get time to gear up for pvp/get pvp specs/professions.They are rushing it for streamers and top 10-20 %
---
No one knows as this is the first time ever happening. People who claim to know how it will be are not only fools but assuming without it ever being done before. More players than private servers, different than all other iterations of WoW. Whoever told you this shouldn’t be listened to for any advice.
---
I played a rogue from BC till WoD I know about all the juicy rotations we had before was more so curious about the vanilla rotation, didn't know rupture wasn't a part of it haha
---
Me too, helped me through all of school
---
OP is an absolute masochist.
---
As someone who is new, let me tell you think about this hard. Do you plan on Alliance or Horde? If horde, pvp isn't as big of a deal since most PvP servers are horde majority. Do you enjoy ganking others randomly? If you don't, then roll pve, because then the only thing you're missing out on is getting ganked and corpse camped by others, or dying multiple times running to dungeons.
---
I wish I would've known before rolling alliance on a pvp server that it's basically hard mode.
---
Fastest weapons possible, raptor strike, mongoose bite, and most importantly explosive traps during fight after tank grabs agro.
---
I used claws and daggers.
---
Follow that build. Invest in the BM tree first, then move to the Survival tree. 
---
Cat pet, 1.3 or faster.
---
man this is really cool makes me kinda wanna play on the server
---
What everyone is saying about Shadow until 55 for lvling and still being able to heal is true. Absolutely best approach.
---
You edited several of your posts because you can't put everything you mean to say down at once, you have to think about it and then come back with genius retorts like 
---
&gt; Please, you couldn't even eviscerate a 3rd grader in a debate if you tried lmao.
---
Oof, yeah I'll be nursing that one for a looong time. 
---
Run along now!!!
---
I wasn't saying it's unfair for a millionaire to win a small amount of money, I was saying it's not nearly as big of a win to them as it would be to other people, I was using it to simplify me previous point of how 500g to someone with BIS gear that needs nothing but the occasional health pot is nothing compared to 500g to a newly leveled 60.
---
When I PUG I expect people to be friendly and share stuff out fairly, once again there's nothing fair about having a full pre-raid BIS geared character win something they don't need just to sell when a tank could use it as a massive upgrade, one wants it for money and the other needs it as an item. When you ran DM East with your guilds main tank 73 times if you had some random person in the group need the book when it dropped and won it to sell you'd be rightfully disgusted, as would anyone else, that's because what was 73 runs for you could have been 1 for them, and they got it immediately. That's why running it as a guild you'd have a different loot system, the system I propose of people needing what they need and greeding what they want to sell, the 'need everything' system doesn't work well in guilds, so why is it acceptable in pugs, because you don't know the people or because there's no consequences for your actions?
---
The loot system is completely chosen by the community, but the 'need everything' system is just a weak solution to combat ninjas by making everyone a ninja, it doesn't consider the needs of people or the strength of their characters, it doesn't consider how long people have farmed for an item or how hard people have searched for an item. When I was levelling I always hosted the dungeons since I was already grouped with 2 other people, we would find 2 other dps and get started, there was one person who needed literally every green that dropped no matter what, when I asked him why his reasoning was "I need the gold for my mount", there were greens that other people including myself in the group actually needed on that he won, just so he could sell them to the vendor, I kicked him half way through and he started throwing flak at me as if I did something wrong, and honestly I did do something wrong, I inviting a greedy ninja that had no right joining any group content with that selfish mentality of Me &gt;&gt;&gt; everyone else.
---
I guarantee that most people who run dungeons as a guild use the need before greed system.
---
Can't wait to get griefed by no-lifers from 48-60.  Gonna be soooo fun!
---
Wandering around aimlessly? A lot of people love grinding gold in this game. What does that entail? Traveling to different zones to grind. When doing this you get a lot of organic WPVP.
---
Make sure you don't have wow head open... on my browser it uses up to 100% of my memory and lags my game out if I leave it open.
---
I don't think it's FPS because it's just hanging spells, people running in place, I'm still able to move - then boom everything speeds up to get back into place.
---
Man, I miss AVR.
---
Someone drew a giant penis or something in either toc or below the frozen throne.  It wasn't mature, but gave me a chuckle
---
They'll kill you anyway just to make sure you don't interfere in a PvP fight nearby.
---
But you gotta take the bad with the good. Corps camping is gonna happen, camping in general is going to happen, everyone will eventually do it for w/e reason for maybe short or long period of time. I dont see the point of moaning about it. 
---
Camping already happens now. Without honor systems. At BRD, L/UBRS. You will eventually drive the horde out or you have to res 2 extra times to get into the dungeon if there are too many. Thats the game.
---
The meta game is wildly different than it was 14.5 years ago. Server populations are also fucking stacked this time around and layering will be completely gone. It MIGHT be an issue this time around.
---
If you are daggers then definitely. If swords then 4 pieces is still alright. The 35 energy procc happens rather regularly. I read that it’s about 2ppm, which seems to be about right. And the extra energy is just great, especially for daggers.
---
Nothing you do now will affect anything at max level.
---
Do other healers in the raid need it for it to work or can I just run it in a pug
---
honestly the raid mechanics from TBC compared to classic are drastic. a lot of fights in TBC require a lot of coordination and precise positioning. look up the tempest keep kael thas fight, one of the hardest to pull off imo. i remember using a warlock tank standing in the back to tank one of the adds, also a mage tank used in black temple. TBC has some of my favorite raids hands down
---
That's pretty smart really. Printout sheets of magnets that have blueprints or camera framing of planned sets, with some interchangeable ones for character or props.  
---
Place them, take a photo, move them, take a photo. Add captions and print them out or display them digitally.  
---
If anyone here has done any filming, you know how useful storyboard sketches are. Depending on the scale of your project, something like this could save time and have more detail than crudely drawn stick figures or outlines.  
---
I could see using something like this for The Witcher series, that is big production value and time investment.  
---
I am sure they do a lot of this digitally as well, with predrawn layers they can paste and resize into various scenes, but there is something to be said about hands on manipulation. Plus it would be much easier to reference during table reads and such as you can have the magnets "acting" things out during the lines.
---
Hmm, well, I think it's just state of my gear now and squeezing as much as possible out from my build. 
---
I have the Accurascope so I don't need those 3 points any more, plus stuff like T1 shoulders / greaves / Ony neck should help you out eventually. Definitely get IAotH once you can.
---
As for pet damage, I guess you're right, pets don't really do much, but I can't see myself squeezing more from the points, that additional 16% actually translated to about 1% more overall boss damage for me, and that's 1% I can't squeeze out anywhere else. (I'm hitting 96/97 percentiles so I think I'm on to something!)
---
What do u suggest?
---
well yeah, what else is there to do in this game lol
---
It auto down ranks on dominoes
---
Oh wow, so mature. A word of advice: you probably still have many years to live, but classic is only here now. Maybe for another year or two, but it's not going to be long. If you choose to not keep up in classic now, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.
---
6/10.
---
The far north area of felwood I found to be the best area to farm.
---
Friend of a friend asked us to show him brd so he could tank it in the future. Long story short there is a 50 warrior out there that doesn't even remotely know what he just got, and can't even use it for two more levels...
---
Yeah, that's because you cant get it until 35 or 40ish, so there aren't low lvl ranks.
---
Go look at important items that are coming out, and which materials will be needed for them. Try and think in terms of which items everyone will want to buy as quickly as possible. Don't be scared to hold for 8-10 months in advance.
---
i've got to say a pocket healer and yellow/orange quests are much more efficient.
---
timing SS and backstab to hit JUST after MH autoattack nets 6-10% (depening on gear and faction) more dps than someone just spamming SS/backstab without thinking about autoattack timer. Due to how 'grants an extra attack' proc works.
---
How's the honor work exactly? Just earn more to buy gear?
---
Just like its namesake, it’s nowhere to be seen!
---
I want to tank on my paladin for 5 man groups hoj+thrash blade flurry axe or ironfoe is great for the extra white attack that also applies seal of the righteous dmg which is holy damage and holy damage is the main source of aggro. Aslo great for ret with seal of command so it's a valid need and he should not be harrased by contacting his gm because loot rules were not set before the run. If he didn't heal the boss would not have died.
---
Spirit does, it's just that you get rank one as a talent much later, so there isnt anything below rank 1 to put on the low lvls.
---
you must not be selling any cars then, especially if you're playing avg 5-6hrs a day. I sold cars for many years, and the last thing, the very last thing I ever had, was time.
---
He was on my server in TBC, his guild was basically a laughing stock because they were constantly doing low effort troll shit and acting like idiots 
---
They ended up transferring off
---
When I say older style RPGs I don't mean MMORPGs. This is the first MMORPG I've ever played. I'm talking about games like Morrowind (which I know isn't among the earliest RPGs, but relative to today's standards a lot about the gameplay is pretty dated). Morrowind is my all-time favorite game and the reason I like WoW so much is that it reminds of Morrowind in a lot of ways, but I can also play it with friends and do PvP against other players.
---
I am a level 49 frost mage. Which one should I choose?
---
 Zum 'rah's Vexing Cane (10 intellect/stamina w/increases dmg and healing by magic up to 21) 
---
Charstone Dirk (11 intellect w/restores 2 mana per 5 sec) with the Cloud Stone (10 int, 10 spirit, 10 arcane resis)
---
Lol! You are so fucking right! /jobquit
---
Honestly i dont know why people pass off leveling as Disc/Holy to suck, or even be sub optimal. Im currently 53 and have leveled the whole way as Disc/Holy healing a lot of dungeons. The extra bonuses from talents aren't necessary but sure are nice - especially ZF onward when pulls going south or squishy tanks can easily cause a wipe. 15% mana regen at all times? Heck yeah! Give your tank 25% extra armor when you crit heal them? You bet! 70% chance to ignore push back from mobs when healing because your tank lost aggro or your group pulled pats? Life saver!
---
Questing isn't even bad either - sure you dont havr mindflay but you *can still use Smite and Holy Fire* since you aren't in Shadow form which both do decent damage. I could count on one hand the amount of times I've died and/or had to stop to drink while questing since level 45. Yes you aren't as tanky as a Shadow Priest but you easily have the option the pop off a Flash Heal (likely without any push back) in a pinch. Heck, i have literally won a gank against a ?? opposite faction shadow priest because i could easily heal myself through their spells until they go OOM and there i am at 70% mana and full health.
---
**TLDR** in my experience the questing isn't any worse or slower, and healing dungeons is that much easier.
---
Damn Ubers hahahahaha made my day! xD
---
Maybe he is just heavy into to transmogs
---
Not this far.  Average is 6-7 days with hardly any rest xp.  Throw in rest xp over last 2 months and 120hours at lvl 40 is standing around doing nothing most of the time or hes not logging at inns.
---
But if someone even acknowledges that the bad exists, they will be told they shouldn’t have picked PvP.
---
Your rules don't defeat ANY of my specific examples.
---
People can still pass on Sorcerous dagger, which is an upgrade compared to every single main hand spell weapon pre-raid.
---
People can still bid on mageblade after winning the Staff of Dominance.
---
The hunters can still bid very low or pass on tier pieces to dump all the DKP on weapons far more useful for Rogues and warriors.
---
Resto druids can still take Choker of the fire lord as a minor upgrade.
---
DKP per hour incentive intentionally slowing down the raid in order for members showing, to gain a real DKP advantage over people that for whatever reason could not show.  
---
Dowsing* is not optional bonus, EVERY SINGLE PERSON shows with the ability to Dowse.
---
Anyone else read that I'm bitter about my life choices?  Seems to be a common misunderstanding.  I have no concerns over my playtime.  I'm just stating facts that not everyone has lots of time each day.
---
1 hour per day would be 3 days and 6 hours, an hour faster than Jokerd, is it reasonable to expect the majority to do that? 
---
7 days /played is roughly 2:30 per day as I said in my previous post. If you had that 2-3 weeks ago you're getting close to the 4 hours I mentioned too.
---
You either suck at maths or have little understanding of how much you've played. I realize I have spent a bizarre amount of time on the game, I'm OK with that, I just don't think it's reasonable to think the majority of players should have 2+ hours played per day on average to keep up with content.
---
I never understand this argument. Casual players aren’t concerned with what raid tiers are out they are casual just enjoying the game. The more content released the more things there are for casuals to do it’s a win win for everyone.
---
You think you do but you dont
---
Yes, elemental is more viable. 
---
Honestly, it's not mandatory that you swap specs, but you do need to find a more laid-back raid. As others have mentioned, due to the debuff cap on bosses, you won't be frost/flame shocking, and your rotation may be boring. But if it's how you want to play, I say pursue it. Just be prepared to get some "no" answers, and keep looking.
---
I wanted to experience the game first-hand and not go into it already knowing everything about it.
---
And your raid is wiping on those bosses if you can't maximise your damage? In all seriousness, it's great to get the best dmg out of your gear, but right now the content is MC/Ony, for which you don't even need a full raid or epics and still won't struggle at all. It won't hurt the raid if you do 1% less dmg. If you want to farm dm solo, you can go without improved FD, but I got so frustrated after dying of trash packs because of resists that I just said fuck it, and now I do 1% less dmg.
---
When twinking has gone too far
---
The wow community should pull its collective head out of its ass, and allow non game breaking changes, allow bug fixes. The no changes people are assholes
---
For threat it's superior to Mirah's.
---
When it procs, it gives a significant boost to rage.
---
Just pointing out that you are not a casual by default because of joining a wow classic reddit. 
---
While I don't agree with people demanding special care for the very casual audience, your description shows that you are quite experienced in levelling - meaning you save tons of time by knowing how to reach 60
---
I got both dal rends within 10 runs
---
I'm using a macro to check latency so I don't know how reliable it is but my ms will go from anywhere between 20-235 and it's still doing the hanging no matter what it is. It seems particularly bad in scholo but it happens in cities and outdoors too. It's just a recent problem so I don't know why it has started all of a sudden. As I mention below it's very typical of latency and not video as everyone runs in place, spells hang, then it zooms back into place.
---
You sure are!
---
shout out to Hammersong. 
---
FOR CLAN AND THANE!!
---
Most of us normal people with a real lives (most who are probably not even here on reddit) are not 60 yet. Shit is way too rushed. You rushed and did all the content already. Well bu-fucking hu. Worlds smallest violin. Go play some other game meanwhile then.
