playing p servers leveling as a priest I felt like oprah giving out fortitudes. Most people would take their time and whisper me thanking me. I loved finding hunter and warlocks because I could throw out 2 fortitudes at once.

The Beta Server is absolutely horrible. 80% of Players there are Americans, which means if you play during EU Times you have a hard time finding anyone. 
---
And then there are the fucking Streamers. Its fucking horrible, but at least I know Release will be better.
---
Yes
---
The server will be largely made up of fans of said streamer, when they have 30k+ viewers. If even a portion of those viewers join the same server, said streamers name will be in chat logs all the damn time.
---
ya true, but you could also take your time thru any zone in wow and have a lot of fun immersing urself even today. player mindset is so crucial to experience in mmos.
---
the patch in wotlk where they buffed titans grip was the closest thing to the feeling of being an overgeared pvp warrior in vanilla.
---
2 shotting cloth is not uncommon if you have gear, and many of the moving utilities arent really needed, since the other classes are lacking them too.
---
the frost trinket was basically the proto spell reflect, and pallies do shit for damage so you can just ignore their bubble.
---
if you played arena, pvp is more chaotic in vanilla and requires a much more adaptive playstyle. (i.e. trinketing at a "sub optimal" time, can often screw your oponents game plan up enough to land 1-2 extra hits which is generally all it takes to win if you are geared)
---

You only need the talent for increasing your Holy light and flash of light. Saving mana with illumination doesn't really matter, your basically have infinite mana. The 5% crit talent only gives a 2.5% bonus to healing effectiveness, and it's often over healing.

---
Because he asks to submit a bug because he remembers it differently in vanilla?  What?
---
rewards are subjective. check out the op, he is extremely eager and excited for to grind out a low res frostsaber mount. im the same way, when theres something i want i will happily do whatever grind to get it.
---
because its in the honeymoon phase?
---
or because like you, most players never actually got to experience vanilla and would like to for the first time.
---
when they have to fight with 900 other people to get an herb they can sell for half a percent of their epic mount and there is nothing else for them to do to get that epic mount, a lot of them are gonna quit there too.

I've had a hunter of every vanilla race. Each has their small perks, or disadvantages but it was never a make or break thing. If you roll a Dwarf Huntress, you'll be the rarest creature in all of Azeroth.  
---
...on the downside of that, I did stop logging into my Dwarf Hunter after some dude decided to hit on me OOCly while talking about how hot my dwarf lady was. Weird ass shit.
---
Thank you
---
I actually tried it on a trial account (haven't played properly since wotlk) and I got bored after a couple hours. The world felt so fake.
---
Wait now I’m really confused... now you’re saying that this guy actually found the private server user because he tamed a pet?  Wtf even if you’re making a joke it’s a very bad one
---
Is he saying “sorry Raid leader, I don’t heal because I’m a ret paladin.”
---
Nah just want to experience it, not looking to just race through it

Awesome list man.
---
I'm really contemplating Mage as well, purely based on how clutch their utility can be. I remember being so jealous of them as a lowly hunter in vanilla. I feel like half my time spent in that damn game was sitting at the dock at Ratchet or Booty Bay waiting for a boat. Or buying stacks of cheese and fish for my pets. Its not like the hunter dps rotation is all that more complicated than any other dps spec. Making my own food and being able to open wormholes to cities sounds pretty dope. Its an excuse to take up tailoring as well since bags were...an issue back then.
---
We shall see I guess. I don't plan on raiding, probably doing that god awful tier .5 chain will be my end game. I have to sit back and think about what I would roll after that. I have fond memories of enhancement shammy but I don't think I took that much past SM and Mograine's Might. All my choices are pretty easy though because I suspect I will never touch BWL let alone Naxx. 5mans have always been the most enjoyable part of wow for me and there's a lot of wiggle room in playing the game to suit your own tastes there.

What are you... Are you smoking something? I'm saying the op of this thread pointed out what he thinks is a bug because it's not a vanilla feature, but it could be a feature on a private server. I'm jokingly saying that he found out that the OP is actually playing on a private server. No need to be rude.

THIS is accurate

He should pause his bench.

Engineering has some fun items such as gnomish death ray (might kill you too), frost or fire reflect trinkets, stun grenades.

I had a lot of fun with mage in world pvp. Especially at lower levels getting tons of enemy players to chase you up mountains and then slide down only to blink and take no fall damage or use slow fall. Most of the enemy players would fall to their deaths.
---
On hunter it was fun to hide and take control of your pet to harass other players as they couldn’t find you. You could also do this in dungeons and other places to drag mobs away so your hunter could run past and feign death.
---
Priests have mind control as an ability. That was always fun to use and have players jump off high places to their deaths.

No, purely because dwarves can't be locks and I respect this guild too much to not be a dwarf.

He says it was a good idea to "hold back PVP until post-launch", but PVP was in the game in beta and at launch, there was just no honor system. Why would he think it was "un-fun" in late beta but not in 1.4 when it was released? **Class design hardly changed at all between release and 1.4.** I PVPed every opportunity I got, even before the honor system. I thought it was great fun. What the hell is he even talking about?
---
Also, I don't know how involved he was with class design, but it really appears to me that abilities in vanilla were designed with PVP in mind, and I have a hard time believing that it wasn't. The scarcity of instant casts and the general design of mobility, interrupts, and damage levels in general all suggest PVP was kept in mind throughout class development.
---
Vanilla had a very late open beta capped at 15 or so, basically a demo.  Classic likely will not.
---
Where are you getting the idea that there will be 6 servers? They will have servers based on how many they think they will end up with, and layering allows them to have as many 3k "Layers" as they need for initial population and then merge down when the tourists leave. 
---
At the end of the day there is nothing but downside to having more than normal vanilla pop caps because the game was designed around only that many people existing in the world at a time. They have not even hinted at making big changes to core systems, and have been shooting for authenticity. Why would they make a huge change like that with nothing but downsides?

Ok Tard, please ask your caregiver to help you with reading comprehension.  The title says "Mark Kern's stream ...interested in the game's development."

In said video, he is leveling a new character during what looks to be the classic beta.  He is killing the wrong mobs (supposed to kill vermin not workers) and making other obvious mistakes.  He is surprised how some of the things work, and generally doesn't seem to know a lot about what is going on.  Other than the children were named after some of the developers.

From his wiki "Mark E. Kern is an American video game designer best known for being a team lead on the video game World of Warcraft and a founder of Red 5 Studios.[1] "

Not nearly the same. Have to make or buy those and my God anything blacksmithing or engineering was expensive

Ya I still doubt I'd notice them. Idk who they are now I don't see that changing when I have less free time playing classic.

Not possible, you can't tame a beast higher level than you. Weird flex but alright

&gt;If healers could keep up a Druid with a boss on 5% parry (they could), then they can keep up a Druid with a boss on 14% parry. It's not an issue.
---
I'm not following this logic.  Because healers can heal a druid in an easier setting, they thus can heal the druid in a much more difficult setting?  One does not follow the other.
---
By "holding back PVP until post-launch" I assume he's referring to the honor system and how to structure PVP progression and rewards, not players being able to kill each other.
---
Maybe they had a different system in place that he wasn't happy with and they scrapped it, but didn't have anything good to replace it with in time for launch. Then post-launch they built the honor system that he liked.
---
Would Warcraft have been even more popular if blizzard had stuck with the classic principles through burning Crusade? Through wrath? Through cataclysm?
---
There are any number of reasons why subscriptions increased between classic end burning Crusade, and then again into wrath. And then after cataclysm began to drop sharply as we saw the player totals really fluctuate, go up for a new expansion then drop back down.
---
As I like to put it, the more expansions a player experiences, in general, it will reach the point of burnout or general dissatisfaction or boredom with that expansion earlier and earlier in the expansions progression. 7 months for Pandaria, 6 months for Draenor, 5 months for Legion, and so on. Diminishing returns, tolerance, call it what you will. With the restart of classic blizzard does have a unique opportunity to try something different, to be more cognizant of specific gameplay principles of classic and they could choose to work harder to adhere to those in future content and expansion releases, this would of course significantly change what we know this future expansions to be. And it's for that reason that I question if making those changes to bring burning Crusade and Wrath more into line with what classic was, I question if that is something blizzard would actually do. If we are going strictly by historic subscriber numbers, blizzard should expect a re-release of burning crusade to be even more popular than however popular this classic turns out to be. And likewise, wrath should be even more popular than both burning Crusade and classic this second time around.
---
Is it at all likely that revamping burning Crusade and wrath to fit core classic principles results in higher potential population than releasing burning Crusade and wrath as they were? I'd say it's a tall order.
---
layering. and i dont need to brag about having played vanilla in the past

The same way they are not noticed on retail.

If 8 see streamers I'm definatly going to annihilate them.

Except it is possible! Which apparently it's a bug which I'll report next test. But I was stoked to get him on the beta.
---
None of them had left over vanilla raid gear. By the time BT was released they had had T5 content on farm for many months. You may be thinking of the picture of a Korean guild downing BT in some vanilla gear because, for whatever reason, things were released differently in Asia, but Nihilum was on an EU server and saw the same release schedule as everyone else. They did down BT very fast, on the first day in fact, which is why I didn't include it in my examples, but they were definitely all in full T5 gear.

This buildup was pretty insidious for me in vanilla, but the flip mode was pretty pronounced in tbc.
---
Tbc Regearing was a hassle, but really demonstrated what you are talking about 
---
upgrading from the lion heart sword to the upgraded version LITERALLY turned me from a zero back into a hero.
---
I think altering gear in a way that doesn't completely transform it would have been more acceptable.
---
Like having armor dyes wouldn't be too overbearing if done well.   Virtually no one would complain if that was the extent of what could be changed, but most people would enjoy it.
---
Where do I apply?
---
I agree.  I'm just mentioning it because excluding voice chat from the client wouldn't necessarily be "nochanges" since they tried to include voice chat in vanilla.
---
Is has been. There’s just no point. No one wants to talk to random strangers and if the content they are doing requires voice, then you just join their discord in 2 seconds with an invite.
---
I would argue that only vanilla suffered from your example.  
---
When TBC hit, pretty much everyone had thematic visuals from raids; for the most part they were all quite different as well.
---
So you want to keep retail wow exactly as it is?
---
That's such a cool interaction that I never even considered.
---
Just another awesome thing in the "classic jank" section of things people enjoy about it. Thanks for sharing that!
---
Good luck my man, I wish you and your Blizzard friends and “Classic+” all the best. 90% of the current classic fanatics would just jump ship back to private servers again.
---
I still think we are going to see a similar situation to that of 2004-2006.  I think most people in general are going to run PvE servers as things settle down.
---
&gt; I mean Orc does strictly more damage then Tauren in PvE because Tauren have more health and Orcs get Blood fury. For tanking its whatever but if the extra health isnt keeping you alive then its Orc obviously.
---
But you forgot troll.  For DPS the question is Troll vs. Orc because you have berserking vs blood fury.  
---
For Tanking Troll is generally considered the best because of berserking again to generate threat.  But some people argue the health from Tauren is more important for tanks.  
---
I'm saying that regardless of how "solved" it all is, there is still room for people to argue about what is better or not.
---
Definately for Paladin since they can’t consistently pull non undead mobs without dynamite,
---
For warz, the aoe shield I have heard is pretty awesome but not necessary.
---
(Blank) Hope's Chapel. 
---
Replace (blank) with the right word
---
I definitely agree with you.
---
The only reason I'm currently leveling on a pserver now, though, is because I didn't get into the beta and I'm treating the pserver as if it were the beta. I mean, people's beta characters will be deleted too, so I'm not really concerned about the permanence.
---
You weren't allowed to go from a PvE server to a PvP one back then, but you were able to ditch PvP for PvE.  
---
I assume it will be the same this time around; and yea, they did confirm server transfers will be returning, but in the form of an in game function rather than on a website.
---
Yeah it's questionable, I mean its part of beta to exploit shit, but the video makes it look like he's promoting the exploit when it's really a 3rd party making the video.
---
Bad idea. Taking away the conveniences of retail is just going to chase off a shit ton of money and that money is what is funding Classic and potential future TBC servers or even Classic server options with new content. Classic isn’t going to have the millions upon millions of players playing regularly as some are expecting.
---
yeah pretty sure it was 1.09-1.10

---
saw this said before but i dont think its unreasonable to think maybe this beta gets taken down after the last stress test.
---
The only two WoW friends I still talk to plan to play for a little while, but I don't know if they're up for rolling on a PvP server with me. I'm going to keep nudging them as I've already got two other people who plan to roll with me. My dad is hyped to play an MMO with me again, so there is that.
---
The guy you responded to will hope you don't return to ask a follow-up question.
---
If it was a role-playing Guild sure
---
They have. 
---
Look up the semi recent interview with some of the devs with staysafe and esfand.  They posed the question and it was answered.  It was available in vanilla, so it will be in classic.  As for PvE to PvP, nothing mentioned, but I doubt it since it wasn't possible back then.
---
The trinket that turns you into a fish from the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is pretty gimmicky.

Considering OSRS actually gets quite a few viewers despite being no where near as popular a game, I would actually argue that there is a large audience actually wanting to see someone suffer.

Yeah IIRC you had to run down to STV to find a fruit vendor.

There's going to be a million warriors.   They're the only class that's the best at 2 raid roles.  Most classes are mediocre at 1.  Then there's the private servers inflating numbers for Warriors, and making them seem even more overpowered than they actually were.    Everyone jumps to FOTM OP.  
---
There's going to be a shitload of warriors.  Sure, a lot of people won't make it to 60, but that will be true of every class.   I highly suspect that the people that are the most dedicated are also the ones that know Warriors are OP as fuck.   That means the people leveling warriors will be more dedicated on average to get to max level.
---
There's going to be a shitload of warriors.
---
Ah okay, thank you!
---
I'm afraid of having to go 'undercover' again. When I rolled on WRA, I stopped having to do that as much as RP servers seem to draw in a more mature crowd who don't think girls have cooties. It wasn't an issue in any other MMO  or game I dipped my feet into since. Now I've peeked back into WoW and already see little boys who don't realize women play games.   
---

---
Well shit I'd hope with 15 years of tech advancement that it would be better than vanilla servers
---
In every classicast ever created.
---
Gave me chills. Now it just has to actually be true, which i sadly don't think it is - the blizzard of today is nothing like that of old, and i do not have much faith that they will remain true to classics design philosophy down the road. Things are looking good right now, and i would love to be wrong, but i really hope the community stays on our collected toes against corporate bs, rather than willfully justify it because of hype and hope.
---
But humans got the spirit for pve and not every priest needs to be dwarf in your raid.
---
Scholomance has thas sweet defense set, so useful to get some of those
---
Yeah that's pretty accurate. Most groups of well-organized hardcore players tend to go Alliance for the advantages of Fear Ward and Paladins. Sure there will be Horde premades that will be able to compete, but the players who want every advantage available to them regardless of faction allegiance will roll Alliance.
---
Yea.. dumb move by blizzard from a consumer perspective. 
---
But of course.. they want to secure subs before the game is even frickin out.  Can't say I am surprised.
---
No one wants to talk to random strangers? That sounds like some battle for Azeroth antisocial single player slot machine MMO Shenanigans. LOL.
---
For me it’s more that I didn’t play vanilla (started in TBC) and so I just like to hear what other people say about what is/isn’t good (or “efficient”)
---
Lol not sure what rhetoric your using there or if your somehow serious, but the story has been just about the only thing to wow for a long time imo.
---
Go look at OSRS streams and you can see just how easy it is to get a following that will destroy people for you and make you money for no reason other than to look good while live.

Ok, but you can't permaban google search results when one guy on some random subreddit posts the info.

Yes.

Once you tamed Tooth it dropped based on talents. If you were BM back in the day and put 5/5 in pet attack speed and popped Wrath you could get it down to 0.89. It was glorious.
---
yeah wolves in elwynn are always running after rabbits.
---
OH MY GOD, I forgot all about that!!!
---
Didn't say that.
---
Actually intended. 
---
Some mobs had a chance to aggro on other players if they ran past another combat encounter (as is the case here) in vanilla. Purposely so, to create more chances of chaos. Blizzard spoke to this in some older articles IIRC. 
---
You would have people do this intentionally to disrupt other players in vanilla, especially if you were competing to farm for something.
---
when cat durid is FITE do not ask for HEEL and NINIRVATE!

The most popular pserver host is shutting down before Classic's launch, but there are some rumors floating around that they might release one last F R E S H server for people to play before that happens.
---
I'd say beating wow classic would either be get rank 14 if you're a pvper or clear naxx if you're a pveer
---
I mean, in Vanilla you didn’t talk to strangers either. You used text. Not everyone had nice over a decade ago. 
---
But sure. Come with the “retail is bad”. You sure showed me.
---
Bonus healing on First Aid FTW
---
vanilla had addons. get over yourself. 
---
If you want to play without them fine but that's your choice and others have the choice to use them.
---
And tanks hate not having gold for repairs.
---
You’re making retail into classic. No.
---
Really disappointed to hear Blizzard aren't putting up any RPPVP servers, had a great time on Defias Brotherhood.
---
Not sure what I'll do, but most of my pals seem to be leaning towards PvP.
---
Yeah I believe it is. Recall having shit like that happen in Vanilla
---
Depends on how many of them are all in the same time zone or similar.  
---
Which time zone you pick doesn't just affect MS, but the average raiding schedule for most players.  Example being that if I want to raid around 6-9 pacific, then I would absolutely need to join a west coast server.
---
Idk where these top streamers live, but if they are on opposite sides of the country, then it is very unlikely to see them in one place.
---
You've got your own definition then, a goal to work towards

On point 4, there is no way that person makes it to 60 in 2 months
---
We're not here to discuss the assumption, we're here to discuss whether or not an alternate history like the one I described would be preferential over them rereleasing all expansions.
---
I personalyl go herbs and alchemy. Saves you a lot of downtime which indirectly gets you more xp and gold, but later on, alch is always a guaraneteed money maker. You can seel herbs, but also simple potions to make a bit of silver. You shouldnt have problems getting mount at 40. I didnt ahve
---
Feel you op, gamers and streamers have large intersection alt-right-lite edge Lord's who are comfortable having slurs in normal conversation. From what I've seen this community is not only ok with it but largely embraces it. Hoping this element of the community is just vocal now and that we can find mature, progressive players to hang with
---
Oh that was 100% tongue-in-cheek, I adore every expansion. But meeting people and talking to random strangers in classic sounds absolutely fantastic to me.
---
dude the video dont work for me, so i scrolled down anxiously... hoping this, or something like it, would be top comment. Gosh that would be great, they just need to somehow keep the design philosophy of vanilla intact. I don't have much faith in activision blizzard as a company these days, but if the community is adamant about it, not giving in to hype and hope but demanding a focus on compromised quality, then just maybe, maybe we could have a wow worthy of azeroth.
---
I am only going to play classic with the dream that I can replay TBC.  I understand that some aspects of the game were lost, but it was still a stellar game overall and improved so many things in so many ways.
---
&gt; The language system is kinda weird.
---
Not really.  k translates to l but l doesn't translate to k.  They didn't swap places in the alphabet.  Think of it more like subtracting 5 places from each letter, or something.  k would maybe become b.
---
Sorry for the noob question:
---
How can you tame a pet above your level? It doesn't work on... inofficial servers.. they got it wrong?
---
Dont see anything unusual here, random trained mobs on them. happens all the time and the agro range is fucking huge.
---
can people stop posting this cancerous bastards content.
---
with any luck he will disappear.
---
This is one of the reasons why ZF is my favorite dungeon after BRD. Very "Helms Deep-esque"
---
Uhm.... wow classic is surely goin to br started from bnet.?  Bnet has voice chat built in.
---
tbc horde rets are giga chad dps
---
Each attack which is not evaded has a chance to increase weapon skill, with low weapon skill, the skill gain rate is at or near 100%, however the skill gain change begins to sharply decrease once the weapon skill cap is approached. At 10% away from the cap, the skill gain chance is roughly 50%, and gaining the final skill point can take hundreds of swings. The chance per swing seems to be unrelated to weapon speed, making low speed (=fast attack rate) weapons better. Instant attacks like Sinister Strike and Hamstring help to increase your weapon skill faster.   
---
It has been confirmed that intellect increases the rate at which weapon skills are learned. Before Patch 2.0, this was listed in the tooltip but was removed shortly after that.   
---
Since weapon skill is only increases when it's not evaded worth mentioning that enemy's defense and other defensive stats are also part of the formula.
---
Don’t you have to be level 11 to tame Level 11 beasts? How did u tame at level 10?
---
Doubtful. The jokes will stop and a political argument will ensue.
---
Well blizzard's audience now includes women and children so they have to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator.
---
Not every knows or wants to know everything about classic - its 15 years old game after all.
---
Which coincidentally also means the game is older than your mental age
---
TBC was arguably the most beloved iteration of the game.  Classes were in a great state for the content given to us; 5 mans were different, but still very challenging and flat out epic.  Raids were the most challenging the content has ever been (not going to count mythic+ raiding with the bloated mechanics... just feels like crap to me) to date, especially tier 5.
---
The amount of butthurt min maxers and "Ive never met a butthurt min maxer before" on this thread is hilariously funny. Dude never even said anything about min maxers he just said play what you enjoy.
---
the problem with going TBC -&gt; Wrath is that it will inevitably split the community when we do get to that point. To many changes made, which ones do we approve? We could try the original runescape voting thing, but i don't think it'll work out with wow - to big. Hell there will be retail players who will spite-vote just to try and damage it, seeing it as a threat to retail wow.
---
Vanilla had voice chat it was just terrible and barely worked.
---
Playing Night Elf Priest only because my first character was a Nightelf Priest (made it to level7 before i dropped them) still holds a special place in my heart :)
---
I would say story kept the game alive. Who didn't want to fight illidan or arthas? But the systems in place definitely degraded the game over time. After you beat the final boss of the expansion, why play? Now if that gear actually mattered going into the new one all the way up to heroics, then you'd see more active users wanting to get it all the way until the new release.
---
If you tied quests into professions, they would work on those. And reputation with all factions as well as continuing storylines, I don't have all the answers as to what you can tie the quests to but it doesn't need to leveling. Leveling was awesome in the burning crusade and tbc because of the areas and the storylines with cinematics. Take out levels and useless gear for rewards and people would absolutely still do it. Rep tied to quests would eventually make everyone do it anyway.
---
It was during summer where I didn't have a job and could play for 16 hours a day. I often stayed awake till 10am
---
It's probably a beta bug. Gunna report it
---
Make friends with a priest and the levels will go sailing past.
---
You have never played a battle royal game have you?
---
You do not want to talk to every stranger if you don’t have to.
---
No I think it's a beta bug. Gunna report it
---
That's a good one! I have until probably September to come up with a name! It's gotta be perfect!

I just dont understand why everyone is following him. It makes no sense. That one moment you get on his stream is not unique as there is thousands of others doing so. Please go do your own stuff, you are ruining everyones gameplay/game experience tbh.
---
But retail needs to be fixed cause in it's current iteration it's bleeding subscribers
---
Keep in mind that Kaplan has interviews from around 2006~ stating what he wanted the game to become.  He had a huge hand in what happened in wrath and it was absolutely planned and intentional.
---
*surprised Pikachu face*
---
All new, the old versions won't work on Classic because it's the modern WoW (BfA?) client customized to play like Vanilla.
---
Whenever I do a dungeon? Sure I would love to.
---
And why wouldn’t a new expansion fix it? Like it has in the past?
---
I really love all the quirky tricks in vanilla. Even though the game is broken, maybe a bit broken-ness isn't so bad eh?
---
Bethor Iceshard can go fuck himself.
---
But how do you simply add content into the 1-60 game and 'fix' talents and add the fun stuff without breaking all 'old' content?
---
It just can't be done.  They either need to do TBC, or they need to make an entirely new expansion with a level cap increase either way, and who knows if this porting team can pull it off.
---
If you don't like what they say, ignore them. Block them.
---
Start the damn classic servers before I piss myself!
---
Personally I just dragged and dropped bud.
---
I've been testing on pservers with arms as a viable pve spec because it's technically possible I think, with the correct 2hers. Slow with high end weapon damage and pray for large mortals pretty much. As it's 2h, you only need your 9% hitcap (8% i think the new figure is? and -3% for human or orc if ur a true nerd).   
---
So i was testing it against 2h fury and arms could not compete. The difference between BT and MS is negligable but you lose Flurry. And you need it, it's \~25% dps increase or so.  
---
So you perform, at best, 25% under 2h fury which performs roughly 20% under dualweild fury in my experience.   
---
You also then just have massive rage starving issues, but if you crit often you'll be fine.   
---
I guess to summerize, it's not good. but if your guild likes you, you'll survive.
---
From my experience race matters so much in PvP it's night and day. People \[myself in-cluded\] would rather take an Orc warrior or shaman who is less skilled even less geared than a better player tauren or troll even with a gear edge. The difference is so massive it completely changes the way the class plays. It's cool for solo play I understand but be prepared to be benched for your orc comrade in blues for pre-made ab or wsg.
---
Again. Back to my original comment. No one wants to talk unless the content requires voice. 
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
They could hide their name and server name in the streeam.
---
I must of run ZF like 100 times during my 40-50, sick dungeon
---
Step 3 of the 10,000 step process of realizing that hype is the next door neighbor of burnout.
---
This right here.... Shits crazy
---
Yeah Kern has been spending the past few years hyping a game that's likely never coming, covering up his failures, and trying to convince people he's the messiah of Vanilla.
---
He streams once a week for only a couple of hours and has a lot to say. Sounds like an attention whore to me.
---
That's a good reason why you wouldn't want it, I'm simply saying that complaining about quality of a previous version is a bad reason.
---
Sorry man, you're antisocialness is not my problem.
---
^ Stance dancing is the primary reason that despite typically playing a tank in retail the last few expansions I have no desire to do so in Vanilla because I hate warrior tanking in Vanilla.
---
So back to my hunter which was my Vanilla main.
---
If TBC classic happens...I may Bear or Pally though.
---
Also did it for a ravaged on my orc. Pets name was Scratchy
---
I'm also a dad (33) and cant no life aswell. Also your play time is perfect for me most days for after work and before bed. I'm looking at a few classes but who knows this early. Hit me up on discord Tarob#3887
---
These are amazing please keep posting more of these clips.
---
Yikes
---
Good luck dude!
---
I remember playing during wotlk and being SO HYPE for cata. and then I logged on and I just felt.... sad. Sad that I'd never see the world as it was. I quit not long after that. Classic has me so excited that I'm kind of at a loss for words.
---
I just don't see why a new expansion should even attempt to keep the previous iteration's gear, relevant.  Though if guilds had full t3, they could clear karazhan with it.. so not sure why you would think that wasn't the case... lvl 58 greens were not replacing most crap you got from naxx40.  
---
I do agree with the point about story though.  I guess at the end of the day the game was fun enough to me to the point of the lore not being a big deal, but I understand why it would matter to others.
---
The problem is that new expansions haven't in the long run yes there were surges in the beginning of legion and bfa but it always returns back to the downward spiral
---
&gt;As a Hunter I hate people like you. All you did was insure that both of you are now fighting over the tame. He beat you to the punch let him have it and get the next one.
---
Nah. As you said yourself, we're fighting over the spawn. It's the same as him or me ganking the opposite faction.
---
&gt; Fucking with them just makes it harder for you to tame the next spawn.  Eliminate competition for the spawn don’t keep it the same. 
---
I eliminated the competition by killing it making him relog to flame me, but he couldn't wait for the next spawn.
---
now That's the .....spirit.....
---
I kind of think dual spec was the first, true turning point of the game, at least in a massive way.  
---
Wrath had already made things way easier, which was questionable enough, but to remove the unique nature of a spec choice... just sucked.
---
You sound like a manchild
---
They;re doing what blizzard intended. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
CLASSIC WOW HYPE!!
---
They rushed out ICC and it showed.  They should remake that entire raid imo.
---
I remember it happening and trying to use that to grief people on your own faction. I don't recall when it was taken out.
---
Funny story about that one. Back in Vanilla, I first learned about Broken Tooth on that Petopia site or whatever. I thought it sounded cool that he had such a fast attack speed. That said, it also said he was super rare and hunters spent days or even weeks trying to get him. Just for fun, I decided to run out there and see if he was there. Sure enough, there he was lol. I tamed him right then. So I spent about 10 seconds trying to farm BT lol. That was about as lucky as I ever got in Vanilla.
---
Look I am not going to remind you before I am reminded. That seems unreasonable. I will however remind you after.
---
Never once leveled in Dustwallow, that zone looks horrible AND it has water you can't cross without slowing you down, and then the spiders with slowing poison. No thanks.
---
You can arguably clear whatever content is relevant to your guild until the end of classic. No worries honestly, just connect with a like minded guild
---
I cant explain why the voidwalker is attacking you. literaly his master was attacking the orc running away.
---
&gt; Question will horde and ally on the resistence be able to Join on grps together to dgs or bgs againt the undead. 
---
I imagined it being a full on threeway rather than ally&amp;horde teaming up.  
---
&gt; What are the undead goals? 
---
As Arthas knows which threats lie ahead, the Scourge wants to unite Azeroth to be prepared for the arrival of the Burning Legion. He envisions his Scourge as a way to end the Alliance and Horde bickering and turn the full power of Azeroth's population to defend the planet while simultaneously exacting revenge in the people responsible for turning him into who he now is.
---
&gt; What Will the undead raids? Will normal people do the same raid? 
---
All factions would receive the same raids. Even if that means it'll mostly be a fight for resources rather than straight up confrontations. Say the Scourge raids the lair of Deathwing to raise him as a frost wyrm while stealing his research, the Horde and Alliance would raid it to prevent the research and Deathwing's body falling into the hands of the Scourge. Another possible raid would be a Scarlet Crusade-themed one where the Horde and Alliance, distraught by the loss of the Ashbringer, are seeking to obtain Light's Wrath while the Scourge would do the same raid to destroy it. I suppose it could end with the final raid of the first expansion being similar in style to the Battle of Dazar'Alor, allowing players to experience it from two or even three different perspectives.
---
That's the way it was and should be. If a dude runs right by you it should aggro, who cares if it's an NPC or you
---
You just compared a video game to school lmao. Also youre acting like this is a hard game it just take a lot of time no skill involved.
---
I can't imagine too many people who are rolling a mage day one of classic so they can eventually become relevant two years from now. :P
---
Another week, another repost.
---
Welcome to why Classic servers will be a shit show. WoW didnt change, people changed.
---
Was literally gonna leave this exact upvote, have my comment.
---
Higher threat from the tank means the whole raid gets to do more damage, meaning human is objectively the better tank.
---
Antisocialness?????
---
I literally just said I would use voice for content that requires voice. The same thing you just said.
---
2 extra frostbolts is actually a pretty big deal lmfao
---
Same, but it doesn't mean i wont have a good time with kids sometimes.
---
I loved Tanaris. And as short as it is, Zul Farak is one of my favorite dungeons.
---
I know. I’m just saying even with good quality and working voice system like we have now in retail, no one uses it anyways.
---
The atmosphere of the city is insane though with the dead upper part en the slimey lower part. The first time I reached that place, o boy.
---
You can put things in the mail, and they will stay there for like 2 months.   You don't even have to take it out.   The problem is 30 copper fee is not an insignificant amount when you are first starting out.
---
You’re right. Not a single bug found.
---
bump
---
Sure, but the difference is pretty negligible either way.

It is actually more centralized than Orgrimmar.
---
As long as I can be the shadow priest for the raids I'm in.
---
I think that’s just him trolling/getting reactions from chat. Asmon irl is actually a down to earth, cool dude. His twitch persona is all about stirring shit up.
---
Exactly.. so many people pretending like classic the beacon, but I would argue TBC was a brighter point in which to experience the game.
---
Yes, TBC had some things that created problems (flying, the final batch of daily content, catch up mechanics).
---
It, however, fixed classes, made most of the specs in the game more engaging to play without removing abilities or reworking them, had very challenging 5 man and raid content and kept in most of the rock paper scissors aspect of PvP that vanilla had started.  There had never been a point of my first 7 years of playing the game where anything was as close to epic as going into outlands through the dark portal, and seeing a new world.  
---
The bottom line is that while mistakes were made, it is important to realize that change is not a bad thing.  OSRS realized this the hard way early on when it dropped in players by a massive amount 2~ years in.  They then realized people will only stay engaged for so long, and new/refreshing content needed to be put in place.
---
In TBC's case, they tried refreshing things by taking us to a new land (for better or for worse) and giving us new ways to play the game.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news for some, but their strategy worked and the game kept growing at a very quick rate.
---
Yeah. The halfway point is wherever half your time is, not half your XP. XP per hour generally deviates in each level range and generally goes up, but raw so needed also goes up so time to level generally goes down.
---
Almost as bad as the taxes crooked Hillary would have out in place?
---
Does 101 101 L i A F F still work?
---
My last comment in these threads is explaining to someone how rough EQ raiding was. I shiver at the memories (but also remember them fondly?)
---
Only if a player has built threat on it, then it will attack. I cant see how his Imp built any aggro on the voidwalker, every attack went on the first mob.
---
Oh my god this! It’s telling how the top comments in this thread are calling op “overly sensitive.” It’s very isolating to be into “nerdy stuff” but the communities are incredibly exclusive, and abrasive when called out on their behavior.
---
That's fair, we've all been there. Those were the days...

Gnomish engineering for gnomish battle chicken and force reactive disk. Nothing else even compares.

Yeah, and I lift too, bro.
---
Wait, you just vendor it? Is it not worth putting on the AH?
---
How so?
---
Its pretty easy to just not care what others think and post anyways.
---
Some of the comments on that post are so deliciously salty.
---
Each person has their own priorities and levels of importance in various attributes a game has available.  When they don't value something, they ask why such a thing is being made or expanded upon.  When they overvalue something, they start gatekeeping and saying that nothing is allowed to enter or change that thing.
---
Race options are no different.  You could have everyone being various colors of the same teapot and someone will still play the game, because they don't care about character aesthetic (or that specific aesthetic interests them).  Likewise, you can shove too many options in and your average player is going to go walleyed trying to figure out how this choice impacts them.
---
I do agree with transmog hurting interactions in the community, though.  Perhaps limiting it to cities or something would've been a better first step for WoW.
---
You're doing the light's work. 
---
When I was watching streams of classic I was disappointed with the lack of kings on people, so part of me wants to rush down the protection paladin talent tree while I am leveling in order to bless the good people of Azeroth with kings.
---
I'm not saying Druid's aren't, but it's a well established fact that Warriors Excell in threat generation over them in both single target and aoe.
---
Downvote all you want but many popular Vanilla Tanks will agree. Skarm main tanked Naxx on both classes and explains in detail why Warrior Excell beyond Pally and Druid even in AoE scenarios.
---
Eh, it's more fun for me to take all these little decisions seriously.
---
Yes please. Tyvm.
---
What?
---
You chose literally the worst fucking example.
---
Horde Warrior's are all Orcs because they're bis for both PvE and PvP, tank and DPS. The +5 axe racial has zero competition.
---
Some people get off on min/maxing every little thing. These conversations are 100% legitimate. I want to be the absolute best I can be. Healthy discussion imo.
---
\&gt; Easier getting to spf. 
---
Sorry, what?
---
TBC added flying mount and destroyed the old world. No thanks.
---
You want a 10+ year old game franchise to grow and never decline? I’m sorry but that’s now things work. You’re always gonna have lows. Even classic wow is gonna drop in numbers in between content releases, doesn’t mean it needs to be made into a new game.
---
I'm torn between Warlock and Hunter. 
---
I enjoy both aspects of the game, but am most interested in wPvP, BGs and Duels (equally) and raid for gear and to enjoy the content / community / progress (don't care for topping meters). 
---
I imagine my time at 60 will be spent as follows; 
---
Raid a few nights a week depending on prog or farm
---
Farm for money / consumes as necessary
---
PvP in all my spare time 
---
I'm concerned I'll get bored of hunter pvp as a one trick pony of FD trapping but would enjoy their engaging rotation in pve (bit worried about a raid spot)
---
I'm concerned I'll get beaten down by shard farming and shadow bolt spamming in pve as a lock but know I enjoy their wild toolkit in PvP 
---
I'm guessing it comes down to messing around with their playstyles on certain servers but if anyone can help pls do :'(
---
&gt; 5% more DPS as a Human rogue with Sword spec
---
The Blueposts in Hit/Glance/Dodge now give us confidence it’s a 0.04% increase to play Human. 
---
5% isn’t negligible but ever racial is :)
---
Yet TBC attracted and kept nearly just as many people as vanilla had.  The growth didn't really stop until the whole sunwell patch with those horrid and very much required dailies.  
---
While raids did get smaller in TBC.. I really don't think it mattered too much considering they were all far more difficult than the vast majority of vanilla raiding.  T4 engaged players far more than t1 did for instance.  T5 is arguably the most demanding raiding the game has ever seen to date, and while it is split between 2 raids, both of those raids combined into the single tier is quite large.
---
I also don't get the argument about devaluing content from a previous iteration, because it is either that or insane power creep.  Pick your poison.
---
T2 Paladin checking in. Still the sweetest armor.
---
Taurens can melee things through any wall because of their hitbox. I don't know if that was in vanilla tho.
---
Yea but what's his point? Not saying he doesn't have one just not sure if he's just adding to what I'm saying or trying to prove me wrong or ...
---
I mean what he says is correct. It's not new information to me personally. I just don't understand how that info is relevant to my post? Am I expected to answer something?
---
In the words of KD, you the real MVP
---
So real
---
Hulk is an orc warrior. Gtfo here with this mage propaganda nonsense.
---
Fuck yeah. In Eve we call this “Content”.
---
!remind me 79 days
---
just go tank any and all end game instances.  Form friendships with healers and great dps.  Do what they need as much as what you need.  Those friendships will last a lifetime.
---
That's what I'm talking about! The beauty of classic: working so hard for something and being well-rewarded. Congrats and good job!!
---
It's a problem that druids have suffered from since launch and Blizzard never really came up with good solutions to that problem except letting people change the colors of their forms.
---
Forms as a gameplay concept are great, but one of their absolute biggest flaws is that they replace your character with a much more plain looking model.
---
Technically the game had halted growth as wrath hit, so the easier content and quality of life improvements are what started the decline, and that happened the moment you stepped foot in northrend.
---
Paladins win
---
Yeah, but it turns out off stream he did a lot of "farming" and got a bunch of cash, so he's good to go.
---
Crendor. 
---
Every day. All day. Crendor.
---
Orc. Weapon skills are amazing.
---
As far as I know they didn't have a prior honor system, unless it was WAY back. But he literally says "PVP was so un-fun", I mean even if you had a bad ranking system would that make PVP un-fun? Seems like a weird think to say.
---
I'm just really curious as to what his involvement with development was like. I know he's credited as "Team Lead", way up on the credits, but what does that actually entail? Not always, but occasionally I see him talking about the details, or the philosophy of things, it feels like he is a bit off the mark. And I realize how absolutely stupid that sounds, being that he was literally a developer, but I'd really love to know what the other higher-up designers (like Kalgan or Tigole) agree or disagree with him on.
---
I agree with your point but only by me checking out his stream earlier I know he definitely doesn't have an endless supply of potions lol
---
too right, came up against Death and Taxes once, their tank had like 13000hp and would get healed up by their healers so fast, was like a 35min of hilarity. as it was so fucking hard to kill any of them.
---
^ what this guy said. Organized 10 man premades always had alliance teams on the top but horde dominated the pugs. Basically been the same on most private servers and I can see it being like that when classic comes.
---
The problem isn't that they lost a few subscribers in between expansions it's that they have been trending downwards for the last 10 years if not before then
---
If you dive deep into theory crafting alliance should be better at pve, but historically horde has done much better. Horde is also better for pvp (orc and undead racials help a lot), but it reslly depends in the server which will come out on top.  Alliance gets more mounts to farm though and if you have the raptor mount from ZG or the undead horsey from whatever the dungeon is called (im sick and my memory is fighting me atm) you are automatically a badass.  Alliance armor and mounts look cooler. But im going horde cause im not into night elf hentai roleplay.
---
AQ opening...will be epic...
---
Well you shouldn't lose your shit when someone says "that was some gay shit", then no one would call you sensitive. 
---
Mature people cuss
---
Immature people cuss.
---
Desensitize yourself to society.
---
The skeptic in me can't help but question if people didn't just randomly give you gold here and there just by asking, since it has little true value on a character that will be lost.
---
How does rage generation from white hits work and why does private realms generate a different amount than classic?
---
No
---
Shit, I fall into that green goop every time I visit UC to this day.
---
That is my guess.
---
You'll get funneled more gear since locks are more rare, your threat control is better because Salv buff, and you get escape artist against mages. Not a bad trade tbh.
---
(I look forward to killing you in the future)
---
There's quite a lot of quests in BRD to begin with, so you may have already run it a few times to get the prebis stuff in there.  
---
Honestly it takes so long to go from 58 - 60 that even a 'fresh 60' should have some gear, enough to do scholo and strat with competent teammates.
---
All it takes is literally one person on his stream in the same zone to recognize him and yell in his face the name of the server they are on. If he doesn't disclose the information I wouldn't be surprised if it happens within 5 minutes of the game launching.
---

T3 pallyrangers.
---
If you're talking about number of subs, the peak of subscribers in WoW's history occured during the end of wrath and at the start of Cata.  So no, the game only growed during Wrath.
---
The lag of times past was mostly caused by your client machine not being able to handle as much incoming network traffic + the overly complicated single-threaded computes for all those spells weaving on the screen. It really wasn't server capacity at all.
---
Oh man. I'm almost certain I'm going priest and the priest sets do look good but.. Damn I really like T2 and T3 shammy gear too. T1 shammy helmet however is just. Let's not talk about that okay.
---
If you aren't willing to support your tanks in Vanilla you're going to have a bad time.
---
WoWs voice chat wasn't trash, it's just they were late to the game, everyone was already using Vent.
---
I want to know how Vent isn't still a thing, and also what's this Discord everyone speaks of.
---
The only reasons to leave your races starting area is rep and friends. Outside of that no reason.

yeah feel free to add me on [battle.net](https://battle.net) Ragma#1219

I thought a happy compromise would be for Asmongold and Soda (the two streamers with an audience I think is big enough to disrupt server population) to release a list of servers they do not plan to roll on. While this depends on a decent number of server options and an uncritical population of streamer-server dodgers, I think this is an easy win-win. For the unknown number of people who really do not want to be on a server with a popular streamer, they have a list of safe servers to go to. For the small window of anonymity that Asmongold wants at launch, he can have it and high-road with some sympathy for his critics.
---
Point 6 hits so close to home :( One of the raiding guilds I was in completely fell apart because of this, and it happened so quickly.

Good bot

Are you me? This is exactly where I am. I thought I had quit this addiction!

Bad bot

It would be cool if we had something on this subreddit like a "Screenshot Sunday" and people could post their favorite screenshots they got over the week, maybe with a little story describing it. Sometimes the simplest pictures to some hold a significant meaning to  others.
---
Oh boy, thanks for our daily "play wat u want" thread
---
Int also helps with leveling up weapons. Beneficial for everyone.
---
55 feels like the begining of max-lvl for me, because you can start heading into BRD, grind on some reputations you need at 60 while also still getting EXP for it like Furbolgs or just grind for mats you need for gear at 60. You get meaningful rewards besides exp that last you past the leveling journey.

BUT THAT'S NOT HOW CLASSIC WAS REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
class and race choice.
---
female night elf priest represent.
---
Why not?  If he plays around 30 hours a week then it is very doable.  
---
Most of the people I raided with back then were married... not saying their wives liked it, but yea..
---
I recall it being patched in and all of my friends piling in to give it a try. We promptly all disabled that feature and continued to use Vent.
---
How have you not heard of Discord? It's a text/voice chat program that lets you join and create as many servers as you want for free.
---
It was like a chinese drop torture for getting me subbed
---
Get the fuck out you worthless normie
---
&gt; exactly like aimshot in vanilla.
---
Aimshot mechanic was a choice determined by spec. Steady shot was "everyone gets candy, candy for everyone!" bullllllshit carebare fucking dumb down nonsense.
---
To be fair...there's nothing that says that those things are mutually exclusive.
---
He could very well be the messiah of vanilla. That doesn't prevent him from fucking up further ventures.
---
Cross faction collusion is also against Blizzards TOS so that would be reportable
---
Those abomination guards were kept busy squeegeeing my sorry corpse off that elevator many times.
---
"Puny orc squish again? Now me have to go clean up again! Arrrrrrghhhh.."
---
Lol wow has been trending downwards since it’s release? I think you need to do a bit of research.
---
oh yeah, i remember people trying to grief others like this on a PvE server or your own faction to ninja nodes or chests or whatever.
---
I get that, but i just really like how classic wow is made and since there is no mmo these days where almost every kill has some value to someone. I played for 16hrs total at lvl 10 since there was so much to do. I also hate streamer culture so I wouldn't bother begging for free stuff.
---
It's just a game for me that scratched that itch.
---
Why not just wait and get it once you're higher level lmao
---
I plan to no life as hard as possible on my main for the first four to five days at release to get ahead of the curve. I do plan to level slowly with some friends on an alt after the rush at launch. At the same time, I also want to avoid the queue times of a potentially huge server with Asmongold and/or Soda down the road. You may have the goal to take your time in the first few days and smell the roses, but that isn't everyone's aspiration in the first week.
---
Shadowmeld for wipe recovery, not useless
---
Yeah that could work but depending on how many servers he says he won't be on, those servers can really fill up fast.
---
Calling it free money is incorrect. They have to maintain Servers (Which can cost quite a lot, equipment upgrades, hiring maintenance staff, electricity although most likely negligible), they have to fix gamebreaking bugs (They won't update the game, but if there's an exploit that shows up as a result of them using the newer 7.3 Engine, then they can't just leave it in the game, they still have to fix bugs) and most importantly and costly, there will still be support staff. GMs that help players with issues and read tickets.
---
I am not saying Classic won't be profitable, and I am not saying that the expenses on maintaining Classic will be very high. But saying "This is free money for Blizzard" is disingenuous and inaccurate.
---
If he's from Brazil, then yes.
---
As if anyone actually got banned back then lol... blizzard would have to be completely insane to remove paying customers over something so light. 
---
Either way, assuming we should heed your warning, there is no way they wouldn't at least warn you first before perma banning.
---
I love tales of taming animals, especially ones from classic.
---
Never played hunter,  are you able to tame pets lower than you?
---
^miss
---
How would you know which server they were on during the character creation phase?
---
What do you mean by silenced? I take it it's some new feature in Retail?
---
I don't plan to take my time but I don't think being on asmons server would be that big of an issue
---
Because then we don't get to experience the world of Warcraft together. Just a tauren and a bear, exploring azeroth. 
---
Also the stress test is capped at 10. Lol

The fact you posted your stream before posting the link to join the group shows what this post is intended for.

Some just hold the door open to the gates of hell so a demon can come out.

Druids were disgusting in TBC, one in our guild was named Legendairy, was a freaking monster.

But that argument isn't relevant since we're about to play Classic, and not TBC.

No wai!

Hey /u/mabr00k , I have been playing the druid the past day and leveled from 15 to 26, so I now have catform and was able to test out your question. You are correct that if you are in catform, you must leave catform into humanoid then go into bearform and vice versa. You can't be in catform then go straight into bearform, without first entering humanoid. However, there is no gcd once you leave a form, so you can immediately enter another form almost instantly.

I swear buffing random people as you run by is addictive.

Yeah but you're playing a gnome so you have to live with that until you reroll
---
ok to be fair that was the stress test, we only had one realm, there were thousands of people trying to experience the fun stuff
---
I get what you’re saying though, I was there for that as well. it was ridiculous lmao
---
&gt;Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and*Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.  
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.  
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Have you tried getting on top of the stormwind gates ? :O
---
&gt;It was a lagging nightmare if you got more than 60 people together all spamming their abilities.
---
&gt;AV has 40v40
---
&gt;distinctly remember getting 3+ raids together to raid cities
---
&gt;didn't lag(unless your pc was garbage)
---
Layering good, keep layering guys. Just remember, it's not sharding, it's Layering^TM but at times acts like sharding(those are bugs)
---
You know what I like about the posts / memes people make like this one?...
---
The close up you get of the ability icon.
---
I played vanilla from start to finish and have played pservers for little over a year and I'm still learning what the actual pictures in the icons are, not just going off a glance of the shape and colour.
---
On pserver (which uses the original 1.12.1 client build) you will rez in the Dwarf starting area, rather than Kharanos. I'm not sure that this is something that pserver devs had to program for every single rez spot in the game (doubtful,) or if the rez location was changed at some point.
---
I really feel like t1 amd 2 druid looks better than t3
---
This is not a curse, this is derogatory language. Insert another marginalized groups name into the statement instead of "gay" and all of a sudden it paints a very different picture
---
Yes and I did get up there!
---
Because it kills the sense of achievement. You either beat the same Nefarion as everyone else or you didn't. My guild never beat Cthun in Vanilla. Never killed more than trash in Naxx. We got stuck in Hyjal / early BT in BC (lots of guild poaching back then). And ya know what, I was ok with that. We were super casual and we knew it. I never felt like I "missed out" because we couldn't compete with better guilds. 
---
I feel like a watered down version of Cthun would have been an insult. We did what we could and we were proud of it.
---
T1 and 2 rogue is badass
---
He is really good at diablo and his guides are great
---
All of them curse constantly the minute they can. Marines shape up in proper situations. Twitch chat ain't it. Your the guy in the locker room school marming people. Should he step up his insult game sure but, at the same time getting butt hurt about it is more annoying.
---
Make sure it doesnt run away.. Happend to me when i first started playing hunter. Damn you, 12 years old me.
---
Voice chat was in tbc.
---
This isn't how the mount works. Multiple people can get the mount if they ring the gong within the first ten hours of the first gong ring. I heard on original servers that people and guilds who were going for the mount would coordinate when they were going to ring it so those who were slightly behind could still get it. 
---
inb4 anyone says that X streamer would ignore the other people on the server and ring the gong prematurely, what are you a pessimistic fortune teller? There is little incentive to betray the server wide effort of the gates of AQ for the troll. The gravitas of the event is in its cooperative grandeur.
---
So sad! I fed him whatever he wanted from the shops in thunder bluff.
---
Well no one is going to do that in the actual game. They for sure wait until it's doable without sacrificing the time and 20+ wipes. More like this is what beta is like
---
Rogues be all like .......  um? Is this even a discussion?
---
Jesus Christ, I feel lucky to have a wife that is as excited as I am to be playing it. RIP op
---
Most streamers are in Texas
---
Hmm I suppose.  It just so happened to be on my paste ctrl v and so that is what I put in first. Do you have  vendetta against streamers?

Idk this reference

Trolls definitely the best
---
I'm actually going to save this because I'm sick of running in circles trying to find the post box / flight master.
---
I thank you for your dedication to the cause.

You shouldn’t need to downrank at all in raids, because you can always Feign Death and drink mid fight to restore mana.
---
[Ferocious Butt] [Pounding] [For the Children]
---
It's been out for 15 years
---
I hope we end up on the same server (insert fist bump)
---
The only option we have is to claim a pvp server as the unofficial rp-pvp server.
---
People did that in Gw2 with Tarnished Coast on release and it’s still known as the rp server.
---
But it's given me enough pause to not trust what he says at face value.
---
What exactly are the meme specs? I assume boomkin and ret pally would be a meme spec, but does meme spdc include something like feral dps? They seem to do good, not great or amazing, dps if you know how to properly poweshift at least. 
---
It would be annoying to be continually declined a raid spot for wanting to play feral dps, though as you have said that is their decision.
---
Just curious how much I'd be gimping myself for trying to do feral dps. Though it isn't like it is really that big a deal to just heal for raiding and dps in everything else XD
---
Came here to make a mum / mom comment.
---
I upvote you, good sir and / or Madame.
---
The other night I fought through a hellish area I was about 8 levels under for to get a mat I needed. A lvl 60 (it's a private server fyi) horde showed up and instantly hit me with 2 shots and got me down to like 40% health, I /begged because I have no shame. He stopped, tapped me on the head and let me go.
---
That's never happened to me where they've been mid killing me and stopped. I love this game
---
Northdal launch was pretty much crash/lag free
---
I don't give a fuck about cursing and we sure as shit aren't talking about that, but go off I guess.
---
I agree to a degree. If there is population balance (big if), and if the server queues are not terrible (big if), and if you don't mind the fandom that comes with a streamer (small if, get over it in my opinion), and if you can live with the potential scenario of your server's streamer quitting and your server dying from it (big if), then I don't see the problem of the biggest streamers on your server either.
---
You must be new around here haha. GL with your guild guild man.
---
Yeah, I’m really hoping it happens that quickly. I expect I’ll find out here on this subreddit.
---
The trend started around the wrath of the lich king
---
You get an upvote because I don't care about what you posted.
---
go google what layering is, using that word to what i said is irrelevant, they are going to take layering out of the game far faster than most people will ever get an epic mount.
---
and you cant brag because you obviously didnt play vanilla or else you would realize how bad it was. 
---
tbc and wrath cant come soon enough
---
You're taking it too far, \^and \^out \^of \^context. Not really strong grounds for a argument.
---
Haven't checked them on the beta server, but they should be hostile. They were updated to be neutral in 3.3.0.
---
You can always do something along the lines of Veteran's gear.  After Naxx all raid drops have some sort of affix that only allows it's power increase within specific zones (raids)
---
I bet most streamers are going to be playing on the same server. It's the best content for them.
---
Our lives will change forever if this indeed happens.
---
You're clearly trolling, but since I'm just doing this for the sake of argument, I'll explain it: Back-to-back crits with parry haste can already happen on private servers and Druids tank just fine. This mechanic isn't being added to the game. The chance that it happens is being increased from "literally never going to actually happen" to "basically never going to actually happen".
---
Let's say a Druid is wearing 0 bonus defense. That gives him a 5.6% chance to take a single crit. Back-to-back crits would then be a (5.6% * 5.6%) 0.3136% chance.
---
But we're not debating back-to-back crits. We're debating back-to-back crits  that happen with maximum parry haste. That can only happen when your swing happens at the exact same moment as the first boss crit (5.6%) AND your hit gets parried (14%) AND the next boss hit also crits (5.6%) for a grand total of 0.043904% chance of eating back-to-back crits with max parry haste.
---
Currently on private servers, this happens at a (5.6% * 5.6% * 5%) .01568% clip. The difference between private servers and Classic will be ~.028%.
---
And again, back-to-back crits do not mean dead tank. The situation should be covered by your healer's normal healing assignments.
---
Phrasing?
---
Some people like to min/max. You don't want them judging your choices, so don't judge theirs.
---
The streamer servers hang on the consistency of the celebrity. If they quit, you will see the server die as well. I don't think any server is inherently safe in either scenario. But if server populations start to dip, I imagine Blizzard would consolidate.
---
I have a vendetta against people advertising their stream when it clear they just want viewers. 
---
Why would your stream be more important than joining the guild? Why even have your stream in your guild recruitment post anyways?
---
2h fury is very competitive in the grand scheme of things and has one of the most interactive and rewarding rotations in classic if one is playing the improved slam build
---
Arms is very poor in a raid scenario with one exception which is ZG. There's so much trash to be cleaved that arms ends up doing an insane amount of overall damage.
---
I don't care if INT doesn't do anything for you, if I run by you, you're getting the buff
---
I've actually had people whisper me and say I'm stupid for doing that in the past.
---
Also a dad here. I bet he's brilliant to have around a table in a pub.
---
I agree with this sentiment. The intro of dungeon finder is what really killed the spirit of WoW. No one cared about anyone else. No sense of accountability in PUGs. 
---
When I was levelling any of my toons in any instance on my way to 80, I would always try to do my best and be as civil as I could, because these random people I was grouping with might be raiding with me at max level. 
---
I attracted a bit of a reputation as an "anywhere, anytime" type of guy on my server. There was some confusion why a warrior in full Naxx25 gear was showing up in their random Heroic 5 mans to tank, but no one was about to complain. 
---
But now even if I'm getting faster groups and instant queues, the chances of these people ever seeing me again or being part of my own community were pretty remote. Unlike if I was still being active on my own server. I liked the sense of dependability I had built up. Adding random pug finder made it pointless.
---
You were born in 1993, how would you know?
---
Please pay attention to the sidebar. There's a weekly thread dedicated to LFG posts.
---
I believe horde: 99 99 is to alliance: he he
---
Oh yeah, there's a comment further down defending it calling this (classic wow I guess) a "masculine environment" with "throwaway insults". I guess that's what this sub wants to be then
---
Damn really? That's a huge blower.. you think he's bullshitting with all the cool stuff he's been sharing?
---
And you said it’s been declining for over 10 years. Completely ignoring the increase of subs during expansions. 
---
But you want a 15 year old game to hold 10 mil subs lol so I think we are done here.
---
proof it then
---
High quality content. A guy was taking a shit... and came running back in to gank someone lower level than him while he was fighting a mob. And apparently it was so important that he decided not to wipe his ass?
---
Gingerbread Blade of the Titans
---
Smh no mention of Overpower
---
You don't know what you're talking about
---
Agreed
---
Name one game that has held 10 mil players and never declined. The fact you guys are still shoving the “WoW is dying” ever since wrath is hilarious.
---
And you're defending derogatory language rather than trying to improve this community. C'mon dude, it sounds like you know it's wrong
---
plz the repair bill is barely higher
---
Beautiful.
---
There's a good case for Trolls to be the best Warrior tanks in later raids, but I agree with your point.
---
He actually sounds more like a half man, half child, half teenager.
---
0 hunters
---
0 rogues
---
HF in BWL.
---
never recall anything like that
---
I thought it was good content. Why not. Was pretty funny. But hey not everything amuses everyone.
---
Thats because private servers are biased in what is considered a Okay exploit or unintended feature, and whats not.
---
I'm not saying it need to hold onto 10 mill players but the way it's headed it's not going to be sustainable
---
Well I just watched a 11 yr old BC era questing 1-6 video and they were neutral so I'm not sure.
---
No it's actually more like a half child, half teenager-man.
---
Are you answering your own questions? I’m confused.
---
I wish I had known about these when they were making them. They look pretty sweet.
---
Okay remind me when he reminds you when the other guy reminds him when the other guy reminds him when the remind me but reminds him. Plz.
---
Salute sir.  As a dedicated twink rogue I approve whole heartedly of the effort.  Can’t wait to get into the 29 bracket WSG
---
Of course he’s new, he broke multiple rules. Must be a fine guild leader that doesn’t read basic Reddit rules.
---
If I learned anything raiding in wow it's that people will obsess over the slightest advantage, real or perceived. There will be guilds that will flat out deny any main tank who isn't a human warrior.
---
No. Please stop
---
How desirable are warrior tank in a raid setting? There's only one MT and few off-tank needed, warrior is a very popular class.
---
Actually yeah that does make a lot of sense. I didn't really look at it like that but that comment kind of opened my eyes to that very realistic possibility.  Thank you!
---
1 DeathKnight spell is the same load on the server as every single spell in Classic
---
It's natural progression, there's nothing easy or convenient in BC or classic.
---
I like how you named it "Raptor"
---
This!! I want all my RP friends to enjoy PvP with me so much!
---
They're not biased. They realized how broken this was because they experienced it first-hand.
---
With an ad designed as poorly as that, never.
---
/chuckle
---
Dude servers are not xrealm like bfa so you repeatedly see same people over and over. You rarely meet anyone again at all in retail in the same server unless in a guild.
---
You do realize it's groups of players generally killing the elite mob's, and they are very good at the game most of the time. The game will not be as easy for the average player without a group to play with, don't compare the general POP with streamers and other hardcore WOW players.

The best part is that T3 is a healing set, so it doesn't out-class Judgement as PvP or grinding gear. +60-some damage to all of my judgements for the full set bonus? Yes please.
---
And even in phase 1 where we don't have access to BWL, we can still get the hood off Onyxia and the legs off of Ragnaros and rock 6/8 Lightforge for the rest to get the +spell damage proc set bonus AND look styling.
---
I played a holy/disc priest on a pserver, I would always buff hunter/warlock pets with fortitude
---
1000 times yes.
---
Blizzard's operating procedure for doing things they've already spoken out again is usually a temporary ban. Sometimes they don't even speak out against it first.
---
Jokes on you I love grinding mobs.
---
Tell me about it. I used to stare at those things way before I ever subbed.
---
It might not be a big issue to you, but what if it was for me, or one of my friends, or my guild? 
---
For me, I would prefer to be on the biggest PvP server (with or without Asmongold) if there was close to faction balance and not terrible queue times (though I would like my server's population to not be tied to a tiny handful of players if they ever decide to leave). And I don't mind if people talk about streamers in general, use twitch memes, or if my capital city gets raided often, but if someone else does or my guild does I would understand.
---
I spent my early 20s gaming and my late 20s training and starting my career/having a kid. Didn't have a computer or much free time the past half decade.
---
Got a new computer + many days off a year now and everything's different, Fortnite is strange and I'm like an old man not even wanting to pay attention to it, WoW is casual heaven, League of Legends is completely different and Vent is gone.
---
Different times.
---
It's too early to be looking for guildmates.  WoW classic is 3 months away.
---
I mean everyone's going to say that's not how it was in vanilla, but then everyone seems to be fine with having cooldowns ticking down on their action bar abilities as well so what do I know.  
---
  
---
All it really changes is how many addons you need I guess.
---
One of the elements I've really enjoyed in games like vanilla wow and quake is that it required you to be proficient at timing, prediction, etc. Without the additional instruments that were added later there was a very high skill ceiling. 
---
In other words, L2P
---
Important thing to remember is that you can't really follow a straight zone progression.  It's not like in the expansions where there's one zone for levels X to Y which leads into the Y to Z zone.  If you try that, you are going to have a bad time.  Especially for Forsaken.
---
I don't think we know how many stream dodgers there are out there. Look through this thread and there are a ton of people out of the loop asking who x, y, z streamer is and why does it matter. So its certainly in the air.
---
NO
---
The Skettis and Ogri'la and Netherwing Ledge dailies made the game worse overall. Incentivizing people to log in and out after 30 mins or so is the kind of thing that will make tons of people fall out of love with the game. The Argent Tournament dailies in WoTLK are effectively what killed my passion. By the time Cataclysm came out I couldn't even be bothered to get to max level.
---
As I understand it, people don’t say “play this, don’t play that”, they are just trying to inform about some specs/races that will limit you, so you can decide from that
---
It’s a lot better to know about the negative sides before, than find out about it 3 months after, so you want to reroll 
---
Sure some raids will bring Rets, Enhancement or whatever, but how many of each are they gonna bring? So if you wanna pick a class, to play a spec there’s only 1 spot for in some guilds, then go right ahead, just don’t come after and complain about it, if it doesn’t work out

You're clearly a troll and or do not understand how trends work.

Just use an addon. Easy fix.
---
Tbh most classes will wear a lot of off-sets. I feel particularly bad for my warlock being stuck with a fucking vest until T3. Ugh
---
I'm the same as you, I can't stand Soda or Asmon because of their shit attitudes.
---
Check out [Payo](https://www.twitch.tv/payo), [Monkeynews](https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk) and [Perplexity](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya).
---
Payo and Perplexity play rogues. Monkeynews plays warrior. They're all pretty good at PvP.
---
I don't think T3 looks anything like a druid set at all. Very strange.
---
I think you might be thinking of King Bangalash (which was TBC)?
---
Its weird,i have this memory aswell. I started playing in 2006 and have distinct memories of being butchered by hostile starter mobs in Shadowglen as a Night Elf..and same with alts in Northshire. I distinctly remember the Kobolds being hostile at the very least.
---
Yet in Classic everything is neutral in those starting quests. And its the same on p servers aswell.
---
I even vaguely remember when they made those mobs neutral and commenting to guildies how lame it was lol.
---
So, I have a love/hate relationship with SM.  I love it because it was an awesome instance.  But, I also hate it because I was an idiot at the time.  I leveled my priest as holy.  That sucked.  Couple the questing suckage with the ease of getting groups for SM as a priest and I did that over and over and over again.
---
-
---
Long story short, I was an idiot and ended up fully funding my mount by looting every damn gray and white in SM and selling it as I leveled to 40.
---
Yeah Cata launch was actually the peak for WoW subscriptions. But it's also when things really started to go downhill.
---
People will go on about skill ceiling and l2p but in reality people just used addons and will use addons again.
---
There's a lot of stuff that arguably should be rolled into the UI but it's pretty moot since addons will cover most of it.
---
That server has people on from around the world too. Regions will make it better
---
I think Ulduar is the most popular raid of all time.
---
addons aren't necessary, u can just time it in your head most people are even good enough they can time it better than an addon can u dont NEED addons!!
---
This post is going to be removed.
---
Sad truth is that generally Hunters and Prot Warriors fully utilize their tier sets (Holy Priests sometimes). Other gear options are better for those that want to minmax. Don't let that stop you though! Looks &gt; Stats for some ppl, to each their own!
---
Nothing is wrong with that at all
---
Well I'm sorry that you think being competitive with other pure dps classes is 'carebear'.
---
In Vanilla hunters are garbage at raid DPS and that is while playing the (optimal) aim shot spamming marksman spec.
---
You still have the option in TBC to never use steady shot and continue to half the DPS rogues and mages do.
---
I'm actually convinced that you never even played TBC, so there is little point in continuing to correct you.
---
Except Engineer, always be an engineer.
---
Typically 2 full time prot warriors per 40 man raid.  Some guilds will bring more if only because they will need them in later raid content, or if the main tank already has all the gear.  
---
After the first two, any additional tanking is done by a DPS specced warrior who just puts on tanking gear.  
---
So warrior tanks SUPER desirable.  Prot only warriors, only need 1-2 out of every 40 people.  Good news is fury DPS warriors are super desirable.
---
Aqua Teen Hunger Force I think. Frat Aliens episode.
---
I know I used addons for all of this from very early on. I remember the default ui being pretty terrible because so much was missing.
---
Fun is completely subjective. Warrior tanking in vanilla and TBC is some of the most fun I've had with the game.
---
You must of not been around during vanilla. Everyone customized their interface with addons.
---
Not one that's married with kids should be playing 30 hours a week.
---
This is so true. In most recent expansions, they give you a questline as if its a script and make you act out the part. In Vanilla, it was all up to you to figure out what to do, the game did not guide you at all after the first few zones.
---
It’s so detailed if you zoom in. I’m genuinely rattled at this thing’s face
---
This post nicely sums up the absurd hate/jealousy some people on this sub have for streamers.
---
The addon hasn't been updated in 3 years, so probably not.
---
Besides, it's 100% not going to work for Classic.
---
That's weird. Patch notes show they were made non-aggressive in 3.3.0. I remember one of the kobold mobs was neutral, the ones in the mine were hostile though.
---
Gather around, people of Goldshire! I, the great Maledixtus, want to show you all my newest trick! Just place your hand on the box as I utter the incantations! 
---
*A random level 10 noob instantly dies from the spell as a big effing doomguard spawns and proceeds to beat the everliving fuck out of everyone within 50 yards*
---
because this time around we're going to have addons to it for us, so we can pretend we're having a true classic experience.
---
The ones outside the mine were neutral.
---
you can do all of those thigns without increasing the level cap or the stat budget of items
---
Ah yes, Legolias, level 15 NE hunter -- and Drizzt level 32 NE warrior.
---
Feral dps gear is hard to find and theres not much of it. You will lack dps compared to other roles just because you will be under geared compared to them.
---
It's was actually kind of both, the slow client side meant hanging data that was caused pending data backlogs on servers.  Putting the cart before the horse situation.
---
You can absolutely tame +2 above you.
---
Did Thrall quit as warchief to be more like Chuck Norris?
---
Just in case the Horde badge didn't give it away? :p
---
Tbh the very word private server is unknown to quite a few people. Shocking I know..
---
Blizzard should force them all on one server to contain them :P
---
Warrior is great fun in pvp.  Even more if you have a healer with you, especially a pally throwing blessing of freedom. Executes are really satisfying.
---
I never said you're wrong I just said I don't think it will matter as much as people think. I'll try to avoid it too but I'm not gonna quit or be but hurt if I end up on a streamer server
---
Gunna enjoy the game
---
Yes please that would be awesome, it's especially important because I'm going to be playing on a PvE server and it's a lot more likely I'd be on a streamer server there.
---
I just want to farm elemental earth in badlands, idk why it was just a relaxing farm for me.
---
You tell us. Only you can answer that for yourself.
---
*imagine* thinking you’re going to be a ret Paladin like Esfand and thinking you’re *not* going to be a total fucking joke. 😂😂😂
---
nope.jpg
---
This is a social based game, so you can't do w/e the fuck you want,, and expect everyone else to be okay with it.
---
Because they stream obviously. 🙄 You can not grumble about the negative connotations of celebrity culture while basking in glory of being a celebrity.
---
I really, really wish blizzard would make a statement to the effect that streaming wasn’t part of classic wow and so streamers shouldn’t stream classic if they want to have a classic experience.
---
Warrior Pros in terms of pure tanking include:
---
* Really good "oh shit" cooldowns on separate CDs (Shield Wall, Last Stand)
---
* Taunt diversity on separate CDs (Challenging, Taunt, Mocking)
---
* Mitigation skills (improved shield block spam, disarms on trash, thunderclap)
---
* Rage-dumping over mana dependency
---
So warriors for tanking back in vanilla would be used very frequently, especially for progression. Usually you geared your warrior up first if you were planning to do 40 man progressions and it was much easier to do that than a paladin (have to roll against warriors) or a druid (rolling against rogues). 
---
Once you got your paladin/bear offtanks geared up then you were likely farming that boss by then anyway, and they could handle it easy. But for progression, paladins could run into mana/threat issues and druids dropped harder and more unpredictably than warrior tanks. So warriors were the go-to for progression.
---
And IIRC paladin stuff dropped even if there weren't any in the raid. So as a horde warr you had the potential to gear up even faster.
---
Tbh, taking my time and enjoying the all the aspects of the game I can. You can always make money, but being in such a rush to make gold you might lose out on friendships and moments you'll remember forever.
---
No, mostly because very few people will be leveling leatherworking, and most that are will also take skinning.
---
If you are solo you'll enjoy Hunter more.
---
If you enjoy playing with people warrior is great!
---
You've got to take into account that Nihilum had to go in to boss fights blind, no videos or guides to go off telling them what to do and how to do it. Go in, figure it out and get it done.
---
That was the hard part.
---
priest tier is consistently the best vanilla to wotlk
---
Double gather, mail to alt, sell on AH. At 60 sell Runecloth. Use 2x Righteous Orbs to enchant Crusader on some unbound level 1 white weapons for the lolz.
---
As a Warrior / Shaman combo we’re going Mining/skinning and Leatherworking/Enchanting.  We plan on providing leather to the shaman from the warrior skinning, also will help boost enchanting from greens via LWing. We will farm devilsaurs fairly early, Devilsaur set is a BIG amount of gold if you get to corner the market.
---
Also Un’goro has s good amount of Rich Thorium which will provide Arcane Crystals, I’ll likely save for Thunderfury (gotta save x100 of them).
---
Need the T0, T0.5 and T2.5 sets in their too!
---
What weapons are those supposed to be?
---
To get an idea of how it is working there is this post from TBC:
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/18325-the-new-rage-formula-by-kalgan/
---
The issue is that rage generation was changed a lot during the course of vanilla and during TBC, so private servers were having to make a lot of guesses.  The rage conversion number is calculated per mob, and was hidden from the client.  Also stuff like the mobs armor will affect rage generation and armor values are substantially incorrect it appears.  
---
I know people doing 1-10 testing were claiming that at least at low level rage generation was higher on classic beta vrs private servers, but I do not not if that is the case for all levels.
---
I literally forgot about Twinks for the last 10 years
---
BRD is very long and often abandoned without finishing, but nothing sharpens your reflexes, wit, and commitment like that instance. Some good gear drops from there and you'll always have people wanting in on a chance at Hand of Justice.
---
I look forward to attempting it for the first time.
---
Geographically on the continent, yes, but in terms of traveling from place to place, Org is more central (considering it's the hub between Kalimdor and both ends of the Eastern Kingdoms)
---
Female dwarf looks cool, and I like how the long braids move while casting. But the animations overall aren't that great.
---
Male dwarf is vastly superior. This is my opinion and all other opinions are wrong.
---
I wouldn't mind being on Mad's. He's a good dude, small enough and actually knows what he's talking about. If I accidentally am on a server with a streamer, hope it's him lol
---
Horde towns suck...
---
Warriors are pure hell to level solo. Now if you can find a pocket healer or even pocket DPS fun can be had. You'll want to start back-to-back instance run as soon and often as you can. They get more fun around 60, and massively fun with gear.
---
I always played hunter as MM. It’s fun and not too hard to master. I did survival once and that wasn’t as fun though lol
---
Everyone's gotta have their "standing around Ironforge" set since transmogs won't be a thing.
---
Basically impossible. Ret isn't a good spec. You can play it but it's not "competitive"
---
Loved it all!!
---
I watched all of his vids.
---
I still know all the damn words to this dumbass medley
---
I don't think that's true. It's attack speed didn't change once you tamed it. And the only pet attack speed talent is a proc chance after they crit. And...Wrath doesn't increase attack speed at all.
---
But I am willing to do all the grunt work that no one else wants to do! Doesn’t that count for something?

&gt; I distinctly remember the Kobolds being hostile at the very least.    
---
You sure you aren't thinking of the ones south of goldshire in the mine? That's where many players died for the first time (that or the Murlocs in the lake).
---
Same as I did at launch. Alchemy and selling health/mana pots. Easily afforded my first mount right when I hit 40 with plenty of gold  to spare and never had an issue affording skills. Plus they came in handy leveling as a Warrior.
---
Paladins be like.... nope gtfo
---
Your best bet is going holy and finding a guild that you click with. Make friends and start gathering ret gear for your ret spec. Eventually they will let you try your Ret especially when raids are on farm and nobody feels you are holding back progression.  
---
It’s just like a shadow priest, there’s such low demand that the roles are hard to get into.
---
I'm going Undead Warlock. I plan to mostly pvp. Orc is easily better for cloth casters due to their stun resist against their argued counter, Rogues. But I like the looks, lore, starting zone, mounts, and animations far more than a stun resist. I haven't played in ages (since tbc) and probably wont be super amazing to counter the rogues on skill alone for a while, but I don't care. I'm gonna enjoy the ride.
---
That said, I am getting engineering this time. I always wanted to try it and the items you get are fun. I got tailoring+enchanting in vanilla, I had pre-bis before raids easily, and It was fun to be a bag vendor, but this time around ima throw robotic dragons at people and have like 4 different extra stun trinkets to mess with people. So again, I'm playing for fun.
---
Now this is a plan!
---
I was never a C- I mean Hunt in vanilla, but King B was defi around by then.
---
Tbh I was just going to google it or look on youtube to see if people put something out. It's more of "let's hope i can find what server they are on" sort of think.
---
I had my old Auctioneer data from Vanilla thanks to automatic backups on a drive in my closet, but I didn't start using it until BWL released. I was also able to grab auction data for several blizz-like Private Servers from fresh launch until Naxx, but that data was harder to depend on. In any case, I was able to create a list of items that are going to increase in price as more people hit 60 and the phases drop. I have about 900 items on it.
---
I will not at all be attempting to make money before hitting 60. I've already calculated what I need to do to make sure I have a mount at 40 and none of it requires interacting with other players. We're going for a week one Rag kill in any case, so I can't afford to waste time.
---
As far as professions, my plan is to take Skinning and Mining and only stick with Mining as far as it'll take me without wasting too much time on my leveling grind. Depending on how Layering works, this might not be very far at all, but we'll see. I'll be keeping all green quest rewards and greens I don't think will sell in my bank (besides weapons, those I'll vendor). Once Mining is no longer useful, I'll switch over to Enchanting and DE everything. After 60 and most of the quest hubs finished, I'll pick up Mining again.
---
I plan on MCing people off boats and the great lift.
---
Tauren? God damn racists
---
Mark Kern was not Vanilla's lead, he was a team lead on Vanilla, there were multiple people above him on the project.
---
After getting my main to 60, level a bunch of alts to 35 and sell arcanite transmute cooldowns.
---
Alright but how would I be able to level as holy? I was planning on using ret for leveling... 
---
Should I focus on healer in while leveling or just respec to holy after hitting max level?
---
Tried to cover as many bases and be as accurate as possible. Please correct any errors, learned a lot myself.
---
I've seen a lot of discussion of Horde vs Alliance, Paladin vs Shaman. What Race is best for Warrior etc. I wanted to bring it all together in one place.
---
Never underestimate the wills of a bunch of assholes trying to ruin the time of an even bigger asshole :)
---
You can clear all content as a Ret paladin just not in a min/max guild. 
---
Find a competent guild and raid with them there will be plenty of dedicated guilds that won’t min/max
---
I mean, retail is more difficult and more challenging content than Classic is. 
---
You're confusing time investment with difficulty.
---
Axe skill on tanks doesn't work when they have thunderfury, which they should be aiming for, or at later points way too many axes are slow and you need a fast wep for heeooc strike spam, so troll is the best tank for tps
---
No. In any half decent guild everyone’s putting in the work and effort. Put it this way - in modern wow people get upset and don’t get invite if their spec is 15% behind the top spec. Ret is literally 50% behind the good specs in Vanilla. You’re just wasting everyone’s time.
---
Yes, and it's not to say that you can't get in a guild that raids. If the guild really likes you they might bring you anyway. Having said that it's not even close to optimal so the real competitive, pushing guilds won't want a retadin. Also my guess is a lot of people will try ret/enhance/feral because it became viable later in the games life.

I went troll rogue for the pve racial in vanilla and regretted it so hard until race change was brought into wow. I looked ridiculous in even great gear. Especially the barefoot part. It looked like my set was missing the boots. 
---
Do yourself a favor and make sure you enjoy the looks of your character first.
---
best tank wpns are swords....  axe skill does dick.
---
Same here, slow lvl'd horde-bc onwards, but speed lvl'd ally from Cata on. Now I want to slow lvl ally side.
---
In a competitive guild? No, afraid not. A competitive is just that, a *competitive guild*, and a ret paladin doesn't fit there. You'd need 3+ ret paladins to make up for a single warrior's DPS.
---
Yeah I’m worried about that. I plan to go Druid and I’m going balance, but I know cat helps me level faster, and I want Resto and bear to group and do dungeons so idk what I’m gonna do. At least I’ll have travel form so I won’t be in huge need of a mount.
---
Arms is a flawed tree for leveling, but probably slightly better then fury.   Both trees start slow, but imp overpower helps level out the unlucky streaks and MS at low gear level will easily out preform bloodthirst.  
---
That being said, if you do a lot of dungeons or group level, I think fury quickly takes over.  Fury functions much better when you are able to group pull mobs as you will have x3 or x4 the enrage uptime.  It is also not tied to a specific weapon or to using 2h.  1h fury tanking is probably better for threat then full prot while leveling.
---
It will work well if you are diligent at calling off your pets attacks. Priests really need the last hit to level efficiently.
---
How late in the games life are we talking? I am willing to go holy before and swapping to ret when I have the chance.
---
I was the paladin class lead and an officer in a Top-5 raiding guild in vanilla (04-07)... due to Blizzard’s paladin builds through at least BC (and much later really)... your sustained DPS won’t come near that of the other formal damage dealing classes, while your utility of healing, buffing, cleansing and supporting is incredibly strong (paladins can top the healing meters and every group with a tank needs one, ideally).
---
Once the raid is over the gear hump, we enjoyed letting some of our paladins taking a 2-handed out and have fun (all of them had Dredgers or Herald of Woes), but when wiping on new content and gearing up to the zone requirement, not so much.
---
Of course, and to go back to the food analogy, you can always add salt to your soup but you can't take it out. 
---
Which I guess is a good point to make with this kind of thing.
---
I got a 48 hour ban in TBC for using "no n***a" to alliance when they tried to gank me.
---
What a moron "LUL"
---
that's just forcing a hamsterwheel though, like how current content needs higher ilvl . It's just moving goalposts. There's gotta be a better way still but I don't think wow's system at its core is compatible.
---
Honestly, Warcraft 3 explains the entire story leading up to Classic WoW. You will get a feeling for what the Horde and Alliance are all about along with each race by playing Warcraft 3.
---
Yup, that’s what the no changes lunatics fought for, simulated lag.
---
Guild Wars 2 has a pretty nice solution imo. All armour models are what they are, but you can dye them. So people can make unique outfits to their taste but items are still recognisable.
---
My first glance at WoW vanilla was over my friend's shoulder. It was just after release. He was only level 10.
---
A priest ran past him in Razor Hill and put fortitude on him.
---
He goes, "What! You don't buff ME! I buff YOU!!!" and forces 20 food &amp; water onto said priest after buffing him with int.
---
Pretty much this I agree with you galivet, you are actively hurting your faction picking a race that isn't optimal when you could be playing the optimal race to increase your odds of faction victory or that small % needed to save a raid or dungeon group. You hurt the collective for your own selfish desire to pick what's \["pretty"\].
---
Pretty much there is no logical reason to play a race that isn't optimal. If you are horde be an Orc or Undead unless you are druid, that's the only exception. Dwarfs for PvP Alliance unless you are gnome or night elf for druid. 
---
Why would you want to play with someone who isn't the optimal build, race or class set when there are tons of players and anyone could easily fill your place. You should really feel ashamed of yourself if you go troll or human \[for PvP\] that you purposely made the game harder for everyone else.
---
Can't wait to play my Troll Ret Paladin.
---
You can level as ret just fine. Keep a set of intellect gear in your bags in case you want an easy spot in a dungeon run, it won't be necessary to spec into holy for that.
---
 !RemindMe 79 days
---
Man, as I mentioned in the article it feels bad. Like my heart says Undead, but my head says Orc. Years of retail, a game I still love btw, has conditioned me to prioritise the numbers.
---
Hearing your story makes me doubt my decision again!
---
Look at this guy wanting to make changes. Totally shouldn't have given invites to current wow subscribers.
---
I can heal as a ret spec?
---
I could have tamed any Deviate Raptor, but man, I wanted Takk the Leaper more than any other. I camped in the Barrens for days and when he finally showed up I had to formulate a plan to tame him before he killed me.
---
I took that raptor everywhere with me, and we were best friends. I quit the game for a bit when I hit 50 and my brother tried to introduce his friend to the game, to my shock using my character as I would later learn.
---
I log back in a month later to see my glorious grey raptor friend is nowhere to be seen, and in his place a King Bangalash named loleatsnoobz.
---
So thats the story of how I rage quit hunter and made a shaman.
---
The goal of a lot of the bigger streamers was to take over a server and have roughly half of them go horde or alliance. Asmon/Esfand alliance, soda and crew horde. Also Tim was supposed to be alliance but looks like he will be going horde sadly for some reason. 
---
Basically the big streamers wanted to all be on a server to have a large community
---
Oh fuck let me fix that!
---
hah. you are so clever.
---
I love the lore of the forsaken and the Plaguelands and my character has a ton of Pre-raid BiS in scholomance and stratholme so I plan to spend a lot of time there.
---
Wait, ret paladins are viable in PvP?
---
Next expansion?
---
You can level as Ret and respec to holy at 60. Respec cost is low at first. It just gets expensive as you keep doing it. 
---
 I would suggest getting to 50 and going holy and start doing dungeons as healer. Many BiS items will drop from dungeons that you can start to farm at low 50s and you will get groups much faster as a healer. Farming dungeons for gear/quests/xp at that level is very efficient if you can group quickly.
---
There's no reason to make old content difficult to try to give a since of "pride and accomplishment" tbh. 
---
If you want the "pride and accomplishment" of old raid content, you should do the achievements when they are current content. 
---
Like getting the Undying in Naxx when it was wrath content, an actually difficult title to get. 
---
Or defeating a mythic boss in Legion or BfA when it is current content, an actually difficult title to get.
---
Ret was never a viable raiding spec for competitive guilds in the entire history of Vanilla.
---
Lol these comments. How about stfu and be grateful for the buff you ungrateful little shits :D.
---
Of course I never played. I sold my account for $350 a week before BC, specifically because of all the shit they were doing. "Hurr durr, stupid mechanic changes are good if it means bigger numbers." My fucking sides, you're the reason why retail became what it did. Thank god retards like you can't touch my pure, superior vanilla experience.
---
Warriors destroy everything in PvP but they are easy to contain, unless they are babysat by a paladin with blessing of freedom, cleanse and heals. That's a big part of it. Horde warriors can also stomp but they require free action potions to even get close to anything. 
---
There are of course different tiers of premades. Just getting the raid on discord is enough to win most battles against pugs. Getting a good combo of players is of course always good. 
---
The battlegrounds themselves also play a role. AV is hilariously balanced in favour of Horde in pug v pug because of the backdoor and the reverse in premade v premade because of the bridge.    
---
Sidenote: on private servers it used to be possible to sorta premade it by having everyone in a raid or discord channel press queue at the same time and if there were a delay before the queue popped you would likely end up in the same instance. I don't know if that will work on Classic but god damn I hope it does because pugging AV is literally worse than stapling your balls to a burning roof, especially for Alliance.
---
What does that have to do with classic and him not accepting help for his epic mount?  Cash and in game items are two separate things.
---

Absolutely, you can heal here and there, seal of command spam, you don’t need a gigantic pool of mana for a 15 minute boss fight. 
---
I craved more DPS than any ret paladin could attain, so my next main was a fire mage... and like everyone else, a spoiled alt rogue 😄
---
I don't see a badge, maybe cuz I'm on mobile
---
I think there is a compromise here. I would argue that for person who wants to avoid population, which in my opinion only Asmongold and Soda are likely effect that, Asmongold and Soda could release a short list of servers they are not going to play on. This way they can have their hour or so of anonymity to potentially get ahead of the curve and the group of people that loathe their existence and want to avoid them will have a handful of servers to choose from. Asmongold and Soda are in no way beholden to give favors to their detractors, but maybe high-roading here by showing this small concession would go a long way.
---
I feel like the most important human racial is 10% rep gain
---
Touché.
---
You can add veteran content.  Forget the new levels, add veteran levels 1-10 and make the new gear only work in veteran areas.  If you haven't cleared Naxx?  No big deal, you can still gain veteran levels, get veteran gear, do veteran raids and come back and keep working on Naxx without trivializing it.
---
Good luck getting through airport security with that in your pocket!

"this time around"?
---
These addons have existed since vanilla. They were added into the default UI because of their prevalence making those that didn't use them at a great disadvantage.
---
Why does it seem like there are so many people who didn't know that addons existed throughout pretty much the entirety of vanilla?
---
PVP is fun if you can engage first/have a healer, leveling you hamstring kite mobs to death. Pvp and pve are both rewarding to play, from tanking to dps. Plentiful kit of abilities to use.
---
I've had a bunch of hunters over the years so I know how to play them decently and only want to get better in classic. Thanks!
---
Early on, yeah. Once you get to 50+, the dungeons get harder so it might not be recommended healing as ret at that point.
---
The addon has false information as well because it was intended for tbc prepatch, as did joanas guide.
---
AQ essentially. The tier gear up till AQ is holy specific but the gear specifically from AQ is decent for ret.
---
Up to about the level 40 dungeons you can heal decently as Ret. Especially if you save some +healing/intellect gear to throw on for dungeons but for 50+ dungeons I would suggest you respec and stay holy.
---
No he shouldnt lol
---
You could use a book in your life - then you might realize that those are Carrion Grubs you're rutting, not 'alliance women', you filthy savage.
---
Low quality content
---
Like a prostitute, without all the lame sex stuff.
---
I also dinged 60 in silithus pre AQ patch, killing those damn undead NE on my war, they were a huge pain. They all spawned a second mob on death.
---
I bet you were the kid in middle school who stood outside without a jacket on and in shorts whenever it was below freezing to flex on all us betas, eh?
---
Entirely subjective. I think the warrior is fun but I find the mage to be boring. It’s all about how you your play style and mine has always been “wear cool armor and swing a sword around” so plate armor classes are my go to.
---
BAHAHAHA holy fuck. That's some greasy shit haha. Payo is funny as to watch though for sure.
---
I mean subs went down in wod. Went back up in MoP. Went up in legion. Down for BFA. That’s not trending downward spiral.
---
haha weapons of mass destruction
---
Yeah, all those cool but "useless on max level" sets and items are actually giving Classic so much replayability, it's insane. That's why I'd love to see a feature that let's you stop XP gain on your character to actually fully allow twinking with all those different endgames, that come with it. And yeah, orthodox "no changes" crowd is giving me hate for it, but as I see it - this feature only brings you more Vanilla. It's so cool watching this new lvl 30 meta on Beta right now. Honestly, it's awesome.
---
Okay, after AQ will I be able to respec as ret?
---
The way it’s headed? Subs were on the increase during MoP and legion but now that the game is decreasing it’s suddenly not sustainable? 
---
I’ll go back to my original comment about how another expansion can raise subs just like it has always done.
---
I'm glad the community is starting to dislike Asmongold, dudes terribly toxic. He gets a bunch of free shit from his fans in game, and will barley say thank you.
---
He bought the 5million gold mount in BFA, and 90% of the gold came from viewers.
---
Yeah I'll admit you're partially right but demo shout is not how warriors do aoe threat (after all same tool is available to druids). 
---
Druids do aoe threat for 3 targets better than warriors but more than that they don't have as many tools like consumables etc.
---
Mine is still there.
---
The OG Triple OG , you the best man !
---
Agreed. He apparently aspires twitch culture in ppl all the same tho, judging from getting downvoted for the truth xd
---
I see misinformation spread every minute of every day on this subreddit by people who know nothing about the game, I combat it when I can.
---
You're holding the hunter back. The game isn't hard. If you've played any version of retail, you get the concept already. It's the same buttons and the same + more abilities you've been using already.
---
It's better at that point. It's never going to be the best but at that point you may bring enough utility to offset the dps loss.
---
It only procs off ticks of drain soul, if your corruption or wand or coa kills it you won’t get the proc.
---
My brother was the main tank in our top-5 raiding guild.  You are the absolute star of the raid, and in our down time, we’d run AV and he’d be simply unkillable with me, his paladin brother, and his holy priest main-healing girlfriend.

HELP!
---
Your first 5 weapon skill against a boss NPC is 3% hit, and 15% reduction in the glancing blow penalty.  You glancing blow 40% of the time against a 63, so that is a 6% damage gain on glancing blows, and a 3% from miss.  Your yellow attacks will not glancing and have lower hit cap, so this only affects your white damage which is on the order of 40% of your dps.  
---
So first pass we are looking at around 4.5% dps boost, however the number is larger then that because you also get additional rage generation from those white hits increasing your yellow damage.  So the damage gain will be on the order of 6%.  
---
There is gear that non-human warriors can use to increase weapon skill, but then they lose out on the stats that gear would otherwise have, so no matter what they will always be somewhere behind human warriors.    
---
If you ever want to tank the number number is far higher then 6%.  Tanks don't have the option of weapon things like edgemaster's, and since they are facing the boss they also have to deal with parry.  The first 5 weapon skill represents a 3% parry reduction, so human tanks should do on the other of 9% to 10% more threat.
---
INVEST IN STOCKS! ^(CANT GO TITS UP!)
---
As said elsewhere, Ret Paladins can be quite good in PvP. Vanilla PvP engagements were quick and brutal, and if you could lock a person down or burst them such that they couldn't respond to you, you would kill them. This means that most hybrid specs were good in PvP, since they almost all had good burst even if their damage sustain was far too low to competently PvE (with the exception of Shadowpriest, which has a coveted PvE debuff that can make for a 1-per-raid scenario, and it is great in PvP not because of burst but because of great CC and the inevitability of its damage).
---
But in PvE? I repeat the chorus. Ret is utter fucking garbage in PvE. You are so comically worse than Warriors or Rogues of *any* spec that it's almost laughable. You'll only ever be able to PvE as Ret in a non-progression guild, or in a progression guild playing Holy and respeccing for farm-status raid clears. There's literally no reason to bring you to a raid from a numbers perspective. Even Feral Druids can put out better damage while also simultaneously being able to Offtank with the same spec, while your job as "Nightfall debuffer" can easily be filled by a melee-weaving Hunter or a dps/OT Warrior. The only worse talent tree in PvE is probably Balance Druid.
---
Hang up your hat and play Holy if you want to progress. If you insist on PvEing as Ret, find a casual guild that doesn't care about progression and lets anyone do whatever they want.
---
I strafe with Q and E, and have A and D for abilities obviously.
---
This way, my middle finger is less extended and more comfortable, also it makes hitting all the number keys faster.
---
For anyone reading this, rest your WAD fingers on QWE instead and see how it feels.
---
Any other QWES users out there?
---
Huh, that is a good point I hadn't seen before. Thank you
---
Pet scaling always frustrated me in vanilla
---
Yeah, anything undead = holy zonk'd 
---
But for a new-to-wow player considering tank classes; big warning label.
---
No matter what they do, there would need to be a level cap increase.
---
Naxx40 gear is already busted, especially if you take into PvP.  How can they possibly go any higher?  The power creep would be insane.
---
why this nonsense allowed in this subreddit ?
---
I am a grumpy old man that's tired of this streaming crap I have to worry about. Can't I just enjoy playing a game?
---
What about a guild on a PvP server? Will I be able to justify them taking me as an offtank there if I am able to perform well in BGs and WPvP?
---
Yes, [but from afar](https://i.imgur.com/Ub6BZHe.jpg).
---
It's really quite simple. If you're not playing a Tauren Druid, your opinion doesn't matter. At all.
---
Worth it aslong as the police report starts with Did someone say.
---
another twitch streamer advertisement in subreddit
---
“Now go collect your arrow”
---
You’re not going to find a competitive guild that will take a ret. you may find good guilds that will take a ret but if you’re genuinely looking to play at the highest level with the most hardcore guilds you’re playing the wrong spec and you’ll likely realize that when you’re putting in 10x the effort for a third of the output.
---
Yea, too bad it technically wont be the entire server viewing the same thing.
---
RL friends can eat a fat one, I'm joining dark iron mathah fahkahs YEH GOT ANOTHEH BEEEEEER BROTHA
---
Probably go 5/5 Imp righteousness instead of strength since more holy damage = more threat and because it works as a percentage it scales with spell power gear like the Judgement set.
---
But will it be viable enough to contribute?
---
I would be very clear with the guild that you want to play ret but are willing to put in the work as holy pre-AQ and see if they accept. Keep in mind (depending on loot structure) you may be passed up for gear until AQ so that'll always put you behind. 
---
Have you asked yourself why you want to play ret in the first place?
---
is classicwow subreddit become an advertisement site for twitch streamers now ?
---
If someone takes you as ret, you're still gonna have to yeet buffs on people. Just because you wouldn't be a healer spec doesn't mean you would be exempt from support duties.
---
It's a mental illness that's quite common.  People want to live vicariously through others.  They'll donate $ to streamers just to have their name on the screen.  Some will compete to see who can donate the most.   That's why  the streamers all have these sub announcements and whatnot.  It's like an addiction.
---
They are, actually. IIRC it's the one paid service they are providing.
---
Mostly for PvP, I love the idea of a Golden armored knight killing Orcs and Undead...
---
The default name of pets is just whatever class of pet the are. "Spider", "Boar" etc.
---
Hey man, me and my brother contemplated this, I think it could work pretty well if you go BM on the hunter make the pet tank then just let the priest go shadow, your mend pet is plenty to keep the pet alive and you will be able to chain pull almost eternally if the preist can get a last hit every second or third mob
---
is that blood elf ?
---
You should remove the 5th line, there is no reason to tell people how to say that
---
Took way longer than that.  At lvl 60, I'd try to grind out the last 20-30 in UBRS (yea, kind of a dick move) and an entire run of attacking wouldn't even finish the job.  
---
Once you get close to cap, it takes a long time.
---
The night elf opening cinematic music still haunts me , thats the best , second best is human start zone.. Dwarf starting movie and music feels depressing (to me)
---
Best Single Armor: Bloodfang Rogue T2 (Pally T2 runner up)
---
Best Overall Collection: Paladin (no contest)
---
Best Improvement: Warrior T1 to T2
---
Worst Overall Collection: Priest (just boring)
---
Worst Progression: Warlock T2 to T3
---
Mine is also still there. I only had access to Stress, not Beta. If I try connect it tells me the Classic Stress Test server is offline.
---
I don’t think there are any specs for any class that the best pvp spec is also the best pve spec. Every serious player who did pve and pvp just changed specs. 
---
I would respec pvp after our raids for the week were done giving me a good 3-4 days before having to spec pve again. 
---
Most people aren’t going to be raiding. If you raid as holy paladin and pick up some gear for your Ret set you will destroy most people in pvp. Don’t let all these people put you down on Ret. It’s fun and you are hated by the horde. The good Ret paladins on my server were very well known because they were so hard to kill.
---
THE BOAR IS PREGNANT NED!
---
No. PvP guilds that are serious about progression simply respec, since PvE specs and PvP specs are often vastly different. A PvP progression guild will expect you to raid as Holy and PvP as, well, frankly Holy because Holy is still better in premades than Ret, but conceivably you could PvP as Ret if you were a dedicated member.
---
This is frankly one of the undying and uncomfortable truths about Vanilla; not all specs are created equal. Ret Paladins are simply *bad* in PvE. *Prot* Paladins are bad in PvE, but at least they actually do have minimal scenarios where they can be Offtanks. Ret can't even OT. It has terrible healing compared to Holy, terrible DPS compared to everything, and terrible tanking ability compared to Prot, which already has poor tanking ability. It's one of the unequivocally worst talent trees in the game for PvE, and while its PvP usage is marginally decent, that's not remotely enough leverage for you to ask a PvP guild to let you raid as Ret as well. You should already expect to spend 100g a week on double respecs before and after the weekly raids. Respec as Holy for PvE, hope a guild will accept you as Ret in BGs, and slowly collect non-set Ret gear (because the only PvE "Ret set" is T2.5 in AQ40) after the melee DPS in your guild have already had their fill.
---
Budokanjh, GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME!
---
If you run with daggers, which eventually outclasses swords, a Human Rogue is pointless.
---
If you mean guilds that are racing for server firsts then probably not. That's very few guilds though and there are certainly very hardcore guilds that take ret paladins, especially if they can keep the same Nightfall uptime as on private servers. 
---
Another hurdle is that guilds usually have one ret paladin who goes completely bonkers with his use of consumables. Theloras is a pretty famous ret paladin on the private servers (and a good one unlike Esfand) and the first time I saw him in my raid he had popped just about every elixir in the game. It was mental, probably 100g per pull at least. He did do quite a bit of damage though, stayed in top 10 on many fights. But this is the kind of competition you'll have. Really good and dedicated players seem to be drawn to the mid-tier guilds as ret paladins because they can actually beat the meters.
---
Ya but again hybrids aren't optimal. Ever. But there are some situations where it would be ok. Sort of like an enhance shaman. A raid could maybe have one sometimes.
---
It is vanilla, there is no 5% stat modifier for wearing all of the same armor type.  Warrior tier sets are designed for tanks, so they have to be creative with gear.  If you arn't getting attacked armor doesn't matter, so for a lot of classes wearing a different armor type is the only way to play your class at a high level in pve.  Expect to see a lot of warriors in leather, and paladins and shamans in cloth.
---

Skinning knife heirloom ftw.

Nice advertisement for the twitch streamer in here
---
You had to comment that three times? Literally everyone got it...
---
Also, I agree with you that ctrl + 1 is too much of a stretch.
---
Personally I don't use ctrl as a modifier, just shift and alt. Whatever works for you.
---
Don’t understand who will be watching when Classic is released. Fair to say a 50-75% drop in their respective audiences?
---
Are you Kungen?
---
I don't even remember how or where I got it, but way back in the day I managed to tame a ghost wolf. He wasn't the greatest fighter, but damn did it look cool. I would love to log in again just to see him, but I haven't had a subscription since TBC.
---
Idk.. if someone makes it to 35~, they are probably in it for a lot longer than you give them credit for.  40 is always a boost in motivation, and even though the game gets stupidly slow (xp wise) at 50~, you also get awesome dungeons like ST, maraudon, and BRD to run that can give you very good gear... in some cases even gear that will last you at 60 for a bit.
---
That would be awful. We dont need an ingame damage meter, even if it helps your self esteem
---
‘Market can crash’. Fuck me. You guys are literally so fucking dumb that it hurts.
---
Good job!!! And congrats!!! This should be a motivational meme because it made me want to conquer things xD
---
The fact that they down voted you is laughable and the sad thing is you're not wrong. Having not only experienced it and watched the more extreme server events on youtube it's just sad. These lads are brainwashed.
---
are you being paid to advertise the streamer's twitch channel here ? stop it
---
Venruki is chill and skillful, esfand is fun to watch, he interacts with his chat a lot and he's been playing a lot of vanilla wow, staysafe plays a lot too but can be super opinionated, he's a fast warlock leveler . There's some decent ones
---
I think Pally takes T1 by a little
---
I could see either one for T2 (tho i like rogue)
---
But T3 pally just destroys T3 rogue...T3 rogue looks like a pre raid set...and not one specific to Rogue...whereas T3 pally looks like a god damn Valkyrie
---
This is only a problem if you resigned yourself to questing completely and utterly and avoided dungeon runs.  Even gnomer has quests available from 29-35 that should entice you do run it multiple times, and that is a lot of extra xp.
---
Mine is missing as well.
---
I think if I had gone orc or undead I would have been happy. They both don’t look really dumb to me. That’s just my personal opinion though. If one really doesn’t appeal to you it will probably make you hate it later on. 
---
I was full T2 and I looked so dumb. My guild mate and pvp buddy was Rank 14 and a troll hunter too. I always thought that his badass gear was so wasted on a troll but he thought he looked cool.
---
I relogged my client and now it is gone
---
Agreed, for the recommendation part I tried to take a more holistic view with Swords being more available towards the earlier start of raiding. Youre definitely right. Ill add a addendum to include this
---
[this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmnXcrvMRY)
---
\#no changes
---
Agreed. I think on some level the Internet has ruined games in that fashion. 
---
It used to be everyone picked what looks interesting and lives with their choices. But game guides and achievement guides have become more and more popular through the years and there are many people who just that is their default. Opening up a guide to tell them what they should do at the start of a game. But if a game is designed well, then you don't need a guide.
---
It effects me (who picks what looks cool or whatever) cause if too many people go Horde and cause an imbalance, that is bad for matchmaking.
---
GO! RUN BACK TO WINTERSPRING! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE! I'LL PUT IT THERE MYSELF YOU FOOL!

This is spot on. Well said

So you want them to pull a BGS and release it Fallout 76 style. We all know how great that worked out...
---
Clearly you didn't play on ND launch.
---
Lock for me if they TBC classic. Probably go rogue or warrior for classic.
---
Eh, I kind of feel like 50-59 would be.  Almost every spec in the game gets something good at 40 (not to mention mounts at or close to 40) that should give you a burst of motivation.  
---
By the time you hit 50 though, all that crap started to get old, and now it was nothing but you and the grind in zones that were much more dangerous than ever before.

I saw another quote today that reminded me of wow, it was on the door to the employee bathroom: "Shit goes in the toilet"
---
a death by a thousand cuts usually starts with a small scratch.
---
Theloras is on reddit, btw. Say hello, /u/Theloras. Tell OP what he's in for if he intends to raid as Ret.
---
Raids want 8-10 warriors typically, meaning for raid balance 20 to 25% of the servers population should be claiming they are going to be warrior.  
---
These polls often has warrior as #1, but it is in the 14-18% range, and even then warrior is a class a lot of newbies roll and quit when they realize it is hard to level.  
---
In terms of gear, realize a lot of fury BiS gear is non-plate meaning you are stealing it from other classes.  The actual pieces designed for your class are almost always tanking gear.  Warriors and rogues are kinda loot-lumped together, mages and warlocks together, and all the healers lumped together.  Only hunters and tanks get their loot to themselves.  So there is high competition for gear, it isn't any better for any of the top tier dps classes.
---
I guess where we disagree most is how you think we need addons. You prefer these things, and due to those preferences you want, but do not need addons. They are not necessities to enjoying the game. I would guess 90% of the playerbase doesn't use addons, let alone argue about the shirtcomings of the UI on reddit. Its simple means of giving you ways to cast your spells and look at your stuff is functional, and stuff like the gryphons make it distinctive, so that it doesn't look exactly like all the other no-frills UIs whose only goal is to convey information.
---
Damn I sound like a blizzard shill who thinks they can do no wrong. You make good points.
---
Ah, the Misplaced Servo Arm. We didn't see many of those drop from what I remember, so I was using Claw of the Black Drake and Edge of Chaos for those rare occasions I wasn't offtanking.
---
No. It’s always horde biased. Always zug zugs. The best guilds and first kills will be from horde guilds. The BGs will always be dominated by horde and I hate it. :)
---
I think you are misunderstanding people on this. 
---
40-50 is a massive time sink that can make or break many people.  At least in the 50-55 range you can start gearing up to prepare for lvl 60 5 mans, but before then it is just 80+ hours of dragging your butt through the same old quests you've been doing from 1-40, just against more dangerous enemies.
---
Ret dps is NOT competitive at all , even with end game bis you are like 50% behind warriors and rogues 
---
PvP on the other hand ......
---
some of them are invited by blizz to try the classic WOW and they get preferential BETA invite , this is called advertising and mutual benefit. Same as those people who kept posting streamer's twitch links in this subreddit , most likely they are paid to advertise the twitch channel everywhere.. 
---
We already saw youtube search being skewed toward certain streamer who pay these shills to promote his channel , thus forcing youtube search algorithm to put this streamer's videos up top.. World First !! xxx Sneezed !! xxx entered Deadmines !! xxx entered STV gank zone
---
This whole thread had really shown how out of touch non vanilla players are with vanilla players, lol. The spoiled kids of modern Wow are use to the easy way for everything and always getting handouts, 99% of these fresh classic players won't even get into MC.
---
Shut up nerd
---

---
auto loot is in the beta, auto aoe loot is in beta, [battle.net](https://battle.net) is in beta, recommending people to be invited to the group is in beta, loot trading is in beta (only tradeable for raid items), report feature is in beta
---
That isn't the point.  The point is that the grind makes or breaks it for many people.  Simply grinding enemies all day long for a couple weeks isn't changing that at all, because it isn't something everyone can tolerate.
---
lol that is the most retarded rebuttal I've ever heard
---
I know Asmongold but who is Soda?
---

LMFAO
---
Is it worth it to level as Prot if you really enjoy the fantasy of using a sword and board while you level?
---
Would just jump back if what? I don’t see how that’s relevant since I’m saying in one supported path, it stays true to classic.
---
my friend is going shadow and i don't mind BM at all, thanks.  really hoping we get the beta to test this out.
---
These meters are worthless af, and were a bad addition to the game.
---
A rogue fighting nonstop in Arathi no matter where no matter when, will easily top the meter, while being completely worthless, compared to a a rogue spending all game defending the stables flag.
---
The same is true for a, say, druid, hotting people fighting middle-of-the-map in WSG all the time. Hes easily top of the meter, and is completely worthless compared to the guy defending the flag carrier.
---
Same feels with Humar, a night elf and I were camping it for a few days and I got it when the nelf wasn’t logged on
---
I'm worried of both directions, getting on a streamer server n having it only be on when they're on or rolling on a rando server n barely getting a 5 man group once the games been out for a while b/c everyone quit :/
---
I think you overestimate the amount of people who care about streamers
---
Also a lot of newbies roll warrior as kinda the default class without any understanding of the game's mechanics.  First time players rarely select a seemingly complicated class or a non-powerful one like a priest.
---
what are you even saying ? BETA release is NOT for people's enjoyment or sadistic blizzard way to torture people by releasing beta so far ahead 
---
IT IS TOO CLEAN THE GAME FROM BUGS..
---
and yet you only see it from your own perspective , which is rather egoistical
---
If someone asks about stuff like that, people on this sub have every right to answer with minmax questions, but it gives a kind of atmosphere over minor shit like iron grenades or sword specialization that makes it look way bigger than it actually is, and that’s why people sweat it because the only information they’re exposed to are these responses. Some counterposts just grounding these kind of minor boosts in reality should be the way to make both crowds happy. Stuff like “human racial for a sword spec’d rogue is a 1.8% DPS increase on a 100% uptime fight” goes a long way to let people make a more informed decision on shit like that. Some people will value that DPS boost, others will say that it isn’t worth having to look at human ass for their beloved character instead of night elf ass or dwarf ass. Same with grenades and trinkets from engineering, same with fear ward, the boosts need to be put into perspective.
---
yes id rather have a tiger mount at 40 on my human over 30s cd fear ward and blind immunity

Just make sure you keep a stack of meat to keep that beast happy

I have played paladin since vanilla all the way to current retail and private servers. I am also playing Paladin in classic.
---
Ret is absolutely awful in PVE until you have godly gear. The only time I remember hearing about ret paladin DPS in vanilla was in Nax there was some super godly geared ret paladins that did semi competitive damage in Nax due to the enemies being Undead.
---
Do not try to raid as ret in a serious raiding guild. You will never ever get invited. Hell they probably wouldn’t let you in the guild if you are a ret paladin. 
---
Paladins heal in classic, that’s how it goes. Period. 
---
Casual guilds? Sure, play ret.
---
The only really true hybrid on alliance side in raiding are warriors. They can tank and Dps. Everyone else has a defined pve role.
---
I am willing to do that! I am also willing to carry around nightfall to offtank!
---
&gt;  It's all the way back from 2016

In the Long Long Ago.
---
Layering will be gone by the time AQ opens.
---
Apparently int helps with weapon leveling, so it's at least slightly useful for every class. Buff dem smarts fellow mage!
---
&gt; Years of retail, a game I still love btw, has conditioned me to prioritise the numbers.
---
That would be the game that is so universally hated and despised, you are actively trying to get away from, by playing its own version from 14 years ago.
---
Not meaning to be condescending, but taking advice from any "conditioning" coming out pf that source, is not "using your head" ;-)
---
Chuck Norris doesn't break the law, he bends it to his will.

OP , i too once think mulgore is massive compared to other horde start zone  , but when i measure every start zone with walking time edge to edge (the quest zones and not the empty areas) they all somehow at the similar size
---
I won it once. Screenshot on my undead rogue during a massive horde raid on Ironforge. We were right outside the gates beginning to march inside. I believe it was shortly before TBC because I had my high warlord blades thanks to the honor change
---
Bloodfang on Troll specifially was always a bit odd. On retail I played Troll male for a bit, and Female. Female Orc is relatively acceptable. Its not as cool as Undead but its all in proportion I guess. The Male Trolls are just so gangly! Female troll isnt so bad, although animations are stiff.
---
So what are you doing this time around?
---
Should I just stick to PvPing and BGs if I wish to remain ret?
---
I kinda giggle at these posts or any time I hear "play what you want to play". Bottom line is decide what you want to do in the game. You want raid, then choose a class that you know will be needed for raids. Want to pvp then choose a class that does well in PvP. Want a mix then play something that lends to both.
---
Yeah mines gone now :(
---
How to pvp ret , go holy for ret gear then wait for bgs ,to come out , respect and go full time pvp
---
Being an engineer  is a must
---
Also getting a good 2h with blacksmiths help a lot
---
Blue pvp gear plus a good 2h boe weapon would set you up on the right way if guilds won’t let you get plate dps .
---
But pve yeah no forget about that
---
I wouldn’t mind reused content from expansions, but I’d really prefer to not have entire new continents that cut off max level players from the rest of the world. If they add Northrend there should be content for lower level players too and not add any major neutral cities that invalidate each race’s capital.
---
Considering gold means power in the late game, I disagree with you.

If anything, many gold making activities are done with at least one other person, and if you have gold then you can be a very strong presence in a raiding guild in a positive way.  
---
Either way... someone who is making gold will still be leveling up.. which means you still run into the same situations that everyone else does.
---
I specifically just meant the players fully 0/0 sitting at graveyard. I know damage and healing don't tell a whole story. But thank you, I should have stated.
---
This is the book that came with Warcraft 3! I remember staring at this waiting for this game!
---
We all need to make some kind of streamer server list to avoid certain folks.
---
Bgs won’t come until bwl patch or something 
---
So no bgs untill then
---
I remember climbing onto the roof of UC as a paladin and then falling through and getting killed by guards
---
I love carrying gear sets, I don’t like running random dungeons and hoping you randomly getting an azerite piece in a weekly chest, it randomly being the right slot and randomly the right traits.
---
Oh cool, I've seen few people as dedicated as him.
---
As an old runescape player I'm glad to see Warcraft go in the same direction. Releasing legacy servers basically brought that game back from the dead and 5+ years later it's still growing.
---
Can only mean good things for classic wow, so long as Blizzard don't start down old roads again...
---
But would a ret Paladin be more welcome in a PvP guild?
---
Nah
---
if you liken spell batching to simulated lag there is no hope for you in this discussion.  It's a batch.. of spells..  If you did something in that time frame it counts.. How is it that hard to understand?
---
This is a great idea. Add massive, sweeping changes to how the game is just so you're not too bored while watching streamers play it. I see absolutely nothing wrong with this suggestion and am 100% for it.
---
Yeah female trolls aren’t that bad to me either. I’m thinking orc hunter or orc rogue. Leaning more towards rogue as they are fun for pvp and not so gear dependent to do well with.
---
You can totally level as ret and maybe if you get a friendly enough guild you could do MC no issues , but after t1 unlikely
---
Cuz priest being nice
---
are there quest markers ?
---
I personally don't like any metric that isn't based off of objectives.
---
So in a game of CTF, it should something like caps and returns.
---
In TDM/DM, kills, obviously.
---
Base capture, time spent capping bases, defending, etc.
---
Anything with kill counts, damage counts, etc triggers folks into chasing people down for kills rather than fighting for the objective. It's poor game design, even in Vanilla.
---
It's all in the game.
---
If you make friends sure , if you expect to file an application , no
---
how much is the hunter being held back?
---
I hated when they did that... all it really did was have people start valuing damage over killing, and incentivize playing poorly.
---
Basically anything that requires a reasonable amount of automated decision making I.e old decursive would be botting today . They banned accounts in Legion who were using an add on calling itself a “rotation guide” which they deemed was actually botting.
---
there's no hope for these naysayers man.  Lets just move on and enjoy the game after they quit by level 30 and reduce the layers in the process.  The sad thing is that he's right he will never play on a non-layered server because people like him leaving is what will consolidate the layers.
---
There won't be any money in it and it'll be GW2 status in a year or two. Just calling it how I see it. Not my fault your a bunch of passive aggressive bitches who can't handle disagreement.
---
In that way no, you'd have to have engineering for such funsies. Warriors are the German class, no bullshit, just get the job done. If you want the more Swiss knife kinda class I'd suggest druid, shaman or paladin.
---
Starting zone northshire Abbey ones
---
they are the only ones playing the beta right now right? So where else are suppose to get any kind of content from? Your comment could be said about any vid or pic ever posted to any subreddit. This is just another advertisement for (x). Dont know why people get so salty about it.
---
I just spent a few hours pouring over old footage and yes...this issue needs to be looked at. Def not supposed to be in the game.
---

But then you miss out on the stealth mind control and stealth ganks.
---
It doesn't matter how old the servers get because with people making alts constantly there will be plenty of opportunities to make gold as time goes on.
---
Plus certain mats for consumables will always be sought after.
---
Loot quests, run speed
---
I cant decide whether im excited for classic or not. Im sure it will be great I just have my doubts it will be for me.
---
That being said recently Ive been playing on ascension and people do this, its small but you dont see it in retail and it brings a smile to my face that not only is there a community, but theres one thats kind enough to do stupid shit like this, not like LoL community atleast...
---
Fuck yeah.
---
In my experience wowpedia has been largely abandoned, gamepedia is up to date.
---
If you are asking how hard it will be to become a MT of a decent raiding guild, then the answer is "extremely difficult".  
---
I know a couple people who really want thunderfury, but the only way you could possibly obtain that thing as a warrior is by being one of the two prot tanks.  And if you aren't the MT, then the odds of you ever getting at are like hitting the lottery... even as a MT... you might never see the bindings drop in a year of raiding.
---
Spoiler alert you don't.
---
Could you send it to me as well please?
---
Every player has a list of improvements they think would help the game, the problem is those lists aren't the same.

I can’t wait to get those tier one warrior shoulders.
---
I remember this rare so well, he blocked a path i needed to take when i was a lower level gnome. His name is bjarn I think.
---
That just raises further questions!
---
I'm guessing GM trickery?
---
I read this thread for ideas on how I can help peeps as a warlock. I planned to give candies put already, but now ima keep the scrolls of x I don't use and pass them around like lsd. We're in this together boiz.

A G EE OO P = me love you

What do you mean by viable to contribute. What is your expectation of that statement?
---
I absolutely agree, I've never been known to be lucky, haha. It is what it is.
---
Fuck off
---
This guy doesn’t understand chuck norris science.
---
I plan on rolling a NE spriest ... And pvp with it... Fight me
---
It would require extra work, it's not natural at all.
---
There would be item changes, stat changes, talent changes, it's not just a copy and paste.  
---
Starting on a new server at not level one is easy and convenient, especially when someone else is doing the work to get you to the level you aren't at on that server.
---
You're asking for a bunch of new shit, and then don't even want to start over on a new server, you are being lazy.  Quit trying to delude yourself into believing otherwise.
---
probably not.
---
It sounds like you can't handle disagreement. Just calling it how I see it.
---
Never saw a T3 druid ingame
---
maybe its just me, but T3 started to look... lazy
---
That was weak as fuck
---
 Every player has a list of improvements they think would help the game, the problem is those lists aren't the same.

&gt; When the Ogrimmar runs red with blood

So never then, good one, Alliance scum.
---
Only one woman ever went down on Chuck Norris, she never came back up. 
---
It’s Fucking dumb I can’t help but laugh.
---
No way, tier 2 and 3 warrior master race.
---
With that same logic, sweeping strikes will wreck those same pulls, but at least you still get impale as early as possible.  
---
Fury is busted on private servers, but that is because we can take advantage of /sit.  Without it, it is better to be able to kite and hit extremely hard with MS, rather than the lower, more gear dependent bloodthirst.  
---
And there is the big difference.  Fury is way more gear dependent, where as arms deals heavy hits so long as you try and lean towards slow weapons.
---
I'm pretty sure it ended up as a 00.00%.
---
I'm planning on running a war and a second class. I'm leaning towards a resto shaman,so I can take advantage of windfury totem. However I really like the thought of running war and paladin for those awesome blessing of freedoms. I plan on doing both pve, and pvp. Do paladin buffs/freedom win out against shaman totems?
---
Scientists once insisted that diamond was the toughest material to exist on earth. That is, until they met Chuck Norris, who round-house kicked them with so much heat and pressure that they turned into artificial Chuck Norris.
---
Chuck Norris doesn't do push-ups, he pushes the world down.
---
It is mainly a better start as human, but if you plan on raiding at least through BWL, then it wont matter once you have t2 equiv dps gear.
---
I always used ctrl-w for mount.
---
Lol 43 is halfway to 60 isn't it
---
You want to change a game you're not even going to play because you have the attention span of a moth. Go find some other to watch on Twitch and leave us passive aggressive bitches in peace.
---
This is the dilemma of Dwarf vs Human Priest. Stoneform and Fear Ward are so much better than Perception and Feedback. But good god does cloth gear look terrible on dwarfs, especially priest robes.
---
Basically, enough to help the raid? I understand that as a ret Paladin I won’t have the best DPS, but I still provide utility and buffs as well as off-heals and the ability to use Nightfall as an offtank.
---
Your server wasn't crashing? all of Kalimdor was crashing every few minutes for most of the test.
---
Julian Edelman has a name boys
---
I don't know why I come to this sub.
---
The knowledge level is so low.
---
It isn’t only contained to spells with people reporting mailboxes and vendors having lag as a result, and even if two mages sheeting each other is funny, your tank dieing after you get your heal off isn’t. Spell batching is something I wish they hadn’t readded. It was a technical limitation not a feature.
---
Absolutely not, for one, you really can’t master Warrior or tanking without being proficient in the other trees. There is a lot of cross over using DPS abilities while tanking. Stance dance, Rage generating moves and other things.
---
Your job as a tank is to hold aggro, one of the best ways to do that is to do heavy DPS. There are warriors in end game who tank in DPS stance. Mind you they have maxed out healers. 
---
Leveling as DPS will teach you how to play your toon and you can tank a dungeon just by putting on a sword and board and getting into defensive stance. 
---
Also leveling as a Prot warrior is nearly impossible. You’ll die just because of how long it takes to kill something. It’s horrible!!!
---
Once you hit 60 you’re be in some form of prot the whole time anyways if you’re any decent kind of tank.
---
&gt;Horde night elf
---
I see your joke, but I must remind you of the  nightbourne
---
EU CM told Stress Test invite is per Stress Test not for all.
---
Messed around with duo leveling paladin and warrior, but not dual-boxing.
---
First 2 man leveling splits xp, and doesn't get group bonus xp so it can be hard to quest only, you will end up grinding some more.    
---
Early on paladins naturally outdamage warriors.  Paladins get judgment very early, and warriors don't get a real instant attack until whirlwind at 36.  This might kinda reverse the roles a bit as when the paladin is taking damage he cannot really heal himself unless you spec him holy for the knockback reduction.  Paladins have no instant cast heal at all so they are somewhat poor in combat healers.  It is better at healing up after a fight, but once again since it isn't instant cast it delays the next combat.  
---
The double buffing is huge, and both classes being slow 2h means you frontload on non-elites really hard killing them very quickly.  This means a lot of your time will be travel and not combat if you can manage to get them to both attack at the same time.  
---
They will physically get split up, as the warrior will be wanting to charge into combat for the rage, while the paladin has to slow walk into combat.  That might mess up your setup.  
---
Getting whoever is not tanking behind the mob is a big increase in damage by avoid blocks and parry.  
---
We never leveled this far, but theoretically by 36 with whirlwind, the warrior can start aoe pulling and using cleave whirlwind only.  Setting the paladin into more of a healer role, so maybe good to keep a set of int gear for the paladin while leveling.
---
As old as this code is it likely is less demanding than the modern stuff. Furthermore, WoW classic is from an era before pervasive virtualization was ascendant - this code will likely be cheaper to run now than it ever was when it was originally developed.
---
And sure, there’s the possibility that exploits will be found, but development for those is likely much simpler than on live since the devs don’t have to worry about hitting a moving target.
---
In other words, they likely have to dedicate very few resources specifically to classic, meaning their spend is negligible.
---
I'm saying it's premature to respect his integrity for not accepting handouts when he hasn't proven it, and will just lie about it and say he got the money off-stream if he did get a handout.
---
It is completely different.  
---
Warriors rely on rage management and decision making based on that aspect.  Rogues can (mostly) reliably count on their rotation being about the same every cycle.
---
&gt;your tank dieing after you get your heal off isn’t
---
that's the opposite of how spell batching works.
---
Mine is gone now too.
---
That&gt;
---
!RemindMe 78 Days
---
Yeah, come do Dynamis in FFXI homie. Shit was a fucking mess.
---
Why would you change the game just to make it more streamable? The travel is a necessary evil of *making the world feel large*. Let’s say they give you 2-3 hearthstones... all of a sudden, you can just ping pong around like it’s nothing, and the world feels smaller as a result, *because you don’t travel it as much*.  Also, it takes the allure and elitism away from being a mage or a warlock, with portals and Summons at the ready to help people out. 
---
Plus, as someone who’s watched plenty of streamers on beta, I think they make it work. They fill the quiet parts of the game with banter and small talk. The quiet parts are IMPORTANT to the flow of the game. The current game is all instantaneous. Instant travel, instant teleports to pretty much anywhere, instant raids. None of that is what Classic is about. 
---
It takes a lot of time to form your raid and organize, on raid night. Should they make that easier just so streamers can have an easier time on their job?
---
That's true
---
And Humans look absolute God tier for vanilla standards too. Proper hard decision if you're pvping. Think I'd go for human just for looks and spirit if pve only. That said I do have a soft spot for Male dwarves!
---
Slam spec died with TBC actually.  At least in the way that is being mentioned. 
---
The top 2h DPS in vanilla will be a fury warrior with 2-3 points into imp slam, weaving them in after an auto is about to land.  Someone else might need to chime in, but I am fairly certain this spec wasn't worth doing until rage was no longer a huge issue; so AQ40~ gear I imagine.
---
Yeah you can do that, but no hardcore guilds want that because they can just get a hpal to buff and have a real off-tank. 
---
Think about how ridiculously modern day guilds class stack , now sure the fights are tuned with that as a requirement and even though Classic guilds don’t need to be that strict they will be because that is the nature of being hardcore.
---
There just aren't enough axes to really take advantage of the spec.  Plus for tanks TF wins no matter what.
---
Mine is still there after client restart.
---
aoe loot isn't in the beta.
---
Like he said, if you play with non-elitist min/maxers you are fine.  If you were in a guild that had  everyone AQ40 guild you don't fit his description.
---
Really? Pserver messing with how i remember stuff then.
---
You can loot stuff for quests tho, right?
---
no, only 1 person
---
It’s an awful metric, and only encourages people like Asmongold to go as big dick as possible, even if just for shits n giggles, instead of playing with your brain and deciding what to do tactically.
---
Why would you ever think it's not returning? It was in Vanilla. Ergo, it's in Classic.
---
Tbh. if your friend, or you, want's to level something other than a hunter, go for that.
---
The truth is, a hunter would probably be held back by a priest more than he would benefit from it. Hunters move faste,r and can deal with everything the leveling process throws at them alone.
---
Alot of people on moongaurd have tamed druids, does this mean chick Norris plays on moongaurd?
---
If you're willing to grind out pots etc for every raid etc you'll be able to hang out in the middle of the pact. But sadly equally geared players and skills you'll tend to be on the lesser end of the dps poll. However. If a raid group brings you to raids and they claim they can't kill said raid boss because of you. There are bigger problems within the guild. One bad player or say a lesser dps player won't prevent a raid guild from clearing content. Just not true. My guilds that I raided in both cleared to 4 horseman during vanilla. Makaveli and sons of gabriel both had numerous ammonts of just shit players and we still got far. Top guilds on 2 separate servers. Don't let some bullshit deter you from playing what you want. But just be realistic at the same time.
---
I feel like that's not how it worked when I leveled in vanilla. Is this the intended mechanic or a bug
---
I am willing to do any amount of grinding
---
This amuses exactly no one.
---
It's just a reminder how utterly without standard Twitch has become.
---
Warriors are the most gear dependent class, which means they are one of the slower levelers. I personally enjoy the Fury DW playstyle, and it can push the DPS charts, but that's only if you get the right gear. On the plus side, this can lead to some really good feelings of progression even after hitting 60.
---
Another thing to consider, it's looking like Warrior is gonna be the most popular class choice. You may end up competing with a lot of people for gear.
---
UC is the USB of capital cities
---
No it’s not, it’s counting all that action at the same time, so if your heal and the death happen in the same 400 ms time frame, you can see your heal go off and have the person die anyway.
---
That is heavily dependent on weapons.  Fury should be beating it out no matter what, but a lot of high end warriors did run a PvE arms build back in the day in naxx40, pulling some insane DPS on many fights.  
---
Point being, the difference isn't vast in the grand scheme of things.  You, as a PvE arms warrior, can outdps most specs in the game; exception being combat rogues and fury warriors.
---
Seconding that. I never cared much for Warrior dps, but Vanilla and BC prot Wars are such a blast.
---
nope sure isn't
---
POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH
---
Hi, /u/KnightFiST2018
---
Undead Rogue Master Race
---
Revisiting this from what we know now, I don’t think it’s as terrible of a plan as the other comments suggest. Here’s why:
---
-There is group bonus exp on the beta for each member in a group up to 5. This is unlike the private servers most people have tried this on.
---
-Layering was announced, no dynamic spawns or sharding. This will undoubtedly make grinding and questing extremely hard at lower levels, grinding rfc is 0 competition as opposed to perhaps 1k people in each layer in the barrens. If you are stuck in the mass, grinding dungeons might not just be viable, but it would be preferred.
---
-With a warlock available to summon your wait to fill your group shouldn’t be hard at all, server sizes will be huge.
---
With all this said, you still will want to supplement purely doing dungeons with knocking out quests that are fast and nearby, especially if you’re ahead of the zerg, making sure you do the dungeons at the right level and as efficiently as possible.
---
Ignore the troll people. He is spamming this shit. Report and block him.
---
&gt; So where else are suppose to get any kind of content from? 
---
I am as hyped as the next guy about classic, still not watching any Streamers. We are not mindless drones required to "consume content".
---
Wasn’t a thing in TBC either (added in WotLK).
---
I've never understood people who make post like this. Is your goal collecting down votes, or you like getting banned threads with no discussion at all? It's not even a good or funny troll to make
---
Oh god can't wait to run down to southshore again...
---
On the minimap? Only a dot for completed quest turn ins. As it was in the days of yore
---
Pretty bold statement bud. You have no Idea what amuses every single person. 
---
Thats your opinion. You're entitled to that.
---
ST/late maraudon/BRD will gear you up to the point of being more than ready for 60 5 mans.  
---
With that said, if you are wearing 58+ greens and blues with reasonable tank stats, then you can do scholo/strat... it just wont be nearly as easy or quick.  People wont be very picky for a very long time I imagine.
---
I vividly remember the first run down through the tunnel.
---
I thought that was the coolest shit. Even though it was a long detour, I usually preferred it over the main entrance.
---
Fuck those elevators.
---
taurens with t1 helmet look sick because of the horns
---
I was at least expecting an entertaining troll post. I was disappointed :(
---
thats ironfoe and felstriker
---
You basically stated in your post below that everyone has to consume content. Don't try to be Mr. Rational now, that train has left the station.
---
I love hearing/reading stuff like this. I think this explains why WoW felt so familiar and easy to pick up. 
---
A lot of games try to be so different in order to stand out that it feels alien. WoW has enough differences to feel like a unique experience while having a firm basis in common fantasy lore to be approachable and appeal to a lot of people.
---
It'll make you a little bit moist
---
Well, most guilds aren't going to let a fury warrior take a rogue piece if the rogues still need it.  
---
MC+BWL covers most of the gear concerns.  Crafted pieces (depending on when certain ones get added) can fill the rest.   So for phase 1-2, you might be getting crafted leather blues to fill the pieces you can't get in MC.
---
No need to shame the stormpike cave defenders.
---
Bangy was vanilla and worse than other STV cats with 1.5 atk speed (the regular level 30 tigers were 1.2)
---
[That's true](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v9Y-4nbfaZU/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
There were a million warriors back in vanilla anyway.  Luckily wont be anything new to those who did play a warrior back then, but it was frickin hard to get into a guild that wasn't casual.
---
!RemindYou 77 days
---
No one:
---
Hunters:
---
&gt; It's scaled leveling was worse than WoW's since leveling up was actually a bad thing.
---
I thought it was genius, in a demented way. It meant the game was always about the right challenge level for casuals who don't pay attention to the mechanical stuff, and for the hardcore it was a whole new kind of rpg where you tried to squeeze through getting as little xp as humanly possible.
---
&gt;How are you supposed to know when to interrupt?
---
By looking at the mob instead of the interface.
---
Are it's hands/face/tentacles glowing? It's casting. Is the glow green or golden? It's likely casting a heal.
---
&gt;This was added in TBC
---
Is TBC Classic? No. Qestion answered.
---
Except Warrior.
---
So just to clarify the other guys posts. Most raid locks will be using demonic sacrifice, to gain buffs on themselves which is an increase to shadow damage (and then spamming shadow bolt), which conveniently also helps our life tap for mana gain. Now obviously the demon can't do anything if it's dead. Then there might be a single lock that is shadow mastery spec instead, which will get to keep their imp out (phased out) to use blood pack (+stamina) on the tanks. This SM lock will be the one keeping up corruption and whatever curse your raid deems best (and multi dotting trash is where they really excel), and being more of a general utility roll to the raid, rather than a top dps.
---
warlocks and rogues and their smelly bullshit stink lines.
---
I'll never understand people who take even one second of their lives to.write something like this. You already lost
---
Why is the Druid one getting worse?
---
If you put in 110% farm every potion, food buff, world buff, DMN tribute buffs as a AQ40 geared ret pally you will still do less dps than a PRE raid Bis fury warrior that’s 1/2 afk through the fight.
---
Wow, that's amazing! Any other tips? What are some of those items that will increase in value?
---
You aren't completely wrong.. but even with people burning out, most casual, semi casual and semi serious raiding guilds had around 12~ warriors per raid.  
---
It was insanely hard to get into raiding guilds if you were even a tiny bit late to 60.  I suspect it will be worse this time around.
---
One of my accounts had it disappear other still has it there.
---
There's another bug on the beta where you can sit up real quick and proc enrage 90% of the time. Should be fixed tho
---
No lol
---
🤠🤘
---
You ever play on a pserver that has lupos doing shadow damage? Literally every hunter has the fucking thing.
---
And I need an addon to type in some simple console commands, which I only have to type ONCE, because...?
---
Death isn't some action to be batched.  Your health goes to zero so you die.  That can only happen as the result of an action being directed at you.  If you have 300 hp and on the same batch you take 400 damage and get healed for 500 damage you are at 400 hp after the batch.
---
I remember this one explicitly. My God the nostalgia.
---
Trolls can be considered better tanks because Berzerking doesn't lower their healing recieved and helps generate more threat.
---
not pictured: max level horde mage sitting on top of the inn pinging lowbies with frostbolts
---
You are right that showing up is the most important part.
---
Getting into a raiding guild as a warrior though... that is going to be extremely difficult.
---
Auto loot was in vanilla and nothing AoE looting related is in the beta...
---
For us it was are you hit capped for dps, total defense for tanks and if they healed they were usually in, we didn't ask them too many questions.
---
&gt; I want to know how Vent isn't still a thing 
---
Vent/mumble/TS are the superior choices, but aren't free servers like Discord
---
Downvoted as yet another low effort, streamer promoting s\*post.
---
I asked my girlfriend to pick one from every tier. She doesn't play WoW and she picked tier 1 paladin, tier 2 hunter, tier 3 druid. As a warrior, I'm saddened
---
For PvP, what is your BIS list pre-MC and pre-PvP gear? I plan to get an Arcanite Reaper, but what about other slots?
---
&gt;if too many people go Horde
---
It's the opposite in Vanilla. Alliance racials and access to Paladins are head and shoulders above Horde. Horde become crazy amazing in BC, but Vanilla is the Alliance's time to shine.
---
Priest/Feral tank is a lot better duo.
---
The objectively correct choice is warrior, as they are the only class which set doesn’t run straight off a cliff at T3 /s
---
Lol ok
---
We could. But your women crave filthy savagery at night. Like sweat dripping window steaming filthy savagery. What's the point in reading books if it'd turn us into their men. Besides, this is basically harmony. You read books so you can be financial support, and we're here so they can get... exercise.
---
99% is a lofty assumption. MC is pretty easy bro.
---
Plenty of people will still actively go for their sets, because those 'off pieces' aren't going to drop all of the time, where as set pieces kind of do.
---
At least night elves and Tauren make the best druids.
---
So basically, play warrior.
---
One of the reasons I'm considering priest so hard. Almost all tier set as BiS, excluding the AQ40 phase, plus the free-ish Benediction/Anathema so you're not competing with Druids/Paladins.

5 seconds later, that poor cat was brutally murdered by a bunch of carnivorous Fel-Gazelles skewering it with their horns. When it tried to get away, it stumbled over the cunningly placed baby, which smiled down on it evily while watching it die.

I play WoW, I don't fuck anything
---
To sum up this thread:
---
OP: "Can I raid as Ret and be conpetitive?"
---
Everyone: "No."
---
OP: "But what if?"
---
Because none of you ever watch porn or exaggerate your own achievements? I think everyone is there own greatest critic - what we say in public may indeed come across confident to put on a brave front.
---
This is a major reason why Im waiting a few weeks after launch to join in. Let the dust settle and then pick.
---
I just can’t believe how rigid class roles are in classic...
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you.
---
No one can even begin to suggest vanilla raid mechanics are anywhere in the same universe of difficulty as current raid mechanics.
---
Current high level content demands so much of players, and after 15 years, everyone has a basic understanding of the usual "trope mechanics" that comparatively Vanilla raids will be facerolls.
---
The entire challenge will be getting 40 people properly attuned and geared just to walk in.
---
I'm looking forward to leveling and PVP, but I have little interest in end game vanilla raids. I'll do them for the experience, but that's probably it. I'm not concerned with having BiS gear and the grind it would take just hoping for a drop and then winning a roll in a 40 man raid.
---
I'll play both retail and classic for different purposes.
---
I remember taking that same journey in reverse as a Dwarf to tame the rare spawn cat The Rake. Good times. I can't wait for Classic!
---
Nothing that I stated in my comment was about having to consume the content. I was just replying to the guy saying I was advertising for a streamer. We literally have no other way of getting current classic gameplay but streamers. Sure this clip isnt exactly crazy content. But the point still stands. That person would have said that same comment no matter the content in the clip.  
---
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. I get it. You don't like the streamers playing it. You are allowed that right to not like it. Mr. Rational out....
---
That sounds like it will make the Onyxia event in Stormwind much harder.
---
Staying true to classic is leaving it as classic. Anything further is not classic.
---
Ah the corpse drag, I'm guessing you played Everquest at one point lol
---
I actually expect most people to quit in STV after being ganked 3 nights in a row.
---
I won’t act like I have irrefutable proof of every bad possible outcome so maybe you’re right, but I just don’t see how checking less when we know they can check more is a good thing. It makes things feel like lag and the only argument I’ve seen for it is niche polymorph/stun mechanics that aren’t worth how it feels when playing to me.
---
Take a look at this with a grain of salt it’s private server data so values will be different on live.
---
Top ret dps of all time
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
The top paladin dps is Emeldira of Kronos 3 (she’s useing a Hand of Rag AND NAXX40 gear)  at 609dps
---
The average fury warrior in bwl/aq40 gear does 1300-1600 dps.
---
The average rogue does 1100-1400 dps.
---
RET IS NEVER VIABLE
---
&gt;I think it’s fine to add raid tiers indefinitely, as well as add new raids at lower tiers.
---
The former introduces power creep by inflated item level.
---
The latter introduces power creep by inflated item drops.
---
I still to this day always wanted to fulfill my fantasy of a Tauren Rogue..maybe one day.
---
That'd be really weird. It definitely stayed there after the first test. But now after it's gone.
---
I guess if you like it for that, cool. But I just didn't care for it. I like to explore and find hidden things in final fantasy games and 8 made that experience not so great.
---
This kinda looks like she was taken by some dudes against her will when taking trip to France with a friend.
---
Can one still get on top of the goldshire inn?
---
Yeah, I'll admit, it kinda sucks... but that's just what Vanilla is my man. 
---
People, especially in this sub, tend to fawn over Vanilla like it doesn't have imperfections, but it does. Gotta take the good with the bad though. It's a damn good game overall.
---
You kinda ruined my shit joke, man.
---
Lol. There is one sword worth using over an axe with the skill and you aren't getting more than one of those unless you want to really rely on luck.
---
So I can raid as holy but still play ret on my off-time?
---
Stop. Please. I can Only upvote so much.
---
Lol that is oddly specific. It's from a 90s Nintendo ad.
---
But don't you know, *to properly enjoy the game I need to be the best*
---
As a naxx/aq40 OT I would say warr tanking is fucking awful compared to retail tanking in 5 mans.  5 mans dosent get easy till you get a thunderfury then it’s a cake walk lmao.
---
I agree with everything you said except that the value of impale is greatly reduced while leveling due to having minimal crit and impale vrs flurry is roughly equal.  
---
I'm only suggesting fury when you can play with a healer.  
---
Even without sit macro fury outperforms arms on private assuming that you have a healer and can aoe pull.  With 4 things hitting you, you have a really high enrage uptime.  Also with a healer your between pull downtime is often less then the 30sec required by sweeping strikes.  
---
It is true ms hits harder then bloodthirst,  but the goal would be to be maximizing your healer and cleaving over single target damage whenever possible.  
---
Also hamstring kiting only works when you can single pull.  Fury has the utility of piercing which can save you on a lot of bad pulls.
---
Well I'm happy to have that discussion.   This is why I like spell batching:  It makes the game more turn based than just spamming abilities.  Personally I prefer the more tactical gameplay.  With spell batching you can dominate your opponents with your mind instead of your mechanical ability to spam buttons.
---
Aetish looks great on a dwarf bro
---
Check out the instan60 private servers and you can play a pre raid Bis fury warrior in less than 10 min of creating the character.
---
I remember big enough raids on Capitol cities would crash entire servers during launch. Tech has come a long way in 15 years :)
---
First thing that came to my head haha
---
Sorry, man
---
People will always feel entitled.
---
It is a matter of preference. In PVE, blessings are insane and many of the weapons in game are mace/sword. With alliance you might not have to watch threat if your tank is any good.
---
In PvP, you get a more defensive playstyle with pally stun, magic dispel, etc. Shamans instead can purge and cast offensive spells. If you put a really good shaman/warrior duo against a really good pally/warrior duo, I will take the shaman/warrior duo. The shaman can purge all blessings while throwing offensive spells and using grounding against pally stun. Just one well-timed earth shock interrupt and they are dead. However, if freedom, sacrifice, etc. never gets dispelled, the alliance warrior can go to town.
---
Overall: Shaman = more offensive and proactive. Pally = more defensive and reactive.
---
T2 is bwl right? So we wont land my favorite set till phase 3 which could be a year after release?
---
Yeah you can. Eventually it will cost you 50 gold to respec if I remember correctly but I found it worth the cost for my pvp fun
---
Don’t forget rogues and hunters for your pre raid Bis dal tends, unless your an orc.
---
Stonetalon Mountaons
---
"Literally" everyone got it, except for the two people I responded to.
---
Hi, /u/Nalidox
---
&gt; I explicitly remember not being able to tame lvl 11 beasts at 10. 
---
You are correct. In vanilla, you can only tame beasts at your level or lower.
---
I plan on doing my prebis farm as prot for my fury main spec. Do you think people will have an issue with me rolling on prebis dps gear just because I'm prot? The ratio is always off with too much dps and not enough tanks and healers. 
---
I figure tanking is the best option also because warriors tend to overlook inviting other warriors. What do you guys think?
---
I swear, some \~30 year old about-to-be-parent in the Classic community will end up calling his kid Thunderfury.
---
\#metoo
---
Threads like this pop up every 30 minutes and I swear they are absolutely pointless.
---
It's clear the people starting these have never played vanilla, which is *completely* fine, but I see absolutely no point in talking about end game mechanics if you have never even played the game. 
---
Start a character and get to level 10 before you even start to ask about specs, chances are about 70% of the people starting these threads will never get to 60 in classic.
---
yeah its almost like an entire new language, its retarded as shit. but also in saying that i have disdain towards almost everything in internet culture that kids are doing these days. im not even 30 yet but i feel like a bitter old shit
---
I wish I could give you more than one upvote, my dude. You are 100% spot on and clearly not an idiot child. One day these kids will understand that no one will give you the time of day simply because you're, like, such a good person inside and clearly deserve attention.   
---
You are what you can contribute. Nobody outside your family cares about all your little hopes and dreams and happiness. We want what you can provide and if you can't provide anything (numbers or novelty) then you can fuck right off because there's an uncountable multitude standing literally right behind you that can.
---
Many a mana user were power chugging for the next wave. CC needed.
---
there are so many calculations happening in BFA. too much. more story less button mashing whack-a-mole please
---
Isn't selling the grenades or whatever they're called pretty good money early levels also?
---
Farming DM North runs on my hunter if they don't nerf it.
---
Ohh, so there’s actually a way?
---
Oh ok I got you. I guess I was talking more long term. 3 years or whatever, it would be cool to see new content that is true to the design of classic wow. In my opinion people who want classic and to always have exactly only that.. then you’re not fighting for the right thing.
---
Again, in my opinion, this is more about the style of the game rather than just classic. Don’t get me wrong, I am gonna play as much as I can and as long as I can, but if blizzard can bring class balances, updates graphics and new 1-60 content.. wouldn’t that be a good thing?
---
Spot on. I’m my guilds OT and a Raid leader (when I play mage). I expect ~75% attendance of our dps and Healers and 95% of our tanks.
---
From what I heard Joana say. Quest. If you cant quest. Grind. If you cant grind. Discover. But always try to quest.
---
Find a less populated area and grind the equivalent experience.
---
The only thing retail did right: making it possible to always be a dwarf
---
Yea, they spawned Hoggers in most starting zones, and replaced the faction leaders with hogger versions from the opposing side.
---
Just pay the cloth. You don’t get exalted doing those quests anyhow.
---
Starshards chad vs fear ward virgin
---
Ps I have nothing against dwarf priests, I'm just not looking forward to people questioning my night elf
---
F
---
Sadistic? More like suck this dick. - Some guy you ganked.
---
You could make an argument that you'd make more gold at max level than you would in your 20s though, so there's merit to leveling faster vs. selling it even just in regards to gold-making.
---
That's seemingly the route I went too, but some people said the quests I skipped were costly (The opening Defias one, Gold Rush and Kobold Candles)
---
Those three quests in particular were so fucking camped it was ridiculous, and would have taken forever to get the drops let alone the tags
---
Tanaris
---
&gt;  lot of the guides seem to be under the idea that you don't have competition.
---
Because after the initial rush at launch you don’t really have that much. You are under the false impression you are always going to be surrounded by that amount of people.
---
Oh no, it's retarded
---
I’m actually polar opposite here.  I love the look of dwarf priest.
---
Mine is still there, but when I open it I still see the Stress Test server and it's offline.
---
I'm NA, if that matters
---
&gt;Maybe I just suck, but doing the stress test as a Human Mage was HARD, especially pre-instant cast. Hard as in, trying to get ahead of the pack and get quests done.
---
Yeah it's something we all have to endure, if you are solo it will be very difficult day 1.
---
Only way around it is waiting for the initial packs to get through.
---
No, dwarves can’t be orc warriors.
---
Sure, but I feel like a leveling guide, atleast for launch, should have adjustments.
---
It should be like "If you can't do X, do this instead"
---
Do you have beta?
---
!remindme 79 days
---
I appreciate it, but then again, it would be an incredibly sad state of affairs, if they stil hadn't sorted that out after 14 years.
---
They were absolutely mindlessly OP compared to Vanilla. But all healers started to become like that. Circle of Healing for priests was such a garbage heal, so mindless and spammy... just keeping your prayer of mending up... Ugh. Such a boring play style.
---
I really dislike TBC because it was the beginning of the end of a healing style that I vastly preferred... I loved picking the right rank heal and timing things well, getting out of the 5 sec rule, etc..., rather than managing cooldowns and AOE spamming... in Vanilla I would enter a flow and get into the zone, throwing heals across multiple people and having a blast juggling it all, while keeping overhead to a minimum. I miss those days.
---
If they launch TBC servers, I’m definitely not playing on them.
---
Why cant you believe this? Its still like that now. If you play a class thats underperforming, its a problem. Vanilla wow has classes that can underperform by half, or more.
---
Top tier guilds roll Deathbringer / Crul dual wield tanks.
---
Shields are used very rarely.
---
Thunderfury is only useful in certain situations.
---
What?!
---
RIP here too, glad they did it. Now I only wait for 8/26
---
Groups don't help for collect 10+ of certain item though. That helps you get tags, but then you essentially need 50 instead of just 10, so it evens out to being just as inconvenient/time ineffcient
---
Groups help for Kill X quests though.
---
I'd pug with them
---
? You do know that most of us don’t watch streams or care about them...
---
So what their streams arnt live, I don’t understand why this is a rant
---
&gt; Sure this clip isnt exactly crazy content
---
It's not any content. It's a low effort promotion of a streamer, something this community despises. And the fact that you get so riled up about people rightfully downvoting and negatively commenting it, only shows why.
---
Well I suppose it would be. It would be great. But the issue lies with the fact that we would be entrusting Activision (Blizzard) to make these updates/changes and I’m sure we all know how that would go..
---
I'm from NA.
---
&gt; He goes, "What! You don't buff ME! I buff YOU!!!" and forces 20 food &amp; water onto said priest after buffing him with int.
---
I approve
---
Bless thee who randomly buff you as you run past them!
---
mines gone, only had stress
---
&gt; No reason to fix it? A CC-immune pet is extremely op. Probably not what the devs intended
---
So we're changing classic now, when it doesn't suit you? Devs intended a lot that didn't work out. They wanted Paladins to be tanks. Didn't work out for them did it.
---
If you form the group, you control who's in and out. Just invite 2 cloth dps and a hunter, ignoring rogues and other warriors. Shouldn't be an issue for you get all of the melee dps gear.
---
90%? Good stat

What time zone are you?
---
n  i  g  g  a
---
It is costly to skip quests but if you can't feasibly complete them then you're better off skipping them because some exp is better than zero.
---
It will be interesting to see ret dps on live servers compared to private servers.  Bosses having more parry chance lowers the threat cap, nerfing warriors and warlocks a bit.  Proc rates are still not clearly known yet.  Less opportunity to get world buffs also hurt rets.  Songflower buff becomes much more important.  At the end of the day, youre going to join a shitty casual guild, a semihardcore guild or a hardcore guild.  And of those 3, there are guilds that play for the game, and guilds where you play for eachother.  If you find a group of players that you click with, any spec works.  All i can say is that playing ret is 70% farming, 20% fighting off community stigma, and 10% autoattacking.  You need stamina, confidence, and a hardcore farming mentality to really shine
---
What? Every streamer I watch plays live...
---
Careful, your tinfoil hat fell off. They're gonna get ya with them alien waves!
---
That publix bag ready to keep 1 grape safe lmfao
---
&gt;Sure you might get 5% more Dps as human rogue with sword spec compared to NE. So what?
---
I want to be the best.
---
ATVI FDs you say?
---
I already have the farming mentality and stamina.... hell, right now I’m building a gaming PC for classic...
---
Aiming high get used to dungeon set
---
The stress test is not a good gauge of how the zones will be on launch. Blizzard is purposefully overpopulating them.
---
Never knew this.
---
Soda is a druid who has anger issues.
---
3 people from my guild got a temporary ban ban in the day by doing exactly that in front of Ironforge =)
---
I've never considered selling one when I could just throw it at someone.
---
PLEASE TAKE EXAMPLES from OSRS that community is huge and they vote on things that get to enter the game
---
The mid 40s are the worst for Alliance. Not quite high enough to start doing endgame dungeons and the quests get really spread out. Then you hit 50 and suddenly there's everywhere to level again.
---
Why, let them do it. The more people who think that's funny get permabanned, the better the overall community.
---
Learn cooking and grab the dragon breath chili recipe for AOE farming as well.
---
Hahaha! Sounds like you're making some grubs very happy, indeed!
---
It's just as well, though. Alliance women - being partial to respectable hygene - can't stand the rotten, fecal stench which seems to perpetually emanate from your kind. That's why the Dwarves selflessly give those poor, repulsive horde 'females' plenty of gag practice - for only a nominal fee, of course! The truly sad thing is the joyous tears that those twisted beasts cry between greedy slurps, just for the few minutes' refuge from their tortured existence shackled to the likes of you.
---
Dude, don´t want to be a dick, but here is a quick headsup:
---
"Competetive raiding guild" means they are going hardcore. The questions you are asking in this thread make me think you probably won´t end up in a hardcore progression guild anyways, so don´t take the top of the top as reference. 
---
Most casual guilds won´t mind that much bringing one Paladin as DPS and if you put in all the efford you won´t end up on the last recount spot. You´ll never be first eitheir tho. 
---
There is some theorycrafting going around about "Spelladin" that´s basically a ret build with spelldamage gear and specific consumables that procc on hit and scale with spelldamage. Depending on how those things are coded on classic, it could be realy good DPS. Nobody knows how viable it will be yet.
---
Autoattack through walls has always been a thing. Even in retail in the arena you can hit people through pillars.
---
You can use all the consumables for both melee and spell damage, have better gear, put in twice as much prep hours, perfect your rotation, use engineering bombs on CD, and still do half the damage of a rogue or warrior.
---
Pretty sure swords are always competitive with daggers.  I've seen a lot of people argue that daggers never overtake swords.
---
Hhahahhaa
---
*GIANT LOG TO THE FACE*
---
But I really do need help deciding what to play. I've got it narrowed down to these 7 classes: Warlock, priest, rogue, hunter, warrior, shaman, or druid.
---
If aiming to beat naxx then it's going to be like a year and a half at the very very least tbqh.
---
You don’t seem to realize the obvious truth that retail needs to change in order to be successful or to maintain relevance.
---
Try reading rather spewing the same zealous phrase in anything that indicates change
---
An hour after launch is still, what, 2 weeks after character name reservations? I'll just have to choose 2 realms and pray I get my list of names on both of them
---
Looking forward to your wide eyed shock and surprise, when you realize that Locks don't have "Summoning Stones" in Vanilla.
---
Wait, does that mean half the damage of **any** rogue or warrior? Or a rogue or warrior that does all of that too?
---
Hey OP, I'll toss this out there. If you want competitive, you won't find a slot. But if you want to find a more casual team, you very well have a shot.
---
Vanilla wasn't kind to hybrids and you'll be a liability. If you want to be the best Ret you can be, check out Esfands guides, but understand that you won't be in demand and you'll need to prove yourself every step of the way. A factor that will likely contribute to your ability to find a team is that early raiding in Vanilla was pretty forgiving. If your team has a core of 20 really solid players, can can more or less fill the raid with the other 20 and they can be fairly dead behind the eyes and you'll still clear.  
---
So in summary, don't expect a team pushing for server first to give you a second thought, let alone a first. But if you find a team that's relaxed, you could find some folks willing to let you give it a try.
---
Fuck I hope so
---
Hell yes. Absolutely.
---
Oh noes, I have to invest effort in the game I am playing. What a nightmare!
---
If they ever do Classic+ adding content to Classic Hyjal is something they could do.
---
&gt;  I have no idea what advice to give you if you're a visual or kinetic learner because **my process of learning stuff is akin to bashing my head against the wall sometimes** lol.
---
You, sir, have what it takes to become a real programmer.
---
Groups will help you tag mobs for grinding though.
---
But you already have access to all the quests in that area so you can see what quests have collect x of y and which ones don’t. The only other quests you will be able to handle is in another starter zone just as crowded. It doesn’t take that long for things to spread out, so it isn’t really the concern you think it is. You are also not accounting the fact that not everyone is going to cramming in to 1 server creating characters of the same race as a couple big time streamers so they can hang around them which is what was happening during the stress test.
---
Bjarn is the rare, yes. Mangeclaw is a quest mob in the same zone.
---
Are there any updated BiS gear lists out there in general? Seems like a lot of the resources around are based off the private server meta that seems to be shifting slightly as more data pours in from the Beta (e.g parry data from bosses, etc).
---
The amount necessary is all the grinding for melee and spellcaster pots, as well as engineering bombs and whatnot. 
---
Even then, you'll be behind the pack. 
---
Your best bet is to get a Nightfall and be taken as the guild's Nightfall guy (usually goes to a hunter). No mater what you'll be fighting a stigma.
---
Red isn't a competitive spec no matter how much work you put in in terms of raiding, so no competitive guild will bring one to a raid unless it's specifically to carry them.
---
Only if you’re Horde.
---
Yeah, what time zone, class, race? 
---
I'm planning on playing a holy/prot pally if i can find an alliance warlock to level with. Preferably a gnome friend so we both start in Dun Morogh.
---
That duo combo is suppose to be the best.
---
*massively*
---
Wait...Dwarves CAN be Warlocks though.
---
It isn't optimal to go for it right away on server launch, but it is possible. Although it is maybe the most famous weapon, it isn't necessarily the biggest game changer.
---
Consider going for the ravager in armory @37 if you have the people for it. The proc is stupid powerful.
---
Hate streamers so much you guys just make stuff up?
---
#no changes
---
It's bop, class specific, can drop tailoring and still use it! :)
---
What did he do?
---
Is that a real event or a beta thing?
---
Can't wait to see all these casual guilds bringing ret paladins and enhancement shamans and boomkins to their KT kills.
---
Thanks for doing your own real research and putting in the time to confirm and comment as a member of the classic community! We will get this issue to Blizzard!!
---
they do again!
---
they made buffs great again!
---
T3 druid is my all time favorite set. Although I agree it isn't very druid like,
---
If classic is already launching with no changes, what makes you think they’ll change anything in future expansions???
---
they made wow great again!
---
 #nochanges
---
I love how there's a large number of people like you arguing that you prefer a specific way in a post where the OP point is to play however you want.
---
I don't get it. People spent over a decade begging for classic wow, then immediately start complaining that it doesn't have enough content...
---
Let's give it 2-3 years before we worry about the game growing too stale.
---
That isn't the main reason why sword spec is better. Sword spec is better because your extra attacks can also crit. This is why HOJ is so difficult to replace with just stats. Extra swings OP.
---
Look at his user name....
---
&gt; I want to see the rebirth of my favorite game ever and a narrow minded subset of the population is actively trying to fuck that up. 
---
You realize the hypocrisy in this statement, yes?
---
Lol didn't notice.
---
We were semi-casual (i.e. basic min/max like no boomkins, but we didn't require food buffs, flasks, or other things), and we definitely didn't start out AQ40 geared. But even the 5-man PUGs on my server never invited a druid or paladin tank.
---
is this asmongold's alt?
---
Rogue and warlock sets make me want to roll one. Soooo nice.
---
Competitive raiding and ret are mutually exclusive.
---
Exactly.  We all understand that some specs do less DPS, especially in Classic, and not all of them bring enough utility to justify a raid spot in a hardcore guild.  That's nothing new.
---
However, some people are trying to justify min-maxing to such an extreme that's it's simply asinine.  Even on the bleeding edge, if a guild leader thinks having a human mage instead of a gnome mage is what's holding back their progression, they're just looking for excuses or a scapegoat.  40 people playing perfectly to the point where that difference is literally the most fixable reason why they failed is just not realistic.
---
Even after launch, big enough raids in one zone would crash servers. In 2005, I was part of a 4 full-raid attack on XR, back when I played Alliance.
---
150+ Alliance vs. however the hell many Hordies showed up to defend.....we crashed Kalimdor on the Malfurion server for two hours. People on boats were getting dropped in fatigue water; griffons randomly despawned; zeppelins just disappeared and logged off their passengers.....................it was EPIC.
---
fuck yeaahh
---
&gt;and a hunter
---
In classic, *everything* is hunter gear.
---
Intellect increases the rate you gain weapon skill.
---
It was actually that way for a while, if not for the entire time weapon skill existed. It used to say so on the Intellect tooltip on the character stat pane, and it was removed from the tooltip at some point in WotLK, though testing showed Int continued to increase weapon skill-up rate.
---
Fuck the "I want MY Game, and everyone else doesn't matter" - crowd.
---
WoW Classic only came to be because people like the "nochanges" crowd exist. Without them, you would still be complaining how shitty retail is, while being busy getting bored by todays world quests.
---
That wouldn‘t be possible, as certain classes have certain jobs. The cap would go to a druid and optionally paly, it‘s not a warlock‘s job to cap the flag. So it‘s not possible to measure anything from that.
---
By adding damage though you can see who‘s gimping in their job to do damage. You wouldn‘t use the damage statistic to measure druids of course, but most of the classes.
---
What's with all that crap on your minimap?
---
Or... Or... Stay with me...
---
They learn that an MMO needs to be an MMO if it wants to be an MMO and put these tenets into NEW games like D4.
---
And other devs pay attention and follow suit making sure that sometimes, it's best not to mess with a formula even if the formula is old.
---
You want wow2. I want Classic and possibly tbc in the future. 
---
It's not my problem you don't understand people want to play the old games as they were. Also, I don't understand the faith in Blizzard making good wow content.
---
They did this for BFA.
---
No one uses it
---
25% Chance to Stun
---
I had the black war wolf on my Tauren warrior 14\~years ago, must have took 1-2 weeks of farming runecloth regularly
---
" I want to see the rebirth of my favorite game ever and a narrow minded  subset of the population is actively trying to fuck that up. "
---
So classic should be made just for you, and your wants.
---
But shields don't increase my dps and I don't have defensive stance on my bar.
---
Wow 2 or anyother mmo and tbc would be a change to classic wow. We want no changes here period
---
sounds like you were ignored by streamers for asking stupid questions or being a typical toxic twitch viewer, so you come here and fabricate this bullshit only further proving how disconnected from reality you are
---
Just to give you an opportunity for reflection on how you look: 
---
You're fussed that people have stoic insistence that a Classic remake of a game is released as close to its original form as possible.
---
Momma said lvl 10 boars are so mad cause they got all them teeth, but no toothbrush
---
&gt; ... you want, but do not need addons. They are not necessities to enjoying the game.
---
I like how you go from trying to criticize me by essentially claiming that I was speaking for everyone, then in the next sentence try to speak for me. I only said hundreds of thousands. That's because there's verifiable data to show that hundreds of thousands of people use Addons in some capacity or another. So for those of us that use addons, clearly there was a deficiency in the UI that predicated the use of them.
---
As for you trying to tell me how I derive my enjoyment, I wouldn't play this game if I didn't have the ability to use addons. Addons make the game playable for me, 100%. Could I play the game, technically, without them? Yes. Would I be having fun dealing with the cludgey, subjectively ugly, information-lacking default UI? No. Not one bit. Could I play as effectively without addons and the information they provide in high-key Mythic+ and Mythic raiding? Fuck no. Not whatsoever.
---
I'm just too used to using them, and I love the experience the add to the game of being able to customize that stuff, and have information presented to me clearly so I can play as best as I can. After almost 15 years, I'd be lost without my semi-truck full of addons, and I fully admit that.
---
The only point I was trying to make in my argument is that the default UI has sucked forever, so to try and claim that I can't criticize it because it's "supposed to suck, it's intentionally retro" is invalid. My opinion of the UI hasn't changed since the game launched. It's always been bad. Then some random trying to gatekeep me that "you're not the intended audience for Classic", like... shit I played Vanilla, I had 2 60s, I raided up to AQ40. I played private servers on and off for years. I signed the nostalrius petition. I talked shit to "wall of no" people, and was equally offended with Jay Allen "you think you do, but you don't" Brack. Who the fuck is this guy telling me I'm not the intended audience for Classic? 
---
They added open all mail. They added one-click auto loot instead of having to hold shift. They added a button to leave the flight path. What's so bad about letting the quests in the quest tracker open the quest in the quest log? Like holy shit. I'm argued against as if I'm advocating for LFR or Mount Shop for Classic. Some people with their no changes shit are just a bit much.
---
Funny thing is that I've literally watched 10+ streamers and they all respond to their chats within 15-30 second window the vast majority of the time...….OP is just talking nonsense.
---
Don't do risky pulls at half hp. Try to pull fewer mobs. Hamstring run away. If you don't want to be careful, just take piercing howl if you want easy mode.
---
Planning on being a DPS warrior that can tank whenever needed. Tanking I feel fine with but not sure what build to go for for DPS. As horde with windfury I read that 2H fury is viable.
---
Now is that "viable" as in you can do it and not be the bottom of the meters, or is that viable in that it is within a few percent of dual wield Fury?
---
Also of it is viable, I was reading about a slam oriented spec weaving it in between autos when WW and BT are on CD. Is that the only 2H fury build worth a damn, or is a non-slam version competitive?
---
Thanks in advance, really looking forward to Classic! I played a bit when it first released but the highest I got was around level 40. TBC is when I really got into WoW. Can't wait to fully experience Classic and discover what I missed out on.
---
How is tbc a change? It's a different game version and devs are likely smart enough to have separate servers to have both classic and tbc
---
Obviously.
---
I expect that they will rerelease BC eventually. I’m betting 2 years after launch.
---
The only thing I can understand about hating streamers is people will ruin the economy by buying them consumables and what not
---
The only difference is that it keeps everything relevant. No more 60-70 content being the only content.
---
Then use another tank. Supply and demand biatch
---
I've really been wanting to try this but no one I'll be playing with classic with is going pally.
---
Classic warlock summoning happens in front of the caster, rather than directly on top.
---
So you could find the fatigue border, either summon them past it or swim out a chunk into the fatigue water, summon them and turn around. - the fatigue bar used to tick down while loading if done in this manner.
---
It may have been fixed, but I doubt it since it looks like summoning still happens in front of the warlock.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
At the same time it shows off who kill snipes. I remember one by the rogue that had the highest kills also had the worst damage. Any standard can create weasel behavior.
---
YYYYEEESSS...aslo do Kara Crypts.
---
You just need to unlearn retail wow where every spec can do basically whatever it wants.  
---
It's not like there are any dead classes or specs in classic, but they all have their niche and strengths/weaknesses.  
---
Ret is a good way to level as a paladin (which is a huge aspect of the game) and can do well in pvp too, but raiding is where the spec drops off.
---
I'm in the same boat. I only went for the first week though, felt like after 6 days I might need a forced break from the game.
---
Couldn’t agree more. Arenas finally reward skillful PvP (not scouting the opposing faction for a pug or premade, and then continuing to stomp a pug for the best time efficiency; rated BGs kind of resolves this) and provide an alternative gearing option for those who don’t like/have time for raiding.
---
Gearing this way obviously needs to not impact one’s ability to raid, and raiding should require raiding gear. No PvP gear should be viable for raiding. Also, the time it takes to get the best PvP gear should be similar to the time it takes to get the best PvE gear, so there is a feeling of progression and finally getting that one piece you’re after makes an impact and you feel more powerful. A fresh 60 should also not really compete with a properly highly geared PvPer, similarly to how a fresh 60 can’t raid in Naxx.
---
I know a lot of people don’t favour arena because it created homogenization, but if they could strike the balance right and somehow keep PvE and PvP in separate pathways that don’t overly clash, I feel this would be an immensely desired option for those of us who strictly like to PvP only.
---
P.S elemental resistance (Fire, Frost, Nature, etc) seems to be the thing that makes most sense to separate PvP and PvE gear. If they reintroduced resilience or a system like that, even with good stats otherwise, this gear should not be viable to raid in as it lacks the elemental resistance. Likewise, PvPing in raiding gear would not make sense as you lack the resilience - you could do it, but it would be very sub-optimal.
---
Actually yeah you absolutely wear leather
---
Blizzard didn't want people automating it. Hand crafting these simple responses has never been something Blizzard seriously condemned, but I do recall any mods that people would use to talk to hand craft messages that worked cross faction was something Blizzard didn't really want to see. I recall Babelfish specifically being a violation.
---
You feeling ok? No one is riled up. Unless you are? Ive already stated you don't have to like it. Am I suppose to not comment back at all? I find it funny you people are so salty. Its crazy how you're saying im riled up but yet your the one commenting and being negative. One would say you are the one who are riled up. But w.e floats your boat.
---
If armory works for classic you should be able to just look up their character.
---
Put in my request but they gave late notice for me to get it off.
---
Hope u ver it bro
---
T2 head (from Ragnaros) and legs (Onyxia) are gonna drop in phase 1. The other Tier-pieces drop in BWL yes.
---
Uh, you forgot launch day...
---
It was sad that I skipped SSC and never had to raid it either.
---
"Just go BT". But I WANT to do SSC and progress in order.
---
Yeah mostlt, silks pretty valuable. Theres chests to roll on and the scarlet set pieces have a fairly high demand. The small radiant shards that DE from the blues sell well
---
My whole Guild is getting back together, chatting it up on discord, the Nostalgia is strong already.
---
I wonder how many of the #NoChanges crowd will use new addons that didn't exist back then.
---
So long as the philosophy remains classic i'll be really happy to play. That means they could do new dungeon/raid content and class/raid balancing (which they already did throughout classic).
---
&gt;	Well, most guilds aren’t going to let a fury warrior take a rogue piece if the rogues still need it.
---
Why not? Fury Warrior is just as good DPS if not better
---
Themechanic96 also for alliance hunters
---
Yes I too watched that video
---
you wouldn't make that much money on the real game, gold is extremly inflated in the beta
---
You sure autoloot was in Vanilla? I'm pretty sure the best there was was shift-click looting.
---
I’ve been looking for a class with its tier set as BiS priest might be it
---
Keep talking, only proving my point.
---
What time zone are you in?  What faction are you playing?
---
It’s just you.
---
You can't tame animals over your level, so no one would be able to test this until the cap goes up.
---
I didn’t realize I wanted a thorns bot for my voidwalker until the 3 or so stress tests posts I’ve seen today telling me I did.
---
I don't know much about true vanilla (I started in late TBC). Why do priests need the last hit?
---
But that’s my point, we don’t know. Everyone just assumes that they will mess it up. But by releasing classic, they’ve taken the first step in developing a different wow, taking it down a different path that doesn’t have so many qol changes, instant gratification changes.. whether you believe it or not, there are some very smart people at Blizzard, not just in the engineering department either.
---
Really can't understand what drives people who dislike Classic to come here and talk shit on it so much.
---
You're distilling hundreds if not thousands of differences between the two game states... down to raiding and comparing them on that metric alone in terms of difficulty.
---
That's the intellectual equivalent of a pigeon knocking over all the chess pieces, shitting all over the board, and strutting around like it won. 
---
I could do the same thing for leveling and be just as wrong as you are.
---
Depends if he/she is in the Americas, Europe or Asia/Aus/NZ.
---
Americas is 26th Afternoon/Evening but EU is Midnight and later so they could do the 26th work day, rest and then go hard at midnight.
---
Doing that at lv11 is tough but fun! 
---
My personal experience was tame a saber, which is right next to Mangeclaw. Attack it with ONLY your newly tamed saber while you staying maximum range. Wait until this polar bear used that whatever knockdown skill. Immediately abandon your saber and start casting taming on the bear. This should grant you with a full 20 second tame without being interrupted by its knockdown!
---
Hope that helps for any hunter looking forward to doing that 3 month later!
---
I feel like after waiting 10+ years for Classic it would be wrong to just replace it yet again. TBC servers or maybe Wrath are one thing....as long as they're optional. But new content for Vanilla? Nah, then it wouldn't be Vanilla anymore.
---
Just hit 32 on a pserver. Omg. Hillsbrad was bad because there was always a level 60 that eanted to kill you, but now every single person you see wants to fight. Its just obscene. And of course I picked the lower pop side so Im kinda fucked....
---
Very smart!! Thank you!!!
---
[Nobbel87](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCX34tk-noBVC4WVC9qQGyMw).
---
During the last stress test I got my Druid to 10 then sat on top of Lion’s Pride Inn spamming people with MoTW and Thorns... did it for hours. Most fun I’ve had in a long time.
---
They have an early talent called I think spirit tap. It gives them a short buff that allows for more mana regen when they kill a target. But it's not if they get experience they have to get the kill on the target.
---
I checked her post history before commenting, OP is in America.
---
I was actually surprised to see this work in the classic client after a guildy posted it a few days into the beta launch... Wasn't this totally removed from retail eons ago or did it sneak back in?
---
No one east of the EDT time zone really needs the Monday off. Sucks for the west coasters.
---
I did the exact opposite back in the day(not vanilla. Started mid bc) to get that fucking pink, overgrown chicken.
---
How so? Do you imagine everyone on the internet raging and yelling at the computer screen?
---
I don't even request at my job, I just tell them when I'm leaving. 
---
#nolifersunite
---
Come, bow before your king! Bow you shits!
---
&gt; No one east of the EDT time zone
---
The only thing East of EDT is an ocean.
---
The DW and 2H fury pve dps builds are actually very similar, only a couple talent points different, and no you don’t have to use slam to be competitive, two hand warriors can absolutely top the meters throughout content
---
Disagree with people on the internet, and managed a video game project poorly. 
---
Ion fucks up WoW beyond saving, but because he's still on the "inside" the same people shitting on Kern devolve into a frothy rabid rage if you insult Saint Ion of RNG.
---
Is volley back for hunters?
---
Instant attacks, extra swing procs, first auto for burst, deep wounds, etc. all benefit from slow weapon. You will favor faster weapons in some cases if they have *really* good procs such as BRE, but not over the items you have shown.
---
This though :)
---
Unlike Druids, ret paladins do not have battle res. There is literally zero reason to bring them over a feral druid or a rogue or a warrior or any other DPS.
---
I don’t think so, but I don’t remember. At least on private servers you can’t.
---
im gonna cause a plague
---
Who hurt you?
---
Extra buff?
---
You shouldn't read and make comments without comprehension of op's content. It boils down to you, the ignorant redditor.
---
that's an addon called questie
---
The point is that apparently its bugged that you can currently.
---
Well from most launch experiences I've seen, getting him at 5pm after work on Monday, even if the Servers launched a few hours ago isn't a big deal, plus any restarts and kinks usually get solved in that timeframe.
---
T3 Druid was always my favorite. Looks a bit weird on Tauren tho imo.
---
Kalimdor was crashing every few minutes during the last stress test. Regardless of what layer you were on. It was horrible.
---
I think they were trying to make the gear fit the theme of Naxx.
---
Some say strange lands of Europe, Africa and Asia are east over the ocean. Personally I'm not so sure.
---
correct \^\^
---
No matter what people say, I'm going to play as a ret paladin.
---
Really? I think t1 druid is probably the worst of them all, and I think T3 is the best of any T3 set.  It's absolutely gorgeous. 
---
It's one of the things that tempts me away from other healer classes.
---
OP is in America.
---
Those are just tall gnomes.
---
I stand corrected.
---
I contemplated not asking off on the 26th since it opens at 5PM CDT (my time) and I finish work at 4PM CDT but I want to sleep before hand so I can go all in. :P
---
Yep.  If they expand on classic, they need to figure out horizontal [with perhaps a -slight- bit of vertical].
---
The question is this - how do you make a character more powerful without making older content irrelevant?  This leads to the question, how do you want new content to interact with old content?  It's tough to get right, and if Bliz goes down that road they need to get it right.
---
I think the biggest thing is how do we want to play the game?  I want to raid MC, BWL, etc, sure, and I want there to always be the 'grind' for any characters I level to have to revisit some of these, but I also want new raiding options at T1, T2, T3 gear levels.  I never want to be so powerful I can solo an old raid, and I want this guarantee that if I leave for a year or so, all my progress isn't wiped out by insane catch-up mechanics or 10 more levels, etc.  I want incentive to level and gear multiple alts, perhaps carefully introduce new classes and races [with a lot of user feedback so we have classes that feel like they fit in vanilla].
---
Op is a server at a restaurant. Doubtful she gets off at 5pm.
---
Uh. I think hes referring to perhaps the paladin quest?
---
Put your instant cast DOTs on on any mob your allies are fighting as you run by, you can lifetap the mana back. Passing out hearthstones and soul stoning party members is always nice too.
---
Soul stones are a bitch, forgot how much of a bitch they are.
---
Right, but you could argue the 1.12 basic recap encourages people to afk, without a metric that exposes it
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/D1eLnfo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/D1eLnfo.jpg) 
---
These people existed then, and you can bet they'll be back. Playing outnumbered is difficult and most likely ends in you having to queue more.
---
A waste of time in a game that will require a LOT of time.
---
My bad, thought you would realize its essential to have these talents, if you got a second opinion...jeez some ppl are so fragile
---
Oh no, my exes name too!
---
I appreciate both sides of the helpfulness coin, honestly.
---
Keep in mind the servers will have layering at first, so you'll see a lot less people than you did in the stress test. What I've found works is you find a spot that you can reach a few spawns at and camp it. If you're a caster before instas and wands, melee if you have to.
---
Warriors don't have an answer for everything in Classic. It is more rock paper scissors. You can still "upset" your counter though if you outplay them.
---
Mine gone. :(
---
Hunter gear always felt underwhelming to me.
---
Stress
---
Every guide takes it into consideration with an asterisk usually saying something like "if you're struggling to quest, grind mobs. If you're struggling to grind mobs, get exploration xp".
---
There isnt a secret way to level when the zone is crowded. Everyman for himself
---
This wasn't in vanilla, but one of my guild's old 25man raid kill screenshots was the whole group aligned into a big cock n balls with a resto shaman chain healing from the tip
---
This was my favorite pet in vanilla!
---
People say it made burst classes bad but I wonder which ones people are referring to, TBC arena was ruled by rogues mages and warriors.
---
I thought it was! I feel like I saw it outside of AQ! but it’s still cool af dawg
---
Parry only factors into frontal attacks so it doesn't affect melee dps, but it does affect tank threat. It just means we might have to watch our threat more is all.
---
Technically Atlantic Time Zone (aka Nova Scotia, Greenland, etc.) is east of EDT.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic\_Time\_Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Time_Zone)
---
!Remindme in 79 Days
---
**Atlantic Time Zone**
---
The Atlantic Time Zone is a geographical region that keeps standard time—called Atlantic Standard Time (AST)—by subtracting four hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), resulting in UTC−04:00. During part of the year, some portions of the zone observe daylight saving time, referred to as Atlantic Daylight Time (ADT), by moving their clocks forward one hour to result in UTC−03:00. The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 60th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.
---
In Canada, the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are in this zone, though legally they calculate time specifically as an offset of four hours from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT–4) rather than from UTC. Small portions of Quebec (eastern Côte-Nord and the Magdalen Islands) also observe Atlantic Time.

other way around. Legs from Rag and Head from Ony. Other than that , bingo.
---
quest addons are a change, they were crude back in vanilla so they area change to the game. #no changes
---
Actually they're almost certainly getting paid by Blizzard. Streamers sign contracts when new games come out committing to playing X amount of hours.
---
I always envisioned in vanilla when they made flying mounts, make them only available at a flight master and it gives you like something like 3 minutes of controllable flight time with a long cooldown . 
---
Basically it gets you to someplace weird quickly, but once you are there, you are stuck with normal travel and can't fly your mount again for an hour or two while your mount "rests".
---
As someone that always played horde in classic, the real advantage was being fucking impossible to click
---
I love how OP is a retard.
---
For a lot of people tbc is when the world started to feel disjointed, and world PvP and social events became sparse. The game was more polished but started to feel empty in other places.
---
!Remind me 79 days
---
Well, 10-20 hours a week would get you to 60 in 1.5-2 months which is not bad if you enjoy the leveling experience.
---
Personal progress would probably be doing some raids and maybe getting Dungeon Set 2 when it comes out. That means you collect all the pieces from the dungeons and do that lengthy quest to upgrade it. It'll probably be something a lot of other players won't have and it might be nice to dress out your alts in that gear.
---
still finding bugs every day  3 months isnt long enough.  wish it was a year
---
Grand Marshall gear was very near BIS though.
---
I am. I'm in US central time zone and plan to take a few days off and basically sit at my computer for 3 days.
---
My guild in vanilla had a shadowpriest &amp; our main tank was a feral druid.
---
Very few people know the benefits and cons of what they bring to a raid &amp; even fewer know how to gear them to be as optimal as possible. 
---
They just parrot what they hear or go along with their biased perceptions
---
Yes, you can enjoy the game.
---
One lie current wow has embedded in the skulls of the playerbase, is "Raiding and Highest end raiding is all that matters!!!".
---
The reason for that is simple: In the RPG Simulator that retail became, it is indeed all that matters, because it's all that's left. Everything else has been trivialized into nothingness.
---
You can play classic for months without ever stepping in a Raid, having a blast, and something productive to do, every single day. You can pursue quests, level, reputations, become a master craftsman, or simply run dungeons. You can do PvP in the open world and in BGs. It all makes sense, it is all part of the game world, and nothing of it feels like just a "means to an end for the 'real' game", as it does in Retail.
---
I'm sorry my terminology isn't exact enough for your pedantry, but the adults are talking.
---
Anyone who produces guild marketing materials for Classic WoW using MS Paint obviously gets it! I’m in!
---
Fantastic! Thank you, and I will be by wowinterface to pick it up in August.
---
Not to just give you a short answer  because I’m lazy or anything, but you need to understand the target audience is just like you. 
---
People who played classic in their youth, and now have to ‘adult’. Other than that you have previous players who were currently on our situation / still are (families, 40 hour work week, college ext..)
---
Sure, there will still be people who work 40 hours a week, and dedicate 80 hours a week to the game, but I don’t think that will be a majority of the player base, and it would be unhealthy for someone to do that if they have any type of responsibility.
---
Just my two cents.
---
I believe pets lose any special properties like that once they are tamed...
---
The streamers almost certainly signed a contract with Blizzard where they get paid and commit to playing X amount of hours.
---
Source: A friends a streamer that regularly does this when new games are released. You usually find all the streamers playing a new release for a day or two before going back to their usual game.
---
My good friend from college had a troll rogue named “imstoned” on Malfurion. Watched him raid through AQ40. Eventually had to change his name when he started pvping a lot in AV and got reported by Alliance.
---
Anyways, he complained almost daily about regretting troll as race, particularly vs. sweet looking undead. It really made him sad inside.
---
If that was true even less people would play shaman.
---
Found what I’m doing on my engi now. Thanks mate.
---
I think your rose colored glasses are likely remembering your old shitty computer because my vanilla server and experience never lagged like that.
---
Which is not what the sticky on the latest stress test said. ["For access, we will be including everybody who was invited to the test on May 22"](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-29/181282) Because of this many people who were in the May 22nd stress test still had the option on the launcher until the May 29th stress test. I assume this is how it's going to work going forward.
---
Homosexuals in 2019 are not the same as black people. Stay in your lane.
---
The orc racial is pretty significant for pvp
---
I am purposely pacing myself on my leveling forcing myself to do all the quests in the zone.  Right now, I have 4 lvl 30 zones mapped out.  Darkshire/STV/Hillsbrad/Badlands.  You HAVE to grind some in the earlier levels.  Its 40-50 is where I am going to hit the wall.  I forsee lots of grinding during that time.
---
You’re a tool
---
55-60 is the hardest, IMO.
---
“You there! Check out that noise!”
---
you can tame lvl 32 beast while our cap is at 30 right now
---
A warrior leveling from 1-60 will consistently be 5-10 points behind their maximum. A level 60 Tauren Warrior has 24 Int. 5 points of weapon skill is roughly 1% hit and a significant reduction in damage loss of glancing blows. This really adds up, especially if you ever have to change weapon types.
---
Your terminology is wrong, simple as that.
---
And the fact that you your first reflex when getting caught talking nonsense is to insult people, adequately shows who the adult is here.
---
Roughly translated, it means "remove me from the gene pool"

weakauras for sure existed in vanilla
---
Horde has an extra fear trinket for 1v1 PvP, alliance has an extra class with magic dispel and fear ward for group PvP.
---
Releasing progression servers is pointless unless they are going to do it while making content for vanilla. Most people aren't going to play on servers where you lose everything once the server hits the final patch and nothing is ever added.

We had several High Warlords in our guild back in Vanilla. Two of them were Tauren, one was a Troll, one Undead, one Orc.
---
These people didn't get HW because of their racials, they got it because they were glorious nolife mother\* with dedication to the game.
---
My 2 weeks were approved already. I'll see you in azeroth!
---
!RemindMe! 89 days "do this"
---
Not all capes are people
---
Then Blizzard be like 
---
" We are sorry to announce but we will be postponing the launch of Classic due to reasons"
---
It's possible OP is off mondays. Like I'm off fridays haha
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
RemindMe! 89 days "do this"
---
Mountain Time (PST +1) 
---
I'm fine with either faction , not set on which for classic but leaning towards alliance.
---
If you dismiss people as being beneath you for asking questions then that's really an issue you should work on that is going to affect your life irl. The best way for people to learn is to ask questions, the real people you should look down on are the ones who act like they know it all despite not really knowing much at all and just capping out their development by refusing to be open to learn.
---
At the dam store!
---
if i played alliance i would. i hate all the alliance but dwarfs, they have earned my respect.
---
Yeah I'd love to try lock and I love dun morough. PM me!
---
Ah ok I only made it to 49 in vanilla on my pally
---
Mountain time (PST+1)
---
Maybe you can do without the utility of locks and druids, but what are your priests going to drink?
---
And then God said: 
---
Let there be Layering on Launch Day, so that all my children may complete their quests in a reasonable time frame and without fear of overpopulation. 
---
And thus it was.
---
!RemindMe 75 days
---
These are the only saber looking pets a Hunter can get in game, which one is cooler in your opinion? Also made a strawpoll for people that cant comment on reddit and are lurking:  [https://www.strawpoll.me/18090451](https://www.strawpoll.me/18090451)   
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry, I tunnel visioned on the first bug you were mentioning and skipped over the second. :P
---
Yea obviously it doesn’t prevent you from doing anything. But a 25 percent chance to ignore Stuns is flat out better for some classes than others. Warlock for instance gets a trinket to remove fear sleep charm not stun. So stacking wotf is no where near as good as orc.  Obviously race doesn’t matter if one dude plays 20 hours a day and the other plays 3. But all things considered two players of equal skill that 25 percent can make a big difference compared to other racial for pvp
---
Agree. Keep cap at 60 and just add content. Guild wars 2 has has 2 expansions and no level cap increase.
---
The Jagex approach is the only good option imo. The rest are just quick cash grabs that result in nobody giving a shit after each expansion hits a final phase and then moves on or resets.
---
You can almost always run away, or turn the monsters into cards.
---
Nothing at all, but I wouldn't do it that way the first time.
---
I'm not totally confident of that. First, the stress test used layering. Second, if they start the layers right at 3k players, that is 3k/X starter zones. Layering doesn't directly balance zones either. So some could be double the pop of others. 
---
If they are not going to use sharding, the best they can do is lower the people per layer to thin the starter zones out. They could start with 1K per layer and spin up a ton of layers. Then as the pop spreads out, boost the layer cap up. As a software dev, that's my guess how they might execute things. 
---
They could of course just throw 3k a layer from the start and watch 3k/8 zones = 375, watch \~375 fight it out in the starter zones. I think stress test day 1 they started with something that high, the second day it seemed they started lower, but cranked it back way up towards the end for the boss shenanigans.
---
That’s simply not true, I leveled a Warrior 1-30 using only 2handed axes as soon as they became available (level 10). I never reached max weapon skill. Not once. The closest I got was 5 points from max, and that was using every scroll of intellect that dropped to help raise my skill. This was part of a test to determine if sticking with one weapon type was much of a benefit (sadly, it’s not).
---
Purple one
---
T1 Priest has probably always been my favorite looking tier set.
---
CAREFUL NED
---
next............song!
---
Just checked mine, same here.
---
&gt;AKA the no-player-can-ever-complain-about-loot-again system.
---
Oh boy.
---
Fact is, your guild needs new recruits. Constantly. If you think you will form a team of badasses at the start that will stay together until the stars go out, you are wrong. These new recruits want a shot at loot.
---
If they cannot have that, because someone has 100 days of attendance, and they have zero, they will complain.
---
And if you introduce any mechanics that give recruits a better chance, then your old players will complain.
---
And of course everyone will complain if there is even the slightest rumor, than an officer just abused his powers. Which will be everytime an officer gets an item.
---
Same here, just went to refresh... POOF history... yikes :(
---
Heard about this earlier. Probably too many people confused, thinking they have beta access.
---
&gt; Onyxi
---
I was referring to the Masquerade event in Stormwind that you do after jailbreak in the attunement quest. It was soloable in Vanilla due to Bolvar soloing everything. But if Bolvar and guards aren't going to attack the spawned NPC enemies, you're going to be in a lot of trouble.
---
Hunter x Mage , Mage can help with capital city portals for quick movement
---
Woah. So lucky. I only got the 4 first week 😆.
---
We the community, our masters appendage.
---
Lmao. Don’t even. 😶
---
I aways felt druid's t1 and t2 are supposed to be more feral / primitive / nature based and t3 is just dreamy / outlandish.Straight outta Emerald Dream.Overall classic sets really hit the fantasy spot for the given class.
---
tbc is a changed version of classic, thus it's a change. #no changes
---
separate servers would split the community, if there is going to be a big community people there needs to be a compromise to force people into one version of the game
---
He did a two hour long class deep dive with tipsout on youtube. Tons of good info in there.
---
Mine disappeared as well, NA here.
---
T3 Druid just looks too Plate and metal-like to be worn as leather to me
---
I knew I didn't have beta access but I had thought we'd have access to the future planned stress tests. Oh well. Back to daily life til release.
---
Did old iron forge exist in classic?
---
I think I heard talks over at barren chat to compile a list for this
---
Ah I'm EU.
---
That one
---
You haven't been paying attention at all.
---
nice
---
Suprised no one has mentioned how dope T3 Mage armor looks
---
Why 79 days? Isn't it like 85?
---
!RemindMe 83 days
---
&gt;!RemindMe 79 days
---
to be fair, there are only like two servers going on right now. in real classic there is going to be way more, so the real stress test will be that whenever there is more cumulative players in total.
---
You and 40% of the ppl want to roll warrior think about it
---
I'm holding out on a decision until after the final stress test. If it looks like they'll run smaller layers to thin the starter zones, I'll probably try to play right on release. If I get the feeling the zones will be ultra packed, my plan is to sleep right after work Monday and set my alarm for 12-2am EST. By then people will either be out of the intro zones or off for the night. And I'll have gotten some sleep and ready for a long session.
---
Or people can just do a DKP system
---
Yes it did, in vanilla. Not sure if it's currently in the classic wow beta or not, though.
---
Horizontal cosmetic progression wouldn't have any longevity in the game unless they add transmog which a lot of people seem to be against for classic. A lot of people play WoW because better gear is a huge part of it. You can easily do gear progression by locking people out of newer raids that require a progressively higher ilvl from previous content giving people the best of both worlds (making old content stil relevant). 
---
Another way you could do it is by locking the level to 60 then having new content with stat increases that are almost neglible but still stat increases nonetheless. For example, this would make it so players can still min/max if they want but it would take ages and many content updates or expansions to go from say a baseline 6k hp to 10k hp.
---
Anyways, there are a lot of ways to do progression without ruining everything and not being boring.
---
!RemundMe 81 days
---
Not as special, but this was my main hunter pet for a LONG time. At least through most of Vanilla.
---
All that is true, but you know what your stun resistance cannot do?
---
Make up for the fact that you hate the guts of your own character, if you don't like the hunched back, or green skin, or oversized shoulderpads, and have to look at it every day regardless.
---
I made that mistake. I played an Undead male Warlock for the entirety of Vanilla. I hated the visuals from day one. I hated the stance, I hated the tatters, I hated the cast animations.
---
But: I wanted WotF.
---
Our guild included my Warlock class officer, who played a female orc warlock. I spent the rest of Vanilla being envious.
---
Not making that same mistake twice.
---
Hurr durrr no changes!!
---
Man imagine a warsong gultch in the real world people could watch in the side lines maybe make a wager here and there. That eould be awesome. Maybe someone should set up some sort of arena system in stv
---
Least streamers going PvE would mean hopefully don't have to deal with surprise server pop spikes from a streamer changing places
---
It is the anti-aliasing. In the settings its quite pixelated however you are able to change that for it to be very smooth.
---
Yeah the problem with making the bis lists is that stuff is still changing. I think the blue post about the hit tables came out yesterday or the day before? While the parry chance shouldn’t affect a dps warrior, three new findings do: dodge chance seems to be about 1% lower, which is neat. Shouldn’t affect gear though. Hit chance cap is about 1% lower (8%), which is great and could mean having to stack less hit on your gear, leaving more space for other stats potentially. Lastly, it appears that the cap for weapon skill might be +8 instead of +10? This might or might not greatly influence gear choice. Someone will have to do the math. This means you are just one point off as a non-human, non-orc fury warrior when having edge masters equipped. Humans and Orcs might have to choose between edgemasters and devilsaur.
---

---
OOOFFF!
---
Patch notes for 1.2.0 say, "Autoloot has been fixed to work with skinning." But I'm not sure what that means. Maybe that was shift-click looting.
---
PREACH!
---
I do think a duo leveling group will complete these quests faster in this scenario because you'll be able to tag mobs easier.
---
&gt;it’s the casuals that demand the same treatment as a min/maxer that seem to be the root of the problem. 
---
You basically just summed up the last 10 years of retail
---
Really, it has a long spawn timer? Still? I only recently leveled a hunter and I tamed that thing @\~30 when I saw it near the fishing trainer I think. :) Anyway, used it from 30 to 110ish when I finally looked into tames and picked up some specific ones.
---
I think Druid tier 1 and 3 are the best sets besides paladin tier 2.
---
Right I’m not telling you to not do what you want, just saying that racial is significant if you pvp lol
---
Only slight hyperbole
---
Give me something for the pain and let me die
---
Undead vs Orc Warlock? Is there a huge disadvantage going Undead? I do like the race more.
---
Not all people are... capes?
---
&gt;actually knows what he's talking about. 
---
Not an Asmongold fan by any means, but he seems pretty knowledgeable about the game?
---
I guess it depends on your definition of auto looting lol. Yes, it was in the game since Vanilla but you did have to hold a button in order to auto loot. They just did away with the button in later expansions. They are also making it so you don't have to hold a button in Classic, which is fine with me. Holding the button down didn't add anything to the game anyway and it was just a tedious extra step.
---
 warlock, warrior and mage gear looks amazing how can you say such an awful thing
---
Omg, farming the Acolyte in Stromgarde for the Staff of Jordan to sell for what? 300-500g 
---
Oh god the pain
---
My god, people really have a foot up their ass here. I enjoyed one moment and though to share. Wish some would have come when I've been gankes earlier in stone talon.
---
photo or it didnt happen
---
Define competitive.
---
This man loots
---
Assuming your math is correct, I think you're still over simplifying.  While you're right that the chance of **back to back crits** is low, the total amount of damage sustained over the course of the fight is going to be much higher due to the 250% parry increase.  Will the tank get killed in 1.5 sec period?  Maybe not (although not impossible), but the increased **sustained** damage through out the whole fight is going to drain healer mana in ways not happening on PS.  Further, this problem is greatly compounded on fights where melee dps cannot be behind the boss the whole time, resulting in a massive increase in parrys that tank has to eat.
---
The increased healer mana usage to keep the tank up is going to come at the cost of healing dpsers.  DPS die, the fights last longer, mana becomes even more of an issue.  I don't think we'll be seeing tanks get 1 shot, but I think we'll see wipes due to healers going oom or dps not beating timers due to deaths.
---
The other thing worth mentioning is that world buffs are going to work different in Classic than they do in PS.  They are not going to have nearly the uptime they do on PS, and we still don't know if the way PS calculate how buffs stack is accurate (very good chance it is not since that is all 100% guesswork).  Tanks will have few buffs, need more heals, healers will have less mana due to less buffs and they'll be spending more of it to keep the tanks up.  All in all...I just don't think PS data is worth anything.  There are too many variables and unknowns for it to be taken as a serious reference for for Classic meta will play like.
---
Context?
---
Wasn't really referring to Asmon and Esfand. Im a big fan of both and actually subscribe to Asmon so I watch him a lot. More of the clout chasers like TipsOut (Sorry, he's a good guy but clearly never played Vanilla Wow and lies about it) and all the ones like him.
---
Bummer, it was in vanilla. I hope this is only temporary because of the legion engine and they plan to reinstate it after or during the end phases of the beta. #no changes
---
As someone who is going to main hunter in classic, this is so bad ass.
---
Wtf even is this thread
---
Looks like some sort of where the wild things are sort of creature
---
OCE here. Gone too :(
---
You didn’t eliminate the competition... he still wants the pet.. he still doesn’t have the pet.
---
Sooo.. how was the funeral?
---
Yes, it takes you out. You can get improved sap in sub tree, but even that still has a chance to fail and take you out of stealth, if I recall correctly.
---
I guess you never looked in the sub talent tree
---
If someone has beaten you to it .. You know what server and faction to roll. Same... And opposite.
---
there's probably a reasonable chance than this ends up being restored given enough time; a few decades could do, as long as it's restored
---
See you on launch day!
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
---
THEY DONT TELL YOU HOW THEY SHIT THEMSELVES. THEY DONT PUT THAT IN THE SONGS
---
I'm not promoting anything was just being amuse  and hope more peple would help in this situation.
---
So far community in beta is pretty shitie and my hope for release are lower everyday.
---
I think the mentally have change too much over the years, probably because of blizzard feeding them easy content.
---
But it feel as empty as BFA.
---
the bis weps but gl farming not just ironfoe, but felstriker as well god damn
---
Mine too :(
---
You are so vanilla you don’t even know
---
Oh dungeon are very effective sources of EXP and if you have a group that is capable of doing them then that is a huge plus but all things being fair and accurate most of the level 60 dungeons quests won't be completed until you are level 60 .
---
Nice cynicism that people can't mention a streamer without being shills
---
Blue one
---
I actually made a full Judgement cosplay set IRL out of foam, as well as a 5 ft tall Ashbringer to go with it. I showed it off to /r/cosplay, but didn't get a single upvote or comment (probably because I wasn't female and didn't have tits hanging out).
---
I'm hoping Fan EXPO this year likes it. I spent *a lot* of time on it.
---
Yep, I absolutely made my decision this way! My main goal with classic is completing all the sets on my main including the dungeon ones.
---
No just a active sub 15 dolla play long time
---
I too have him. The trick is to send a temp pet to attack him and as soon as he does his swipe, you abandon the pet and tame him. He won't cast the knockdown by the time you finish.
---
Investing in personal relationships and socializing in the guild
---
The mage sets are so bad
---
YES. It does more than enough damage to beat Patchwerk in Naxxaramas, it is viable just not optimal. The problem is there are a lot of people who either have unreasonable expectations, they fall into traps where they can't think outside of the box, don't really have a good understanding of raiding to begin with, that they'll just repeat cookie cutter opinions that everyone else is regurgitating. 
---
It's like in retail when people put some stupid hard cap on how many melee they'll take to a PUG group and won't deviate, ever. Or people who set a firm cutoff on ILVL and if you're a couple below but have tons of raiding experience, that's not good enough they will only look at ILVL. 
---
The reality is a lot of people have a lot of bad opinions and spread misinformation about what is important. Damage meters are not nearly as important as people make them out to be on most fights. Surviving as long as possible during progression is more important than doing the most damage.
---
I want to play Rogue or Mage, Rogue because I’m an asshole who relishes in the suffering of others and Mage because I found them fun to level on a private server, and I like having all their utility.
---
.. I hate to break this to you friendo, but as someone who raided on a Paladin for over 2 years religiously, if you go into Classic expecting to push serious content as a ret you're going to be *seriously disappointed*.
---
At best a progression will have one. *One*. And that's only so you can use [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) and keep wisdom on the boss. Otherwise; you bring absolutely nothing to the raid that another class can't do better in some way/shape/form.
---
You, nor anyone else, will get a week 1 rag kill. Sorry
---
Warriors are a hybrid class, but they are the exception.
---
I love the game but I won't burn all my vacation time on it and I do like to go on vacations outside of the state. But I did manage to snag a few days off coupled with a few vacation days
---
Really? I think the Priest sets are awesome
---
I'm not asking for any new shit, I'm hoping they release a classic BC server that lets us mirror our classic characters over to it. If I spend 3 years playing a warrior on classic, why the fuck should I have to reroll at level 1 to play a warrior on a classic BC server. I should be able to carry over all my gear and titles the same as when I played a warrior the first time around. 
---
I don't even think you understand what I'm saying. It is just copy and paste, just like how you can copy and paste your character onto the PTR. Copy and paste your character to BC Classic and continue leveling from 60. If you want to go back and do AQ the character still exists on the classic server. Community doesn't get as fractured, players can continue their characters progression.
---
Modern day guilds don't have nearly the luxury to stack as you're saying, unless you're talking about the top 10 world guilds, which won't apply to most people here.
---
You can zoom that far out? That's crazy
---
You'd think so but not by vanilla standards
---
Dkp, loot counsel or some hybrid system were the typical classic systems for looting. Please no addons for this or new new systems.
---
I work a two on two off oilfield schedule. So I’ll be almost two weeks late to the game, but I’ll have two straight weeks off to play at a time.
---
"PvP or grinding gear". Judgement is better for holy builds than it is for Ret with all the spell damage anyway.
---
I wish. Just 12 days. And I’ll have my two weeks
---
Tanking was way too easy in TBC.  I hated the dungeon design and leveling in outland was stupid.  They should have add 2 raid zones for outland, that only people with Nax level gear could survive in.
---
I always liked having an rp alt, to take a break from progressing. Just sit back and enjoy life as a hunter in teldrassil
---
Both.
---
I keep hearing wall jumping is gone, so it confuses me to hear that certain 'tricks' are still possible.
---
Or try going under SW by standing on wall near the exit of trade district otw toward mage quarter.
---
Walk under the city.
---
There’s a command you can type to increase the max zoom distance to a custom number. (Still has a cap, but it’s higher than what’s available in Interface Options).
---
How so? People are complaining about layering without understanding what layering does and why it's being implemented.
---
Don’t be a dick
---
If people are rewarded only for raid attendance you will be royally fucked.
---
&gt; Judgement is better for holy builds than it is for Ret with all the spell damage anyway.
---
No, it isn't. There are some dungeon blues that are a few +healing points away from being better than T3. Literally no pieces of Judgement are good for holy, as every piece has a superior item that can be located in either a previously accessible raid or dungeon.
---
Hunters and rogues are worth a mention too.
---
!RemindMe 77 days
---
!RemindMe 69 days
---
It was a chance to break stealth, taking points in improved sap lowered that chance significantly.
---
Personal epiphany here... all the time I played wow (vanilla beta -&gt; cat) and never thought of modifier binding a, s, d, and w. Thank you!
---
Swamp of Sorrows maybe? If you were farming whelps it’s likely you were farming the companion pets they could drop which were quite valuable at the time because of their rarity
---
Imagine the horror big streamers will have it they see they lost access..
---
not
---
Sounds like a balance issue that  never got corrected because almost no one was naxx geared.
---
Tiny crimson whelpling vanity pet in wetlands?

Maybe?
---
Stormlingx (stormx) is very good as well, excellent flag runner
---
you mean shift click? thats not auto loot... auto loot is when you click the corpse and it auto loots without having to shift click, and that wasn't in vanilla
---
I mean for PvP with holy builds, not for raiding. In raids you heal, in healing gear. I implied that in my first post. Seriously, stop putting words in my mouth please. I DON'T PLAY RET.
---
difference in a opinion :) 
---
The T3 is okay...but T1 and T2 are pretty boring
---
thanks I am not in beta so I had no idea I just heard that it was so my bad
---
If youre going to be switching talents that much I hope you enjoy farming for all of your free time for the gold to do so
---
Agreed. The colors on tier 2 are neat though.
---
I'd still take my regular gear into PvP for the obvious +healing benefits, but to each their own.
---
For sure! I am heavily biased for cloth wearers I also like the warlock alot too
---
There's a difference between wall jumping and wall wedging, where you can sort of force yourself into a corner, jump, and get stuck at a higher position. Wall jumping allowed you to walk along the surface of a mostly flat walls, and that seems to be impossible now.
---
There is a lot of truth to that, and I do think going smaller for content expansion would be ideal, but it really depends on exactly how much content the devs would want to add to the game.
---
I think most would prefer the level cap to stay at 60 as that is definitely one of the biggest contributors to the power creep problem we've seen of the course of WoW's lifetime.
---
AoE Tanking was far to easy in TBC.   Took a lot of the fun out of it.
---
Arenas were a mistake as implemented.  They only should have been used for actual game world competitive events(tournaments), not another BG.  
---
Honor gear should never be better than PvE gear.  If you want to grind your life away, do it in raids, not BGs.
---
you're doing god's work out there
---
Yes!  It was the pet because it was worth so much gold and I was always trying to win it big!  Thanks for the memory jog guys.
---
Hi, /u/latman
---
Luckily for me, I'm already off that whole week except for 2 days
---
What happened to the idea that when you get bored of a game you can take a break rather than the game constantly trying to adapt to keep your attention?  I don't think Classic will ever drop below enough players to fill a handful of servers indefinitely.
---
We did it ヽ(◉◡◔)ﾉ﻿

Yeah, it's horseshit. It's either avoid it or be flooded with fanbois controlling everything potentially fun on the server.

"Sword of Omar"
---
He comments this on everything remotely related to streaming. Just ignore him, he’s crazy bitter.
---
i hear you, im going to make an alt of every race to play through the zones. might skip on dwarf though since its the same zone as gnomes
---
Wasn't King B prized because he could run down people on standard mounts?
---
It was missing before the update was installed, I only got the update now and it's still missing after it.
---
1) Only 1 and had only 1 before the stress tests too.
---
2) Now after it updated it's 1.14.3.11206 and Agent 2.17.2.6700
---
The problem is that I already did that. I don't necessarily believe that raiding is all that matters  but it's difficult to see the joy in leveling a profession just for the fun of it when it's something I've already done many times. 
---
My actual problem (I honestly don't know how to make this more humble) is that I belong to the 1% of the top player base and my version of vanilla (or classic) differs a lot from that of most other people, that's why I felt it necessary to include background story. 
---
While I do appreciate your input it sadly is quite insignificant in regards to what I wonder/am looking for
---
What's funny is that I check this sub literally daily, it's my homepage, and I've never seen this. Isn't that amazing?
---
Is that Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?

Level 44 and level 53 is 75%
---
Female Dwarves are a myth, guild gonna enjoy that 20:1 male:G.I.R.L ratio
---
Looks like if you are an officer you can override the entire point of having a nondisputable system. Thats just loot council with extra steps. Honestly it looks terrible and everyone's uncle would die every week they dont feel like raiding. The first time someone gets to the top of a list after showing up prepared and working hard and one of your cheese dick friends (officers) decide they want the item to go to anyone else, not only would the entire guild die but you'd probably make a real bad name for yourself and anyone of the officers with a hand in it.
---
Thank God I can avoid any and all of this streamer drama living in the EU.
---
Thank god my job offers time off for the birth of a child, my wife is due the 7th I get a month off. I know it will only be 10 days with classic up. But I'm still hype as hell
---
!remindme 75 days
---
I mean google it?
---
If his reply was 'quite insignificant' (you sound dumb) then nobody will be able to help you. You don't know what a real RPG is if you're used to Pet Battles and Achievements. Of course you'lll be able to enjoy the game with 10-20 HOURS A WEEK play time. Don't be a jackass. Go back to med school and keep thinking it makes you able to talk above everyone.
---
Yeah, but I don't play final fantasy to run away from battles.
---
Ms puts a retardedly high prio debuff, pushing other better debuffs from the boss. Go fury for pve.
---
Can confirm, wife has a Harry potter wand on her key chain and it's a pain in the ass every time in airport security.

He's really not though
---
Questie add-on. I already leveled to 30 on my main without addons. Couldn't be fucked doing the barrens again with out this add-on that honestly ruins the vanilla experience I hope it gets banned
---
Imagine saying Orc racial isn’t significant in PvP in 2019.
---
Finally, someone who gets it!
---
Seems like every day my decision to roll warlock instead of mage is reinforced.
---
If you are looking to recreate your experience then, no you will not enjoy Classic. I am much in the same boat as you, I was a hardcore raider who made it into Naxx. I am looking forward to replaying the game in a way I never did before. I want to level slow and play a class I never have before. What I have found in my limited Pserver play is that PuGs still happen and are quite successful. With my schedule I cannot commit to a raid schedule so I am just looking forward to the slow adventure. There are going to be a lot of casual guilds that will take you if you are available and pug the rest
---
hol' up
---
All the mage sets are ....underwhelming.
---
Hey man.  You're def wrong.  I think MC will be cleared probably week 3 at the latest. On one PServer I think it went down in like 2 weeks or so and guilds have been downing Rag with less than 40 regularly.  I hate to say it, but people back then were just bad and there wasn't resources like now.  I've played on 3 pservers and on all of them I think Rag went down within a month.
---
You seem to be interested in coming up with a fool-proof system, which I commend. For that reason I'm going to present some hypotheticals to consider whether they're potentially game-breaking.
---
First, a couple comments:
---
1. It looks like you're giving way too much power to officers, which don't really warrant it. Sure, they're useful some of the time but that shouldn't mean they're fast-tracked on gear. That just reeks of nepotism, especially in guilds where Officers are promoted based on favoritism and not performance. Your whole system seems performance-driven (where attendance is one metric), so why let officers opt-out in such a dramatic fashion?
---
2. Tenure is a good metric, but it needs to be based on decaying buckets and potentially reset between tiers. Just because someone joined a month earlier in Phase 1 doesn't mean their loot priorities should be affected going into Naxx. They should be treated as equals by that point. This was my biggest gripe with DKP systems. Once your core built up a ton of DKP in the first couple raid tiers, they were basically uncatchable later on.
---
3. How do you deal with 'available but not raiding' players? Say you have 15 healers online and ready to go, but you only need to bring 12 to raid with you today. Who decides which 3 healers have to sit out? How does that affect their loot priority?
---
4. Not all loot is created equally, and players will feel **really** upset if a minor upgrade early on in a raid causes them to miss out on a major upgrade from an end-boss. For example, Netherwind Gloves popping a Mage off the Staff of the Shadowflame / Neltharion's Tear queues.
---
Now the potential issues.
---
1. Do people need to fill in gear priorities for **every** slot, or only in slots that they actually care about? For example, for Priests in BWL T2 pieces are mostly BiS (6 total), but a lot of the drops are marginal upgrades over existing loot, and they will only be in contention with the other Priests in the raid. What about gear like, (a) Shroud of Pure Thought, (b) Pure Elementium Band, (c) Rejuvenating Gem, which will be in competition with Paladins/Druids? For instance, Paladins only have 3 BiS items before Nefarian compared to the Priest's 6. Priests get punished because their BiS is readily-available.
---
2. Scenario continued from (1), but the prevalence of gear dropping chronologically within a raid can fuck people over as well. Consider again the much sought after Rejuv Gem, or DFT. Because these drop from Drakes, players who back-load their BiS lists with gear from Chromaggus/Nef are going to have a much, much better shot at getting these items over players who happen to have gear dropping beforehand. Consider Paladins (Shroud-Flamegor, Boots-Trash) and Druids (Shroud-Flamegor, Boots-Trash, T2Wrist-Razorgore, T2Hand-Drakes) who have relatively few drops before Rejuv Gem compared to Priests (Shroud-Flamegor, T2Wrist-Razoregore, T2Waist-Vael, T2Boots-Broodlord, T2Hand-Drakes, Wand-Trash). Combat rogues are basically fucked when it comes to getting weapons over Warriors since they also want full Bloodfang.
---
3. Specifically for tier gear, this is the kind of loot that is going to cause a lot of problems with a system like this. Classes that depend on Tier gear will quickly get that loot and dequeue from the non-Tier gear lists. However, much faster than those non-Tier items propagate the Tier gear will saturate, meaning you're going to start DE'ing T2 items (because everyone already has T2 Priest gloves), long before you get everyone a Rejuv Gem or Elementium Band. Again, the availability of their loot hurts them when it comes to getting bigger upgrades.
---
4. How do cross-class items and and class disparity factor into things? For example, you're bound to have only a few Druids and a ton of Paladins and Priests, therefore the Druids are almost always going to gear up faster than those taking Tier sets despite them being the least effective healers. Similar issue with Hunters and Jewelry versus Warriors/Rogues. The first few weeks will gear them up quick, then they'll just creep up the BiS queues of those contended items.
---
5. Do off-spec, non-BiS items factor into this? If so, how? For example, a Paladin wanting to get Full T2 and a 2H weapon for PvP / Farming versus a Fury Warrior building a tank set and wanting a 2H weapon for PvP.
---
6. Does unwanted loot given to players count against anything? For example, T2 shoulders aren't great for Druids compared to the shoulders from Molten Core, but you'd rather give them the loot than just DE it in front of them.
---
7. What happens when a boss drops 2 pieces of loot and the same raider is at the top of both lists? Do they get to choose which one they pick?
---
8. How do you deal with player motivation if a player is predetermined to not get loot? For example, assume Lok'amir has 2 entries left -- two Paladins, A and B. Consider these two players capped out on BWL gear already, such that the only item in the entire raid left for them to obtain is Lok'amir. Paladin A is currently above Paladin B in the priority list -- why would Paladin B even bother showing up? They can't end up in a worse position then they already are.
---
I'm not used to pet battles and achievements. It was used as an example of things you could spend time on. The point is that he misunderstood the purpose of my post. The point is that I already played vanilla. Doing all the quest lines in eastern plague lands again on the only two classes I didn't level to 60 15 years ago will not be exciting for me.  WoW is a MMORPG but we all play for different reasons, one reason doesn't have to better than the other. Maybe I didnt specify what I was actually concerned about specifically enough since you felt the need to write that comment, but I really didnt mean anything bad.
---
Got proof on those DPS numbers? I’m seeing around 400dps on legacyplayers.com. And that’s only about 4 people with their best runs on servers that have had Naxx out for over a year.
---
No. Won't be open.
---
it is not open :(
---
Oh right it was the centaur that had been hunting the tauren. For some reason i thought it was the earthen.
---
Tank Warriors too. Tanking as a warrior is pretty much just get all the Tier then work from there.
---
And considering there are bloody 8 of them on Horsemen...
---
I'm in the same boat and I think it's fine to take it slow, my guess is that people will go through raids faster than in vanilla, opening up for more casuals like us to joining them in the longer run
---
Human Rogue is never pointless as you would never run daggers as Human Rogue in PvE.
---
When it comes to trying out jokes, sometimes I gotta just shoot from the hip
---
PTR Account is now gone from my account.
---
Nooo
---
That’s too bad. Guess I’m waiting 3 months for the release then...
---
Damn shame
---
Rogue t3 is one of my favorite sets and rogue t2 one of my least favorite
---
stonetalon/ashenvale
---
Yeah, I was farming the Ara in booty bay
---
Yup.
---
 Actually it is even cooler now because you can still get on top of the roof by jumping in certain places.
---
Though if you play an alliance priest, strongly consider dwarf. It's probably the only race/class combo that has any significant impact. 
---
For myself, I will not play alliance simply because I do not want to be a dwarf priest. On horde side I can pick both troll or undead (undead I think i'll go).
---
That guy is rocking the RAVAGER.  He's about to spin to win.
---
That 5 wep skill by no mean equals 3 hit.
---
I only got launch week off, was a pain In the ass though because my boss wants it off and I do his duties when he isn't in so we had to have the "would you leave if I said no" talk.
---
First time I didn't instantly say no or don't be silly, I just said I'd have to think about it and a few days later he approved it.
---
He's still got it booked off thankfully because I'd had to have said no if he was going to cancel his launch plans for mine.
---
Icehowl's abilities plus Children's Week achievement.
---
It was super popular trade chat fuel back in our realm.
---
I remember how miserable being a Ret Pally was in vanilla... I also remember how satisfying it was having Judgment gear and looking like a stud!  I’m okay with being a dps laughing stock, atleast I look good.
---
Yes and no. Attack speeds weren't normalized until TBC and crowd control immunity was removed from every pet except for the Blind Hunter (removed later in TBC). So it is an oversight, as with many things in vanilla.
---
STV
---
I've missed out a lot then.   
---
sucks to be me
---
Alchemist?
---
I mean if you think not having Tier bonuses that work for you DPS spec is awful try this on for size.
---
One of your best raiding trinkets will be a level 56 blue until well into AQ and even then is rarely replaced due to limited loot drops.
---
Or how even if your a DPS warrior in a guild that easily clears T1 and T2 content you are likely to still be wearing Mail and Leather gear simply because of much better itemizeation.
---
Hi, I try to help you :) 
---
Hunter + Mage 
---
Efficient farming + questing ... lot of CC ... high pvp skill cap (this duo can be fast and fearsome!) ... really strong pvp potential ... mage can blink to keep up speed (sort of:P ) 
---
Hunter + Druid
---
Hunter gather mobs, Druid takes them and kite/tank, than you both aoe ... pet is to dmg or off tank ... I did this in Vanilla and was fun ... it isn't easy chill mode if played 1-60 ... if you play NE you have stealth shenanigans potential :) ... this combo is more pvp fun than pve 
---
Hunter + Priest 
---
PvE, Hunter starts mob than leave it for priest and pet to finish while starting next (you can also leave mob to die from dots) ... PvP very good, Priest is great, Hunter is great, healing is great :P 
---
Hunter + Warlock 
---
As priest but faster killing ... 2 pets ... let's say more dmg but no healing ... also very strong in pvp
---
Rogue and warrior get a really significant advantage for being human.
---
If you are Alliance you can get the purple pet AND mount. Easy decision.
---
Non-farm content.
---
So you sit down to a nice game of dungeons and dragons. Your buddy sits next to you with a 2 intelligence barbarian and says dont worry I plan to be our healer. You say thats a terrible plan and he says but I'll do my best. It's still a terrible plan and you can see the determination and excitement in his eyes, you know you dont want to say no because you dont want to ruin his fun but you know if he does this you're absolutely fucked and will not finish the campaign. Classes aren't what their specs dictate. Class is class and talents are modifiers. Palys are healers. You are being no different than a priest that wants to melee because they can wield a mace. People arent being mean it's just the game design.
---
In this particular thing, Im sure I do. If you dont agree with me, you are miniscule minority
---
Thank you!
---
i like doing tarren mill at 21-22
---
But can he do the arm thing?
---
It takes you out of stealth. Improved Sap gives 30/60/90 % chance to remain in stealth.
---
Kid. Wife. Med school. Maybe focus on those instead of a 15 year old MMO?
---
So it needs to be easy to be fun then?
---
!remindme 80 days
---
Does this mean top geared warriors are going to pull even further out on the meters vs private servers?
---
If I’m a healer then why give me plate armor and mechanics that rely on melee?
---
too bad they based vanilla on 3 patches after pet normalization. The only difference is attack speed, movement speed differences and the other wierd stats were removed (such as the huge resistances wolf, the shadow damage wolf, etc)
---
I'm super sad especially about the movement speed, there was a special place in my heart for taming Takk the leaper, a raptor in the barrens who ran faster than a mount (or the bats in ZG, who outran epic mounts and were REALLY fun to mess around with in eyes of the beast)
---
Can I get around the min max stigma by playing a gnome mage in arcane spec?
---
  **&lt;Journey&gt; |** Faction: Alliance | Server: NA-PvE (PST) |Raid Times: Mon&amp;Tues 6:30-10:30PST |  Guild Type: Semi-Hardcore
---
**Introduction:**  **Life and WoW are about the Journey, not the destination.** **We are a newly formed guild that fosters a community where members want to be part of the guild; evident through their actions and interactions in and out of the guild.** The leadership team has many years of experience running guilds in World of Warcraft going back to retail vanilla. We have raided and experienced all content up through AQ40 and will push further this time around.
---
**What we are looking for:**  Players who like to have fun outside of the raid but are hardcore when the raid commences. We optimally want a 50-person raid team who maintain a 70% attendance level.
---
**What we are aiming for:**  Clearing all raid content while allowing for an optimal WoW/Life balance. We would like to clear each tier of content well before the next tier comes available.
---
**Member Expectations:**
---
Raiding:  We are looking for raid members to be lvl 60 within 6 weeks and 75% BiS within 8-10 weeks. We will accept casual players (friends/family) who are not progression minded. The player will not have a guaranteed raid spot but could be asked to fill in.
---
Be educated about the class you intend to main and how that class interacts with the raid. You must also be willing to continually learn and accept/give constructive criticism. We are willing to teach class mechanics and strategies but need people willing to put the time in and learn.
---
**Raid Schedule:** A third night may be added once additional raid content becomes available. Out of respect for member’s schedules, raid times will not be extended past raid end regardless of progression.
---
**Loot System:**  **Loot Council** 
---
**Interested? Submit an app via our website. Contact** Faceoff#6299 or Faroh#7198 **in Discord if you have any questions or clarifications.**

This is the [Nostalrius census](https://out.reddit.com/t3_bv12wj?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FJusynaG.png&amp;token=AQAAlyDyXGX7sGOAdtLmPizGaHjA1B4XhHfsMtpMcBWZs9Ofdgi3&amp;app_name=mweb2x&amp;user_id=18232174). It'll give you an idea.
---
Not a real answer for this. The 20s are bad for the horde. You can so a few quests on stonetalon. You can do a couple of quests in southern barrens. Maybe some of hillsbrad. Vanilla doesn't really work like your hoping.
---
Or you can be like my brother's guild, which had 3 thunderfuries in 2 months.
---
It's not about difficulty. The entire point of the exercise of raiding is to complete the content as well as you can. It's like you're in a 10 person canoe trying to row across a lake. It's not *difficult*, it's not like you're in any danger of failing. That doesn't mean if some retard sitting next to you is just using his hands splashing whatever at everyone else anyone will be that happy about it though.
---
I was thinking about this today. I assume someone will compile a list shortly after launch.
---
\*sarcasm\* Blizzard should make using the internet to find out quest information illegal.
---
We opened AQ on server that launched with TBC. It was still laggy as hell. Gotta see it again.
---
Some of the specs are ok if you are willing to go the extra mile just to be middle of the pack. Most people aren't so people generalize
---
all good :D
---
I remember some days in STV during Vanilla I was unable to level for the entire weekend. Everytime I started to kill a quest mob a band of the opposite faction would come through like a tidal wave and just crush everything and everyone in their path. It got worse in the evening when it was peak raid hours, bored level 60s waiting on their guildies to show up for ZG would run around on their epics mounts and just gank everyone they saw.
---
Kenny?
---
Asking as you don’t play a tank or healer that requires 90%+ attendance you should be able to clear Mc and bwl in a guild no problem. Aq40 and naxx would be an issue although.
---
MC/BWL are easy. AQ40 and Naxx are not. Those specs will be a lot more common in early guilds compared to the guilds still sticking around in AQ40/Naxx times.
---
Cool, let's discuss Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
You would be surprised.
---
Woah they're puttin in armorless mounts, spirit warrior gear, trading card loot... i can go on a while. Just because it was in vanilla doesn't mean it's in classic.
---
Lmao you people sound like you were bullied by a streamer back in high school
---
I Think you underestimate how long it takes to get  lvl 60 if you compare making alt to profession. Prof only takes a few hrs while lvling to 60 takes around 8~ days / played
---
If you want the lore tied to your gameplay experience I highly recommend watching nobbel87s vids in chronological order playlist (2-76, 1st vid is a summary)
---
It’s frkn amazing how well done they are
---
A bit of both. Raiding back then wasn't a joke or easy.  The only reason people believe that now is the fight are a joke on private server. It turns out private servers had to guess at numbers that made fights much easier. Some content will still get face rolled but easy content doesn't make bad dps classes any better.
---
Does everyone else agree that the floating combat text font seems really small?
---
There aren't any black people in wow
---
I don't know if you edited your post or not but it doesn't matter. I'm not trying to put myself above anyone, I had a specific question concerning MYSELF based on my previous experience in vanilla/classic, trying to get input from people that are in a similar situation as me to have a clue of what my potential future experience would be like. I have nothing to brag about, I'm anonymous and we're talking about a game that was launched longer than a decade ago - literally no bragging rights. If there was a subreddit called "vanillaplayerswhoprogressedthroughnaxxramasanddontwanttoupsetotherplayers" I'd definitely post there first in order to not upset you. English is not my first language so you calling me dumb for expressing myself in a certain way isn't gonna hit home, at least I'm (almost?) bilingual.
---
In vanilla there is always a 1% chance for spells to be resisted no matter how much hit you have.
---
Paladins get some of the best sets. Makes up for their weak class strength 
---
/s
---
We found out that private servers are actually harder, Blizzard even made a post about it after people complained about it
---
Hunters pet doesn't run back immediately when a mob is killed. Anyone else noticed too? Looks weird...
---
I think I addressed this in my original post. Seriously, if the recipient isn't you, why comment? O.o
---
Wholesome. I am in the same boat as you. My life just doesn’t allow for so much leisure. So I am going to enjoy what I can. Thanks for sharing!!
---
30 hours a week is a shitton of time and if you are investing that much time you clearly love the game and wouldn't quit after reaching raid content
---
So something like the mountain jumping to get to the airfield is likely impossible then?  From your description, I would assume goldshire inn would be impossible to climb as well; isn't it quite flat on the way up?
---
I will be running at level 1 from dwarf/gnome starting zone to Night elf zone to level in their zone for darnassas rep. You should be able to get exalted with the rep if you plan the routes according and level in the correct zones by 40. There are a few guides out there.
---
Yes and no first 2 raids (mc and bwl) is easy and always have been. When you get to aq40 it gets a bit harder. What makes the raids easier today is knowledge. In the good old days world buffs was barely used and elexirs/flasks was used sparingly. Not the massive buff lists of a normal privet server raid. Alsow sins there where no way of inspecting your guild mates talents in the beginning alot of ppl raided som times in not knowing them self in sub optimal specs. All this put together especially the heavy use of buffs world and elixirs makes alot of endgame content trivial but it will take you about 5 hours of grinding/collecting buffs for every 2 hours of raiding making the game time consuming.
---
My thoughts on this is add items that make those classes better. What about a better version of wolf's head healm? Or similar stuff.
---
Losing is the metric that exposes the afk and worthless. With pvp rewards being on old system doing nothing is legitimately wasting your time, unlike now in retail where everyone gets something no matter how they do.
---
It's complex to answer.
---
I suspect a lot of elitism has grown over time - people love min-maxing and want to have the best possible team mates since that's how they play themselves. Or they want to be carried. 
---
In retail the culture have been a meta and only one way of playing the game for years - I suspect a lot have been influenced by this mentality over the years, or just don't know any better from only having retail experience. 
---
They may have their opinion influenced from streamers who bitch and whine over certain builds being trash. 
---
At the end of the day, your enjoyment and how you are as a person is what will get you raid invites rather than spec. The raids Are easy. You're gonna end up blazing through them day one, regardless of how many oddbuilds you bring. If of course you aim for a server/world first guild, I'm afraid the dream will end there as min-maxing goes without saying in such a guild. Won't matter much till Naxx anyways :p
---
I can only hope the community realises this before launch.. but it probably won't. I've created a little community and started up a guild with like-minded players, cause I can imagine the trouble of sorting through guilds and people at launch - at least until people become more patient and learn the virtues of the game (or quit).
---
Actually it was the opposite. Turns out the raids were severely undertuned on pservers. Your confusing leveling dungeons with raids.
---
I like watching Sakaar's streams (He used to work at Blizzard as a CM named Ythisens).
---
This isnt true, p servers overtuned bosses and they were actually much harder
---
If your aim is to consistently be in the "1% of the top (known, raiding) player base" on 10 hours a week played, the answer is no. You probably won't and can't do that again because nobody can do that on 10 hours a week played. Because there are players who are going to be hardcore nolifing it and be far ahead of everyone by the time they hit 60. You won't catch up.
---
There seems to be a pretty fundamental mis-match of goals going on here. The whole point of Classic is that we get to play the game we've already played and loved. Your problem with Classic is it's a game you've already played, which goes against the whole point of it being here. Is it really what you're looking for?
---
For me, I'm not going to bother with hardcore this time. Yeah, I'll probably have a (casual) raiding toon and a PVP toon, but most of my plans don't revolve around those. I'm gonna:
---
- do personal challenges like Iron Man (maybe with an Iron Man guild with everyone recording milestones)
---
- do purposely messed up builds like "no more than 20 talent points in each tree" to see how far I get with skills vs. purposely fucked character (probably pretty damn far, if the competition is newbies)
---
- try to grind my way to 60 without doing a single quest because why not, with other mods like being a Rogue that kills only Humanoids
---
- try out an RP server at least once
---
- be that guy that has all the keys to everywhere goddamn, drag friends around to show them zones and fun quests and secrets, and also do 9000 full BRD runs because that dungeon is my favorite
---
Why challenges and stuff though? Well, why not? I played in 2004 too, I've done most of the rest of the stuff. Random challenges will be fun to do and fun to know I did it, even if the rest of the server doesn't know or care, and I can do them at my own pace.
---
Judgement set is one of the best if not the best armor set in the game. And this coming from a rogue who gets some good armor sets (bloodfang is real good)
---
Game breaking?
---
We had addons that time as well
---
I had addons for
---
Energy thinks
---
Bleed,Blind,Stun etc durations
---
I had enemy cast bars
---
I had threat meter and dmg meter
---
and I probably had more which I don't remember atm
---
true, thats a sexy combo
---
Tip 2. Emote at the enemy. A quick /bow can help you avoid a much stronger enemy.
---
Yes low level instances are a bit easier we still have no ide on raids
---
Sumthin wrong with his medulla oblongata
---
Well, I just finished my masters and there's no way in hell I'd even think about playing an MMO during that. Much less if I had a wife and kid...
---
I appreciate this comment very much, and I'm very happy you got the point of my concern!
---
Are you seriously comparing two specifically announced programming exceptions and an external, not-fully-implemented trading card game to rare mob spawns? That's just sophistry.
---
Here, let me help you not be so obtuse: It was a *mob* in Vanilla added to the game before the 2.0 prepatch. Ergo, it's in Classic.
---
And besides, there are, like, six other albino Crocolisk mobs anyway, so OP has nothing to worry about on that note.
---
That's what the players thought but both devs from pservers and blizzard have come out with different information. Blizz keeps dropping server info that pserver devs guessed at and they really lowballed it.
---
All benefits??? Paladin is top tier healer, why waste a Paladin spot on a ret, since they bring nothing that a holy Paladin can't...
---
T2 paladin is much better for PvP, than off piece cloth gear the armour means nothing is a meme, you wont be able to stick to a warrior for support if you get 1 shot by an auto attack.
---
Raids aren't a joke but even if they are why would you purposely choose the weakest and most group debilitating specs to prove a point?
---
No ones been banned for buying gold? Thousands of people have
---
Why is the improved charge talent so unpopular? I'm leveling a warrior now and am constantly rage starved. However none of the leveling builds put any points into improved charge. Why is that?
---
Lol mate just go pug something and be the trashy dps ppl used to be back then
---
As an Ally, all I remember the Horde saying was ‘dogg dogg dogg’.
---
Energy thicks , stun lock bar , threat meter , dmg meter , questhelper , various coordinates addons , dungeon loot table addons , action bar alternatives addons
---
We had plenty ..
---
Did you read blizzards posts? People were complaining mobs werent doing as much damage as on pservers, blizzard confirmed that classic is using lower damage as it is how it was in vanilla. Pserver mobs were hitting too hard
---
I don't think I've ever seen him pot in PvP. He drinks constantly for mana but it seems like he thinks pots are bad etiquette. I barely know anything about WoW though so I might be dead wrong.
---
Almost all of these are badass
---
Orc is terrible. Most if not all the goos tank weapons arent axes so thats one useless racial. 5% more pet damage is an useless racial and the active racial is useless tpo since it reduces your healing recieved.
---
If you have edgemaster's then basically none. Otherwise, a lot.
---
I guess you have never heard of the search option then.
---
True! emotes can really turn a situation around!
---
This is what I did to make the grind from 44 to 60 bearable. Lots of skinning mobs were killed. From 50-60 I killed a lot of dragon kin for a chance at black dragon scales. Got all the mats I needed for FR gear and made enough cash to buy an epic mount.
---
Paladin grinded undead mobs. Got a lot of cloth to give to my priest to level tailoring that way and rep from WPL. Priest was easiest as I just killed humanoids forever. Also at 54 I started queuing AV and just grinded those yetis in the cave so I could get exalted with AV by 60 for some phat loots. (Or so I thought at the time)
---
I would argue against that maybe hundreds in the recent years. Out of what? Hundred of thousands buyers?
---
Don't feed the Troll.
---
You jump up in the corner. Actually, I think you might do the same going to the airport but I haven't done that in a very long time. I don't recall every walking on a wall.
---
He doesn't, but pretending everything is the same as vanilla is also a shitty way to answer the dude's question. You could have just said, if they arent you can get another one in another location instead of blowing it off like it wasnt valid because it was in vanilla.
---
I loved that the dailies in blades edge gave you raid flasks and consumables for gruul. I wish the isle dailies had followed that model instead of becoming a simple gold source.
---
t3 mage is still probably my favorite set in all WoW
---
ironic, huh?
---
idiot, everybody and their grandmothers figured it out that you're a shithead - "oh, let's say it was all a joke"
---
seem more like a child demanding attention so gonna block you.
---
I decided to keep stress testing... For science. Sorry y'all.
---
its casual vs hardcore mindset.
---
the hardcore type of player / guild  wants to clear content fast. they want to be the first / among the firsts.  They want to do extra raid runs to gear alts, they want to get Thunderfury, Etc.    All these things cost time and they want it to be as efficient as possible. Therefore they have little to no place for efficient builds. 
---
a casual type of player just wants to clear the content, not caring too much if it costs them 3 months or 5 months. As long as there is any progress, it's fine. do you want to play Moonkin? go ahead.   since you can clear the early raids with 30 people, it's ok if 10 play suboptimal talent trees.  Only when they get to a tough roadblock boss they start thinking about raid setup. 
---
Of course, most guilds fall in between, you have hardcore guilds that allow 3 people to play a weird build, and casual guilds that restrict it etc
---
I would go for the right one.
---
I assume you don't feel like contesting for mobs - that will happen in vanilla. But I do have some tips for survival or minimizing death time by banks.
---
1. Have a backup plan if the quest you want to do is contested by aggressive enemies.
---
If you get ganked repeatedly, find a remote area where no quests sends you to and grind for half an hour, then return, or try another quest in you log. More efficient than running into a wall. Heck, even do a dungeon.
---
2. Questing in packs or groups are not a bad idea for some zones.
---
Safety in numbers. Especially in STV. Expect gank squads with full engineering setup running around for the lols.
---
3. Duel. Duel a lot. 
---
Though WPvP and duels are not entirely the same, they can teach you a lot about your class and enemies class - who are good and who are bad. Expect to get your butt kicked a lot.
---
4. Level an alt.
---
Sometimes a hunter and rogue will corpsecamp you for no particular reason. For hours. Logging out and playing an alt for that time is something I'd recommend. Play a few hours on an alt and jump back in, by then they are hopefully bored of waiting. I have seen cases where they are not though.. myself included.
---
I actually based my choice on tier 0 and the Lightforge set back in beta. Unfortunately, by the time I reached 60 in retail and got the set, they changed the helmet design to the monstrosity most people know today :(
---
Probably zenyatta main
---
Warriors benefit the most from the HP regen portion of spirit getting 0.8 regen per health regen tick (every 2 seconds) per point of spirit (comparatively, the next closest is rogue at 0.5, and the next closest drops to 0.25). With a set of gear stacked for spirit, you can reasonably get up to the same HP regen food at your level gives you, but you get to move around while doing it plus saving you money on buying food, or you could half the time you need to eat food.
---
Another thing to note, strength is kind of weak until you can really stack it late game. 7 strength is only 1 dps, haven't done enough testing to see if that DPS loss making the fight take longer is made up by the lower time out of combat due to regen or not.
---
Overall, as a warrior, your most important upgrade DPS wise is going to be your weapon, keep it up to par and you should be fine.
---
Don't use it then bud.
---
Maybe someone else would like to use it.
---
I plan on being a full time tank for whatever guild I join, and I’m thinking of choosing Dwarf for the racial ability and frost resist, the only thing left is what my talent tree will look like as a full dedicated tank? 
---
On the calculators I like going 10/0/41 to really maximize my raid utility as a tank, but I’m not sure if it’s better to possibly spend my points in increasing my dps output even though I’m a full tank. My guts telling my utility &gt; minor dps increase 
---
Any help and feedback would be appreciated! 
---
I’ll see you guys in Classic come August !
---
Thank you very much! I don't aim to be in the top and I also realize that it's completely unrealistic. It would be fun to play the game with other people that played in vanilla though that you could raid with on a casual schedule whilst progressing in a decent pace. Yesterday I just suddenly realized that I really really would like to relive this game again, not exactly like I did before but at least somewhat similar to how I used to enjoy it, because I simply know what actually triggers me when it comes to this game. 
---
The RP server idea actually sounds appealing as a side project:)
---
When you die , you ress at the nearest graveyard right? .......am a little vague about how classic processed this scenario.
---
Ya, your confusing dungeon mobs with raids.
---
You are lucky I leveled an awesome hard hitting melee monster (enhancement shaman) only to find out on 60 that I would never ever raid as dps. Whit this info from the beginning you can choose if healing is something you want to do or not
---
Due to 16 debuff slot instead of 8 at launch, will I be able to raid as 2h arms warrior, or do I have to get Nightfall to be valued in semi-hc guild?
---
It's a mix. He's been grinding the shit out of the game for sure,  but he gets traded gold for respec and stuff so he can grind other things. That is mostly from his guild though. Same with enchants, those are from his guild and I think he pays for them. I think he got traded BIS chest the other day, but he grinded the fuck outta WSG for some trinket or something and spent the past 2 days in Gnomer for the offhand weapon.
---
I might've mixed up some item terminology, I don't know WoW very well.
---
Ye, so this is what I do not get. There will be raids that will want to clear everything as fast as they can, which is cool as that is like its own meta of a competition, but outside of that, does it really matter if the content is not hard as no one is going to be pulling anyone back if you can have 20% of the raid AFK and can still clear... I guess I am interested in whether the 'WoW classic raiding is a joke" is just hyperbole.
---
who is this Theloras guy you speak of?
---
sounds like a bit of a weirdo if you ask me...
---
I  could see this analogy working if the activity were fun. 
---
Like people going camping if you take 10 people so long as 2-3 are capable at pitching the tent and starting a fire who the hell cares who tags along for assistance the deed will get done and we’ll have fun either way?
---
Why ask a question if when you get the answer you dont like you plug your ears and start with buts?
---
It's bullshit, they wanted to take advantage of multicore/threads. Doing so requires less servers/less money.
---
When did WotLK ever need 'sharding' because DKs were so 'complicated'?
---
I feel like t3 looks worse than both 1 and 2 on every single class.

---
Ouch, why
---
Tryhards!!
---
It is not really a case of dps in classic raids. It makes things faster and easier. Your aim is to clear content faster not only to clear it.
---
I see. So you do not think it would be possible to easily clear Naxx with a DPS team full of rets and boomies?
---
If you stay within your own echo chamber, without your views being tested or challenged, you'll come away worse off than you started. 
---
If you don't understand ***why*** you like something, how can you improve upon it or enjoy it fully? 
---
I'm not shitting on the game. I am asking questions and proposing situations that try to explain ***why*** people feel the way they do. 
---
Read what I am responding to. The guy is talking about "earned" things in Classic. What does that mean? 
---
It certainly isn't because Classic content is difficult. None of the raid bosses are that complicated. Most only have a couple of abilities. Mastering the class isn't that complicated. A lot of classes literally spam one button. There's no rotation. 
---
The only solution I've come up with is that "earned" in the Classic WoW context means, "I ***spent*** a lot of time grinding for this gear, therefore I attribute value to it." 
---
But that's not a very good metric for what is considered to be "earned". I've been playing since 2006. Does that mean I've "earned" the right to something in the game? By mere virtue of existing? 
---
When it comes to video games, we measure someone's "value" by ***how good*** they are. Not by how many hours they've logged into the game. 
---
That's what I am getting at here.
---
I see, so the first two raids are the joke content, and the rest is more harder and will require people to be properly talented and specced etc?
---
Yeah I can get beind that. Except shaman amd mage ofc.
---
If ypu have even remotely passable gear, fury is better, either with a good 2h or any high level 1hs.
---
ayyyy there he is
---
And yes, he is.

   * v. Level 60 mob: 5.0% / dual-wield: 24%

   * v. Level 61 mob: 5.5% / dual-wield: 24.5%
---
   * v. Level 62 mob: 6.0% / dual-wield: 25%
---
   * v. Level 63 mob: 9.0% / dual-wield: 28%
---
Private server numbers, actual is 8% and presumably 27% for dual-wield.  Maybe something else is incorrect from private, but on private 5 weapon skill does give you 3% hit.
---
Just know there isn’t actually a whole lot of RP going on.  It’s not like everyone pretends it’s a dnd campaign it’s still mostly normal chatter.
---
Which stance would you be in? Like for most of the time?
---
I see, thank you for your response. I understand there will always be a race thing for things... hell I see a lot of people min/maxing their commute to work, making sure they are at the exact spot at the tube for the best carriage etc.... but for the overwhelming majority of people they do not, which was why I was confused why people are sh\*\*ing on the less viable classes if the content is easy anyway.
---
They were still irrelevant in terms of making your character stronger. You didnt need it for anything and I sure as hell didnt do them.
---
Because pre 30, you have no viable rage dump: you don't have slam, It is not worth pulling multiple mobs pre sweeping strikes so cleave is out. Heroic strike is HORRIFIC when you consider that it not only costs 15 rage, but it also forfeits the rage you would have generated on your big 2 handed swing (you cannot gen rage on yellow attacks and heroic strike replaces your next melee attack). You are correct, you will not have enough rage to heroic strike... basically ever pre 30, but it's not worth talenting into to pull off anyways. As long as you are just rending, hamstringing, and overpowering.... you aren't going to need improved charge anyways once you have anger management. 
---
It's also vastly inferior to anger management. Anger management, on a 15 second fight, is going to give you .3 rage per second, or 4.5 rage per talent point.... but that is both in and out of combat, so it's just always working no matter how inconvenient your mob kill rate is. 
---
If you cast charge on cooldown, every time (which you will not pull off), it's 3 rage per 15 second fight per talent point. Making anger management 50% better under IDEAL situations, and probably more like half as good per point as anger management in real game situations. Possibly worse.
---
And you need tactical mastery at least 4 anyways just to function as a warrior, in both pvp and dungeons, so you might as well get tactical mastery 5. 
---
I do think it's probably worth backfilling for improved charge at levels 28 and 29 if you can make sweeping strikes spam work, as I really don't like going for axe mastery at low levels: you don't really in my experience have much choice over what weapon you are picking anyways. But pre level 20, it's just way way better to rush anger management and then go for the meaningful dps you get from deep wounds/improved overpower.
---
They are meant to be healers that can take a beating. Like a combat medic. That's why all their tierset effects buff their healing and there are shields in the game with stats for healers. It may be odd but it's how it is.
---
Content for casuals.
---
PLZ read wowhead... Dungeons are easier in classic retail and raids are much harder in classic retail bc of the parry value of bosses

Hunters weave in aimed shot and multi shot between auto shots. Hardest rotation in vanilla
---
No problem, you asked for ideas so I was just tossing some out there. I know the RP server is one thing I'm definitely gonna try, and so is the [Iron Man Challenge](https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronClassic). I'm betting a lot of other former players will try this time around too, especially if there's official rankings going, lol.
---
And if anyone ever makes a "Challenge guild" that has 20/40 in some kind of suboptimal spec but tries to seriously do raid progression, I'd probably join and try that out, just to push the limits of what's considered viable. All the most optimal and efficient stuff has been done already, right? :P
---
We are still going to have 16slot debuf instead of 8. Is that a problem, if it will become 15 slot only due to MS? Its still more than what people used to play with
---
Judging from most responses, seems like an unpopular opinion that a lot of the T3 was the beginning of the end for creative and identifiable sets. I absolutely LOVE warrior and lock, and have a soft spot for the hunter set I never got close to (the helm saves it for sure), but it still feels like the others rely too much on color scheme to identify the class and just wail away on shiny, pointy, and Halo 2 elite. Looking at you Druid...
---
I see. I have read for many a years that they were a joke. I think the only time I heard a raid being hard was about Naxx?
---
The question then was if it was a joke, why would it matter what specs raided if it was going to be easy to clear. I guess my bad analogy would be if I asked you to pass the salt at the table, and someone had a go at you for not wearing your running shoes and sprinting to me, despite it being easy (albeit a little slower) to just pass me the salt at the table.
---
You're full of it.

Worth what? A loot treadmill that in the end means nothing at all? Trying to recapture the feeling of being a teenager when you have MUCH more important responsibilities to be taking care of?
---
There are so many other games that are far better suited for where you are in life. It might be time to move on.
---
Unfortunately there aren't many places with enough density to make 28% worth it, even with the jump in total xp per mob.
---
From what I understand, if your raid is insanely pushing on DPS, your threat output is going to be more important than maximising your dmg mitigation, because it's that threat output that's going to allow your teammates to really push damage--and human's sword spec is probably going to be more useful than 10 frost resist. 
---
i recommend the youtube videos of skarmtank, he seems to really know his shit. But his perspective is one of a super optimized high end guild so make sure you keep that in mind

This is how I recall it working

Meanwhile having over 80 people on same layer in Orgrimmar was impossible with people and groups being pushed to dead layers. So great. At least it looks like they can manage it and will disable it for capitals. Orgrimmar was just depressing with multiple layers of 40 people and not letting us to have even 3 full raid groups on same layer.
---
The rage differences are small if they even exist.
---
The reason warriors or physical DPS are gonna do more, is because the bosses will have lower armor than private servers.
---
Imagine taking an asmon stream seriously.
---
Is 5 skill with swords that much better in the long run even though Naxx has a lot of frost damage and that extra 10 is kinda nice isn’t it?
---
I don't know enough to say for sure.  People are getting more rage at super low level doesn't mean they will get more at high level.  
---
I have read that most bosses on private servers had the same armor, but it is known that bosses had vastly different armor numbers in vanilla.  So at a minimum there will be more variance from fight to fight for melee.  Until we test raids I don't know if anyone will know for sure if on average it is more or less then private servers.  
---
Perhaps on average warriors do higher damage then private servers, but we have learned that parry numbers were to low on private servers by quite a bit, so threat for tanks should be lower.  Warriors have less threat management tools then rogues or mages, so they may be more limited by the tanks threat then their theoretical damage output.
---
You can skip big chunks if BRD if your primarily goal is to farm last boss, making it 20-30min run.
---
Yes unless you talent for it.
---
You might want to start your time off a couple days after launch.

I was checking private server raid logs.

Compared to the top warrior DPS of all time, hybrids do the following:
---
* Shaman - 50% DPS of top warrior
---
* Druid - 44% DPS of top warrior
---
* Paladin - 27% DPS of top warrior
---
People can dig through the logs themselves:

Yeah, hinterlands feralas and tanaris cycling works well enough in my memory.
---
No changes
---
5/7 raids Are easy, only AQ40 and Naxx have some requirements.
---
MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and Onyxia are even entirely pugable.
---
Vanilla raiding is a joke to private server players that have been doing the raids for years and years, and for mythic retail players that are used to a fight having 20 finely tuned mechanics.    
---
    
---
For your average player the raids will not be joke. If you want to clear even BWL and ZG you need a good raid leader calling shots and a raid of players paying attention and at least specing/gearing/playing somewhat intelligently. AQ40/Naxx will require some serous work for anyone. Yes it will be easy to carry people through after a few months of clears when everyone is geared, but not many guilds will clear it first reset unless they are people that have years of raiding experience. Most people guilds not in the 1% will get stuck on bosses and players will get burnt out and they will struggle to fill raids (and have all their good and geared players poached by better guilds).
---
On private, weapons skill counts as negative defensive skill. Since every point of defensive skill adds 0.04 miss chance, 5 weapon skill adds 0.2 hit. The actual glancing blow damage reduction is the highlight of the weapon skill, not the hit/dodge part. That's also why weapon skill is fairly useless for ranged, since ranged attacks don't have glancing blows.
---
Losing a whole slot worth of stats is a lot. Especially considering Edgemaster's is only useful for lvl 63 mobs.
---
People weren't lying when they said it was the most disgusting keyboard they've ever seen lol. He is funny indeed.

I haven't forgotten, just never heard of him.

You've got that Nightfall thing a bit wrong. It's a 2-handed axe with a debuff that's used typically by the off tanks to whack the target when they're not needed to tank. It's not a weapon you use to tank with. Even less as a Paladin.

Thats the TBC formula.

In Classic, its 5%, 5.5%, 6.0%, 8% for lvl 60, 61, 62 and 63 mobs respectively.

---
A lot of the req levels are straight up wrong and are directly contradicted by the wowheadclassic links
---
the best thing about vanilla was mindcontroling horde players and then buffing them with fortitude. I turned many deadly hordies into friends I could farm alongside in complete peace for days.
---
It's enough to make a difference if players are equally skilled. However, you can still top meters if you're good.
---
It just makes itemization more optimal and you don't have to waste gold on Edgemaster's. 
---
Another option is to go dagger build with Aged Core Leather Gloves, which becomes really good in AQ40.
---
Arcane spec is good, it's Arcane missiles that isn't as good.
---
Mining + skinning while leveling, replace skinning with Engineering at lvl 60 or earlier if you feel you wanna wpvp alot while lvling.
---
Ah i see. No it's not THAT easy. To further your outrageous analogy while i dont need you to lace up the sprint shoes to pass me the salt, i also wouldnt want you to be like the sloths from zootopia. There's an episode of family guy where peter makes breakfast with an elaborate machine that takes forever and it ends up shooting him somehow. Stupid things can happen in raids especially if everyone think's its so easy cause they watched someone on an undertuned private server destroy it with everyone in max gear. If those stupid things happen and you restart or miss the kill because you took a raid of sloths then it's easy for the joke to be on you.
---
I used to love the game, I'm never playing anything while my toddler is awake and I manage my career just fine. It's not about the loot, it's about an enjoyable experience. What equals an enjoyable experience is not the same for everyone. 10h/week is probably a lot less time than a regular person nowadays spends staring at his/her phone looking at things that are completely irrelevant in regard to their real lives.

Should show these sets on other races(popular race/class combos). Undead warlocks look insane as do undead rogues and orc warrior. If the sets are only judged on human I think pala t2 wins but if other races are introduced I think undead rogue t2 or undead warlock t2 win

Same here
---
There might be some cases that feel strange, but that doesn't make it a technical limitation.  I do agree that some situations can be extremely wonky, but that is just how things worked out.  Like any other game you either learn how the systems work, or you don't.
---
Your opinion of what is better is irrelevant.  If the devs didn't have the manpower or time to make it happen it wouldn't have.  They just decided that in order to stay true to the classic experience it was something that aught to have been prioritized.
---
Can someone make a hub with 5 star mods exclusively
---
Not talking about cooldowns or resists, again. It's actually bugged in the Classic beta and just refuses to activate when it should sometimes.
---
You've got Ashenvale and Stonetalon Mountains as well as early Tarren Mill. If you're a healer you can already start farming SFK at 20, if not it's perfectly fine to go in at 22...
---
There's plenty of options, especialy as you get to mid to late 20s as you can start going to BFD and RFK and then it already opens up the path to full thousand needles and shimmering flats which will take you all the way into the early 30s.

Nax is a long way away, and FR is only useful for saphhiron and I think KT? and 5 weapon skill is important the entire time, especially for a tank who risks getting parried--and with parry haste that makes weapon skill into a defensive stat, too. (on top of it yielding more rage, which is still more threat).
---
That said... It doesn't really matter much in the end. I recommend you play a gnome, for escape artist in PVP. :)
---
Your exact attitude is why it doesnt work. You tell 40 people what to do to be successful and they all want to know better than you or break the mould. "But what if i" is the raidkiller. You say hey i need you to stand here because of xyz and the same type of people that want to play a not optimal role are the type that will say okay then in the middle of the fight think "but what if i" and do dumb shit that kills everyone.
---
I still feel pretty torn about which faction, race or class that I should play. On one hand, I want to play as Horde because I enjoy the underdog feel and I love most of the zones and dungeon experience. On the other hand, I want to play an alliance because their cosmetic looks cooler and because roleplaying. I want to level up a hunter again, but I also want to play a shaman and maybe be a healer this time. 
---
I am very undecided, but I am looking forward to experiment when the time comes.
---
That honestly seems like a lot of fun, you make a good last point!

That's when the bears show up.

Some streamers really so care about their communities, like Preach for example. Hosting his own convention, meeting up with viewers irl for drinks etc. Dude goes out of his way to be nice even when there's nothing in it for him.
---
10 hours a week and you're never going to do anything more than casually run the level 60 dungeons. It's going to take you months to even hit 60, much less gear up.
---
The main point is if you have countless people and doesn't have any strong emotions towards anyone (aka friend, discord raid clown) why would you bring a spec that can't contribute to the goal as much as it's healer spec or another pure dps. If  even getting 40 people is a problem, than noone gonna nitpick that much imo.
---
Ahh, I see, so in some ways, similar to what we have now? I am purely speculating here, but I am guessing the quality of average player in Classic WoW end game will be a lot higher than in retail, which could make things a little easier.
---
Everything I've heard about raiding in vanilla, below Naxx anyway, is that you had 20 people who were doing their best and 20 people who were just sort of 'there'. I suspect that with 30 'good' specs that are all actually playing there will be more than enough room for 10 'sub optimal' specs. If only to prevent gear from getting wasted.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer, exactly what I was looking for. I didn't realize that heroic strike hits wont generate rage. That basically means that even if you skill improved charge and turn your first hit into an heroic strike hit, you wont have rage to empower the next hit anyways. Got it!
---
Haha, ok, I get your point. Thank you very much :)
---
In some situations it can be. Problem is we don't know how close those servers are to what classic will be. Also, legacy players gathers data from combat logs, so the accuracy of the raw data can be off
---
I'm not sure if you noticed but you answered a question issue by recommending dungeons. Just proving questing does suck at 20ish for horde.

What's the classic subreddit for if not to ask questions about classic?

I’ve played priest since I started in TBC, how were they in vanilla ? Are they slow at levelling? Are they good end game?
---
I see. Thank you, so it is purely a time thing then, of which some people care and some do not. Thanks \^\^
---
Math doesn't really work like that. If a warriors base int is only reducing the total time by say, 2% (notice the above listed test was like 500 int). An addition of double that value, assuming linear scaling, would only bring that number from 98% total time, to 94% total time. In other words it would be a less than &lt;5% total reduction in time from base to base + AI. That is helpful, but by no means huge. 
---
Disclaimer: I have no idea what the actual formulas are, but regardless, the % change wouldn't vary much with a different formula, unless they are using some extremely wonky system for this.

Btw, you may wish to amend that part in your Spelladin guide about Lionheart. It was a 1.11 item and thus won't be in the game until Phase 5 iirc, so a Pally will almost certainly get Judgment before then.

"Miss a raid, might as well quit the guild."
---
Just go look at set bonuses from the raids and you'll know everything you need to know about your class in the end game.
---
Most classes were one spec only and that's it. If you're aim is PvP there's some more choice but will be very gear dependant.
---
it might but not by much. like 5g MAYBE. this all kinda sounds familiar but i forget. most of the cost of mounts is in the training.
---
If i can throw my hat in the ring. Fellow BC so just going from what I've heard. When people say Raiding is a joke what they mean is that there really aren't "mechanics" as we know today, the mechanics might be sidestep this or dodge that. I'm assuming that's how the whole "don't stand in the fire" joke started, since that was probably core mechanic. I think you will find, as you said in a comment, there will be two thought processes, yes the main groups wont take things like ret/boomy/enhance due to the fact that there are just classes that do more damage. However if you're in a casual raiding guild, who cares, they will tell you to have fun with the game. Plus when I was raiding there was the concept of, one class may do better DPS, but if you know how to play another class better, you personally will do more damage. 
---
TLDR: tryhards wont take certain things, casuals have fun, mechanics are mainly: fire = hot and bad (my guess)
---
Cheaper and I think by 10% each rank. I can't speak for humans but as horde I always had revered just from the regular amount of quests. I didn't have to focus on specific faction to get there.
---
should already have been doing some of the early stonetalon quests but 20s horde is all about weaving between barrens/ashenvale/stonetalon/hillsbrad/thousand needles.  i hit 30 on beta without even touching 1k needles actually but you should be doing it
---
I’m not in the beta, so I can’t really participate, but I entirely endorse it. 
---
I love TB, he will forever have a place in my heart and mind, he completely changed the way I look at games, media and life as a whole.
---
It would be amazingly lovely if the community would come together for a tribute like this, you should post this idea on the forums/the wow subreddit/anywhere else.
---
after sleeping a night on it, naxx was the first raid where the set items made sense for most classes. (mp5 for shamans, spirit for priests and druids, +heal for healers and so on) a big part why random dm/mc gear was viable long term was of the shitty useless stats everything else had, you just needed to know what benefits your class the most
---
we dont actualy need to increase the ilevel of the item, just give it useful stats and set bonis ;)
---
Yeah. You do actually have enough rage for the OCCASIONAL heroic strike in the 20-29 range (at 30 you really change up what you are doing), but It is definitely better to float 20 rage at all times just so that you always have the rage to make sure you get your hamstring/rend/overpowers off, as they are the high impact abilities (don't underestimate hamstring: it not only is a lot of damage mitigation, but it can crit, and therefore, it can proc deep wounds).
---
You're gonna make me resubscribe, aren't you?
---
God dammit.
---
Well yeah. He will do a few hours sleep every day. But i also dont think people will go without sleep at all. The time is expected to be 3.5-4 days to 60. Noone will do that unless they acc share. You can do 2 days easily without sleep. 3 is alreaedy exhausting as fuck. But 4 days, either you practiced that often or take stimulants your Reactions will be at the level of a stone.
---
A massive grind but worth every second of it imo.
---
10% discount for honorable and 10% more for rank 3.
---
17 y/o me had no concept of these things.  It's so great getting all the details.  It would be nice to get a professional documentary made after WoW becomes the "best selling PC game in two separate decades"
---
Here's hoping
---
There are a couple of beers I can't see without thinking of classic because of an old podcast I always used to listen to while grinding.
---
I can level up to 60 in about 6 days of /played time easily, given that I don't go for a warrior or rogue,  mage and hunter makes it even easier. The game is going to be out for more than a few months anyway so no matter how long it'd take it's not really the point. Getting pre raid BiS is a lot faster than leveling. Also in my original post I do state that I'd like to do a raid every now and then with people that are in the same boat. Not frequently but efficiently.
---
Anal \[working Day &amp; Night\] for \[Skills to pay the bills\]
---
he also answered with Stonetalon, Ashenvale and Tarren Mill, plus giving another option if OP wants to take a break from quests, are you not going to acknowledge the three zones he gave since it makes your point moot?
---
Yepp. If there is no carrot, only stick, people tend to leave guild sooner or later.
---
Ah yes. One of the fun classics
---
I'd recommend picking one role for leveling and sticking with it to save respec costs. Balance in vanilla was torture, I would not recommend it; you get Moonkin Form at 40 but you don't even get a lot of the quality of life things that made it somewhat tolerable from later expansions such as Moonkin Frenzy and Typhoon.
---
Wait... there will be aussie servers right?
---
"No, you *WERE* stupid. Now you have Intellect."
---
10% discount off what total number? The mount? So what's the difference in price
---
Honored: 10% discount  
---
Revered/Exalted: **No** discount
---
Rank 3 PVP: 10% discount.
---
Nobody has confirmed either way unfortunately.
---
Do honored and rank 3 PvP stack?
---
What are you talking about? We don't have any evidence for raids one way or another.
---
Oh that's interesting.. 
---
Next test kill mobs solo as much as you can nonstop for 30 mins relative to your level and post how many, and do it with the groups.
---
Could be good to find out the group TTK Vs Solo and what's worth it more
---
Look, I'm not am Asmon fanboy but I do watch his streams sometimes, especially since Beta came out.
---
80% of everything you see and hear from him on the stream is an entertainment persona. You don't know exactly when he switches off that persona until you've watched him for quite some time. The dude is actually pretty darn lucid and well spoken. His followers generally understand his persona and go along with it. 
---
He's like a lesser version of Boogie on YouTube.
---
Asmon can be and generally is harsh, honest, realistic, foolish, funny, sarcastic, quick to judge, caring, just, reasonable and a bit of a dick.
---
Honestly, who isn't? Who isn't a mixture of bad and good? At least he is honest about it. He keeps you on your toes throughout the stream because you never know when he's acting.
---
 Outside of his "work" with streaming, he spends a lot of time takinf care of his old parents who aren't in a good spot.
---
I’m from Aus so can’t help just wanted to say your English is great.
---
Yes, dungeons are an integral part of Classic WoW because they reward you with a lot of experience as well as gear for leveling that isn't accesible through questing.
---
Not only do you need to run dungeons but you have to actualy run them multiple times to make questing as smooth as possible.
---
Otherwise what awaits you is grinding 2-3levels in bad questing greens at least after every 5 levels of questing because you will run out of quests for your level.
---
Neither faction has a smooth questing experience without a lot of dungeons.
---
Trevor, Corey, Tpb guild, let’s go!
---
I’m on edge between paladin and Druid. Both tier 1 sets are easily obtainable and both fill in similar endgame role. Still can’t really decide anyone can  help? I played Druid for 14 or more years since beta really so I kinda know a bit about it :) but paladin has the power of free heals at end game which is insane and 2.5+ cast time on healing touch is also not that fun on Druid if you can snipe heal on pally
---
It wouldn't be true classic if we didn't play with 200+ ping like back in the day
---
Wow, you really seem to be a very kind person. What I meant was that you could have used the search option to see if I am right or wrong, because just because you haven't seen this video getting posted here a lot, doesn't mean it doesn't actually get posted here a lot.
---
You have to be willing to travel around a lot, which really isn't that bad.  STV, Arathi, Desolace, Shimmering Flats, Swamp of Sorrows, and Badlands.  Vanilla makes you see the world which causes it to feel larger.
---
The terminology with attack speed drives me nuts, lmao. I appreciate you clarifying it.
---
Dwarfe priest though
---
We likely won't know until 2 weeks before when we can reserve a name. It seems likely there would be enough pop here for 1 pvp server, but it's ultimately up to Blizzard. More than likely we would be put CR BGs with the yanks anyway.
---
Nobody ever says this though.
---
I second this, this is the one and only true choice when going Dwarf.
---
Is it capped in classic beta?
---
I love this, made me lol.
---
It would be neat if some of the streamers would make this happen.  I know many of them looked up to TotalBiscuit.  So that would be a nice event.
---
You can get pala tier 2 as holy also because only you can use it anyway. Problem is the rep needed for ragy or flasks that will take none zero time given good farm so this 3 months can be optimistic for getting specific loot from raggy
---
Ye, I have heard the same aside from I also heard about people being AFK etc and things still going down....  I guess something else I heard which I do not see addressed is the concept of hybrids bringing more than DPS i.e a Ret Paladin can bring DI which can save a raid etc. 
---
I know in dungeons, that having a spec that can off-heal can be really good, but not sure how much that extends to raiding due to mana concerns.
---
Those 3 zones don't get you through the 20s. Not even close. I also mentioned the 2 zones you can do at 20... if that was a real solution I'd give him props but it isn't.
---
People seems to be divided into 2 parties. One thinking it gives +3% hit, other talking it gives -0,2% for dodge, parry, miss etc. I cant seem to find the definitive answer and its driving me crazy haha. Now I dont know, if I only need +5% hit rating or +8%
---
my reasoning behind priest is primarily that dpsing old content will seem stale and disappointing but healing is always fresh and exciting. after that its the benedicition quest line.
---
As a human warrior is the ww mace better than the axe?
---
! RemindMe 79 days
---
Is that pvp rank 3?
---
Even Shadowcraft looks nice. T3 is pretty lame in comparison. Though that’s not just for rogues.
---
I did it with the help of 2 priests both high 20's, at 31.  It's challenging but it's worth doing ASAP.
---
Your really not helping your argument here. 
---
&gt;Yes, dungeons are an integral part of Classic WoW because they reward you with a lot of experience as well as gear for leveling that isn't accesible through questing.
---
The reason why that experience is integral? Because t huh e questing for horde in that level bracket isn't enough.
---
BRING ME THE BOAR STRETCHER
---
Follow joanas guide
---
Because vanilla runs in batches of ~2.5 frames/second, server-side.
---
Because one BFA character produces more effects, procs, and other bullshit, then an entire vanilla raid.
---
I always thought this was a TBC thing TBH.
---
So am I going to get into raids as a Night Elf Rogue or what?
---
Druid tier 1 is barely wanted by even druids (although just keeping 3 pieces of if for thorns is pretty good). If you roll a restro druid you could probably get half the pieces for the minimum dkp bid
---
Oh no did i exagerate a bit? Newsflash, 100 million crits arent any better. Thats what we were doing in Legion, i havent touched the sorry excuse of a game that is BFA.
---
Anyone else nut after that, no just me?
---
their two
---
*pre-raid-bis.
---
I'm a 2 handed fury dwarf warrior.
---
Oh my!
---
Yes, if it would be a Tauren guild.
---
That wasn't my point. My point was it's still valuable, even if it's been posted often because there are frequent users of the sub who still may not have seen it, case in point me. This sub gets a fair amount of content so it seems obvious.
---
*Tier 1 paladin*
---
wAt tHE AktUaL faK??!
---
So, what you're saying is that if you're a shit healer, and you land your heal ~300 ms after the tank takes fatal damage, your tank lives?
---
In IF sure. but if you’re raiding or pvping in gear for style... lol.
---
I know this is a joke but this illustrates an issue with the overbearing minmaxing; off specs being excluded from all of the content, not just raiding.
---
And no link thx
---
That's not what he's saying. He's saying the abilities are more complex to calculate as the game combat has become more advanced. Abilities can proc other abilities, meaning a calculation needs to happen each time, for each potential proc. He's referencing a DK in the current iteration of the game, not the game a decade ago. Replace DK with any other class and what he is intending to convey still applies.
---
Fury warriors are the clowns of classic.
---
Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, and Thousand Needles can get you to 30 easy
---
I think the green oozes used to drop a slimy bag that container a pet as well, it to had a super rare drop chance. I'm glad you got your answer, my reply just adds a little flayva
---
so Stonetalon ashenvale and Hillsbrad to 25 then thousand needles 25-30
---
I’d be pretty upset after all we’ve come through to get servers on retail we didn’t get 1-3 servers (1 pvp/pve/rp) maybe pvp. We aren’t the biggest region but we get it done none the less
---
No one has seen the raids yet
---
Yeah I even tried to show her t2 paladin but she wasnt going for it.
---
yep 100 %
---
I don't know enough about the game to be sure about that but since wow is all about different classes bringing different things, i think its a high possibility you could be right
---
this guy knows. you only went gnome because you were harder to target.
---
I’ve heard it’s rubbish.
---
Can i get it made off my level 12 human mage? He only has an off hand orb and lesser wand
---
Because vanilla class designs were a lot of good thoughts and not as great results
---
Why do you want to play a ret pally anyway, all you do is auto attack, they have no gameplay
---
a fair loot council will always be best, the trouble is actually finding/having one.
---
The content has become so easy because people don’t play bad specs. Try to clear Naxx with a group full of rets boomies and shamans and suddenly the shit is harder than mythic retail.
---
Pservers launching fresh servers is a thing that has nothing to do with shutdowns.
---
Its fine for you to want more things but it's fine for me not to.
---
It also comes down to the loot. Why would you give a BiS Weapon/Item to an offspec Char if 5 other in there main roll can do so much more with it. Keep in mind, 40 people only 2-3 loots per boss. it will take a while before a carried ret/melee shaman will get his spinal reaper.
---
some specs are okay since they give unique buffs or for example ret/shaman with a Nightfall for the + Spelldamage Proc (even though a melee hunter gets the debuff more often) but you probably just gona take 1 in a raid and you have to make it attractive for everyone in the raid.
---
a lot of problems come with envy and effort. for example as a healer it is not fun to grind mobs for money/whatever you needed to respec to some dps spec same for tanks. if you dedicate your time and money to the good of the raid and some pseudo dps class wants to take your loot so he can halfass a raid and be top on pvp/farming people start to wonder why and you better give them a solid reason or raid drama will happen
---
The average classic player will be better than the average vanilla player was. If you're comparing classic to BfA players, I don't think that really entered the equation for this thread, it's not really relevant.
---
SoR doesn't have the best scaling with spell power. So generally not worth it as the damage increase isn't great. (But not to be underestimated). However it does scale with 1 hand specialisation. So if your picking that up can be tasty
---
Nope fruit vendor in IF
---
It's a poor "solution". It turns off glow completely.
---
In Vanilla the glow was more subtle. I like the the glow.  I just don't like the overpowered glow in Classic.
---
They should fix it. But I'm sure they won't. :(
---
&gt; don't have to min-max your schooling or career choices 
---
That misses the point, since career choice is often considered and/or influenced by interests (along other variables). The equivalence in-game would be the fun factor, something pure minmaxers ignore completely.
---
With a lot of grinding mobs that's true.
---
Yes we don't have to see the raids to know about them. Blizzard has released information about them. Blue posts ftw.
---
nah, just honored and PvP rank 3. (total of 20% discount).
---
Rep giving additional discounts wasn't a thing until 2.3 TBC, since they'd removed PvP ranks and you couldn't get the other 10%, so to compensate they changed it so that rep gives 5% per level starting at friendly.
---
Keep an eye out for twink gear and hold onto it for when everyone is leveling thier alts.
---
Pserver raids are a lot harder than they will be in Classic. Pservers don’t have the correct values so they play it safe by over-tuning everything. Private server players are very dedication so they can appreciate the increased raid difficulty.
---
Getting furor after 30% catspeed is preferable I think, that 40 free energy when you shift is huge for overall speed
---
I've always thought that if it wasn't for the arena zone/raid and those terrible jousting dailies that Wrath would be put on the same shelf as vanilla/TBC.
---
Ulduar was 100% one of the best raids ever put together.
---
Random Google search landed me here! May I ask what you called your priest? I played a warlock in Insomnia back then, named Hex.
---
This is not a solution. It just turns glow off completely.
---
In Vanilla the glow was more subtle. I like the glow. Just not the overpowered one in Classic.
---
The drop-down option to select stress test server is gone but the game files haven't been uninstalled.
---
maybe, I personally don't remember that time that well since i was only like 12 lol and i started in BC. So definitely not trying to say you're incorrect or anything. Just thought id throw my two cents in that's all. Besides I'd take your word over mine cause i feel like ill need all the help i can get come classic
---
I would say that Asmon is like George Carlin; however, George Carlin was funny and actually had a point that he always trying to convey, Asmon is an arrogant whiney bitch.
---
It's not totally necessary. But the dmg reduction is fantastic for aoe farming, and the extra holy dmg works in block works so well with your kit, especially when you don't have holy shield. However, not having sanc lets you tank with wisdom or kings which come with their own advantages and holy shock gives you that extra snap threat so it's more a case of practice to figure what works.
---
As long as you pick up redoubt, imp righteous fury and shield specialisation you have your core tanking abilities. It just them comes down to tanking style and how effective you want to be. I personally prefer a more holy weighted build if in piping and more prot based if I'm pveing.
---
I have the exact same days off. I wanted more but unfortunately everyone else had booked from the 6th onwards. Must be some regular human thing going on.
---
Brody is the homie 🖤🤘🏻
---
Yeah, and your point was presumably that, especially as a hunter, good-looking gear would not come eventually if you're good, which is simply not the case since our tier sets are also BIS for the most part.
---
Retail is a different game for a different playerbase. We're getting classic for the classic playerbase.
---
so the only place I know of that's tracking this is https://barrens.chat/realms.php and that page confirms what you're asking
---
Looking at the private server populations most have 25% warriors which is insane, still viable to tank or go fury/off-tank in that case?
---
Like as someone whose tanking experience is limited to druid in WotLK and TBC assuming I start from day 1 and maybe say 4 hours a day am I smoking a crack pipe thinking I could play prot tank and arms pvp in a guild?
---
If you go above and beyond, you'll still be doing 50-60% of the damage of a warrior or rogue that's using an average amount of consumables. 
---
Your best bet is to try to become a guild's Nightfall guy. Especially if you're willing to put a lot of work in. Plenty of more casual guilds are less likely to care as well (pallies have great utility beyond just damage). 
---
You'll have a hard time clearing AQ40/Naxx as a ret, but you could definitely raid as it. 
---
Just a heads up though, the gameplay is primarily auto attacks with the occasional judgement.
---
Still looks good, still happy.
---
This just feels like salt on the wound now
---
Just pop viper sting on things people are fighting as you run by.
---
 [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=28873&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45169](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=28873&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45169)  A whooping 292 DPS by Esfand with Might of Menethil.
---
Give or take 20% for actual vanilla and paladins will remain really, really bad. The rolling ignite mage is at 900DPS and the highest warrior is still at 787DPS.
---
I know its better, im asking if arms is acceptable. I dont like the idea of spending 50g every time I want to run MC
---
!RemindMe 79 Days
---
But there are retail servers and both versions are running off of the same infrastructure, so it would be more than likely there will be at least one. Unless Blizzard thinks that there isn't enough interest in the OCE region to exclude a Classic option for said region. Which I don't see happening.
---
 [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=28873&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45169](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=28873&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45169)  I replied to him too, but I dont mind spamming the baddiness of rets. 292DPS for the ret LOL
---
yeah same here, just noticed
---
i mean you're welcome to try and discredit the numbers on private servers but the truth is that the vast majority of the incorrect values on almost all popular cores aren't character related at all. player stats and abilities were quite well documented compared to most other things in early wow's history. they might not be to the decimal but it's a reasonably good representation of how classes compare to each other.   
---
the reason things were this way is because classes were just supposed to be classes in vanilla. there was no "i'm a DPS paladin" kind of thing yet. that happened later as the game developed and the community came to a better understanding of the systems in place (and the devs made changes to make things more playable, eg enh shams and ret palas.) yes, there were hybrid classes and some were viable in PVP but the fact of the matter is that if hybrid classes could do more damage than the true DPS classes, it would create a massive imbalance in what players actually chose to play.   
---
i'm not really for or against any of this btw. my fav class balance was in tbc/wotlk.  
---
(yes, there are exceptions, like feral druid can actually do reasonable DPS numbers by using crowd pummeller, a head piece and power shifting. ret paladin can actually do okay numbers in some fights in naxx, etc.)
---
U got beta access just now? Did they send out new waves
---
Sequisha.
---
Not only the best moustache on twitch, but chill and knowledgeable - tends to stream for a long time too.
---
Very much worth a watch
---
Yeah, even if OCE server comes I've been considering playing a populated NA as I am worried OCE population won't sustain over a period of time haha
---
Feralas imo. Mulgore 2nd. My 3rd choice is among the most hated zones in the game and so opposite of the first 2 I question myself for liking it so much.
---
There's probably like 1 ally for every 5 -6 Horde
---
Wotf and Stun resist is so much fucking stronk it's not even funny
---
Same here, I was invited only for the stress test. I'm assuming stress testers are probably the only one's effected.
---
(Shrug). If exploring and also beating every random encounter to death is core to your enjoyment, I can see why it wasn't for you.
---
T3 warlock seems like an alchemist set if they were a class. T2 is peak class fantasy for ‘locks imo.
---
When it was announced last year or whatever.. 85% of the time we needed to wait has gone by.
---
be bad like me!
---
-you
---
That was awesome
---
I'd really like to see that blue post you're talking about, I must have missed it
---
It's a tough call and honestly I don't think you can go wrong either way. 
---
WW Axe has a higher top end (more damage from MS/WW/jousting) and gives 5% crit from axe spec while the mace will give you a higher average damage (reduced glancing blow penalty due to wep skill) and stuns when spec'd into it.
---
I, personally, would take the WW axe if i was leveling solo for the better performance when jousting, but would take the mace is duo leveling.
---
What would this sub be if we didn't have this compulsion to shit talk retail?
---
I remember someone at Blizzard mentioned the major server zones at some point, and mentioned them as if there's more than US and EU, so it's pretty safe to assume that there will be Oceanic servers
---
Unfortunately I have extensive experience in it. Not only have I done the climb about a dozen times but I looked into the best strategies. They all involve grinding or dungeon runs. Its largely because ashenvale and stone talon only have a handful of quests for 22-24.
---
Yes. But you had to level it up to your level, which in Vanilla was a very long process especially if the level difference was so large you couldnt take it into dungeons because the pet would pull everything in sight
---
Back in Vanilla they heavily utilized a concept referred to as the "hybrid tax". It essentially meant if a class was capable of healing and dealing damage, their damage specs would be subpar compared to the "pure" damage classes. 
---
When Burning Crusade launched, they really loosened up on the concept and just about every spec found a niche within the game. 
---
That's not to say damage specs for hybrids are completely useless - shadow priests and elemental shamans, for example, are brutal in pvp and feral druids can make excellent off tanks. 
---
Ret Paladins specifically are a bit of a problem area. In pve they fall far behind the pack due to the hybrid tax.
---
In pvp they're viable; not nearly as strong as holy paladins are and still fall behind vs similarly geared enemies, but still viable. A main benefit you gain is that if you raid at all you'll outgear a large portion of your enemies anyway. 
---
All that said, there's few things more iconic than a ret paladin rocking judgement armor and sulfuras in a BG. Strongest person there? Probably not. Coolest? You're goddamn right.
---
Kungen was 1000% using thunderfury because of its threat gen
---
Druid priest and Mage.... but which one first?
---
(warlock too)(ugh ill never choose in time)
---
 Looking at the private server populations most have 25% warriors which is insane, still viable to tank or go fury/off-tank in that case?
---
or should I go for DPS or heals?
---
I don't mind healing or dps or tanking but I want to kill stuff in PvP so im looking at warrior (Prot/Arms), Rogue, Warlock, or Priest (Spriest/holy). Im thinking not priest because at most theres one Spriest slot and Im guessing id get low priority on the gear Id need for Spriest pvp. Mage is also a maybe I suppose since I've never leveled 1 past 30 but I like lock ascetic better.
---
I alrdy rolled one lock and although I enjoyed it im worried about getting raid slots/gear. I thought warrior would be the ticket until I saw the private server stats...
---
MC will be cleared within 1-2 weeks of release this time around, you will see :)
---
That's a common misconception. They overturned some aspects but it turns out the fights overall were undertuned. They did the best they could but it didn't end up the way they intended.
---
I'm married and have 2 kids. I also work 3rd shift, 11pm-7am, at a 911 center.  5 days on 2 days off then 5 on - 3 off.  My weekends end up being during the week a lot, and during the school year I keep my 3rd shift schedule through days off (way less stress on my body).  
---
I'm pretty happy about when Classic is being released because those kids of mine will be starting school back up soon after so I can play all night!
---
Also, wife is having flashbacks of the first time I played Classic and is already on my case.  But I was in the Army then so I could never hold a spot in a raiding guild with all the time in the field.  Things will be different this time.
---
What is jousting?
---
Just listing one feels like a disservice to how beautiful the world is, so here's a top 10 :)
---
1) Loch Modan
---
2) The Hinterlands
---
3) Mulgore
---
4) Dun Morough
---
5) Stranglethorn Vale
---
6) Ferelas
---
7) Winterspring
---
8) Elwynn Forest
---
9) Un'Goro Crater
---
10) Ashenvale
---

You'll be scavenging for bag space just vendor them.

50 DKP minus

People don't want to come home from a day of work and instantly jump into classic release, especially if they plan on staying up all night.
---
Average worker ends work around 5pm EST.  Classic launches at 6pm EST.  That's one hour to drive home, get situated, etc.  Not enough time.
---
You don't bump on reddit
---
Your big limitation on swapping back and forth is going to be respec costs. IIRC it caps out at 50g, but you're going to go broke super quick doing that 1-2 times a week. Depending on how seriously you're PvEing, you could do some light tanking as Arms.

BLIZZARD NEEDS TO MAKE THE SERVERS LAG LIKE WE USED TO

BLIZZARD NEEDS TO SHUT DOWN WOWHEAD BECAUSE THOTTBOT'S UNRELIABLE INFO WAS ALL WE HAD

BLIZZARD NEEDS TO WIPE OUR MEMORIES BECAUSE OUR PRIOR INFORMATION IS CHANGING THE GAME
---
Same. I assume we'll have to wait and see what happens - next stress test is around the 19th of June. The 29th was just a bonus one. I assume they got the data they needed out of the first round and they don't want to keep people hopeful and daily logging in multiple times just in case... Like I did xD
---
Maybe you could elaborate as to why this is such a stupid idea?
---
int does improve something ....
---
Ya, you'll be more valuable DPS wise as a fury warrior.
---
Yeah, but wearing Hunter tier is the punishment itself.
---
Does it have a hidden BTC miner??
---
The first album of the Kaiser Chiefs; “Employment”. Without failure reminds me of leveling in Westfall.
---
God tier healers end game. Leveling isn't terrible with wand spec but it isn't the most fun. Hardly any downtime though.
---
TBC is where it's at for me. Warlock T5 best set ever.
---
This is gonna get buried because I am way too late but I'll just say this. When you start out your wow adventure you have every opportunity to do anything you want in this game. But depending on what choices you make, that pool of opportunities will shrink. If you wanna raid as a certain spec that is absolutely fine, but as you make that decision now 200 guilds have closed their door to you. If  you dont want to min max that is also fine, but now another 200 guilds have closed their doors for you.(numbers pulled out of my ass)
---
When you make these decisions you have to be okay with the outcome and not fault these guilds/players for setting their standards of how they want to play the game. Seek out players that  share your vision of how to play the game and have fun. In the end we're all playing to have fun, we just have different thrills.
---
Yes, its gone.
---
I pretty much took the exact same picture.
---
30-40 from my experience is everyone I dragged to played on pserver died as well. It's when leveling slow to a crawl and quests are too spread out, meaning a ton of endless grinding of mobs just to fill up levels
---
My guess would be hamstring kitting between your weapon swings.
---
BC raids and some into wrath were *really* the peak of Warcraft.
---
It was easy to miss. It was about parry/dodge chance. Basically bosses on private servers did a lot less damage and took a lot more damage than in vanilla. You pair that with the armor reduction stacking being wrong and you have very inflated damage numbers.
---
ya, weapon skill is amazingly OP and there are plenty of ways to get FR for Naxx.
---
So I'm going warlock and have understood that Felheart and even Nemesis ain't the best armor sets. Still, I have always wanted a fully T1, followed by a fully T2 geared warlock, and I dont want to ruin that by exchanging the robes for some random blue vest that drops in Dire Maul or whatever. I want to have the full tier sets and I don't care whether its BiS or not...anyone else thinking like this?

T3 Rogue is also incredibly badass...

---
No problem, the one thing about Classic is a lot of people will have a better understanding of how the raids and mechanics work which will make pugging easier and more successful. You probably wont clear or even see Naxx as a pug but I don't think BwL-AQ40 is out of the realm of possibility.
---
I always get mount at around 40-41.
---
&gt;  a great opportunity to revitalise a great game and it comes with a wonderful opportunity to maybe do something a little different.
---
except the people that design are on BFA and we saw how shitty that is.
---
Ya, its especially disappointing for warlocks imo. The first 2 sets look great then you have tier 3 at best boring and at worst ugly. But guess what? Until tier 3 your stuck with an ugly ass crafted vest if you wan to have bis.
---
I am American, I work the afternoon shift the 26th and will be off by 5pm local
---
its how the forsaken recruit new warriors
---
For me, I was 10 in classic. Obviously had plenty of free time. Played all the way to classic through cata, and as much as I could for MOP on because I joined the military and grew up. 
---
For me I’m mixed. I want to play classic as much as possible, want to experience the raids, but I absolutely don’t want to rush. So I’ll be a bit of a hybrid. Maybe a tad faster with the first room. Then slow it down.
---
AQ release was like launch all over again. Servers crashed a lot and everything was crap.
---
No idea... I have not seen or heard any of them for 13 years!
---
Itll be enough for me, my drive home is 5 minutes and that'll give me 55 minutes to get in pajamas, have a meal, and then stare at my screen in anticipation for 40 minutes
---
You would rather take lower stam cloth gear into pvp than T2?  I can see the rogues and warriors on the other team salivating now...
---
Nightfall is not gonna be available on launch I'm pretty sure. Yet back to your question: Anything is possible, there's gonna be kitty druids, ret paladins and who knows what raiding. It's however going to be really difficult getting in if you're looking for a very good and dedicated guild.
---
From what I've been told axe tanking weapons arent really that common so troll is actually the best threat generation with beserking on bosses.
---
Prolly not what u wanted to hear lol. Maybe a female troll could be tolerable? I hate looking like a chimp with back problems.
---
One of the most fun activities in vanilla.

See a gazelle family, run over there, plant a fire nova totem ahead and try to gauge the right distance so it goes off when they walk by.

I will be off at 5pm actually, I bartend the Monday afternoon which is mostly regulars and keno players. Night shift bartender gets in at 5pm and its slow around that time so I'll be out at 5:03 at the latest
---
Even if it is Legolass?
---
Ok but on which realm
---
Unfortunately those are the few things that try to help counteract the allies huge advantage built into the game. Glad to see the horde getting some appreciation finally.
---
Honored is a 10% discount on any NPC purchase with that faction (including training for profs and skills). The only exception is bank bag slots and respec.
---
Not 100% positive but believe rank 3 is 10% off every NPC purchase except bank bag slots and respec.
---
Yeah if it didnt have the story, no one would play it. (and the porn).
---
No one at my work plays wow and the manager who approves my time off loves me, no competition. They also take into account who asked first and they get priority
---
A lot of classes T1/2 sets look better than T3. Mage/Shaman/Warrior doesn't look bad in T3, but that's about it, imo. I will say, a lot more work and textures were put on all of the T3 sets minus maybe Hunter and Paladin though. They definitely tried to make them look the best, I just think they match the class themes the other two had previously laid out much worse and that is why I don't like them.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I can only presume levelling with someone else would speed up levelling :)
---
Soon everyone will accept the Horde's superiority
---
DW fury will be optimal over 2h. 2h fury, while a thing, just doesn't quite keep up.

Some people value themes over objectively higher textures. Obviously, the most work was put into all the T3, at least texture-wise, but it doesn't feel like Druid at all. Same with all the other classes. Better textures, worse thematically.
---
You must really have love that fuckin’ bear
---
I'll be home before launch, beating it by just enough. It's a chill day at work so I'll have a few red bulls on hand and be ready to go all night
---
Well classic is rolling with 10g training and 90g mount. So you'd get 1g off training and 9 g's off mount at honored. Exalted gives nothing but the ability to purchase that factions mount if you aren't already that faction, oh and bragging rights.

It was 1.0. The only reason hunter's tamed him, to fuck with casters.

serious question: why are you censoring "shit" on the internet?

Warriors are the best tank. Most guilds will run only warrior tanks.
---
Look forward to seeing everyone there
---
Same here took 2 weeks off starting on the 27th. Boss was like, sure bro do your thing
---
Hybrid DPS doesn't exist in raiding vanilla WoW.  There was a hybrid tax philosophy back then basically saying that pure dps classes (only dps offspecs - Mages, rogues, hunters, locks) had to deal more damage because they lacked versatility.  
---
The only hybrid dps you'll see in a raid usually are basically classes that grant auras (boomkin for spell crit/feral for melee crit) or ones that provide strong debuffs (shadowpriest 15% shadowdamage buff).  And there's usually only one of them.  Hybrids all heal otherwise.  These classes deal roughly 1/2 the damage of the other dps, but provide buffs that make their dps worthwhile (just on someone else's meter).
---
Warrior was the only class that got past the hybrid tax on their class, and that's why they are the only hybrid DPS.
---
Oh no doubt. Healers are the ultimate duo leveler. They make any class they level with better, but a Warrior/Priest combo is the best. You can do any dungeon because you just need 3 dps and Warriors are amazing when they have no downtime.
---
Loch Modan is certainly a good contender, especially before the Cataclysm!
---
First time around, I spent about 10k hours Vanilla-WotLK, so I guess it’s category 6, if I get past step 2, that is.
---
Ok cool. I watch soda because I've been watching him for years now and I like his personality on stream and I think he's a nice person. I enjoy his content and I absolutely love how happy he is since the beta started. Haven't seen him this happy in ages. Which makes me happy too. Seeing beta content is just a bonus at this point but it really does get me your up more. Now tell me where I'm wrong
---
Oh well. Thanks for answer, I think at the end of the day, I will try and see what reactions I will get
---
I notice a common phrase of people meme specs is that they want to raid in what spec they find fun.  Something everyone should remember is that a raid consists of 39 other guildies and sometimes you have to put the team before yourself.  However, that doesn't mean you can't do both.  The best way you can earn that enhancement spot/ret spot is too show you're a great guy to raid with.  Being consistent, always showing up on time, and being fully consumed is gold to you raid leaders eyes.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'll use my old guild as an example of this.  We had a shaman that had all the above positive traits so he was allowed to raid as enhance.  However, he understood that sometimes he had to do what was best for the team and during bosses we struggled on he would equip T1 (healing gear) and offheal.  It was a win-win for both the raid and him.
---
Naxx is out??
---
No all heroes wear capes
---
Yeah I understand the cynicism but if they are going back to classic and using that as a structure to eventually introduce new CONTENT W within classic, then hopefully it should prevent anything like BFA from happening. After all people are playing classic for classic style gameplay not BFA.
---
I love STV. Every time I tell myself I am going to avoid it, I don't because there is soo much beauty in it. I also have a weird thing for Duskwood.
---
Untrue
---
Blessing of salvation and human weapon racials are huge. I played a 2h fury slam warrior on alliance side on pserver and would only lose to likewise skilled DW fury warriors and the best of our rogues.
---
But it all depends and I was always competitive basically and got to have a much easier time with weapon drops
---
If I want to level arms is it viable to go 5 into cruelty first before going down arms tree? Respecing at 40 for MS of course though
---
Covered by all the holy paladins
---
That's awesome dude. I just saw 'awaiting approval' and thought 'Oh shit... That could go wrong.' lol
---
oh fun, thank you
---
Tier 1: Hunters
---
Tier 2: Shamans 
---
Tier 3: Warriors
---
I know this is an opinion but my mind is unchanging on that order!!! Either way all the sets in vanilla look really great and truly showed the originality in the art department, they relied on concepts and design instead of high resolution and tiny details like the current tier sets we have in retail

Can't you just /e and type what you want them to see?  No speech bubble though, I suppose.
---
Okay man have it your way, OP requested a scenery change and got it. You cannot get to 60 by quests alone, regardless of level bracket. Every faction has a gap about every 5 levels if you're doing only quests. You either do a lot of dungeons between questing or you're grinding every few levels.
---
I plan to stealth nearby and watch
---
What is the addon called?
---
I think the only real question is how important class fantasy is to you. Human is the best racial pick hands down as a tank. Their bonus is equivalent to 3 more hit, and if you're running with zero other wep skill (which is common for a tank) it will increase your average white damage vs bosses by some 30-40 percent. When you start spamming heroic strikes it matter less, but it's still worth 3% hit. In terms of racials the only option you could defend to ever be equivalent for alliance is night elf due to the 1% dodge, although most experienced tanks would still choose human without a doubt. This becomes even more clear when you consider the fact that you need to itemize for hit (it's vital!), And a human would be able to sacrifice 3% hit to gain way more than 1% dodge.
---
Back your question about your spec. This is the one I would advice for you for the first tiers of raiding:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0bZVZEizseMzVo
---
Now you could drop improved revenge for either more tactical mastery or imp shield wall, but in 5 man's this spec is a Godsend and it doesn't hold you back much at all in raids. When you get better gear (AQ40 or tps gear from BWL) I would advice going for a tps build with impale though.
---
Why so toxic in this post wtf? Where is the Supi dupi classic community everyone talks about? I find this quote to be quite fitting.
---
Yes because everyone uses this feature in retail /s
---
I would never use it. Unless you're in a raid or pre made pvp there is no need for quick calls and typing is good enough. And for raids and pvp people will not stop using discord anyway
---
Tipsout was just testing taunting pets in a duel a few days ago and it didn't work.  The pet was on passive though.  Does it work when the pet is in defensive or aggressive mode?  Is it a bug that it doesn't work in passive?

When I roll classic I plan on playing with full tier sets regardless of class. Just not worth playing if I hate my characters design when I’m supposed to be at my most powerful form. I’d rather suck and look awesome tbh
---
The greatest challenge ever conquered by cow person. A true hero
---
All of that adds up, but Vanilla bosses and M'uru in TBC are unparalleled in terms of difficulty.
---
&gt; boomkin

wat

The hunter dead zoning was the best thing, other than that not really that impressive. I mean he would probably be a good commentator but there is nothing to commentzte in classic haha
---
Tukui classic, same thing basically
---
Who? Most streamers will go pvp i think. Asmon and crew will go pvp, guzu surely too. Its mire content in the end vit yeah pvp might suck for some. Asmon stated that continued harassment will be punished with temp bans anyway. And losing a day of playtime sucks in vanilla.
---
You can polish a turd all you want, at the end of the day it's still SHIT.
---
I would not mind healing but I also want to dps and pvp. I refuse to play a plate class, and im alliance
---
In general you should be fine, but it's always prudent to let your competition know you're rolling as dps before you start.
---
Sounds like casual talk to me!
---
Exactly. That is the best guide without dungeons and it can't even get you to 30 on quests alone.
---
People used them sometimes in AQ to buff up the fire mage group to keep the ignite rolling.  It wasn't good, but it helped mages.
---
2. Test was Test 1,5 ;)
---
Maybe if they stopped giving us passives that play the game for you and actual situational abilities that we choose to use then maybe they could less shards? Seems like win for us.
---
Mage s2 and mage t6 soo good, also warrior s3
---
Yes. There are people who are dedicated making ret work in pvp and are working on a build for it to maximize dps for all phases.
---
Everyone here is saying ret was never a thing in vanilla and they are right. However, not everyone was as bright back in the day and there was not a single paladin running MCP spellpower builds, for example. Right now it actually shows promise.
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-phase-1-new-meta
---
You'd be surprised what they can pull off in classic with this as it is shown the max they can pull off is about 1.6+ dps with bis gear and full buffs. However, I do not recommend it, as the consumable amount you need is out of this world, and vanilla combat is not supposed to be interesting and dynamic. You really won't miss anything significant, gameplay wise for pve, if you run holy.
---
Exactly that's just how vanilla is and the horde in particular. That bracket is ghoulish but it's how the game was designed.
---
So, speaking to WoW player/vets of the game, is it worth getting into vanilla wow as someone who has never played?
---
!remindMe 79 days
---
100% yes
---
Classic won’t be enough to swap to full time for most people. After the grind to 60 you can reduce your play time to a few hours a week.
---
Too bad the stats are trash. Nice for rp doe.
---
Hi, is it cool not having Deviance in prot tree? I read, that its a pretty important talent for holding aggro

You guys should roll PVE. Sound like a bunch of babies.

So my personal data is from TBC, but I got my draenei priest a darnassus saber at 40
---
People working on a rotation on oil fields usually have very little free time when they work.
---
It's even gone from my account page. Rest In Power.
---
You might not be MT but there will be pleny of guilds looking for warriors willing to tank. Damn my Druid lust.
---
I'll let you in on a secret. Unless you want to be in a hardcore guild, you can raid as what you like. There will be many guilds that will just need people and will happily take a Ret Paladin or Boomkin.
---
Also, don't forget that raiding is only a small part of the game.
---
Horde has always contained the more "hardcore" players. Look at the raid world first lists. So it's no surprise the beta server is more horde heavy.
---
sorry for being uninformed, but what is a reck bomb?
---
I approve of this. Having to fire up the client and log in just to double check for full beta access was annoying. I'm sure everyone will get it back for the next stress test.
---
The axe is still mathematically the best according to a Monkeynews guide some 6+ months ago.
---
Heads up: children under 1 years of age should have zero screen time according to WHO.
---
I love Duskwood as well, it's super moody and atmospheric - hell, Deadwind Pass is actually one of my favourite zones. But they're not really what I would personally consider pretty or beautiful (which the OP asked for), hence their exclusion from the list.
---
meh
---
Paladins are trash dps, it’s not a joke or a meme. There is a reason “LolRet” exists.
---
Oh I just meant she's gonna chill with me in my office lmao not gonna make her sit with me and watch me white swing shit to death lol
---
haha trust me ill be mulling over this decision for weeks to come
---
But i just told you this 1-60 pace doesn't make sense. 
---
And what does 1-60 like pace means? 
---
You want it to take weeks/months to get to the maximum level every expansion? No one would wanna do that everytime, the game would have lost far more many subs by now. With only 5-10 new levels, and 6-8 zones it wouldn't even make sense. Also making a zone takes much more time than leveling through it, so just adding more/larger zones is out of the question. 
---
Leveling could be more social interactive for sure, but people don't wanna socialize while leveling anymore, they just want to get to the max lvl asap and do raids/pvp.
---
Even now youtube is full of classic leveling guides, to get you lvl 60 asap, and people will try to get lvl 60 asap, skipping dungeons, group quests, quests that make you travel around the world. Sure people who just wanna be casuals and/or don't have time or just don't want to raid will just chill through the levels, but that's gonna be the minority.
---
This 1-60 stuff just doesn't make sense, and it's not the main issue with leveling/catching up.
---
That doesn't work. 
---
If you make your own emote it just says something like 
---
"Character makes strange gestures at you"
---
Yea i gotta put stranglethorn at my #1. I usually stay around lvl 35ish for awhile for the open world pvp.
---
&gt;allies huge advantage
---
 advantage in what exactly?  Every side has advantages in different ways.
---
No. Theoretically warriors are not the best wielder of nightfall. Caster DPS also being comparatively garbage until AQ40...
---
Because the information is already there
---
i honestly could care less about this guy. everyone makes mistakes but I mean he wished cancer on people and cried about trump winning like it was the end of the world. kind of shows deep down he was a simpleton. even if you hate trump, acting like he is the doombringer of the world really shows lack of critical thinking.
---
But remember that there is no honor system in phase 1, you will likely be 60 before honor comes.
---
The only ones that can answer that question is your guild. Off course many guild aren't going to care, although I would think the majority of raid dedicated guilds would.
---
If it’s red it’s dead, no exceptions.
---
Asked my gf to pick 1 from each row. She picked T1 druid, T2 rogue and also surprisingly T3 druid.
---
Hm, I had no idea that's what that meant. But it makes sense. So the /e only works for same faction then, I suppose.
---
Just run at lvl 1 imo
---
I ran from orc starting zone to UD starting zone 2 times, and one time the other way during the stress test, and only died by jumping off zeppelins. It only takes about 15 mins, and you get half a lvl of xp for running at lvl 1. Nots not like you run faster at lvl 5, so I would just run at lvl 1
---
The difference is only around 1k rep I think, so either way it’s no big deal
---
Definitely recommend the advice on an alt. If someone is that hellbent on ganking, switching characters will avoid a headache. That or just taking a 15min break to stand up, grab some water, walk the dog, show affection to avoid spouse aggro, etc.
---
Yeah, my stress test access is gone.
---
Judgement Armor Master Race
---
Easier access to most raids. Better designed questing zones. Stronger pve hybrid. Dont get me started on AV. That's just off the top of my head at 4am.
---
Bro I took 2 days off, relax. 
---
Also turns out my new girlfriend was born on August 26th. Fuck.
---
The new bluepost regarding 14% boss parry might change the dualwield tank Meta, but we'll see.
---
Because it's not a question of could you clear the raid with boomkins and rets because you could but how much time will you spend clearing it
---
I know, alot of my family and friends work on rigs, I'm in oil and gas myself. There is time but not alot as you say. Helps you scratch that itch though.
---
It's highly outdated
---
God no. It's all by server. You'll never see someone from another sever in your game unless it's a BG
---
Priest tier is the 1 thing keeping me from rolling priest. It was boring in vanilla, yet awesome in TBC.
---
i think a lot of these people who want tbc, wrath, etc just look for classic as a nostalgia trip - classic was not made for these people (because the game radically changes from each expansion, targetting different demographies of players).
---
then there are those who just favor tbc because tbc basically resolved all the problems with classic such as the class balance rework. but, tbc was also the first time that the game shrunk in size. we went from this huge world that took 10 years to create, into this tiny little world where open world content was mostly dead due to flying mounts and linear quest design and there just not being enough content to keep you active. tbc was great for existing mechanics such as for the class balance, extended pvp such as arena introduction and more bgs, dungeon structure, and raids. tbc was not good for the world content which is one of the main things that pulls you into vanilla.
---
then we have these pserver players who just want the vanilla experience to reset and start leveling from the beginning over and over again. this is fine, but it's not the game i want.
---
because here is where i am. i am the type of player who hate the leveling experience, i loved the rewarding feeling of hitting 60. but once you hit 60, that was it for me. i didn't want to level to 70. i didn't want to make a new character. i wanted to have that task DONE. it's enjoyable for me to do once, but not on repeat. after 60, i wanted content that challenges me and let me progress horizontally. go on adventures in dungeons, join epic raids, world pvp, pvp. work extremely hard to get my gear (i ran over 250 ubrs runs and 200 scholomance runs just for one fucking item that never dropped); because that was it with vanilla, you just did it once, you worked hard as fuck, and once you achieved what you wanted, it felt good. because it was over. you enjoyed your journey there, but it's not something you want to repeat. and that is my grief with expansions. every expansion resets stats, armors, and items. and you have to start from zero basically. everything you worked so hard to achieve is gone. just gone. holds no more meaning. the same would happen if they reset classic periodically. all hard work gone in the blink of an eye. all effort for naught.
---
i think of this as a guild wars analogy. the original guild wars was really good. and each "expansion" added a new storyline, new mechanics, new content, new classes, new maps. but it never removed the value of the original content. expansions never completely changed the game. and everything remained relevant. but then came guild wars 2. guild wars 2 was like a wow expansion. now you had to start from the beginning, and it was a huge and radical change to the game. and people can say "just go back to guild wars 1", but the game is dead, there is no point in playing guild wars 1 when there won't be any updates and there are barely any players left, the continuation lives in guild wars 2 and that's where you have to play. i think the same goes for classic, adding tbc etc will just ruin it, and people say "just keep your character in classic then, don't transfer to a tbc server", but then i'd face the same problem, no more content after naxx, players leaving because the game is not going to be updated ever, and it dies.
---
so yes. i think adding new content to classic is the wise choice for longevity of the game. just the way both runescape and dofus did their "classic". i am sure there are thousands upon thousands of people like me. while anecdotal, every person i know feels the same way about classic as i do and just want more classic content not a reset or going into tbc. so from my sample size, the only part of the wow community who always resist this, is r/classicwow.

I picked it somewhat arbitrarily because I went to set up addons before release.
---
 !RemindMe 1 day
---
dat ui....
---
If she said tier 1 druid, tier 2 paladin, tier 3 hunter, I could get behind it. Tier 1 warrior will always be awesome ... tier 2, not so much.
---
You might still, might just be hidden until next stress test comes close , im sure a lot of people open it regularly to see if they got the normal beta
---
Oh, seeing anal in chat again. Beautiful.
---
I see! Good luck with the baby. Just don't be too disappointed if your free time will be a lot less than expected lol. I'm on parental leave when classic releases, but I only expect to be able to play during naps and at night.
---
Missing the WSG buff and then pom pyro a warrior in zerker stance with recklessness on. You can literally 1 shot a warrior no crit lol!
---
I think what isn't a joke is how difficult it is to field 40 competent players. Now you don't even need that to complete some of the earlier raids but it will be more difficult in the later raids.
---
Jeffery has some of the most chill streams, he has a great personality and is soo interactive with chat.
---
Nah they’re not ”worthy of my attention”. I watch all the same streamers that are being recommended in this thread but I’m not being smug about it on my high horse with my fellow superior internet friends.
---
Yeah, it'll be there. It sadly doesn't have any noteworthy qualities as a hunter pet though, as AFAIK it has no special traits, and isn't a unique skin/model. It isn't even useful for Bite training.
---
Apparently in the original WoW Beta before release, Hunter pets didn't have normalised size, and the Sewer Beast has the distinction of being the largest possible pet in the game, which was pretty amazing. Unfortunately, this was short lived and didn't even make it into the original release. Too many people complained about pets being too big.
---
TBC without the Outlands and lvl 70 (ghostland etc is still great), and i'm on board!
---
no, it's pve rank 3.
---
If all you're doing in vanilla is raiding, sure, but in that case you might as well stick to retail.
---
idk how ppl can afford to play wow classic when they are 10 y.o.   where do you get the pc/ money for sub?  
---
back then i didnt even had internet :D and i had to pay it for myself.  kinda jealous
---
Warlock or hunter is by far the best "beginner" friendly class.
---
10% off from 100g total at 40 and 10% off from 1000g at 60.
---
for a warrior its not the speed, its the 10 points we cant get without it.
---
I like the look on T3, but T2 is absolutely gorgeous and still my all-time favourite.
---
Not as a warrior lol
---
60+ hours a week? wasting your life away dude... unless this is a job of passion i really hope you make it out of that shit
---
MS might be fine in MC and BWL, depending on the wishes of your guild, but once the mages start going fire you want to minimise the chances of ignite being pushed off the debuff list.
---
You see his horde icon next to his name right? Guess we all know what hes playing lol.
---
I literally mentioned that at the beginning of my second sentence.
---
I feel you
---
😂 Thought maybe he meant revered. The third positive reputation "rank"
---
Outside of the literal top 0.1% of guilds your choice of dwarf vs human will not matter. The top speedrunning guilds have NE warriors.
---
WAAAAIT WAAAAIT
---
I'm sacrificing about $2000 in pay to take time off for classic. Money comes and goes, but classic will launch once.
---
The dual wield tank meta existed in vanilla as well.
---
A warrior without any extra int will never max the weapons out.
---
How is people giving rheir honest opinion worse than straight up paying people to just say good things about the game? If you prefer the former as a consumer idk whats wrong with you.
---
They also can kinda estimate how many people are really interested in classic before launch.
---
I was not aware of this. Although I never raided past MC.
---
My dad played WoW with his friend from work. My dad used to play a game called Ultimate Online, and then WoW dropped and his long time friend wanted him to play it with him. My dad being the cheapskate he was told his friend “no man. I’m not paying for a subscription. If you really want me to play, buy me the game and pay my sub”. So that’s what my dads friend did and they played together all through Classic and BC. Well my dad introduced me to the game and I would play while he was at work. We shared the same account for prolly 6 years as he slowly started playing less. We had an old e-Machines computer and dial up Internet in rural North Carolina. He would download patches at work and bring them home. 
---
I think for all of my birthdays for those 6 years, or say age 10-15, were WoW gold from him. 
---
Still to this day he buys me something WoW/Blizzard related for my birthday. 
---
I got him back into the game in legion since he Retired, and we are anxiously waiting for classic.
---
I really think they're going to go fresh and make new content. It seems like the most reasonable path.
---
If this was a pirate server, then I think it might not have been pure luck.
---
And she's still your gf?
---
I'm getting WoD garrison flight path flashbacks
---
Do you really need to hide it in your ass?!
---
Yeah I agree that class balance and pvp both got better. And I think tbc was a great expansion overall, but the points I brought up still stand as they are and you can back track a lot of the things that "ruined" the game back to these changes.
---
I feel you on that. My wife doesn't work and that's not me saying it's solely on her to watch my daughter, but when I can I'll definitely be playing and if I can lvl while she's awake then I will if not oh well always another time, also good luck with your baby as well!
---
You really gonna whine about trump in this of all places? Grow up dude
---
Being annoyed is one thing. Being super offended and wanting them to lose beta access because of it is something else.
---
This needs to be higher! This is how you play an mmo!
---
101 101 zug zug
---
Probably not. Maybe for humans. The new accepted proc-rate for Ironfoe probably being 1ppm (4%) makes it a bit worse than before than Pre-AQ-BIS. It will still last you well thru MC and into BWL. We'll see when classic releases.
---
Oh it wasn't just the bus that ate up their budget (though $3M on a west coast customs bus for a game several years off release isnt a great idea) they also: 
---
- sponsored one of the bigger chinese soccer teams when the game was still in alpha
---
- Created an in-house video production studio (REALLY high quality) and sponsored a week-long 'firefall festival' on twitch with some of the biggest streamers/'gaming personalities' of the time
---
- Promised $1Mil in esports prize money for 2013 (for reference, the game entered open beta halfway through 2013), none of this was ever paid to players &amp; iirc PvP got removed later. 
---
Not to mention the number of people from red5 who have said he was awful to work for.
---
Check out the podcast "countdown to classic". They discussed this topic :)
---
Probably gonna be your Pre-AQ setup though because all the other warrs/rogued will have prio on weps over you.
---
Life's not fair :(
---
Ye, I can see that being a problem. I guess there will be less but bigger guilds in Classic.
---
why take the day off 27 ? its technically not out until 28th, you could have gotten 1 more day of playtime
---
Faster wins in PvP always matter as they increase your honor per hour rate and put you higher on the rank lists, assuming you have playtime limitations. Farming 100k honor in a day or 50k does matter as eventually you get stuck on the same place due to honor decay. 
---
In raids you are getting carried because your proportional contribution is negligible, yet the loot demands are the same. At this point players would rather have an empty slot than a meme spec player who did 1% of total DPS but rolled epic reward. 
---
Even the most shittiest guilds do not want to spend 2 days clearing content which could be cleared within an hour. Setting the viability threshold as "minimum to salvage the fight" is a horrendous approach.
---
This has many problems with it but to keep it brief..  
---
People will complain when its supposedly a no complain system when officers can tell others they cant have certain gear for whatever the reason. Its basically loot council but theres no incentive to perform well in raids. When a player questions a loot council decision on why an officer got a piece of loot over them and the only response they get is "show up to raids" you can bet on drama breaking out. Your idea of only showing up to raids is not good at having players take the raid seriously for the most part. When a player is constantly causing wipes and doing stupid things and another player is always performing at the top of the meters but is losing loot to the idiot raider because its his turn for simply being present.. then that good player is going to leave. So your guild will constantly be bleeding good players while retaining the slackers and attract more slackers as your guild reputation deteriorates into a place no good players want to be. This system is also a massive amount of work because the lists of what loot each player wants needs to be adjusted if anyone misses a raid and the loot distribution gets messed up. Or if a new player joins or old player leaves. Youre also going to run into problems where certain loot wont drop in the order that pleases the lists you create. Loot is random and if theres lists then someone could be getting 2-3 pieces before an unlucky player gets nothing. You will have arguments over the lists themselves as no one wants to feel they like have got the short end of the stick. Foor example how would you determine whos the last melee dps players in line for a weapon? Compensate them with priority for a couple good gear upgrades? What if no weps drop and the 2 pieces of gear drop, will you have an officer step in to force the second drop to not go to that person? If thats the case then whats the point of the lists if its basically attendance based loot council aexcept the officers get extra benefits and the lists that are told to be made by the player arent followed? What will you say to a player comllaining about such type of situations? Show up to more raidz? My advice is to just use dkp and put in the guild rules for loot scenarios so people know exactly what theyre getting into because that sounds awful as is. Good luck regardless.
---
Played a pally in 04 played a pally on every one of the 15 private servers I played on from 2010 to 2018, and everytime I re-get this mount I say "it was all so worth it." Every damn time.
---
You need r3 in pve and pvp for 20% off.
---
True, I guess it partly depends on the phase we are on. When you mainly need to do early (lvl 60) dungeons Orgrimmar is better,  but once DM and silithus becomes more important TB might be the place to go.
---
I think you are right. The numbers are very interesting, but density is a more important factor.
---
If only there were instances in the game that would allow your 5 man party to have exclusive groups of npcs. ;-)
---
Yeah I've been watching his streams for a while now back when classic wasn't announced.
---
Our fight shall be legendary.
---
Ye, but I thought that wasn't the case though? as there were lots of people who maybe played as Fury, but ran unoptimal decks and didn't know their rotations?... please correct me if I am wrong.
---
Assuming they are decently geared, they do enough damage to beat the hardest DPS checks in Naxx, like Patchwerk. It is generally true that the more damage your raid is doing the easier the encounter gets but there's also something to be said about having enough class diversity that you're not wasting item drops because that's what will happen if you stack too many rogues and warriors.
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
It just naturally happened when you started to outgear the content. I was an off-tank all throughout vanilla, and it would be "funny" to tank the adds on bosses keeping your dual wield on, instead of equipping your scarab. Then it became normal for tanks with Thunderfury to AoE all the adds on a single boss but then your DPS would be threat capped. So in the end dual-wielding for threat became the norm. I remember the first time our tank dual wielded Vael and we killed it quicker than ever before. After that he ran a fury/prot hybrid and we had an off-tank full prot for the damage heavy encounters.
---
Imagine our main tank not having his thunderfury equipped half the time, and one of our off tanks being the only full prot spec in the raid.
---
Ahh, I see. Thank you
---
I’ve watched soda since mop but sometimes it’s too hard for me to watch him now. He’s so arrogant now it’s insane. He played some private servers where the best players will teach him shit because he’s a streamer and guilds will carry him through leveling and farm. So because he knows more than average he thinks the average person is just retarded.
---
I still remember one time he came back to legion after not playing wow for a while. He got a relic drop and wasn’t sure if it was an upgrade. One guy in his guild chat or something told him it was (it wasn’t) so he equipped it (which deletes the old one). Chat told him it was wrong and it was actually an upgrade and he just smugly said “you guys are wrong. I forgot how bad the average world of Warcraft player is at world of Warcraft.” That’s when I realized his ego was getting to much for me.
---
in in vanilla
---
I haven't posted here before, I am not sure what the mods are like.
---
Sure, you are entitled to your own opinion. But it truly seems like you are trolling.
---
Nope don't see an emblem
---
I personally do not know if I even want to raid, I was just curious from a general point of view. Good to know though, thank you!
---
IDK about lack of content at 60. Raids, attunements, pvp, rep/gold/item farming, world pvp, random adventures with friends, making alts and doing it again, world raids. Just off the top of my head. I played wow every day in high school from vanilla to TBC. Can't recall ever running out of stuff to do.
---
Same for me :/ Also saw another post about it
---
paerver hero tho
---
I've also been removed from it -- it's likely due to the stress test ending and them needing to take the server offline.
---
I think rather than outright "Heroic" versions of dungeons, I'd rather they integrated features into the normal dungeons which could alter the way you tackle/experience the content. Along the lines of Strat 45, DM Tribute, or WotLK Ulduar hardmodes etc. 
---
Rather than clicking on your character portrait to "set the dungeon to heroic", having the functionality actually be an integrated mechanic of the gameworld is a far less jarring experience. 
---
If all the 55+ dungeons had their own unique "hardmode" features which were tuned for lvl 60 players it'd definitely add to the pool of things to do at cap. Perhaps in BRD at 60 you can accept a quest from a lvl 45 prisoner who says he knows of a hidden treasure under the throne of Dagran Thaurissan. He will then follow your party. So long as he stays alive, it alters several encounters through the dungeon: The arena event will instead spawn one of 3 lvl 60 encounters, The Tomb of the Seven event is retuned to 60, The Grim Guzzler patrons are all naturally hostile towards the prisonner, and the respawn rate of mobs in The Lyceum is increased. Once Dagran Thaurissan is dead, the prisonner will run behind the throne and perform the looting animation, at which point he transforms into a level ?? Black Dragonspawn Boss (The Dark Irons had stolen his magic or something IDK) and attacks you.
---
Eh, I've raided with a Scarab Lord, I've raided with someone who's guild got a couple world firsts in vanilla and he said they were far easier than mythic raiding today. There simply were a lot of people, even in those top end guilds that weren't very good. I suppose you could say more of the challenge is that it's hard to field 40 good players and there will always be a talent disparity.
---
I feel like this sub is more and more turning into r/freefolk.
---
His name is Dives the 50 DKP minus guy GL for the wipe club
---
Is the API for Classic same as API for Live? I do not have a Beta, but I might try to cook up something on the trial.
---
AN ELDER CRAG BOAR ON AN OPEN FIELD NED
---
well if the "german pewdiepie" of youtube named "gronkh" decides to play on a german server, then yes that will have a big impact on that server.
---
I think a lot of this had to do with all alliance zones being built first. And horde was mostly rushed out.
---
And as horde?
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. :c
---
But being invited is fun. So no meme specs paladins can only be holy. Druid can only be resto etc
---
Jewelcrafting.
---
"reasonable amount"
---
umm ok
---
&gt; In retail the culture have been a meta and only one way of playing the game for years - I suspect a lot have been influenced by this mentality over the years, or just don't know any better from only having retail experience.
---
I don't know where you play in retail of course but i've never seen this being "Meta" in any guild i've been in. You sometimes see it in pugs, but thats about it.
---
Summon inside Goldshire inn, huehuehue...
---
I see you are also a man of culture
---
My guild is full of "classic sucks" people. I have no idea why. They love BFA for some reason. Mythic plus whores mostly. So I'm leaving them for the true game.
---
definitely not. 2x edge of chaos much better for pve.
---
Yes! Even if you're horde. I'd even mc buff you.
---
Its not that OP
---
misplaced servo arm, bis HEMO rogue weapon. for the truly sophisticated rouges out there.
---
Apparently the addon API for BfA and Classic are indeed very similar, to the  Some BfA addons have been confirmed to plug into Classic without breaking.
---
I guess you might have to manually change the version number in the LUA file in order to trick the client though, but that's not a big deal.
---
yeah ret paladins only exist in bgs.  aka healing paladins who picked up the loot left over from warriors.
---
Why do you think I’m trolling? Because you don’t agree with my list? I said all the tier sets are amazing, this is just the order in which my opinion ranks them.
---
Sadly it's really hard to have big battles in bfa without dc or 5000ms, not sure if it's because all calculations or sharded servers that can't hande the amout of players or perhaps both.
---
Hell even AV can lag if too many fights in mid
---
I kind of figured that's why it didn't make your list, as I think its generally accepted that Duskwood is one of the best zones. I would argue that whole mood and atmosphere is what makes Duskwood beautiful.
---
I usually end up making it to 40 there haha I end up doing every quest then off to Tanaris which is the exact opposite.
---
i have always been jealous of how good the paladin t2 was as a rogue.  then the zg leather set came out and i was happy for a while.  the helm/shoulders from zg look fantastic for rogues.
---
Oh my nostalgia! I remember going through these everyday pretty much, also I would obsessively look through all the old race and class pages before and after I actually started playing the game
---
People are going to run through raids at record times, vanilla raids were far less mechanically intense and thanks to YouTube, twitch and other live streaming services the general player base as a whole is a lot more experienced and game smarter, for lack of a better word.
---
Yeah we have reported that in the beta 100000 times already. lol. 
---
But yeah. all the level 30 hunters are running around with level 32 cats at the level 30 cap, its crazy.
---
i agree druid t1 is the worst looking set for any class.
---
Wasnt the level capped on 5?
---
Aka this boss does too much damage
---
Steamers armies lol ? Is that even a thing...?
---
!Feminisme 79 days
---
Jeffery is awesome! I found out about him from this vid and just had to share :)
---
!remind me in 79 days
---
nightslayer helm just ruins literally every helm for rogues through even current live helms. with the exception of MAYBE the zg rogue helm.
---
Lol if you'd rather suck than look awesome, how are you even going to get the tier sets in the first place?
---
Well I am a hordie at heart but going ally this time to relive my vanilla experience and appease my partner!!!
---
Just don’t play arena then? You still get gear by doing only bg’s. 
---
Personally I like arena combined with bg’s. Tbc arena is fun as hell as a pvper.
---
Jeffery is awesome! I found out about him from seeing this vid and had to share :D
---
Right after inscription.
---
I mean sounds fun for the hunters.
---
as a joke maybe
---
Actually, I'd say jewelcrafting before inscription.
---
Mulgore is awesome. Always liked Feralas, Un'goro &amp; STV too. The jungle zones are awesome.
---
Thankfully I had this talk with my wife when I played on private servers and basically told her. You don't beat this game. You only do a little better each time. She shrugged and said "what's the point, if you can't beat it?" I said "the quest of trying is always worth it. "
---
You're an idiot. This has got nothing to do with the whims and wishes of the playerbase, it's a major oversight that needs to be fixed because otherwise every hunter will be running around with this broken pet. Pets are not supposed to be CC-immune, it makes the hunter far too overpowered as a class. It boggles my mind that you want to keep bugs like this in the game because MUH CLASSIC.
---
I guess so, but there are still a few more stress tests coming. Granted the next one is in 20 days, but it still surprises me that they straight up remove the Classic option from the sidebar instead of just making the stress test realm appear offline or having the Error show up when trying to log in. I guess they will have a whole new batch of people coming to the next stress tests.
---
I don't even like trump lol
---
It's completely dead once Classic launches. I don't think anyone want to play BfA but it's what's available.
---
I’ve watched this guy for a couple weeks, definitely a fun and interactive steamer. That being said, I feel like his shoutcasting is very cluttered. I know he’s just having fun and his viewers enjoy it, but I wouldn’t say it’s something I would want to hear at something like Blizzcon. But still recommend checking out his stream!
---
This is really sweet and kind, thank u who made it.
---
My biggest obstacle is my friends, they all want alliance and all i want to do is play shaman.
---
How is benediction/anthema free lol?
---
Why would you go to Stormwind? Ironforge is better.
---
I couldnt really tell you why. Horde areas are just much further from a lot of the high end raids. Though UC is close to a lot of the end game dungeons.
---
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GIANT PADDLE IM WHEEZING
---
Cause there's so many other things to do at max level in vanilla...
---
Shadowmeld Mind Control opposing factions off of cliffs or bridges 😎
---
MC &amp; BWL were easy and could be cleared with a suboptimal raid comp. By the time Naxx came out most people had figured out the game and very few went into Naxx with poor builds and rotations.
---
funny meme, its almost like it started in retail wow and probably wasnt a thing in classic. oh well.
---
Totally agree on pickibg a race and class you want to play.
---
But when it comes to joining my raid guild, you will play the spec we tell you to, what you do outside of raids is your thing. Just will need you to have what ever is on the consumables list for the evening with you.
---
Also get ready to change into engineering once aq opens.. 
---
Other than that, you can do whatever you want. If you dont like these options, there is plenty of more casual guilds that will have their own requirements, most of them even lower than mine. You not joining my guild does not mean we cant coexist, ill still heal you and your guildies in 5 mans.
---
Mostly uncontested (outside of other priests). Something like Lok’amir has a lot more competition.
---
Mine is still there, if I log in I can see the stress test being offline.
---
Puberty will hit them soon enough.
---
Alterac mountains and hildbrad
---
yes. lvl 32, 33, 34 is really bad because lack of quests. i will grind with music on
---
Yes, a CC-immune pet is game breaking. Do you really need us to explain why that is the case?
---
You hit it on the head. Mulgore is 'different' from most zones, vast plains and scarce trees, large mountains. It's beautiful.
---
Ssigb me up!
---
Ashevale. The soundscape there makes the feel and look blend together really well. Maybe visually not most beautiful alone but combined with the music it is my favourite zone.
---
the wow classic files are on the usb stick inside her pussy.
---
Except for those Bloodfang shoulders.
---
Sword spec is slightly more damage because the value of crit depends on how much crit you have, i.e. if you have zero crit then your DPS goes from 100 to 105 if you get 5% crit, but if you have 25% crit your DPS goes from 125 to 130, which is a 4% increase in damage even though it's a 5% increase in crit. 
---
More importantly though, burst kills people in PvP. You want to time your abilities with auto attack, so that you land an AA, then use MS/WW. If you get lucky then anything not wearing a shield is getting their face caved in.
---
Any update?
---
At the start? Probably none as there are no surplus gold in the economy. Gold starts to really appear when the players start to hit cap and farm.
---
i was a priest in vanilla, got full T2 and started naxx before TBC was announced, its definitely a solid choice if you want to see all the content the game has to offer, but it can be rather unchalleging aswell, make no mistake.
---
Maybe it's just bugging out since some have had it happend and others not, either way it works for me so now I don't login to disappointment everyday!
---
It's tough for a lot of people that can't find other games fun at the moment but we get closer every days :]
---
Feels like it makes Hemo single handedly viable in engame pve.  It's straight bonkers for that shit.
---
!RemindMe 10 hours
---
Technically this happened in vanilla aswell from time to time
---
Bobby B kneels to no man.
---
You'll be 100% good with herb an alchemy, look up recipes ahead of time that you'll want to look out for.
---
Shaman is pretty good too.

Im mean most people will tell you that the best dungeon ever made is BRD. Literally the longest and most non-linear dungeon there is. It was huge and an adventure. The mentality of saying "yeah we can't have that because buisy parents need to be able to do that" is what lead to a fuckload of issues. There are simply some games that you shouldn't play if you don't have the time to put into them. It doesn't mean that every game has to ponder to the needs of every demographic. The current wow tries so hard to appeal to everyone that in the end it ends up not appealing to anyone as far as see it.
---
Now don't get me wrong, the dungeons in tbc had a great design for the most part, but they had no diversity. Every one of them was designed to be finished within an hour or less and you'd be running the same dungeon dozens of times for your attunements and such only to repeat the same process in the heroic versions that were 90% the same. 
---
Also the heroic difficulty is conceptually stupid, because you cannot explain the mechanic of the difficulty increas other than saying "because it's a game". Any mechanic that can only be explained that way is bad in design. Why should the enemies of a dungeon I have already completed suddenly become stronger and more difficult to kill? "Because it's a game". And yeah, vanilla had a lot of those too, but there was a consistency in the world. When you said "yeah I've cleared stratholme" you didn't have to ask "on normal, heroic or mythic?". It was a clear statement, because there was only one difficulty. In addition to that the whole heroic thing spilled over onto raids in wotlk and later on you had a whole bunch of difficulties like you are playing diablo 2. There is simply no saving grace to that. Recycle content by making it harder to extend a games longevity is not good design.
---
&gt; Vanilla is full of quest hubs. 
---
Yeah that's the one thing people keep saying about vanilla. You had an abundance of quests for your level range in any zone. 
---
&gt; Yes, they made dungeons relevant and actually difficult. 
---
Are you implying that dungeons in vanilla were not relevant? Where do you think you got your bis pre raid gear?\`Vanilla had lvl 45 dungeons that were relevant because of how itemization worked. You could actually make progress towards your pre raid bis without having to be level 60. That makes things a lot more relevant. In tbc pretty much nothing mattered before you hit 70. Only then could you start gearing towards pre raid bis. Heroic dungeons didn't make dungeons relevant, they just added an additional step that made all the non-heroic versions irrelevant.

&gt; Why does it matter if something started in tbc? As long as it's still good in tbc that's what matters. 
---
It matters because of the evolutionary process of things. Especially since we know the "future" retrospectively. It's like saying "Why does it matter if the whole nazi thing started in 1933, as long as in 1933 they didn't kill any jews". &gt;!sorry for the really extreme comparison btw, but my brain is literally incapable to think of something more fitting and less morbid atm.!&lt; Well It matters, because we don't want that shit happening again.
---
&gt;  tbc has flaws but it's like you're completely blind to vanillas flaws which, in my opinion, are worse than tbc. With that said, both vanilla and tbc are close to perfect. 
---
Well that wasn't a post about the flaws of vanilla and since vanilla is the base for my comparison I can only talk about the things tbc did better or worse. TBC improved in raids, class balance and arguably pvp (not in my oppinion though) and added a lot of things that were "convenient" at that time but which pushed to their extreme lead to the broken mess of a game that we have today.
---
I appreciate your thoughts on that matter btw. and do not think that tbc was bad, some of the gameplay elements it introduced however were bad and most people like to ignore that because tbc for most people is like the golden child of wow expansions.
---
that's about it, also tauren had one I think but I forgot.
---
Having raided back then only a few bosses took the full raid to cooperate. A lot of the challenge was just things like coordinating dispels, raw dps requirements, and tank swaps.
---
Holy priests for sure utilize theirs.  In fact all the healing classes utilize theirs pretty well.
---
Found my name in the mess
---
Shes muh queen
---
sums up pretty much every BUT MUH NOCHANGES on this subreddit lol
---
Don't worry after they get flying in 8.2 and play the new zones for a month they'll get bored and hop on classic - keep in mind them having an active sub gives them access, so no extra cost for them.
---
Not saying everyone who tries it post launch will stick, but they always have that option of playing the better game.

Druids are ok healers, pretty good for group healing due to their heals over time. The real problem with them is dungeons. The fact that they don't have a real rez makes them less desirable. Both will get into raids both will get into dungeons. It will just be easier as a priest.
---
Gods I was weak then...
---
Will Bobby B Bot visit us here?
---
There is not a single Zone I don't like, they all are beautiful in their own unique way. Hard to pick a favorite really.
---
You'll have fun with either obviously but if you are strictly going for PvE only I'd say priest, if you ever want to pvp some - damn druids can be fun :)
---
I still have the Blizzcon demo installed and showing on my bnet launcher 🙂

It was one of the coolest thing that happened to me a few seconds after I started playing on a pserver. And it reminded me of what PvE actually meant back then : Player versus Environment, for real... Let's just help out each others survive out there.
---
You can tank and pvp just fine for most things with a 31/5/15 spec.
---
Alchemy is always desirable. Potions are needed all the way through naxx. Herbalism is great to because you can grind it and sell excess herbs easily.
---
Meh, Cryptstalker looks good with a fitting weapon combo.
---
Hide the helmet on Dragonstalker and it's not too bad either, just not as good as some of the other T2 sets
---
How could I not?
---
People in WoD/Legion asked for quivers, but they are in Vanilla loool
---
I think Lock Modan, Arathi Highlands, Dun morogh, Mulgore and Azshara are all top tier for aesthetics
---
I fully expected this to be stupid, I was gladly mistaken
---
Addons are a part of classic. This guy wants UI changes in base game
---
You're looking at 6+ weeks if you play 4 hours a day
---
Druids are just that much worse. I actually mained a druid through vanilla and they just weren't as good of healers. They had no real group wide heal and hots could only be used once on each target so 1 druids rejuv on the tank for the whole raid. 
---
Druids have some benefit like innervate but even then you'll usually use that innervate on a priest in raids.
---
For Warriors there were finally +def items with hit on them, So that was huge for their TPS. Which was also usable by Furys.
---
Ret/Boom/Enchancement aren't good builds. If you have ... 10? of those in your raid and you aren't the most hardcore guild with all possible consumables. You aren't going to clear the content. It's quite simple.
---
I never claimed there wasn't an emblem, just that it's not displayed for me.
---
 it was about the zones he named, and I think you know that, however I think you probably just like stirring the pot, and that's ok. 
---
You mightve even seen the comment made before you commented about the emblem, where I say it doesnt show up for me, or maybe not.
---
Warrior and Priest &gt; all overall

Raiding as arms will be entirely up to you and your guild. Noone else can answer that. All the non-maintanks in my guild in vanilla were arms, and we killed Twin Emperors before Naxx was released.
---
Druid tier 3 is so fucking sexy. Warrior and Lock ain't bad either.
---
Sorry but.. Wrong. "top-Guilds" choose Human Warriors so they get reduced Glancing Blows with TF, therefor more TPS
---
Ret is viable in the same way that bringing and empty slot to the raid is viable.

Same here.

Well, this changed my mind on leveling a nelf warrior. Atleast humans are also pretty.
---
I was thinking of dps warrior,  but ya undead is def below orc and troll
---
bwl is not easy, i dont know where this mythos comes from? on privat serves maybe but certainly not on live.
---
bwl needed a lot of 5man / smaller groups to perform on spezific but vital tasks to accomplish the raid and if a party wasnt able to keep up it ment wipe. coordinating 8x5man groups was the hard part. teamwork was the hard part, mechanics where easy to understand but got randomized and hard to deal with.
---
group handling on boss 1
---
group heal on boss 2
---
random clusterfuck on chromaggus
---
phase 1, phase 3 randomness endboss
---
and most of all, there was no aggromanagement / threadmeter / omen at the beginning. try maximising your dps on vaelas without pulling aggro over the 3 tanks. that was hard and needed a lot experience and understanding your damage and your tanks
---
therer was a reason why raids wiped on these bosses for a long time. the reason was coordinating 40 man
---
Mine is still there. Also you don't need to unflag people if you want to take the servers offline - PTR remains unflagged even if it has many inactive periods.
---
Main tank: "If you ever need anything, give me a call."
---
Ret Paladin: "Do you know how to get to AQ20?"
---
MT: "Yeah, I know. Get a map."
---
EU has the best guilds though. Avoid Method's server at all cost.
---
Add warrior to that list...
---
&gt; Or is everyone talking rubbish about how simple it was and it was a lot harder than people remember?
---
As someone who raided during Vanilla and on private servers: Both, and something more.
---
1. A lot of people look at the special mechanics present in low-tier raiding, and much more mechanically complex raid fights nowadays are, but they forget that Vanilla had a lot of mechanics that players had to keep in mind in *every* fight, and that those interplayed with boss mechanics in Vanilla. For example, mana was an issue for healers, and so you had to keep the mechanic around the 5sr in mind in as good as every encounter, and often keeping up a healing rotation of sorts.
---
2. Private servers guess at a lot of the things they implement, and more importantly: They work off of 1.12 values. Player characters were *much* more potent in 1.12 than when, e.g. BWL released. Take a look at the [pre-1.10 Priest talent tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20060316123824/http://wowvault.ign.com/talentcalculator/?skillclassid=5), for example: Notice how Holy Nova is the 31-point talent in Holy, and that you need 5 points to get ya 15% increase to Renew instead of 3 points? How there is no general pushback protection in the initial tier, and instead you get one for Flash Heal exclusively at tier *four*?
---
3. Same goes for equipment. When people started MC, DM wasn't out yet. That place alone has a lot of gear upgrades compared to what was available to raiders at that time.
---
4. A lot of people look at p-server MC, and maybe BWL, nod their head that it was easy because bosses have few abilities, and call it a day. And MC *was* easy once you knew what you were doing, and once you had stuff like raid target markers, which weren't a thing until halfway through Vanilla. But other stuff was not, especially since you need 40 people to not fuck up instead of 25. That alone is a huge thing. Have you ever even *tried* running into C'Thun's room with 40 people so well spaced out that his eye beam doesn't chain?
---
5. Sure, a lot of people were noobs back then, and we all started out as newbies in WoW. But a lot of us, especially the early guys, had been gaming for a decade or more when WoW rolled around. We weren't all shit tier back then. We crunched the numbers, we used TS2 and Ventrilo to raid (and to formulate tactics, since encounters were actually unknown back then, no "just spool of this strategy").
---
6. A lot of the difficulty in Vanilla comes from sheer numbers. You *need* your soakers with Nature resist at Huhuran, because by sheer numbers alone, if you don't, you'll croak. There is little room to compensate lack of preparation through skill, and that means you need about 50 people per raid that are willing and able to Be Prepared. Every raid, every week. It's a different kind of difficulty than living through bullet-hell mechanics, but it'll cut people out of higher-tier raiding because they are not willing/able to put in the time and effort. And that doesn't just mean "show up with a stack of pots". Every new raid came with its own set of rep and mat requirements for resist gear (Ony scale cloak, anyone?).
---
In conclusion: Yeah, you can easily run as ret in a raid clearing MC. We've had times when half of our raid was on follow while the other half cleared MC once we were somewhat geared. But we also spent *months* trying to get the twin emps down, with no place for "fun" specs like boomkin, because in quite some fights, everyone just needs to pull their weight. Not all raiding is created equal.
---
actually you can straight up walk up the mountain in places in loch modan, no tricks required.
---
It doesn’t need to be banned just don’t use it if you don’t like it
---
Maybe it is just a bug, who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hit rating cap will be lower in classic = more TPS. 
---
More parry means tank will take more damage and generate more rage = more TPS.
---
What?  Shaman T2 and T3 are some of the best sets!
---
I sense a casual
---
That was great fun.
---
Ehh yes?
---
I don’t know how anyone could possibly give you an answer. You know how you like to enjoy wow and you’ve played since beta. Why are you asking us?
---
I like how the rogue goes from "you can barely see my face" to "faceless edgelord" to "bitch look at my fresh fade while I stab you".
---
Why bother commenting? People are trying to do something nice to remember someone they cared about. If you dont care then why waste your time and energy typing this? Its because you didn't like him because of his views or behavior. If you didnt care you wouldn't have even opened the post. 
---
This comment is akin to showing up to a celebrity's funeral to talk shit about their views in front of the people who cared about him. Does nothing productive and only serves to make you look like an asshole. Also really shows a lack of critical thinking.
---
Kindly fuck off sir, and let the rest of these people do their nice thing in peace.
---

---
T3 rogue is just not a pussy who needs to hide her face anymore.
---
Nope, only Battlegrounds. There will be no "xrealm" like it is in retail where you can raid, do dungeons or see other people from other realms while you play.
---
Only in battlegrounds to reduce queues.
---
I've been doing the same on the PvE server on my Mage. I would love for them to do some kind of top 50 drive by buffers or something list for the servers. Shit would be awesome. I would be crushed if I didnt make it lol.
---
This is huge. Please do something
---
Depending on how much of the content you're clearing, your spec will probably change during the course of Classic as you get comfortable. Going for Impale or Fury for more threat as examples. 
---
Here's a starter for you: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AjCAATAFzxf\_00A](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AjCAATAFzxf_00A) The 2 and 3 point talents around Conc Blow can be moved around to fit your wishes.
---
Winterspring, hands down. Why's that even a question?
---
Any new Classic WoW player have to know a simple thing, that will help them understand how Classic works, and also offers them solutions to deal with lack of quests, avoid red quests and avoid (as much as possible) WPvP.
---
That simple thing is that EVERYTHING in Classic WoW matters, especially GOLD.
---
With that in mind, grinding random thrash in your level range and bellow becomes a reality. 
---
The advantage of mob grinding in Classic WoW is unquestionable. First, as a new player, you will practice your class skills and spells, which will make you better at playing your character. Secondly, you will make GOLD during this process. Third, you will also gain XP, even if not as much as Questing + grinding, but enough not to feel like you are stagnating.
---
At 40, you get your first mount. Not having the gold for, it's going to be frustrating...but you can farm that gold, AND XP, in other areas than STV. You will be behind other players in terms of level...but you get the mount before them, and that mount will tremendously help you to close the gap when you go to Badlands, for example.
---
New players should not be discouraged by slow leveling or WPvP, regardless the level that they are. Grinding mobs lower lvl than you it's stupidly slow, but the gold you make is going to matter MORE than those 5 levels you are behind. 
---
New players will have to understand that in Classic you can't have the cake and eat it too. You can't do EVERYTHING in the same time. You can't speed level, and have gold in the same time. You can't PvP all day long and have maxed professions. Try to understand that prioritizing something in Classic WoW is going to be the dumbest idea ever.
---
You will need gold, you will need professions, you will need XP, and you will also need to be social, which will help on the long run.
---
Just don't get discouraged by slow leveling...there is PLENTY to do in Classic.
---
Panicking!  No one's said they're leaving yet but I expect a lot will try classic and enjoy it.  
---
If Blizz syncopate the classic and retail content releases its gonna be a nightmare managing the guild roster.
---
I kinda want to focus on classic but I've got too many friends in my retail guild to let down
---
Please use commas properly to make it easier for the readers, your sentences just go on and on and on... Other than that, pretty interesting
---
Are you talking about this undocumented comment?
---
&gt;Level 3-5 starting zone mobs are now neutral by default.
---
Note that it says neutral *by default*. That language suggests that all mobs that *weren't* neutral prior are, not that they all were aggressive beforehand.
---
But not in classic
---
Spent 2 hours the other day at crossroads in the beta buffing people with Stam as they all flew by on the wind riders. Was a good time.
---
Sorry mate, but there is no answer that will be good enough.
---
Where do I sign
---
Well met!!!!
---
Actually, as it turns out, Pserver bosses do way too much damage and have stupidly high armor to curb the melee dps.
---
Any reflect damage ability/buff/item/etc directs threat to the recipient. Same goes for the damage values as well. 
---
You increase the damage the tank is doing (dps meters gets higher for the tank) and the only way to calculate thorns damage as your own is to check the dps report and extract the total damage done by thorns . - 
---
You’ll be surprised how efficient it is, especially when combined with other effects (naglering, spiked shield, retribution aura, imp’s fire shield, fire breathing food buffs, emulation potions , etc)
---
Correct
---
Higher parry value will make the raids even easier.
---
I've played Alliance 100% since TBC. I made a Tauren with my friend the other day on a Classic Wow private server, I was surpsied at how good looking the starting zone was!
---
oh, so the increased parry is a positive thing because of rage gen you think? hm, that's cool if so.
---
Use the kids ! Tell the wife that your account will worth thousands by the time your kids go to college, and you will sell the account, and give the money to the kids.
---
Me too, I told myself that it was because I was getting the full beta but who I am I kidding lol!

I felt compelled to stalk his profile. It’s actually a fairly anti racist account, most people are morons who can’t read at even a 12th grade level, see his name, see a post with racially charged language and downvote. 
---
Much of what he does seems to be pointing out people’s ludicrous positions by highlights how wrong they’d be if you subbed in race.
---
“I was raped, therefore I am afraid of all men and will keep them at arms length, for they are a threat”

“I was mugged, therefore I am afraid of all blacks and will keep them at arms length, for they are a threat”

Or the irony of calling someone racist then describing them with a racist slur.

Winterspring and Dun Morogh. So many good memories from both my first character who was  a gnome warlock and my alt dwarf hunter. Also I remember grinding the Frostsaber mount twice, but that was in TBC and WotLK.
---
Most of my friends are going play Horde since we have been playing Horde for ages now, but I think I'll make a gnome rogue and a dwarf hunter, just for nostalgia reasons.
---
Lucky i'll be Legless
---
A big part of this too is how much better they handle ability data now. They did some talks about how they used to store the data for each ability where everything was essentially on the one row but now they have indexed it so it runs a lot better (this is pretty much a nessesity with how much is going on with today's abilities and would result in a significantly reduced amount of computing power compared to og vanilla)
---
TL;DR
---
They store data better now, required for modern wow but massive performance boost for vanilla
---
If I could give you gold or silver I would, that broke my heart. I hope you can reunite with Takk.
---
I think you missed the blue post of Classic raid bosses parry chance mate. It's 14%, almost 3 times higher than 5.6% parry on pservers. And that is probably not ALL. If the private servers fucked up with parry, they fucked up with resistances also. Pservers crit chance that players have on bosses is also fucking SKY HIGH. I expect to be much less, while glancing blow to be much higher.
---
I expect the difference to be the same, almost 3 times higher in Classic.
---
While that won't matter that much for extremely hardcore guilds, they will still NOT clear MC in first week...or the second. Probably in 3rd week, some guilds will. Some others in week 4. But MOST guilds will not do it before 3 months after release.
---
Private servers got it VERY WRONG, and not for the better (overtunning), but for the worst (undertunning). I expect Classic raids to be about 50% harder, if not more (when you consider that 14% parry on raid bosses = only Prot Warriors will tank = less dps = longer kill time = more mana) than pservers, all thing considered.
---
Thats good to hear, nice
---
You should keep making these. If I rolled horde I’d want to spend as little time in those dumpster fire zones.
---
&gt;i just dont wanna farm consumes for hours and then just being stuck on autoattack because my threat is too high
---
LiP and you're fine. Also can blame tank for not making enough threat.
---
Female dwarf’s casting animation weirdness is perfect for pvp, most people are not used to it

Here's a video from January 2008, *way* before this 3.3.0 patch people are suggesting that nerfed them.
---
https://youtu.be/OkBdqVZmROY
---
They're neutral here too. I'd like to try and find an earlier source, but we can tell from this that it wasn't this 3.3.0 patch.
---
the bosses have higher parry values. much higher. a parry includes a +50% increase on the next attacks swing timer, so a boss parrying makes it do more damage. I know your trying to create a narrative for yourself and others, but please do some research before you spew your ignorance everywhere.
---
Especially this guy, obnoxious af, will pause the video every 10sec and lie about thing that never happends and talk shit for the entire video while his viewer/drone « pog » in the chat

Would look a lot better with the original water effects enabled.

will be fine i make the same with a mate hunter and shadow priest
---
There are few best in slot guns, most of the best gear is either a bow or a crossbow.
---
Crossbows are used a lot because of the slow speed. 
---
For the bow if I remember correctly the epic hunter bow (class quest) was really nice. 
---
I don't remember a lot of guns but I may be wrong
---
I hope it helps
---
My retail guild fell apart in WoD, playing other games, might reconnect with them in classic.
---
If the NE warrior is the better player than the HU warrior the top guild is gonna choose the NE warrior, simple as that.
---
Mulgore and Ashenvale.
---
That's really weird
---
There's a finite amount of loot in a raid. 2 moonkins will do the dps of 1 mage. If you are filling your raid up with people that are barely contributing, it seems sensible to simply run with fewer people and give the loot to people actually contributing.
---
Essentially that was their attempt but it didn't work out. They didn't have all the data like parry/dodge ect so they added damage to offset it. With that information public now they didn't offset it enough. Yes the bosses do more damage per swing but they didn't attack as often. There are a ton of differences between vanilla and pservers and it ended up making the fights a bit easier on the pservers.
---
&gt;  a progression raid will have one.
---
Not OP, but why is everyone (including you, obv) pretending that every-single-player on this sub will join a progress pve guild? If the guy wants to play ret, let him play ret.
---
Also I highly doubt there will be no diversity in 40man raids, there was back then and there will be now: quit pretending there will be just 3 classes doing the DPS roles among 40 people.
---
Nice swo... wait...

Yeah I'm glad, was annoying being strung along thinking I had an invite. I have no issues waiting until August.

As a priest you need the black «pope hat» from Neffarian

I found a source during 1.x that confirms that they were neutral at that time.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060613210538/http://thottbot.com/?i=494
---
This page is from June 2006.
---
Thottbot doesn't display aggressiveness on the mob page directly, but they display it on any page with that mob linked. Find "Kobold Laborer" on this page, and you'll see they're listed as neutral.
---
Does anyone still have it?
---
Crossbows and Bows are generally what you will see at 60. The hunter class bow is one that's fairly simple to get and will last you awhile.
---
Blood elf sulfur as... not impressed!

Just remember that EU players will have cross realm bgs with Russians. Target calling is it's own separate game unless you call out classes

Maybe archeology but just for the toy collecting.

It is amazing. All classes have their place in the grand scheme of things.

yes
---
This is the main reason I've decided to switch from Holy Paladin to Priest. Having a patchwork of armour pieces bothers me far more than only relying on 1 or 2 healing spells.
---
Guilds will struggle to have 20 people attuned in 2-3 weeks let alone 40 people at level 60 and geared enough to clear the trash to even get to the first boss. Private Servers are cool but they definitely aren't true vanilla WoW.
---
I sure will :) Trying to finish the horde 1-5 guides this weekend.  
---
I also got my 1-20 gnome guide that I have to work on soon.
---
This made me think about something... what if... Blizzard sets up a stream that follows random servers, random zones and just shows how many people are there running around and maybe randomly focuses on players for a minute or two if something is happening or especially for world pvp it hovers over the area where there are &gt;6 players killing each other
---
yes weapon skill is the most effective way to increase TPS AND reduce incoming damage (parry hit, look it up). provided you get a tank sword, which is likely (thunderfury, quelserrar, bloodlords, ....)
---
 that being said, gnome warry who is tripping over his thunderfury is funny as hell
---
That's wholesome. I like it.

I mean, I wasn't really affected by his death emotionally, but I did enjoy his content and understand how he fought the good fight for us gamers (just to put it very simply).
---
And Trump, while not being the end of the world, does have a huge negative impact on the US and on the rest of the world. So I don't know why you'd consider someone a simpleton for being angry about him becoming president.
---
I can't wait for Classic to release and for people to race for World First and realize why it took so long back in the day. I don't think it'll take as long as 152 days that it did before but I am thinking at least 3 months to get 40 players the gear and FR needed to kill Rag.
---
You will encounter far less guns at high tier raids than bows and xbows
---
a tad easier in your own server with literally no one around
---
a robe, like a paladin should be wearing
---
YES! Integrated hard mode! That is SO SMART!
---
Fuck Asmondgold
---
More damage = more rage = more TPS. 
---
Please do some research you clueless dunce.
---
Pretty certain you shouldn't be able to tame beasts that are higher level than you.  This should be reported as a bug if true.
---
I'm looking forward to adding someone to my friends list again. Then maybe another. Then join a guild because I like the people and they like to have fun in the game as opposed to doing all dungeons in the fastest way possible so they can queue up again. I look forward to the difficulty of leveling and the insane lvl 60 quests like the warlock epic mount quest that had me visiting all corners of the world for a larger goal, not world quests where 80% of the time is spent traveling for a 10 mob pull that is easily defeated and then moving on to the next one. I want each class to bring something different, not this homogenous blob we have now (why reduce hunter pets from something that you cared for to a skin selector instead of expanding the pet connection?). And most of all, I want Blizzard to learn something about what people enjoyed about classic so maybe they could put a little bit more of that magic back into retail.

Week 3 will happen. Week 2 if a guild truly no lifes it.
---
Meanwhile private servers handle even more without layering.
---
I must tell you a secret.
---
You only need to wear clown suits in raids, everywhere else you can run around with your cool looking gear.
---
\*inserts mind-blown meme here\*
---
Sounds like an epic item.
---
2 more. One in june and one in july I think. But still.
---
This is some tinfoil thinking but could it be because subs people used to get into stress test/beta will end before next stress test? Or maybe it just a bug, who knows.
---
Because I want my raid to finish AQ40 in 30-40minutes and not in 50-70 minutes because of meme specs.
---
We have better things to do, farming takes time, people want to premade, people have other hobbies.
---
Friendly reminder: Gamergate was about ethics in games journalism.

meh, every nelf hunter uses these. Get a Gorilla or some shit.

Vanilla had questing addons just like this, so

Don't forget theres a chance when a streamer gets bored of playing, so will the vast majority of their following affecting the realm economy and basically causing a dead server

You would certainly save yourself from the burst of anger the moment mage frostnova you down and you are not a gnome.

Sunken Temple is a L. 50-55 dungeon.

Red level mobs?

God damn 50-60 was such a slog. The 20’s were also pretty bad imo

I make the guides to show people in which order they should do the quest and where the quest is :)

You can basically cycle which race/class combo you want and see how all tier sets would look instead of having to watch other race/gender using the sets you plan on getting.
---
Just think of it like this. Paladins are easy as fuck to play. In world pvp 40v40 you can just freedom ur warrior,bubble and go in with sappers etc and Horde can do nothing about it. The skillcealing of playing a shaman is much higher than a paladin just giving you blessings. If ur shaman sucks it sucks to play horde. So alliance is a safecard. Wf totem and totemtwisting is hella fun tough.
---
fair enough. I try to have backup routes in mind incase tails arnt viable, etc

Meh. Dude it's just a game. Relax and have fun. You can do fine with all classes if you practice or grind enough. Don't fall into the minmax trap and become cancer to yourself.

Then by all means, stay in retail or play something else.

The less streamer fans, the better.

Is there some professions that you should not take if you are casual ? Is it a valid plan to more or less ignore professions ?

were you though?
---
Imo hunter's T2 on a Tauren is the most imposing look in Vanilla, ahead of T3 Tauren shamans and Warriors. It looks good on orcs too. On Dwarves, NE and trolls, not so much.
---
Of course, it gives general spell crit.
---
yup, its for the RP for the same faction
---
Alliance will dominate the PVE servers 2:1.
---
It will be equal on PVP servers.

This was me 2005 as warlock. Would it be Wotlk I'm sure I'd get kicked.
---
Actually it's ametuer-ish design. It's one of the first zones bilzzard designed iirc.
---
&gt;The point is that he misunderstood the purpose of my post
---
Yes, because I am simply too dumb to understand Mr. Undergraduate at Medschool, my feeble mind which wrapped itself around two MINT degrees and has served as a software developer for these past 7 years, cannot grasp your greatness.
---
Disagree 40-50 is easy to lvl. You have booty bay stv &gt; uldamn disk quest chain (shattered necklace for ally) &gt; tanaris &gt; feralas &gt; hinterlands &gt; searing gorge. I Would argue 10-30 is harder than 31-60
---
I think in the Beta many Alliance players are from NA. Have you been queuing for BGs on their prime time?
---
30-40 is mostly SM Cathedral and Tanaris/ZF
---
less TPS because the abilities get parried. you are never really lacking rage when tanking.

The whole Duskwood zone is a creepy-shadowy-edge of the seat bad dream zone.

Cannot wait to rub the quests and create the original version of Stitches.

And was him wreck stuff,
---
Over/under on number of players he kills before he dies is 19..
---
I myself only played a month during Legion so I’m not really familie either but I’m choosing Warlock for Classic simply because a pet to aggro for you really helps in MMORPGs and because I read you can play with souls and perform a summoning ritual.  
---
I mean how cool is that? You need people and stuff just to summon a friendly because transportation is hard
---
if you are in a group content doing this then you are selfish as fuck
---
if you are grinding solo or doing anything else, it doesn't matter
---
Never seen this debate, so give me your points.
---
Flying mount bad, walking good. Why?
---
&gt; Not having engineering grenades will not lose you the raid spot. Take whatever profession you want.
---
I think that Engineering is more of a concern for those who are looking to do a lot of PvP
---
It's been a long time since my vanilla days but as I recall you could tame a pet a couple levels higher than you as long as you could tank their damage long enough.
---

Got to take part in both stress tests. Would like to see it the other way around to make the servers more and more stable with loads of people online.

I'd join in on that if I had access. I'm sure I'll find a stream of someone participating though.

So you are telling me that I can now transmog leather and cloth as a mail wearer?  Their scatterbrained decisions with transmog made me get better use out of a private server's own custom transmog system. You could basically buy tokens that let you transfer the appearance of an item in your inventory (going by slot) for less than 10$ of their donation currency (or buy it with badges/pvp currency). If you didn't want to see anyone else's you had the option of disabling the entire system. 
---
Actiblizzard started trying to do shit like slightly improving transmog, and adding godawful garrisons, in response to Wildstar having better shit. Square Enix also blatantly added telegraphs and housing in the same vein (though obviously better than garrisons). Of course nothing they did is even close to the potential that Wildstar had in its mechanics. 
---
All they have to do is copy Wildstar without even trying to pretend its their own crap, and then give the option for people to turn the system off entirely. Now there are basically no legitimate complaints.
---
Hey guys, I'm considering rolling warrior (I used to play druid back in the day) and I have a few questions still :
---
I plan on tanking dungeons on my leveling journey but I ultimately want to play Fury. 
---
Is it necessary to spe prot to be able to tank pre-raid dungeons (scholo, UBRS, etc..) ?
---
If so, I may plan to spe prot until I can get all my pre-raid BIS items for Fury, is it okay to roll on those items even though I'm tanking ?
---
On the other way around, Is it okay to roll on tank gear as Fury warrior (in dungeons mostly, not talking about raiding) to be able to build an offtank set for raid ?
---
Lastly, about professions, I kinda want to take blacksmithing/armorsmith but I'm a bit worried about money making with a warrior. Is it a viable money making profession (even if you don't get the good recipes) ? 
---
Is alchemy something that could be worth picking ? Maybe easier money and herbs selling as well ?
---
I appreciate any kind of answer :) 
---
thanks guys looking forward to playing in August!! Cant' wait!
---
Often times you can min/max and try new builds. While end game is largely 'figured out'. Leveling is far less theory crafted. Most RF on pservers are such because they grind their face off with a good spec. But often they don't know the min max level specs themselves and just do what they think is right/ always have done.
---
A good example is priest. wand+ spirit tab to 19 for everyone, 2 into 2 imp SWP and 1-3 in Shadow focus. Then holy or even disc is better than going more shadow.  Yet, RF 60s all the time argue shadow at this time is better because its what they are used to. Like did you know there Ally or Horde and what race impact this a good amount also. Starshards is actually a strong ability for leveling (i would NEVER, ally priest should just go Dwarf always. You really are hurting groups by not.)  Trolls are best best leveling shadow spec by far. Allys get a OP non shadow spec wand at 42 and horde has to wait until 46.. That doesn't seem like much until you look at shadow who can get a wand at 40 with the same damage. Thats 6 levels for horde verses 2 levels for alliance where shadow will have a wand with +~10 more dps (almost 24% more wand damage).  
---
I also agree there can be some specs that aren't the BEST but are good and add some utility or play diversity and are fine to play. Like ele shaman works, tanky spec 1-h enhance works for leveling far better than most realize. Warriors can level any tree, really there best bet always is to find a healer.
---
The issue does arise when someone wants to ret, enh, and so on end game or pvp premades.  They have invested a lot in saying it will be good, when we know its not.
---
oh no at end game its 100% about combat dagger spec.  it's a shame there isn't a good mainhand sword from naxx until KT.
---
lol I see what you did there
---
https://youtu.be/34mS5GK--cQ
---
Congratulations! Now that's what I call consistency and determination.
---
Is there a version of this with tier 0 on it?
---
i wish more mages would do this for us warriors...thank you
---
I looking forward to see the launch, because I pray that they will have dynamic respawns on quest items and creatures.  
---
Els I might have to skip quests and do something els.
---
&gt;it's ameteur-ish design
---
Totally disagree. Big, open spaces make the world feel like, well... a *world*.
---
One of the things that makes retail WoW feel so much less like a place of adventure and mystery is that every inch of it is crammed with *something*. There's no space. Mulgore and the Barrens were prime examples of the early philosophy to let the world just sort of be there, vast and wild, and if there's anything amateurish about that, I wish they'd be amateurish more often.
---
Nagrand!
---
&gt;walltext for no reason

just roll for loot
---
 Now imagine going to different layer and simply getting him. Yikes. Just because blizzard has no motivation to fix launch overpopulation issues properly.
---
It sucks. I work a factory job. My wife doesn't work and my kids have a lot of extra "needs" (sports, cheer, etc). They won't be this young forever and I don't plan on working like this forever.
---
lmao
---
thanks for... nothing..
---
Dun Morough for me. I am going druid this time, but I will 100% run to Dun Morough and lvl there instead.
---
I mentioned it, as Minkelz said that for the average player, raids will not be a joke, so I mentioned that the average player that will get to end game in classic, will be better than the average end game player in BFA.
---
Felwood, Winterspring, Tirisfal.
---
Aaaand it's a TBC video.....awkward.
---
&gt; Now tell me where I'm wrong
---
Nothing in my post stated you are wrong in any way. I stated that we are not required to consume streamer content, not that we shouldn't.
---
It seems to me you are not out for a discussion, you are looking for a confrontation. Look elsewhere.
---
Just chilling at the moment. All do their own things. Hyping each others over Discord. Playing other games. Sunbathing lol!
---
I'm loving the new classic foliage, looks pretty!
---
The reason why it's important to choose the right class and the right race in classic is because it takes an enormous amount of time to lvl your main character so you are in a way 'stuck' with what you chose. 
---
I remember picking a human paladin when wow released as I liked the warrior/healer aspect but at lvl 40 I was very bored of him due to the boring fighting mechanics  and regretted my decision. Took me forever to level my dwarf hunter afterwards. In pvp at max lvl, the race traits make a huge difference. This is why it's very interesting and important to plan ahead and think carefully of your choice!!
---
Maybe if youre a male hunter but Dragonstalker is S-Tier for the girls
---
Really appreciate the time you took to formulate this response, it was really insightful. Thank you
---
Wow and i thought having almost 10g Was much😂
---
Yep, but I'm in the real Beta. :P
---
Unless u roll a druid, then you're mediocre in everything. 
---
From what I've heard in classic at least.
---
what you call amateurish, is what a lot of ppl love..huge, open areas with one theme. Not these super overloaded, blinking and shining mob infested zones from retail.
---
Name yer pet bro
---
Thank you for your response.
---
Haha, same here.
---
I dont care about the leveling, only having a healspecc etc
---
But having to wear cloth as a paladin is a no go and absolutely mandatory

mark kern said northshire and elwynn was the first zone they designed, then westfall and duskwood.
---
You want to know the number of players on each server before any servers are running?
---
Nothing beats Ashenvale.
---
Trump is doing fine any negative impact is the media spinning their narrative. So who cares. He didn't fight any fight.
---
That is genuinely hilarious.
---
IMO be prot if you are in bad gear for the end game dungeons.  It is possible to not be prot and be okay though as long as your healer is on point/consumables.  If you already have a good chunk of tanking gear you should be able to tank just fine without being prot.  For items, if you plan on rolling on DPS items as the tank make it clear ahead of time/reserve an item or alternatively make the group composition so you don't have competition.
---
Mining is able to also make money if you go blacksmithing.  You can also potentially sell some blacksmithing items if you get the patterns early.  Arcanite crystals will always sell well and thorium should be decent.  If alliance you can also sell sharpening stones I believe (no windfury competition).
---
Good luck.
---
imagine being this person
---
We must consult the crystal ball
---
Same as a Tyranny would be the best form of Government, if only there was an actually just, sane and informed Tyrant.
---
Not even being sarcastic here, I fully agree with you.
---
This is what I plan to do.
---
In stress test I was hitting anywhere between 350 -450. If we don’t get servers in August I’ll be waiting until we do cos for me it’s not worth it otherwise.
---
No, I was asking if there is any wat to predict it. When I played the server Sylvanas was quite popular for Horde PvPers, I was just wondering if the same sort of popularity might be predictable.
---
"We are going to use the same server names as in Vanilla"
---
Okay, then maybe the same spread will occur
---
I do agree with a lot of your points, and we are at the point of trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils,(kind of like the US election) but I cannot agree with you that dynamic respawns is better. 
---
At the start, I did think they were an option, but there is just WAY too much room to abuse it. Every private server that has implemented drastic dynamic respawns (because there is dynamic respawns in retail, just not a 5 second timer), people are able to abuse it to the fullest extent in AoE grinding and farming. It completely alters the economy, and it makes questing in caves and other close - quarters areas nearly impossible, even with a 5 man group because mobs pop up before you can even reset your mana and HP.
---
I don’t get why people ask questions like this; none of us could ever know the answers to them, we aren’t on the dev team
---
There is 0 chance of me not wearing Felcloth if it drops. I don't give a fuck if it's BiS or not.
---
&gt; Also it's fun to blame tank for not making enough threat.
---
Than fun won't last long. Rogue and dps Warriors are the most overplayed classes, and every guild wants tanks :D
---
it's not a real guild, nor is it likely to ever be one
---
it's a parody of those old guild ads
---
Pretty sure they said it will be new server names.
---

Moo plays warrior, trives also. Perp plays rogue

---
So my guess is that it does not count whether you reported anything or not.
---
What your asking for is a guess. Nothing like this has ever been done so close your eyes and point. Whichever server you land on is horde favored.

alex jones plays wow?

So everyone is chosing blindly I guess? Thanks, just wanted to know

yeah, was a mistake - I re approved the post.

In real Classic you couldn't tame a pet higher level than you. So that's a bug.
---
Obviously not, don’t be silly
---
thanks man
---
You should make it work with QuestLogEx or better yet replicate that functionality yourself.
---
Barlow has maybe 2000 viewers. Thats a joke. 
---
Then there is Stevinho with maybe 500-1000 viewers. Even more a joke. 
---
Dont know anyone else. 
---
They will run some small community guilds, but they will have no real impact on anything.
---
If your colorblind how are you going to know what the colors are that are on the list?
---
Second stress test cap got upped to 10
---
Jesus, no. Why is everyone so toxic about this? Im simply asking if there IS a way to chose a server the smart way
---
Ive been enjoying watching tipsout
---
Hooooly shit!
---
I only knew the Onyxia Video, but this guy is pure gold...damn, compared to that, Gny. Sgt. Hartman (Full Metal Jacket) looks like the pope giving the _Urbi et Orbi_ blessing :D
---
No idea what this is
---
Yes, a crystal ball.
---
but nobody actually did this in retail vanilla
---
Why would a top guild choose a NE Tank? Because of that 1% Dodge chance? Thats literally nothing.
---
Top guilds don't have problems healing the tank, Top guilds struggle to keep their TPS above the 1k DPS (which will increase in Classic since Private Servers had higher armor values).
---
Thats why Tanks go 0/31/20 Specc with TF. They don't need mitigation, they need TPS.
---
You know that UK is on EU, right ? 
---
And yeah they will stay in EU server pool even after brexit ;)
---
I was under the impression that the spelladin build was competitive enough to warrant a spot, maybe not in a guild rushing realm first but otherwise.
---
For me it's in the top 5 at least. I didn't like it for the longest time, but then I actually saw a druid wearing it on a private server and holy shit is it cool on a nightelf.
---
Depends on what level you'll be playing, Bis pre and post Rhok'delar are all crossbows
---
Has this had some console commands to increase the floor clutter?
---
Yea I don't think that's it since I made sure to report everything that looked fishy during my time in the stress test
---
I'm gettin on it, let me log on pserver
---
My guild likes bfa, raiding, m+ and most will only try. 
---
I have only 3 other people in our 30 man raid roster taking time off when it launches. 2 are irl friends that i used to lan with in bc and wrath. 
---
A few casual guildies will be switching though. 
---
Where as for bfa launch most took a few days off and some took 2 weeks off to level and gear out.
---
Ive already discussed that i will be playing main game alot less if at all when classic comes out. 
---
I have a kid, work two jobs so i can only really put my hobby time into one mmo at a time.

Thought they found out dodge was 1.5% higher?
---
I'm not black and white colorblind. I can see color, just find it difficult to distinguish between things like blues and purples. From time to time in mmo's i'll choose a color for my character i think is correct only for someone down the line to point out it isn't. It's just annoying more than anything. If no one helps I'm cool, i'll just choose whatever like I've always have, it's not a big deal.
---
Ret/Enhancement/Boom are far, far, far behind everyone else. In almost all circumstances, they deal Less than half the damage of other classes. But that's really only a problem in AQ40/Naxx. The content you can AFK-through is mostly MC/BWL.   
---
But killing C'thun? That requires 40 people who are looking at their screens intently. Imagine you only make a mistake 1/80 attempts, and you're playing with 40 people. If everyone is making mistakes at the same rate as you, every other attempt is doomed.

---
As someone with an ample backround in radio i can say that his voice sucks,and i got a headache from listening to him mouth breathe and trying to talk at the same time.
---
Im a minmaxer but i do think people are obssessed with it and it is being discussed way too much. Even in retail, there are off-race picks in guilds competing for world first. For classic, which PvE content is easy by todays standards, i think people are putting too much focus on minmaxning, which might hurt the community because it will think it is very important for progression, which in reality it is not.
---
Just to be clear, i do think minmaxing is great but i also wish people were more aware how much impact it really has, especially in vanilla
---
Not sure most guilds.  I can always see at least 1 OT bear.  They will do okay DPS when their tanking job is finished and give MT extra crit for threat gen.  Seems at least viable to me and casual guilds will probably even have prot pallys tanking.
---
The first is a Ouija-Board.
---
The second a Crystal Ball.

The third is used coffee grounds.

The fourth is the seer from Asterix.

The last are assorted Tarot cards.

Probably the most hardcore  in this thread yet. Just happy to have from 26th of augusti and 3 weeks ahead.
---
You never use blood fury as a tank. It’s weapon skill vs berserking. Either you use an axe and you’re orc or you don’t and you’re troll. Or you go Tauren if you think threat won’t be an issue and are more concerned about survivability.
---
"I'm coming all over the place"
---
No keybinds, proper vanilla
---
You are completely out of touch with reality. Read the Mueller report.
---
Yea, skill books are one of those mixed bag things.  Some people were super unlucky, but on the other side, you actually cared about getting them.  I think that's what I missed the most about the games back then.  Getting gear and character progression actually made you feel good.  Now it seems like a race to AotC and that's it.  
---
I miss the days that you filled out your tier set felt good.
---
Yes -- filling the raid with hybrids, you may as well be filling the raid with AFKs. Nobody wants to run a four-hour MC.
---
You are completely out of touch with reality. Read the Mueller report
---
He/She mean't class restricted. :)
---
For me it'll always be Silithus. The gloomy, mysterious... Almost alien landscape with creatures that are equally foreign with pockmarked hives and the remains of an ancient empire and battle. Cultists and elementals too! 
---
It also feels like the only zone in the game where we have no control over with exception to EPL. We've been able to create a small foothold but we're far from being comfortable.
---
On top of that it has a lot of lore associated with it that spans thousands of years.
---
A Silithus for the restofus.
---
Elwynn is my favorite for sure. I also love Westfall.
---
You are absolutely wrong about weapon speed, you only want fast weapons if you’re rage capped. Slow weapons are actually better if you’re not rage capped because windfury scales on weapon damage (not weapon dps) and slower weapons always have higher weapon damage, assuming the same tier. Also, the percentage of tanks who get thunderfury is insanely low. Bindings don’t even drop until av patch and most guilds average a binding every 3-6 months, and you can get the same binding and have 0 tfuries.
---
Hit cap was super important yea.  I don't know how I feel about hit though.  On one hand I liked the rpg aspect of it, and on the other hand I didn't feel bad when they removed it.

LOL right there with ya.. AI for ALL THE PEOPLE (even the ones running past me) a quick wave and an AI and off I go
---
I thought the same time. On a recent private server I rolled a priest to heal. I'd healed before on a paladin but it's boring to just spam flash of light. 
---
As an ally priest I fucking hate paladins now. Their heals are so quick and so efficient they just snipe your best heals. You are pretty much forced into using flash heal to even get a heal in and that just wastes your mana. We are progressing through Naxxramas atm and that raid is very well designed for priests and druids where MC and BWL is more paladin territory. When the raid is taking enough damage that the paladins can't snipe it all then it becomes fun. Weaving in normal heals with greater heals, renews and the odd shield or prayer. Very versatile.
---
GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME.
---
I mean the desert in Vol‘Dun exists, and I really like it, it’s just not big enough imo
---
If you decide to go for full T2 you might be pigeoned into keeping it until way after Naxx. The 8-set is so incredibly strong, especially with the ZG trinket, that you will outheal many T3 priests unless they fuck you over by overwriting your renews. One of the reasons I made sure to only get three pieces of T2 for the amazing 3-set.
---
2 words to ruin anyones attempt to clear mc week 1 or 2. Tranq shot

Seeing as you dont need BIS to do anything before Naxx or AQ40...

...well thats how.

---
In that case I apologize, I interpreted that your reply was how WoW would be great for anyone to play in a general sense, but I actually asked for feedback from people that are in the same situation as I am, I felt like it didn't apply to me. 
---
I don't think I can only draw joy from playing at the very end but that's literally the only way I've played the game. Not because of skill but because of freedom and time invested. And since that's how I used to play it, I simply wonder, based on everything I wrote, if there are other people that have the same concerns/thoughts about this as I do, and how they plan to play the game/if they feel like the experience will be a good one with a lot less time invested etc. And I got some good answers about that. 
---
I don't understand why you seem to get offended by what I posted though, but that's probably on me as well. Any way I meant no harm, thank you for taking the time.
---
T1: I'm so good I killed the bad guys and wore their armor
---
T2: I'm so good I had this badass armor custom made for me
---
T3: I'm so good they dressed me in this fancy armor and asked me to pose for a picture
---
(this is a joke, also only commenting on the looks not content)
---
I like this idea
---
Well thats not the case now. it procs on dots / pets / DS itself.
---
and you dont even have to drain the dying mob, just as long as DS is channeling and a mob dies from your source's you gain the buff.
---
I'm disappointed there's no clips from the wire with WOW Omar's face edited over the top.
---
Tbh, in my experience they'll sheep the Mob you're fighting, allowing it to regen back to max health inbetween your wep swing \*cries in 3.5 wepspeed"
---
should be colour blind options  you can access  in options  before even creating  a character
---
right ... You should stop calling others "simpleton" then
---
What is French Perth and YMMV? I am in normal Perth.
---
That’s the dedication that you’ll need when Classic drops
---
You're missing out on a huge part of the game though, I both hate and suck at pvp but I wouldnt never roll on a pve server in classic
---
They should in system (or interface?) have a colorblind option that will align with yours (IIRC) I'm kinda in the same boat only I'm not colorblind so much as I have color saturation issues, so if light blue is right next to white, they'll both look the same to me, purple fog on a blue floor? yup not seeing it either, taupe and yellow? nope no chance. those color blind tests with the dots and number? yeaa I can't see any numbers LOL. (TL:DR MS has fucked my eyes)
---
Wholesome post
---
Hunter T2 represent!
---
You are the hero we need tonight! :) Thank you.
---
30-40 isn’t the longest, it’s significantly shorter than the 2 brackets that come after it.
---
Most people aren't going to clear all content, not because it's insanely difficult but because it has a large time requirement that regular people either dont want or can't do.
---
Week 1 MC is possible, but how realistic is it that you have 40 people that hit 60 and have at least some basic shit gear enough to actually kill rag, warriors being the obvious roadblock there.
---
Does it matter if people no life wow and kill all the raid content as soon as it's released? Should blizzard balance the game around what is realistically going to be a small % of the actual playerbase?
---
I think it's good that rank 14 is out of reach for most players, even if the grind is disgustingly over the top, exclusivity breeds desire and desire keeps people playing and pushing for their goal.
---
I know it's a meme but there should be no changes to the core systems of classic, you speculate that few will stick around, if that is the case then I say so be it, let classic be what it is.
---
Sorry dude the initial colors are random so I'm figuring a way to do this lol. Can you look at this screenshot and tell me if you recognize the green hair and pale green skin ?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/9FhuQKm](https://imgur.com/a/9FhuQKm)
---
Druids bring some amazing utility innervate is great and they have the only battle rez in the game. 
---
Also you can be a raid off tank with the right gear and cut down on the number of warriors in the raid.
---
Probably bigger on the horde side, my thinking is most big streamers will be horde and therefor all their fans will do the same. Another thing is most who want to tryhard in pvp or just gank usually go horde as you have a pretty big advantage on racials there
---
Easy content isn't necessarily bad as long as it's fulfilling and rewarding. 
---
Braindead content tacked on on top of a crappy reward system like we have in BfA on the other and is a problem. You have to go out of your way to get a good experience in that game.
---
What did you do? Curious.
---
I still have my first hunter pet, seeing one day they are your best friend, nothing like it.
---
RemindMe! 70 days
---
rogue*
---
wrath? the most overrated garbage i've ever seen, extremely unbalanced, lfg, heroic dungeons were an aoe grindfest, the only redeeming thing about that garbage xpac was ulduar.
---
And I did level a 60 mage and 60 rogue in vanilla, stop being in denial, you're not special.
---
What made you go private?
---
Just wondering since I've been in wow since day one, so I've seen what I would characterize as a decline, but if you started in legion, you wouldn't have vanilla as a reference?
---
depends  if you guys are trying to go hard at launch, if that is the case yeah its completely  random. 
---
 Otherwise you can wait a week let it all shake out a bit since you wont really get true number until a few months in when a bunch of people have decided they don't like it.
---
It's not the expectation of class balance, it's more the inability to accept how it really is. Typical millenial mindset, "I know I'm not helping but if I look like I'm trying really hard it's just as good as helping". I'm not worried, none of them will be around very long much less hit 60.
---
Thanks for posting so many helpful resources, you're awesome.
---
i think there are addons that will do this for you, the problem is blizz made wow and it was very rough around the edges, between 1.0 and 1.12 they smoothed some of them edges but others were still very rough and in smoothing some others appeared just as rough as the ones they smoothed, it wasn't until about wrath that i would say the game was in a nice smooth place, and then they added more edges in cata and beyond and the smoothing seems to have stopped.
---
the version of classic is the best we can really hope for and you can use addons to give the added extras like we used to in vanilla, in all fairness the the things missing from vanilla that we are getting in classic is mostly QoL things that don't break the game by them not being there
---
How bad are the consumes for warrior? So many people complain about leveling, but what could really be murder in the long run is having to farm for the BOE gear, farming drops like Ironfie, and then on top of it trying to find a way to get the mad consumes that Fury might require (I assume it needs a ton of Groms, on top of other stuff).
---
At what level do you get Honored in your own faction ? I know exalted is around lvl 40 ?
---
Saurfang once pissed in a lake. He created the Maelstrom.
---
Retail wow felt way too easy and i didnt like the story. So i tried vanilla and love it
---
You'd want mirah's Song anyway because you'll use it till BWL after you get Vis'kag
---
Hi
---
There was this addon for retail that did a nice dialog animation "storytime" or something maybe it will work on classic too
---
Tier 3 has Great setbonus and is equivilent to tbc stat bonuses. Before Tier 3 its not often worth it sadly but its often an upgrade with Tier 2s just not always bis sadly. Rogues fighting vs hunter for bis gear. Will be fun

Discussing private server usage is prohibited on this subreddit. So you'd have to look around for yourself.
---
"OH GOD THANK YOU, SIR!" - Future me.
---
A voice over addon is apparently against blizzard ToS, someone tried to make one and got lawyer'd, as for just reading there's an add-on called storyline which kinda acts like a jrpg where when you interact with quest mobs a window pops up with theirs and your models to talk, it's being ported to classic here: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24938-1.13.2.0.html
---
when did blizzard ever state that they will increase the level cap?
---
Druids have the best mobility and heal over time spells. They also have unique abilites in innervate anf combat rez.
---
I really liked the game when I was playing it in beta.  Thought it was a cool concept all around but ran out of things to do eventually (which could have been added in). Too bad :(
---
Recommending private servers is against the subreddit's rules.
---
I'm sure you can find what you're looking for with a Google search. There's a very popular (~12k pop) vanilla server as well as an instant 60 server to practice high end PvP.
---
This!
---
you can turn off instant quest text
---
Yeah i see, the hair looks green to me. The skin does look greenish too.
---
that ground clutter kinda ruins it though.
---
Just play a class that uses their tier sets. Warrior tanks, priest healers, rogues and hunters. It'll take you a fair amount of time to get the full shebang ofc. Loot is rare in vanilla.
---
Perhaps even more embarrassing is that it is actually a Wrath video...
---
You clearly have not read the Mueller report.  Some other negative impacts: attacking our law enforcement and Intel community, vitriol in political discourse and bullying of private citizens, violation of foreign emoluments clause (gifts), actions against LGBT community reducing rights in healthcare, a man with a strong history of misogynistic comments elevated to a high office is an endorsement of that misogyny, tariffs that hurt our own farmers, demonization of the Free press for any negative coverage. These are real things happening.
---
Geez, you got it bad. :(
---
Good to know with the option though!
---
I dont think its worth. You would have to give up important other talents for a unreliable cc that is in nerver needed
---
A little off topic but in the beta is SW the “main” city everyone uses or is it IF? I remember back in vanilla everyone was always in IF and my old crappy family computer couldn’t even handle it when I went there for trades or quests. Used to have to meet people at the tram.
---
I could tell you but the mods would kill me.
---
The entire wrath expansion was carried by its plot, that's why so many people like it.
---
Thanks for that, I'll definitely be using it.
---
I'm going to say .... Feralas.
---
&gt;Now we know the ideal composition, and a lot of my friends want to try to clear MC week 1 or week 2 at a maximum in classic release. And we will.
---
The record to first Ragnaros kill on private servers is currently 10 days and was set by an extremely organized group of players who have minmaxed the race several times.
---
Teldrassil, for me. I really enjoy the music, and the fantastical feel to the zone.
---
Did you get my reply? I got 5 of yours lmao
---
soccer moms, vegans and libturds sum it up

Hi, if you want to tank dngns while leveling I'd highly reccomend arms spec. Swapping to def stance after a charge will give you rage for threat and arms is great for leveling once you get sweeping strikes. At level 58ish I'd reccomend going prot and building your own groups. Let the other melee know you are rolling on the dps gear and you wont have any problems. If you want to main fury thou you dont need those preraid tank blues. Good to have yes but hopefully you wont be asked to tank a mob that crushes your health bar in 1 swing. Also building and tanking groups can be a pain, much funner joining as dps and grabbing leftovers the tank doesnt want. As your guild progresses tanks get geared up quick and fury's will get full tank sets anyway. Also I would not reccomend tanking 5 mans as fury, its doable but threat is an issue for a full prot tank so if in similar gear to the dps you will be tanking with taunt on CD. When you are in purples you can hold aggro and dps as fury in fury gear, maybe throwing a shield on for bosses. At least that's what iv noticed on priv servers. As for making money find a good healer friend. You can fury spec 2man dm east for books, shards, rich thorium veins (if they exist in classic), and decent vendor loot. If soloing your stuck farming the things everyone else can also farm. Building and tanking groups with a rare recipe or boe item reserved can land you a huge payout. Strat live reserve first orb drop could be a nice cash out for an hour run. Cant say much for professions, if you land a recipe early on definitely good but the market will be oversaturated quicky is my guess.
---
Go mourn him on his subreddit then. This is clearly a karma grab by OP. The guy was a low life simpleton. I don't feel right speaking ill of the dead but there it is. He was politically biased, and acted childish(wishing people would get cancer).
---
Not with this stupidly short aggro range.
---
k so, i didn't specifically mention using ONLY fast weapons, but for fights that give you heaps of rage, heroic strike spam is a shitload better when your wepspeed isn't 2.7, which generally, none of the high power axes have, considering there are fuckall high power axes to begin with
---
I loved the first beta I played in 2011, wasnt so keen on it when i tried it again near the end of its life.
---
The Feralas is my favorite!
---
Lol...
---
Atm it's stormwind mainly because of the level 30 cap. Once we get 60 cap it will be iron Forge, because of the close proximity to black rock mountain.
---
Maybe stop being a pussy? Holy fuck I can’t imagine having to play with someone like you.
---
For real man the whole zone and quest lines just read like a great story.
---
iirc it's the 7.3.5 client
---
I research a lot of wow classic stuff, so I am glad I found it. I have an interview I found with him too. See comments
---
Agreed, I love that zone but really hate horde levelling so only ever get to it at end game as Alli when doing the waterlords quests.
---
That was some of the most annoying in game chat I’ve ever heard, if someone was speaking to me like that mid game they’d be getting abandoned
---
i member when blizzard used to release the tier sets before the patch came out... it was so exciting up until wrath and they started reciclying tear pieces
---
I research a lot of wow player history, so I was happy to find it. I am adding a interview with him.. see edit
---
Who wins the biggest victim award?
---
He's...Not the most sane nut in the peanut can, let's put it like that. He exaggerates and makes stuff up on the spot.
---
I want to join this guy's guild for Classic.
---
It's against tos to make an addon like that. Somebody was making a quest addon to rewrite chunks of the zones and voice act them to make them more engaging but Blizzard shut it down.
---
Plus I think they are doing some of this intentionally. How many people can we cram onto a layer? How many into a starter area before it becomes impossible to complete the intro quests as every mob is dead?
---
A) yes, it's a valid point, however, it will still have some difficulty due to how they made gear and world buffs. Molten Core is literally the easiest raid in entire WoW, so yeah I expect people to clear it quite fast. Starting from BWL however, I expect it to take much longer, especially since on Pservers, a lot of information about the bosses (such as armor, resistances, etc etc) are wrong. Just looking at a recent bluepost we already know that TPS is going to be much weaker on Pservers. What I find quite funny by the way, that on Retail, we already know in the Beta stages how to clear heroic and mythic raids on release, and then people get World first in 1 day. I mean…
---
B) yes, we know how hardcore the grind is. Time and effort investment = rank14. Yes, it's a brainless grind, and it takes extremely long, but since when did your arena rating correctly state your skill level? Especially now on BfA where they are still letting AFK resto shamans run around for 3 months now. A true indicator of skill level will mostly come down to reputation in your server. Even on private servers, there were several guys I knew who were dogshit at the game but they just grinded out the arena rating so it looks cool. And this is how it should be: skill is identified by reputation and analysis. A hunter on &lt;REDACTED&gt; named Athell, I consider to be the best Hunter in the entire game. That guy was insane, yet he only hit 2550 because he only played Jungle in 2s, meanwhile a much more retarded Hunter hit 2800 because he played Thug.
---
Classic will last quite long my friend.

Someone say thunder fury, blessed blade of the windseeker?

I do want i more pale skin. To me options 3 and 4 look pale. 4 looks bluish but i dunno about 3, is it the green pale? With the hair color i wanted a dark/black color, the last two options look darkest to me but the last looks like blue or maybe even purple in it? The second last hair color looks like it has red in it to me? Am i close or no?

Ok so I'm confused. I heard the were NOT using any updated models or graphics or animations but this does not look like 100% Vanilla to me. Can someone elaborate or link me to article/thread with a nice Q&amp;A? Thanks in advance. P.S. Grats man. that's what Vanilla was and will be to me... ALL about the adventures and the journey\^\^ Much grats.

Hi, /u/Dookman

They also had the atlas with the epic music. Also the old forum layout was nicer. The modern one looks like twitter.

Blacksmithing, maybe Enchanting.

wowserver subreddit is what you are looking for

i'm pretty sure mine is deuteranopia
---
I thought it was but I only recognised Ice Lance which is a TBC skill, but yeah most definitely not vanilla.
---
I’ve been clearing all the notifications since the entire comment section is majority negative minmaxers missing the point completely. 
---
However I saw someone spouting off that ‘you won’t raid AQ without engi in muh elite guild’ and since I never got to AQ I don’t know what mechanic he has in mind.
---
But yes I am well aware engineering IS hugely powerful in pvp
---
If you can wait a few days, I'm sure there'll be a tool that'll record server population by faction. Still, that's quite early and won't be any indication of how the realm will look in a few months from that point.
---
Tried a crystal ball yet?
---
Sure, slave
---
If private servers are any guide most servers will be alliance favoured, remains to be seen though. 
---
One thing you can do is avoid streamer servers because they attract retards like flies to shit. They will also be heavily favoured by whatever faction the streamer is. I kinda hope all the big streamers roll on the same server.
---
I can't compare with BFA flasks, my only recent experience with retail is less than a month on Legion.
---
However in Vanilla flasks were mostly used for raiding and since they were quite expensive to make it was usually a guild effort (it shouldn't be hard to find guildies to make the run with you).
---
The major difference between a flask and a potion is that flasks persist through death.
---
The 3 major ones that I remember last 2 hours and add 1200 HP to your max health (a tank has something 5 or 6k HP) or 2000 mana to your max mana points or +200 spell power (not sure on this one though).
---
I'd say 99.9% tanks will have the +1200HP in raids, but the other flasks are for the more try-hard players.
---
FWIW if you're a blacksmith there's the same concept of a special forge hidden in a dungeon (Blackrock depths) where you can only make certain items.
---
Technically gathering. Mining/herb combo.
---
I wish I could do this. :(
---
Tbh I will roll class on which set I think is the most beautiful. Right now its T2 Paladin
---
We had Oceanic servers in Vanilla. They just weren't there at launch, and people didn't really want to switch realms.

And NA servers had more active pops so some AU players often just decided to deal with the ping rather than play on the closer Oceanic ones.

---
Well said bro, though you still need to put more weight on skill and preparation. 
---
Skilled t2 dps &gt; failing t1 dps
---
Consistent shadowpriest low dps is better than mage who dies couple of times every boss. Dead players cant to damage
---
Prepared t2 dps &gt; lazy t1 dps
---
Consumables play huge role in vanilla, we didnt have battle and guardian elixir back then, you can stack very potent ammount of buffs, but considering wipes you would need to farm up alot of them, or farm up alot of money
---
Granted tryhard guilds will consist of skilled/prepared t1 dps, but not all guilds will be tryhards.
---
Mu guild back in vanilla was casual friendly, we had some raiding mums even and we made it up to Huhuran. We didnt have luxury or perfect raid composition and I prefered to take meme spec who were skilled and prepared over lazy and failing t1 dps.
---
Back then and it did work for us

There, just leave your post like that, it's all good :).
---
Classic is going to be so different from Vanilla, when everyone was trying stuff and having a good time.
---
This time around it's going to be 90% elitist tards saying you're shit because you don't min-max your DPS in Scholomance.
---
Virgin Godsword vs Chad Thunderfury. Old School Godswords just look plain bad, yes most think look bad in OSRS but damn...
---
who cares economy is fine

To be honest I’m very unlucky of the time I get back into wow , only playing mop, bfa and wod with two of them arguably being the worst
---
I can GUARANTEE everyone here that this Coffe\_Kaffe person never bothered to spend a second to look over the math for Ret Paladins DPS, but instead choose to just parrot preconceived notions of what Ret can do.
---
Ret is more than viable as a DPS spec. It's just not optimal but who cares. You need 40 players for for a raid. I would much rather have the Retpala that show up every week with consumes and do 20% less damage than your average Fury Warrior.
---
It's easy to talk out of your ass about what is the "theoretical best composition" for any raid, but it's pretty obvious you never had to organize a raid yourself. If you did you would realize how valuable just having people consistently show up is.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the labourers were aggressive too, as well as the cave spiders in the nelf zone and the cave trolls in the dwarf/gnome zone (not 100% sure on this one).
---
I understand that thinking, you should take a look at Esfands stream if you feel that way, people as him "what should i play in classic" and instead of saying things like "pick this class to maximize your dps" he always asks one question "what do you want to do" then he always tell the person that classic is all about having a good time. yes there will always be elitists, but there is a vast majority of people who are just excited to have more people playing again
---
like some sort of Big Brother situation?
---
There is a reason people say race does indeed matter. If you get butthurt over this, and unfollow, maybe classic isnt for you after all.
---
You. Are. A. LEGEND!
---
That's exactly what i was after. Thank you very much.
---
To be honest, if you haven’t played I’d suggest waiting until release to give it a go!
---
!reminder 75 days
---
People who think Vanilla was better than WOTLK and TBC didn't play Vanilla.
---
You actually have no idea what you are talking about.  TBC was vanilla wow perfected.  WOLTK was where where the modern wow woes began.  If you actually played the game you would understand this, but you didn't play the game so you are just trying to justify your own viewpoint by making up experiences that you have no clue about.
---
People like you are the reason why the classic community it often regarded as toxic.  You have a superiority complex and act like you know better than other people.  It's fine if you want to like Vanilla better than TBC, I can actually respect that viewpoint.  However, to claim that TBC added nothing positive to the game is just denial and ignorance, especially when you never even played it.
---
Cool! My regret was mainly seeing my cousin and brother enjoying their first pick, sticking with it and making their way through molten core while i was stuck in stranglethorn vale with my second character. Took my whole summer vacation to catch up but boy was I glad when I finally did.
---
Your always gonna need someone to swing nightfall! Ret and enhance fit perfectly into that and alot of guilds ive been in will let someone go ret or enhance to do it for a laugh as they are still bringing something to increase everyones dps even if theirs is sub par and it saves one of your off tanks worrying about it too much.
---
&gt;My thoughts on this is add items that make those classes better. What about a better version of wolf's head healm? Or similar stuff.
---
As I replied to another guy here. Making niche items which 'fixes' classes/specs seems weird. Wolfshead makes druids do close to double the DPS, from just having 1 specific item. I wouldn't call that great balancing.
---
I remember once I was level my undead warrior in stranglethorn valley and an entire ally runs past me the priest MCs me and the rest of the raid buffs me nothing beats being a horde in classic with kings and might. I later grouped up with a shammy and got windfury totem I felt like a god.
---
Np man sry for the wait i had to feed my dog meanwhile and also search for color names on google like an idiot.
---
Shouldn’t have an issue getting into a raiding guild with either, but I’d say the priest would probably be easier.  Can never have enough healers.
---
That’s an interesting opinion. I don’t see what about it is amateurish. I’d have liked it to be a little bigger and have a river coming from stonetalon mountains to stonecairn lake.
---
Warriors would need to generate literally 50% more threat to come close to touching a druid with manual crowd pummeler. Also I don't know what warped memories of vanilla you have (probably from before druids were buffed enormously in the talent rework), but even a string of parry haste crits won't insta-gib any tank. This isn't TBC, bosses just don't hit that hard relative to the tanks health pool.
---
Hey my gf has ms did you get optic neuritis? She got that and that's how she got diagnosed. But thankfully her vision is back to normal
---
What kind of tech are we talking?
---
I came back to this post after 2 days. Wow. Some people are way too oversensitive just because someone wanted to know other people's experiences. This is actually worse than the blizzard forums.
---
&gt; You didn’t eliminate the competition... he still wants the pet.. he still doesn’t have the pet. 
---
At the end of the day, I got the pet without losing any time myself. Which is what matters. I get your point though.
---
Tech?
---
Just the fact you took the time to do that for me is great, thank you and continue to be excellent!
---
And the music only adds to it.
---
Yes this is the case. You would have to be in the very top 1% of elite guilds before a Retpala really hurts your raid. 
---
Or let's put it the other way. Your guild have to be utterly garbage tier if the Retpala is the reason you arent clearing. I generally find people to be such hypocrites when it comes to these things.
---
People tell you how Ret is completely unviable as a class because it does less damage than a rogue or fury warrior, meanwhile the same guild wont bat an eye over bringing 4 Hunters to the same raid even though Hunters do objectively less damage and you only ever need 2 for Tranq shot.
---
wait shit
---
EDIT: I meant Teach, Apologies.
---
Fair enough
---
I mean even for a non colorblind person those colours are hard af to distinguish

---
Actually, I headcanoned one set for PvP at AQ stage, and it doesn't look all that shabby. Of course some pieces don't have the optimal throughput because the presence of strength and such waste item value for pure healing purposes, but they are at least plate/mail. Most of the colors are still gold/red.

---
Ahhh what a typical vanilla raid, half the raid not doing anything.
---
Jokes aside this is a great picture, probably my new wallpaper for a bit till classic releases!
---
No way BFA is under WoD, it should be little below Cataclysm and MoP
---
Can you just switch layers on will?
---
you dont need professions to anything, if you dont want to gather things mining/herbalism/skinning/fishing/cooking you can just farm mobs for vendor loot or usually you'd farm some more spesific items that will sell on AH or whatever is the most fun and efficient for you for money. Having gatherer profession will give you more options tho. 
---
Alchemy/Tailoring/Leathercrafting have items that have cooldown so that is passive income if you just level it that point. For example in tailoring  Mooncloth is like 4 day cooldown but one cooldown can make 16 slot bag for example and people will need a lot of bags for themselves, banks, alts as long as the game goes, its also used for very good chest pieces for cloth classes, those require about 10 mooncloths per piece so just using your own cooldowns for it it takes 40 days to get 10 and imagine if you upgrade 10 bag slots for your characters its another 40 days. I'd say thats best and you could just have that for mooncloth. Alchemy have similar which transmutes arcane crystals to arcanite bars (used by lot of good Blacksmithing recipes) For that item you need rare gem from mining and then your profit purely by difference of arcane crystal / arcanite bar price from AH. This can be good or very bad early on depending how server will grow up but very least you can sell your CDs. Leatherworking have the worst one but there could be less competition for it and it to have a very solid money value too. So one of these probably is worth in the long run anyway.  
---
blacksmithing/enchanting are money sinks and you'd probably only want those if you know what your doing
---
engineering brings extra fun, utility, DPS but not needed to enjoy the game.
---
I remember when I heard the news. I was just about to take a huge test for that would advance my career, decided I’d watch some totalbiscuit vids to calm my nerves before I went in for it, only to see RIP throughout the comment section. Needless to say, wasn’t a good day. 
---
He’s going to be missed by the gaming community as a whole.
---
As a druid healer, I... gotta agree. But when TBC came around... Oh boy. Best time I've ever had in WoW. Healing was a lot of fun.
---
I like it ! :)
---
Druid is just really hard to heal with. They have the highest burst heal and with innervates and mana potions they can be the masters of the healing meters. Without those tools you might as well melee the boss and throw an odd rejuv. If you want to be successful as a druid healer you will really have to learn your class and demand that you also have a right to the good loot. I see so many druids who are still walking about in T1 and T2 by Naxx. No wonder they don't heal much, some guilds are really retarded. 
---
Unfortunately I can't tell you what makes a druid great at healing because I don't know it myself. But we have two druids of similar gear and one almost doubles the other's healing.
---
I'd imagine the closest you will get is if servers are announced prior to launch you could track if guilds are specifying which they will be choosing in their recruitment posts. 
---
However, servers seem to snowball in population for various reasons and this will only be seen after launch. Thinking of things like server C becomes the go to PVP server or players join server F because it has the most successful raid guilds.
---
I can appreciate why you might like to know though as no one wants to end up on a dead server, hopefully blizzard keeps an eye on populations this time round if they do try and manage them with free transfers. Dragonmaw EU went from being one of the most popular realms in Vanilla to a dead realm because of this.
---
The way it was has elements that diluted the design philosophy. Flying destroyed Wpvp and lfg and easy mode dungeons diminishes the community
---
Why do you care so much that people wants to min max their racial traits? You clearly also said "It doesn't really matter", when it fucking does, don't tell people lies. 25% resist bonus matters. Escape artist matters. Other racial traits matters for their own reasons. Garbage post dude.
---
Reminds me of my trip to Yellowstone.
---
Cant decide... guess ill play them all. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I see them as a bit watered down when compared to the first two tiers
---
It's just crazy how much it helps when you are a rogue or a warrior. 
---
Don't have beta but I play warrior on a Pserver atm and people are very kind, gives me buffs/mage food/healthstones/hp pots and even green gear because they know the struggle
---
YES!! YESYESYESYESYESYES
---
PLEASE BLIZZARD! I IMPLORE YOU! DO THIS!!!
---
YES, MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK FROM SHEER EXCITEMENT.
---
Can't do that but there's an add-on called Storyteller or Storyline or something that makes quest text more immersive. It's great imho
---
Make sure to uninstall / remove those files taking up space.
---
Same here dude.
---
Unsubbing at this point, see you in August.
---
I found a guild that is more about the community and playing the game through and enjoy it than rush to lvl 60 and raid. You will find a group of people that fit what you want to achieve in the game.
---
People on this sub need to chill out haha
---
I dont need a source to know that 10% attackspeed generates more threat than 5% more hitpoints.
---
Not my fault you have low IQ.
---
For me it's TBC&gt;Vanilla&gt;WotLK&gt;Cata&gt;everything else (granted, I barely played Cata+, but I heard Cata had good moments like hard heroics and still-old-ish talent trees).
---
I hope we see more "oddball" builds in classic and not the same old tired bullshit
---
Remindme! 79 days
---
this is the most privileged comment i've ever read. of course someone who is for trump would have no political needs other than a "good economy", what ever that fucking means.
---
&gt; It would be like the Giga WOW! server camera.
---
&gt;&gt;like some sort of Big Brother situation?
---
This is basically what they did.. sorta.. they didn't have the technology, they just placed a fresh character on a random server and people gathered around it while the show was running live..
---
Now if there were a twitch stream running all the time with invisible characters flying in the air around the zones just observing players.. that would be pretty neat i guess.
---
thought i just published a reading assignment for a moment there
---
Thanks for this.
---
I kept getting internal 500 errors, so didnt know it was posting
---
Alchemy becomes really good once you get the flask recipes. The other "normal" recipes are easy to get and there are a ton of alchemists. Also every guild has at least one of them and they will craft for free. Same goes for most crafting professions. You really need one of the rare recipes and they usually come from raids which means the guild decides who gets then, if you're not an officer good luck with that. 
---
Herbalism is always good. I plan to have an alt with herb/mining and he'll just run about doing that.
---
Candyland!
---
I wish so...
---
flash of light? im curious why would any paladin spam flash of light. Holy light is significantly more efficient and heals more... it has longer cast time but pre-casting is a thing.  
---
Or does mana become less of an issue at higher mana levels? i though it just has to do with spell ranks so instead of using... idk, holy light rank 4(?)  youll be able to use higher rank holy light instead.
---
The best one is running dungeons when someone has Dragon's Call sword. 
---
After you summon a whelp and finish fighting the whelp will go and seek the nearest hostile target...Got kicked from so many BRD  throne rooms.
---
What a looter
---
There are going to be plenty of try hards. I'll be one lots of times. They are easy to avoid by making friends with cool people and joining a casual guild.
---
Most vanilla zones are exactly like that. It's from I'd say WotLK ontowards they began to cram as much into the zones as possible.
---
Mulgore is very close to Mulgere, which means "To Milk" in Latin.
---
Fair about TBC, but Vanilla &gt; WoTLK
---
Priest, Rogue and Warlock are the best. Not necessarily in that order.
---
Better with classic graphics though (sorry, cant stand new metal water).
---
Yeah, they kinda dropped the ball on the hunter, Druid and warlock IMO. The rest of T3 looks fantastic.
---
Blizzard should sometime soon.  At least on the PVE server it is completely dead now that everyone hit 30.
---
They are not going to be getting many bug reports etc. if no one is playing.
---
My memory is obviously foggy but I never remember being bothered by the fact my friends were 60 and in MC when I was still levelling. I saw a post linking kungen’s rant about it and he says how endgame wasn’t even on our radars in the early days. Since we weren’t all racing to get to it and were just playing the game everything was more fun. I did eventually get to 60 and raid but it wasn’t my priority. I think a lot of that is lost. So many angry people here gatekeeping and missing the point of the post it’s hilarious. Too many treat wow endgame like a job and are so convinced it’s their way or no way at all.
---
And people like you need to stop spreading carebear lies. You could've worded your post differently, but you had to get your own pathetic subjective opinion in there, agenda, or whatever it is. Racial traits matter. Done.
---
It is a bug.  I watched the warrior who taught me how to pvp taunt a pet, then run over an ice trap.
---
It is pretty well established now that “tipsout” is horrible at the game, and has questionable experience with actual vanilla. ( I said this all along) so don’t listen to him.
---
Yep there will be low tolerance for wipes too because of this
---
The layering is to handle competition for mobs and quest objectives, private servers also implement dynamic or increased spawn rates, which is very not classic.
---
I swear Abalop was phase shifted, and he won't pull any mobs in that state! It was one of you guys!

---
But tier 3 paladin isn't great and tier 1 paladin is a joke. Probably one of the stupidest sets in the entire game, Vanilla to BfA
---
If your focus in vanilla WoW is to min-max and play it like it's retail, you're gonna have a bad time. If you play it like its classic and take time to just fuck around and go with the moment, you're gonna have an amazing time with old and new friends.
---
There is a program that can that for you.
---
At launch I got 5 days free game time because the servers were so shit, at the AQ gate event it was pretty much unplayable, blizzard could have faxed me frame updates faster.
---
I wish it would be like that because I play healer, and I am not a full time gamer, I suck at games. I like playing wow just because of the lore, I am not trying to be the best or anything. I understand the pushover, but still...
---
I remember being so amazed when I first found that rare. "THERES A HUGE CROCODILE IN THE CANAL!" As I run and go get my brother to look.
---
I was aged 11 playing TBC. Good times.
---
Arathi basin cliff.
---
OMG WTF!!!
---
Yeah, miner's gone as well.
---
[Immersion](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/immersion/) or  [Storyline](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/storyline/) schould do the trick
---
In difficulty yeah, but you were never bored in WOTLK - There was always something to do.
---
WOTLK in my mind was the perfect expansion, Blizzard knew that their playerbase was getting older and didn't have the same time to commit to the game anymore, so they made it inherently easier to stay top tier.
---
They then made hardmodes for people who COULD still dedicate the time.
---
Say what you want about Blizz now, but from a business standpoint they knew exactly what they game needed for the first few years.
---
I understand that's your perspective and that's okay. However that doesnt mean the comment is necessary or that it needs to be posted. Also I feel you're mistaken about it being some sort of karma grab. OP is organizing an event on the classic wow beta. His target audience is people on the beta, so the best place to post it is here. Sure it might not matter to everyone but it's the easiest way for him to make people on the beta aware.
---
weird
---
I love Desolace with a passion because i'm a troll at heart, since that was my first ever character. I'm rolling alliance too this turn around so i can play with friends. Small world.
---
Lol dude, do you see that no one is moving, or running on the spot or randomly disappearing? That's lag.
---
Eversong &amp; Teldrassil got me hooked on WoW.
---
There was a screenshot back in the day of Amazon and it listed "Fleshlight + Lube" as frequently brought items with the WoW Vanilla /TBC battlechest.
---
I was commenting on the “crafting gear to boost I’ll for lfr” bro.  Not the other way around.
---
Well, learn then. Classic is not a complicated game and classes are not complicated outside of PvP. Any joker can do well on a mage, paladin or rogue.
---
I have a special place in my heart for Winterspring. The untouched Winter serenity, in a land torn by chaos and war really jumped out at me.

Vanilla/TBC &gt; Wrath &gt; who cares
---
I've seen several threads of this, mines still there but still no beta access, lol.
---
Hell no, it looks dope and especially when worn. If you dislike OSRS aesthetics in general that’s a whole other thing.
---
Also shadowmeld gives rogues and druids an passive improved stealth.
---
So in comparison with other races the NE rogue can have the strongest stealth in the game, and since horde doesnt have human racial (perception) they will have double hardtime seeing you.
---
In that sense an NE  rogue should always be able to win the sap-war against horde rogues.
---
That's just, like, your opinion man. Some legit enjoyed WoD more than BfA, me included.
---
In vanilla, flash of light in combination with the right talents will give you back 60% of manacost on a crit, while critting a lot. So basically healing for 40% manacost, which is usually replenished by manareg items and bow
---
You will encounter 60% bows, the rest guns while levelling (low lvl crossbows are quite rare).
---
Your pre-bis phase 1 weapon is a crossbow (Blackcrow).
---
Your bis Tier 1 raid is a bow (Rhok'delar), that you will keep quite a long time since the upgrades don't drop that often.
---
After that, the 2 best ranged weapons in game are crossbows (Nerubian Slavemaker and Ashjre'thul).

There's one in orgrimmar (was a proud bat owner 13 years ago). Iirc the bats in ZG also had 1.0 attack speed, like BT. Although bats only had 7% + damage compared to cats 10% + damage, so not as good choice
---
Gotta disagree I'm afraid! TBC was definitely an upgrade from Vanilla, despite its flaws, but WotLK was the first time in the game I ever unsubbed. The story was fantastic, but it started the slippery slope of losing the community feel and worlds began to feel empty.
---
Not saying it was a bad expansion, but it would go TBC &gt; Vanilla &gt; WotLK for me, then the rest
---
Also worth considering which of the two has even the slightest chance at receiving tier 3 in Naxx.  
---
Which is NOT rogue.
---
You need to tick "use subreddit style" over on the right hand side of the page.
---
YOU EVER FUCK A RIVERLANDS GIRL?
---
Yea ill be tanking so I’m in the clear :)
---
The funny thing is Vanilla content is SO DAMN EASY (Naxx being the only real exception), that you could take 5 ret paladins into MC or none and it won't make any real difference.  If players aren't being complete derps, it matters little which spec they choose to raid with.  As long as you have the tanks/healers covered, using 'optimal' dps specs is just win-more.  
---
Let people play w/e they want in raids, it won't really matter.  This isn't M'uru.
---
Expect tryhards will have a bad time in classic and end up either changing their attitude or quitting the game within the first couple months. They'll stay in close-nit groups of like-minded and be in their own little exclusive bubble. 
---
So I wouldn't think too much about it :) be open, friendly and talkative to who you meet in the world. Your ignore list is a neat place for toxic people, those people won't do well in classic for sure, and won't get far when the whole server slowly will know who they are. 
---
I'd invite friendly people over skilled to dungeons/raids any time (within reason), as they take a long time to do.. so it's better to have some cool peeps to chat with and enjoy the game rather than a silent NPC.
---
Yes, Jeffy is amazing, come check out his stream you won't regret it!
---
For the vast majority of the game, flash of light will be your go-to heal while holy light is precasted before big hits like shadowflame on Nefarian etc. Initially you have to downrank flash of light but by around BWL gear you'll just use max rank and maybe pop a potion here and there. By Naxx it's pretty much impossible to go oom so you just spam and spam endlessly which makes it an easy class to heal with, but uninsteresting.
---
Is it just me or does your forum not have any sub-forums on it at all?  
---
Every time I think "Lets go see what that place has to offer", I arrive and it's all one big shit mess and I just close the site.  
---
Hopefully I missed the very obviously placed sub-forum sorter.
---
used to listen to WoW Radio back in vanilla. i remember Blue Plz with TotalBiscuit on Sunday nights (especially spamming IRC for him to play Emerald Sword during every single break). certainly made reputation grinding a whole lot more enjoyable
---
it was weird coming back years later and finding he'd blown up on youtube, but you could tell he had a passion for expelling salt
---
If you’re too stupid to read then it’s a waste of time explaining to a simpleton how tanking works.
---
What the fuck is this? This guide is 90% explaining other classes spells.
---
The talent build is of a BM hunter.
---
The rotatiion is not a rotation. It is about equpping items, and popping potions on CD.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer as a recommended melee weapon. Nope. I do appreciate you mentioned Nightfall, as that is the only thing that makes it viable, but even then i'd rather have an offtank wield it.
---
Lmao the downvotes, they can't handle the truth
---
Maybe if you're 12. Though I was exactly 12 when they came out and I still think they looked awful compared to dragon weaponry.
---
buy gold :D
---
Nope, Elwyn beats it hard.
---
Arcane Explode Once, Arcane Explode Twice, Arcane Explode Thrice... SOLD! to the Pirate in the Ice block.

More specifically I'd say 45-50. The times where I was lazy with grinding mobs towards quest objectives that was the real hell.
---
This and Loch Modan.
---
I sat my GF down during the stress test and took her on a tour of both zones. I love these zones.

Imagine telling someone they are "wasting their life away" by providing for their family working 60 hours a week on a thread where he is talking about no longer being able to spend 12 hours every day playing an online game. I think you are the one with poor priorities here.
---
its 50ms so 20tick rate. Retail afaik is 60
---
Cant track mining nodes and herbs nodes at the same time in classic. Probably more efficient to go herb or mining with skinning as the second one if you want 2 fathering profs.
---
Technically wow classic is a brand new game, so no. It can't be beaten 14 years ago, when its not even released yet.
---
Weapon skill this glancing blow that.  
---
I just wanna gnome warrior for gods sake
---
... WoTLK was only good for the first half. Then the trial of the crusader patch came and made everything kinda poop. A trend that continued for the rest of WoW. It's the time when sub count started dropping, and even the first time since vanilla launched that I unsubbed. Was never bored before that, always had something to do. The loot and catch-up mechanics got in place and trivialised past content.
---
Crypts under Karazhan.
---
It’s provocative. It gets the people going.
---
Indeed, and I think this opens up spots for lesser geared people and such, as long as they have experience

hey, thanks for responding, sorry im so late. No this is not the right one. This is a link to the youtube video I'm searching for, including a timestamp of 6 seconds:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kTpmAvcPs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kTpmAvcPs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6s)   
---
however this video is unavailable
---
Don’t assume pserver sensibility will carry over to classic.  
---
Ironfoe farming was NOT a thing in vanilla, and it may or may not function the same as it does on pservers ( the fact that it wasn’t widely used in vanilla is the reason there is very little data to reverse engineer its proc rate)
---
It might be the case that it was actually really good, but we won’t know until we see the functionality on classic.
---
Otherwise, healthpots and plate repair bills are what really cost a warrior $$ to raid/5man.
---
Just like leveling, once you are geared however, you can actually make money raiding and 5 Manning so it’s sort of a “pay up front” class all around.
---
Oof
---
Does LiP reset your threat if you use it while you're not the boss target or it just stops the boss from oneshotting you once you took agro ?
---
If it doesn't reset threat like a vanish / feign death it's useless : just watch your threat and stop attacking **before** taking agro from the MT.
---
i don't see any shaman love in this thread :(
---
Then you'll mostly be using your warrior tiers yeah. In AQ you can switch some of it out for more tps like I believe the T2,5 helmet and shoulders, not 100% on those.
---
Retail IS too easy! And I miss the "forced" cooperation, that's what made me feel like I was playing a mmo, I went through legion without speaking to anyone outside of dungeons
---
he separated everything in different paragraphs. It was easy to read, maybe you just need to read more books
---
That's just plain wrong. I hold TBC in almost as high a standard as vanilla - it made the old world kinda negligible, where vanilla feels like a true complete world. 
---
WoTLK was good and fun to be sure, but a lot of QoL stuff started getting implemented, and it was here especially that raid content became useless when a new raid came out. Especially later half of WoTLK was terrible (trial of crusader patch and from then on). Too many catch-up mechanics
---
one sword? there are numerous tanking swords in the game, more so than axes. Youll get a sword before you get an axe everytime.
---
Quel'serrar, maladath, bloodlord defender and some dps ones. (ofcourse thunderfury too but hey, thats rare)  
---
As i see it the first axe you can even get is from nefarian or hakkar... next ones from AQ20 or naxx.
---
Excluding rank 14 weapons ofcourse, majority wont be able to get there before raids.
---
just don't run gnomer with pug hunters, problem solved.
---
dun morogh is probably my second favourite behind here
---
Please do then perhaps you'll learn to read and come back when you have.

It's not possible anymore to sheep friendlies targets.
---
Hence this meme : as a mage if you want to help someone from your faction you can't use sheep, use frost nova.

"I guess ill die." ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So do I - just so I could train onto him.

Sorry for potato quality. 
---
It was pretty funny, he had a pile of bones on the ground, probably from his victims. Every few mins, he'd grab a bone and tell his blighthound to fetch it. The dog would get the bone, Nathanos would say "good boy" and tell the dog to put it back in the pile of bones.
---
But this time without lagging :D
---
i agree with almost everything you said besides the racial comment
---
orcs are broken vs alliance classes that rely on stuns
---
If light hearted jokes about not being able to predict the future qualifies as toxic behavior I suggest avoiding the Barrens while leveling.
---
No, the sentence is "Yeah what a good guy he is, aiming to help out classic!"
---
okay but if I'm not always prepared, how will I fight off the rogue that inevitably is right behind me the second I switch into my transmog set?
---
Way to be bad at English comprehension.
---
People like you make me lock my door. How you can be so wilfully delusional is both terrifying and disgusting
---
Why the fuck are so many people searching just the word “vagina”
---
Wow i forgot about that! Nostalgia level 100!
---
Nah, the airfield is super easy. IIRC you just need some sort of slowfall + speed boost (mount works). Jump from the small graveyard next to the Ironforge gates. Run up the mountain.
---
Another who's terrible at English comprehension :(
---
Honestly just feeling bad for people now.
---
How do you go through life this willfully ignorant?
---
Sorry Mr. Memespec, you won't get into any raids.
---
How do I know if its twink gear?
---
Not all try hards are elitists. And for that matter not all elitists are try hards. 
---
If a hard core guild acts like a bunch of assholes because they're good at an old game then they will self segregate pretty quickly. I wouldn't worry about it. There are a lot of people excited to play a casual and socal style. No matter how noob you are you won't be alone and not have fun.
---
makes me a bit hopeful to see so many people not wanting to worship internet celebrities
---
shame on those that do
---
Meh not my cup of tea i feel like professional shoutcasters are exciting but not just shouting all spells in an order
---
I know this is a warrior thread, but can a night elf hunter feign death into shadowmeld?  How does this work?
---
Professions were good. Raids were good. Class balance was good. Arena was ok.
---
Everything else was kinda shitty. Introduction of flying mount and daily's. A shared main city. Pallys and shamans on both faction.
---
I think if TBC was so great, people would be playing it as a majority compared to vanilla.
---
Thanks bjrni
---
The only Orgrimmar I care about.
---
You don't need to start in the same zone : after 2 or 3 hours you will be both lvl 10 then you can group at the cross-road in the barrens (I think you will have easier time finding someone if you don't limit their race / class choices).
---
Good luck !
---
He didn't mean fast paced. He ment that once people realize that leveling is so incredibly time consuming, compared to retail, there's a good chance many will quit.
---
At least the people with the attention span of a potato lol.
---
God Bless you dude for this
---
FU !
---
I mean, good for you man !
---
This is a heartwarming and wonderful idea m8, thanks for posting it. Will be sharing it on every relevant place I can think of. Sadly don’t have beta, but will look for streams of it. I imagine Jesse - should he feel up for it - would participate. Tb was by far the most respectable person in gaming imo, a real loss to us all when he passed so young. This would be the least we could do
---
I punched spiders in Azshara on my lock to level all the skills
---
Nothing beats Vanilla Azshara in terms of atmosphere!
---
It was more entertaining then listening to the baseball commentators talk about whatever random, unrelated things they want to or football announcers commenting about rules and what the replay shows. lol
---
Is what I said XD
---
#nochanges
---
THIS is accurate, everyone else is a pserver shill.
---
Dw fury was better then 2h fury which was better then MS, but MS was still really good dps.
---
I was MS all the way until nefarian when I finally respecced dw fury, but even after respec the remaining MS wars were some of the top dps.
---
Yeah everyone knows the best porn on google is if you search for "bobs and vagine".
---
Warriors are godly after they get geared.
---
After they get geared.
---
But... isnt that exactly the same for holy light? except holy light heals alot more, crit or no crit.
---
Blessing of Light also increases holy light healing by like 400 but flash of light only 100.
---
Isn't that normal on a PvE server tho? The real end goal in WoW is whipping your E-pen all over people in world PvP after getting phat loot. Can't do that on PvE
---
But atm we only see how slow it is to level 30. Getting to level 30 is NOT time consuming, compared to the other 30 levels. Heck, just getting from 55-60 can take a lot longer then 1-30 can.
---
I love Teldrassil, which is where I started my first character. Other than that, Mulgore definetely.
---
This is why gnome warriors are superior, the fact that every mob is 4 times your size is a constant reminder not to pull more than 1.
---
!rewindwillsmith
---
Always loved green zones that pop. STV is it for me. Nagrand was my fav in TBC.
---
I don't know you, but I hate you.
---
It was all down hill after wotlk.
---
I really like greenish zones the most:
---
-  STV
---
- Ashenvale
---
- Feralas
---
- Arathi
---
All zones are nice tho imo, they're all unique in their own way and that makes leveling more enjoyable :)
---
Thank you for your advice
---
Why are you being so aggressive and stubborn? I never said they don’t matter. My point is that people who never played before are going to think they can’t play anything besides human rogue or gnome mage. You must be an orc warrior or else. It’s comical how furious people are getting. I have always run BiS lists and farmed full consumables. Not sure what my agenda is besides playing a computer game over a decade old for fun.
---
I'd like to add, that it is **still** fine, despite Trump doing everything he can to fuck it up
---
Most beautiful zone you say?  Looks to me like you touched up the brightness and saturation quite a lot in PS after you took this screenshot of Feralas
---
I prefer beige over rouge.
---
I watched it live on his stream, not just taking his word for it because I know he's not that great.
---
It won’t make you magically better than the other player. It will give you a slight advantage.
---
weird maybe they  took  a few thousands the acess away to get new ones next time but still I'm a little disheartened that we got no information for this
---
&gt;If you’re too stupid to read then it’s a waste of time explaining to a simpleton how tanking works.
---
Your link supports what I am saying.
---
Personal favorite is Tanaris. It just feels too real to me.
---
Absolutely. I wouldn't have a bunch of alts on that guild, but I don't see why I wouldn't have fun playing with them.
---
Thank you wangchief
---
yeah, it is **still** fine, but not because of Trump, rather despite of all the shit he is doing that is definitely not good for the economy
---
Very true.  I'm having such a tough time deciding what to play because of what each class can uniquely offer.  
---
Mage - Most fun AoE farm spec and overall in a great place in Vanilla in PvE and PvP.  AV as a mage is a blast.  
---
Pali - Super fun with good gear, you feel like a monster out and about in the world.  Gets to full pull dungeons like SM Armory/Cath and AoE with Consecration/ret aura.  Also super satisfying as Ret when you get to upgrade your weapon.   1 man army.  
---
Rogue - Stealth.  As alliance, get to lurk in the shadows then 1 shot horde characters who lose duels then vanish.  This will *never* get old.  Stealth is just so damn useful/fun.  
---
Too hard to decide!
---
Definitely agree with you. At least we only have until August.
---
everyone play feral druid or ret pally
---
thanks so much! I just want to see the community do something nice to commemorate his life, in a game he loved... this is for him &lt;3
---
if both of you are the same skill level you will win for no reason other than hardiness, it's especially true for orcs that can just blind if they resist a stun and then kill the other player
---
What i thought is that flash of light would not let you keep up with the healing required. Youll fall behind... but holy light on the other hand heals alot more so potentially you need to cast it less times for more hps.
---
Blessing of Light also increases holy light healing by 400 but only 100 for flash of light.
---
If classicdb isnt inaccurate holy light costs more mana than flash of light, and heals significantly more... and if you are not able to run out of mana in naxx wouldnt it be better then to use holy light? We do have other classes that heal  faster amounts, like druids with rejuvenation and priests with bubble/renew.
---
Paladins atleast to me appear as the goto healer for big and efficient heals, they can spam them more than other healers.
---
Totally forgot about the Hinterlands. Late evenings clearing out trolls with the boys &lt;3
---
Well the stress tests are over. This isn't at all surprising.
---
My favorite zone. I moved to laramie wyoming, after leaving there and playing on a private server i finally realized why i loved it there so much.. mulgore. I loved that zone and spent so much time there over the years playing wow and it translated to the real life plains.
---
Thanks :)
---
Laughs in Warlock
---
Eh, 2 mobs is fine just use Cleave.
---
Honestly the increased race class combos are all pretty good. Like Human Hunters how were those not things already? Tauren Paladins we can have so many holy cow puns!
---
I know this is the express checkout lane with a limit of 10 items, but can I check out with 20 items instead?
---
Until you get sweeping strikes this can be accurate.
---
What about skinning?
---
This subreddit is for being toxic about Classic, not peoples personal situations.
---
Don't be so fucking rude.
---
It'd be like Live PD lol
---
Pre raid PvP gear for a warrior? Rolling rogue.
---
Darkshore has always been my favourite. Can't wait to go back to the pre-cata version. :)
---
Being Horde i've never quested in Duskwood, but i've always loved the aesthetics when passing through
---
T2 rogue lover checking in. Even if I get better gear I'm still going to rock full T2 in the cities.
---
Should of....
---
My parents made a deal with me: so the dishes every day, get a wow sub. I bet they figured I would soon stop xD but as I kept doing it, and they could clearly see I enjoyed the game immensely, they investigated. They weren’t American soccer moms told by tv that gaming is bad, so they did so objectively. They found out I was making friends and learning English skills, so they simply started paying for my sub the same way they paid for my sports club fees. Not trying to judge or insult you or your parents, but I think it’s natural for a parent to encourage their child’s interests financially, within reason.
---
Today I’m getting a bachelor in English and psychology and want to study gaming culture professionally - it’s cognitive benefits for one, like what’s being done with sc2.
---
So do I create a whole post for this simple question which the mods remove for low effort?
---
Most People will have silver, if you price it right you make gold
---
Are you expecting to make some kind of living off of it? If not, who cares if you are bad or good. Just have some fun man, that's the only thing that matters tbh.
---
Abyone can be good, given the oppornity to learn how.
---
I was alliance on Thunderlord. What horde guild were you in? I was in Angry Beavers. Best guild on TL alliance was Inquisition though
---
I didn't think you could tame beasts that were higher level than you?
---
Elwynn Forest, and Dun Morogh are my favourite. Try fishing on a half-frozen lake in Dun Morogh, listen to that music, when the piano hits, literal chills. And the forest is pure nostalgia, crazy
---
The only time you will see me at Storwind gates is when I raid your puny Alliance ass :)
---
Classic Mulgore is the zone I have missed the most since cata, I’m very excited to play it again
---
Thank you for the response, this makes me so happy to hear.
---
Learning to wall jump was one of my favorite things to do in classic, glad it is still around!
---
+1000 upvotes
---
This version of Nathanos is so much better than the BfA one. The hunched over ghoul-like model of the Undead has so much more character than his lame Vlad Dracul cosplay model.
---
This guide is absolutely awful.
---
true  its not that long but every day i crave more for it ;D
---
Even if it was everyone’s first time, there would be elitists giving you shit over trivial things.  Any time a game comes out “the community is really the best I’ve seen in x game genre, its honestly so refreshing!”  And these feelings are heavily influenced by the game being new and fun for you.  Its the sameish community as any large scale game, so if 20% of your interactions are terrible in other popular games, expect something similar for wow.  
---
I personally only ran into a handful of same faction jerks, but stealing boss loot etc will happen every now and then.
---
Probably currently that’s true since there is nothing really to do at 30 but pvp.
---
Population seemed fine while leveling though.
---
200hp is not to be sniffed at, even in Nax gear
---
There are more stress tests with next one in less than 3 weeks, also PTR access doesnt get removed between patches either.
---
Hillsbrad
---
Also alliance flight paths overall are just so much better located for the respective quests than horde. Quest wise you feel more exposed as a horde than alliance to ganks and danger zones. At least that was my experience from a private server recent leveling experience..
---
Way back when in vanilla I honestly can't recall the ganking situation too much.. but the flight paths definitely stick out.
---
I recommend trying to level both factions, you'll see what I mean. :)
---
i would get paranoid
---
they are not  next is end of june and like i said from first to second you had your "progress" saved too and the acess
---
RuneScape did it but that’s the only one I can think of
---
with saving for a mount as quickly as possible in mind:
---
is there any things warriors NEED to buy while levelling?
---
for instance is it worth it to buy "white" weapons from vendors if they have more damage than what you already have, or is it better to just wait until you find something better?
---
You always want 1-2 druids in the raid anyway, and in most polls druids are around 8% of peoples choices, which means you're basically always finding a raiding spot.
---
&gt;  during the last **stress test**.
---
yeah, wonder why
---
Did anyone level up to 10 who lost the option in their client?
---
I can't put TBC in S, with Vanilla. I just can't.
---
Vanilla S, TBC A, Wrath B, WoD and BfA on F, everything else on D.
---
No expansion deserves a C.
---
This is wrong : on raid bosses you don't lack rage, however if you get parried more you generate less threat.
---
I'm not really sure what progression guilds will mean in Vanilla.  For Naxx I can see it being a thing, but previous to that, nothing is so difficult that you'll need anything close to the organization required on retail mythic raids.  Almost every boss has fairly simple mechanics and most bosses boil down to a *don't stand in the fire* type mechanic for the dps to worry about.  Some bosses the biggest threat is simply "don't pull aggro".  
---
We'll see how it play out, but I think people in 'progression' guilds will simply be the ones who plan to spend a bit longer to clear out the raids slightly faster than all the rest of the 40-man raiding guilds.  Pre-Naxx Vanilla bosses weren't much of a skill-check as much as a gear check.  There were exceptions but only a few.
---

So you have 3 big streamers and for example 20 servers. So 3/20 are gonna be bad and you have to pick one not knowing which one the streamer's gonna choose. How is it not gonna be a problem for anybody just because there's only 3? People on those servers are gonna be fucked, period. Now move on kid
---
It'll be true in a world where you've done all raids and are sick of BGs too. There's nothing like being a menace in the organic environment that is World PvP. 
---
At least that's my opinion ^^
---
Dustwallow Marsh is excellent
---
I beg to differ...
---
I don't have a retail guild.
---
Out of curiosity did you level to 10 in the stress test?
---
Even though I hated it back in vanilla days, Darkshore. There’s just something about the atmosphere. And how it ALWAYS felt hardly anyone was there
---
(ACKCHYUALLY)[https://m.imgur.com/gallery/TKyAy]
---
Multi specs
---
I thought names should be at least 3 chars on WOW ?
---
But it doesn't make sense to me that a warrior, who wears plate and is supposed to be tanky, cannot outlive two mobs but clothies can. How does this make sense, RP-wise?
---
30-40 was prime SM time.
---
Dude...
---
Just Runescape and Final Fantasy.
---
I reported a bug too.   The bulge of Omar's toon was much, much too small
---
I have always loved Ashenvale.  My first time in the zone I took so many screenshots, and the music is amazing.
---
I always loved Wintersprings.
---
Bag space, the mount tab, quest tracker.
---
\&gt;unless they are using some extremely wonky system for this.  
---
It's classic WoW. I'm paying for it to be a wonky system. If it's not I'm going to riot.
---
Flash of light is way more mana efficient in the way that it has a 1.5 sec. cast time and 115 mana cost, whereas holy light has 2,5 sec cast time and 465 mana cost. if you spammed holy light (which you could) you would be oom really quickly, without actually healing that much because nobody required that much healing. spamming flash of light on the other hand (only) had a manacost of 46 mana per 1,5 sec, which your gear could overcome if you had enough mp5. otherwise it would have been 279 mana per holy light so 111,6/sec while flash of light has 30,6/sec. So FoL was sustainable, holy light was not.
---
4 mobs was fine as warrior. Until level 5. Things change after that
---
People who think wotlk was better than vanilla didb't play wotlk
---
Iseewhatyoudidthere
---
Being able to loot an entire pack rather than each individual mob.
---
Yeah but will u enjoy the raids, being a mediocre healer and innervate/combat rez bot? Genuine question, my retail main is a druid because I like to be versatile but I'd prefer not to be only mediocre in classic at best compared to the main classes.
---
Duskwood should be in there imo. The zone is beautiful in how great they managed to deliver that atmosphere. Retail players talk about Drustvar... meanwhile, when you run through Duskwood at night as a level 19 player and you see that wolf near the road... and pray he doesnt attack you... thats just beautiful.
---
Not quite the same, but Rift had a classic server too.
---
"It really doesn’t matter. The bonuses from your racials are negligable." Untrue. 
---
Why can't you just accept that you worded your post poorly? And you're calling me stubborn? Funny dude hehe.
---
!RemindMe in 79 days
---
This was honestly the *cream* of the crop.
---
Except Felwood. Nobody likes Felwood.
---
Pretty much this.
---
If a Melee Warlock is viable (not necessarily optimal) then I’m sure he’ll make an article about it one day :)
---
Seeing that little happy symbol next to its name just reminded me after all these years that you have to feed your pets in Vanilla. Man.
---
yeah theres basically no "exploiting" to be made to reach airfield. it's just as you say, a jump with some speed and thats the trick.
---
Yes unlike in later expansions
---
Uldum is similar.
---
The game felt much much easier on the stress test client compared to pservers. Rage and health (re)generation seem to be heavily undertunes on pservers.
---
I love Felwood :D
---
ability to cc, heal, kite, etc. warrior has none
---
i rly thought they would include that, since they enabled "auto-loot"   
---
its the only think i would love to have
---
Goblins as a playable race.
---
I was thinking about doing all the Night elf quests . Not sure how far that would take me tho.
---
I just gave the man what he wanted
---
 [idk this reason?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM-UnV9TEzY)
---
Health regen on stress test felt really quick up to level 7, after that food became useful between some pulls.
---
2H warriors are good, as in they often top the meters. One big reason is that there are several 2h dropping in raids and there is less competition for them as DW warriors and rogues don't want it, while hunters have to wait in line.
---
T1 looks amazing on female Orcs and Trolls in general
---
I agree with you, I like Nagrand too.
---
Duskwood? i love that zone
---
One main forum for general discussion is enough for our small community - not really had any complaints about that before.
---
I would have thought that having very clear sections of the site in the navigation bar was clear enough and not misleading at all - could you explain a little bit more in detail about what you find confusing about this?
---
I like felwood
---
I missed this place.
---
I haven't even noticed it so far since you can't really kill more than one mob at a time anyway.
---
mr carebear you better roll pve...
---
I think it fits the theme. Over the top holy warrior who only heals 😂
---
Auto-loot was a thing in Vanilla though, even if you had to hold Shift every time.
---
AoE loot has some gameplay consequences when it comes to the safety of looting - for example, you might be forced to abandon a corpse if it is too close to a pack of mobs, but AoE loot allows you to loot it from further away.
---
If i would be you, i would pick mining + skinning and save all the cloth on a bank alt for later leveling and sell the lether for a bit more gold
---
Soulforge dungeon set 2
---
This is not 100% acurrate. The Community Manager told in a Stream, that we got only selected for the specific Stress Test 1. Since the 2. one was a "Addition" to the first, everyone keept it.   
---
So we had Stress Test 1 and 1,5 for Stress-Test 2 you need to get invited again, from what the Community Mananger said.
---
Of course that’s why I had it
---
Where's the PvP set? Not heroes, carebears...
---
Nobody like Tanaris?
---
I've had mine since May 17th, still have it now. Blessed day.
---
Or &lt;rogues do it from behind&gt; or &lt;sapped girls cant say no&gt;.
---
Witch server? NA or EU ?  
---
and most important Ally or Horde? :D
---
This is a dps increase to melee...
---
I used to aoe grind a bit, maybe as a mage it's more noticeable
---
Capitalism
---
I want max level mage and priest NOW!
---
I went to 5 on the first one and 10 on the second with two characters and was on all day. Mine has been removed too. Hopefully we get an official post
---
No, just 10/10 ground clutter
---
Havent seen it like that. Maybe just decrese the AOE loot radius to 10 yards instead of like 50 \^\^, i hate it when like 5 corpes lay on each other
---
Ironforge inn is like a dream.
---
who cares lighten up, everyone is doing good
---
Maybe on Monday when the new Invite Wave is.
---
Haha, nice one. But no, directly from the game
---
They could even automate it and let people in chat vote to stay on a scene for longer
---
If this were true we would all be druids paladins
---
Not classic, but my favorite zone always will be zangarmarsh... i always thinked that would be cool chilling that bigass mushrooms.
---
[There is something special about Tirisfal Glades](https://i.imgur.com/CVhvodI.jpg)
---
I was quite amazed walking through the shimmering flats for the fist time. perhaps not the most beautiful per se but deserves a shoutout in my book.
---
Mining/Tailoring. As you don’t need to farm for the lvl 40 mount, you can deposit the mats needed to level Engineering in your bank (or even better, mail them to your bank alt) and sell the excess on the AH.
---
Man I ran ZG so many times for that set on my rogue. I got the first one easy but the second never did drop in classic. I finally got it to drop in BC I think, I still have the set on that character. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the proc much since they were no longer good by the time I finished the set. Still bitter about that!
---
My vanilla pet was Takk the Leaper.  Too like 30 attempts to tame him and I reminder panicking each time I died that someone else would take him
---
I love travelling along the road in Feralas, it's one of the most beautiful places in the game. Until you run smack into that tauren town they put in the middle of the road for some reason.
---
I got removed from the stress-test too :| I only had time to play 3 hours during the last test, I hope it's not related. 
---
I kinda sucks to be remove from it and now I have to wait for release :(
---
not sure, but what is Cataclysm? anyone of this reddit were playin past wotlk? (joke)
---
Plot twist: the mage is opposite faction.
---
Good that there is a ignore list, and not an X-realm crap that makes it useless  
---
i remember back in the days there was a "shit" list. if you were on you could litteraly delete your character bc you would find no guild or any group to play with
---
Strongly recommend you buy the first level 3 white 2h weapon from the town after your starting zone. It costs about 7 silver, you probably won't be able to afford it until level 7 or 8, but it will last you until you start getting greens from quests.
---
It's also recommended to buy the level 30 2h white weapon from a major city if it's a significant upgrade. No one who is speed levelling is going to be doing the level 30 warrior quest at level 30. Alternatively, RFK has an excellent 2h wep with a high drop rate at 30 if you want to take an exp/h hit.
---
Winterspring was my favourite with the Timbermaw bears
---
Excuse me, what? If it was a bug and never intended to begin with it needs to be fixed. Especially when it has gamebreaking PvP implications. 
---
People were able to get out of the gates in WSG and AB before the game started as well. That obviously shouldn't be in the game either. 
---
Game breaking PvP **BUGS** should not be in the game when Classic is released.
---
you just track down a guy who has lvld up enchantment bring the stuff needed for the enchantment also called mats trade him that then trade again put your gearpiece in the last slot wait till it shimmers green off the enchant and finish the trade and then u should have your enchant :)
---
Dude raiding in vanilla is boring for everyone. It’s really not that hard for any class the rotations are simple.
---
You have to find someone with the enchant and then one of 2 things happen - you give them the mats that are purchased off the AH, or you pay them for their materials.
---
Also some exclusive enchants that aren't widespread on the server will drive the price up :)
---
!RemindMe 90 days
---
Yeah but aoe looting would make them even stronger so I think it's a good thing that it's not in the game.
---
This x100.
---
I’m a big fan of Winterspring and Elwynn Forest personally.
---
I copy-pasted your question into Google, and [this was the third result](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-shadowmeld/19682). Should have all the info you need.
---
JUST GIVE ME CLASSIC AND LET ME DIE!
---
None of this is accurate.
---
I stepped into MC as a lvl 59 arms warrior using arcanite reaper and valor set.
---
I was one of approximately 6 warriors including our salty MT who was full t1 and just there to help our guild get our bearings.
---
I cleared most vanilla content (up to twin Elmo’s aq) and most of my guild mates cleared Cthun previously.
---
Despite being “late to the party” I was the top dpser for our guild goingn jnto tbc and I was the class leader who was in charge of distributing gear to my fellow warriors.
---
My guild was pretty a higher end progression guild on my server, but my server was smaller so we were probably pretty close to average in the grander scheme of things.
---
Pretty sure that refutes all of your assertion, lemme know if I missed any.
---
True rotations are simple, but there's a big difference when you can actively participate with fighting mechanics or stand at the sideline as buff/healbot for 3-4 hours right.
---
It isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, but the 2 big problems resto druids have in classic are, no OOC res and only 1 rejuv can be active per target. So having a ton of druids isnt viable but a few are perfectly fine.
---
Lmao I took this as sarcastic and the mage is on a pvp server and its about to get real dark for that warrior.
---
Gone, and now im sad :(
---
Uh...I really fucking need one.
---
g o o g l e
---
Also I remember the druids required 3 sets of gear as the stats didn't shift with your shape in classic! Oo
---
Guildbank.
---
A post like this one was also posted 2 days ago..
---
Just go away.
---
When we leave out questing and ganking I would say Winterspring
---
I wish they weren't so afraid of making zones like this anymore. Every zone from the past 4 or so expansions feels like a cluttered jungle, with mobs, trees and rocks in every direction. Honestly stops me from enjoying the zones, I feel claustrophobic and stressed in them. Old zones like this are so calming.
---
You have to find (usually by asking in General or Trade chat on a major city) and meet up with someone who has enchanting and has the enchants you need. You will open trade and give them the mats, then one by one you put your item in the "Will not be traded" section of the trade window  and they can enchant each piece thru the window.  If you provide the mats, they dont usually charge to do the enchants but its usually customary to provide a small tip.
---
I think blue looks cooler on its own and is less common than the purple if I remember correctly. But if you do get the purple mount you should get the purple pet to match!
---
I loved going to nagrand after molten core raids and just chillin...?
---
The mental gymnastics some of the people in this thread are pulling to justify wanting to have / keep this in the game is absurd.
---
Confirmed BUGS that completely break the competitive spirit of PvP should obviously be fixed, but some of these dumbfucks would rather have an OP pet than give a fuck about preserving the competitive nature of PvP. Fucking amazing.
---
Selfish fucks.
---
I leveled 3 Warriors on Nost and Ely and in the Beta and Release I roll Warlock. I just twink up a Warrior later on when I have all that Gold from my Warlock.
---
I'm feeling the same, even if you forgot some important things
---
But unfortunately this will never happen. People that want TBC or WOTLK will ask for nochange no matter how theses changes are leading to what we have now on retail.
---
I've been really digging darkshore. chill aesthetic and Auberdine back as it was is just nice, less crowded than westfall as well.
---
I dont care if you are right or wrong. I want Classic, not whatever you can dream up. so take my downvote.
---
Not being hit and vast magical powers help.
---
EverQuest has been doing it for 10 years an Everquest 2 has been doing it for 6 years.
---
Not taking the 27th off b/c it launches at 5pm in CDT timezone. Also, no commute b/c I work from home 🤘😎
---
So many places, but if I had to pick one, I'd say Ashenvale. Nothing beats the [background music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoNY9UVr9E) there either
---
I think you meant Candy Mountain right Chaaaaarrrrrllliiiiiiiiieeeeee?
---
Theres a lot of things retail did right tbh, there's just way more they didn't. This here is chief among the good they did, the different Dwarven cultures and traditions getting over their grudges and expanding available classes was a huge win for flavor and game.
---
yea you're right i just watched john oliver. he said everything good that happens is not because of trump and everything bad is because of him. i believe it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkUQMk7nGOY
---
Bandages , intimidating shout, piercing howl ...we've got it all!
---
Yeah. Clothies can do stuff like summon demons to help them. Or transform the most formidable enemy into a turtle.
---
A warrior ability: shouting at this turtle I'm fighting really loud, so it attacks me slightly weaker for a few seconds.
---
That's just your opinion man. Some legit enjoyed BfA more than WoD, me included.
---
thanks
---
btw I'm not gonna be "speed levelling" really, just trying to save every copper I can to get a horse as soon as I hit 40.
---
I am one of the community discord owners of the current retail rppvp servers and the general consensus is most people want to roll on a pvp server.
---
Over the years almost every one dabbled in RP but anyone serious about if transferred to argent dawn rppve long long ago, even as far back as cata.
---
I think blizz are correct that an rppvp would not work, for one anyone who does not enjoy pvp as a main thing are almost militant about their disdain for it. Many people initially rolled rppvp for the more mature player base but fact is the average age of wow players has increased significantly since then. 
---
So we will roll on pvp servers but still organise some big battles and things, if you want battles with more emotes and hand holding set up i suggest you go pve anyway.
---
Didnt the survey say that 75 % of people on this subreddit are unsubbed from retail? 
---
I understand that you want to ask this question, but maybe ask it somewhere were the audience actualy plays retail?
---
Yes, the DMG text &amp; nameplates are very small in comparison to the 1.12 client.
---
If you don't care about the story just focus on the killing / mob looting quests.
---
lol i never said they should make this instead of classic... i just said what they should not do, should they add also BC and wotlk. classic can still coexist with BC and Wotlk...
---

---
My memory, ask any of the streamers that player back in vanilla. And countless of YT videos, just google devilsaur mafia dude
---
Old Nagrand, Dragonblight, Uldum, Kun Lai Summit (at least half the zone), Frostfire Ridge, Vol'Dun. For all but Legion we've had some sort of zone that was relatively open with some sense of space yet filled with enough that it doesn't cramp it. As nostalgic as places like Mulgore and the Barrens are, they weren't great leveling experiences for the simple fact those spaces were too big for the content within it.
---
Ah yes, the *level 20* ability Cleave.
---
That's awesome friend! Very intuitive and minimalist. :)
---
Thank you, that was very informative! Will my piece of gear be enchanted in trade screen after the other player created the enchantment or am I a dumbass? Or do I have to apply the enchantment myself?
---
WOW LEVEL 20 SUCH A DIFFICULT LEVEL TO ACHIEVE.
---
OGJeffery is not only a good commentator, he's ultra good at the game. He's hands down the best mage I've ever seen.
---
Yes this is true, and somewhat taxing on your bag space, and if you are planning on playing multiple rolls prepare for some heavy respec costs.
---
The only priority he should have is finding a way out of 60+ hours a week of slaving away. 60+ hours of anything that you're not enjoying is a waste of life, regardless of whether it's necessary or not.
---
Hi, /u/Setheroony
---
Thats actually a fairly good point that I hadnt thought of. There arent that many EU streamers are there? That actually made me a bit happy for a minute :P
---
!Remind Me 79 Days
---
 Pre quests for blackrock and onyxia. Classquests, Quests which give you rep for low factions but high factions too. I think I forgot the other half 😅
---
Warriors struggle the most at low levels.
---
so what are some things i forgot? what did you really dislike in the developement of the expansions? \^\^ i'm just curious \^\^
---
You are still dreaming though, which makes you just as annoying as the 15 other dayli posts about: "they should do this to or after Classic" or whatever these shitposters title their garbage. 
---
just stfu already.
---
Thank you! Does the enchanter have to posses the formula for the enchant or can I give it to him/her?
---
"appease to everyone" nop
---
There's going to be some bias with that though. Don't get me wrong, hybrids are going to do a bunch less DPS than a warrior or other good DPS spec. But like realistically if you had to give a piece of gear to a warrior, or a ret you're probably never going to choose the ret. Same thing for druids with other loot.
---
Give me tirisfal glades/brill In the  rain and music up loud.
---
I did, but I was a much higher end raider and multiglad in TBC, but I wasn't as good in vanilla, so my opinion is biased.
---
Crusader strike , Divine Storm
---
Be nice you're a paladin.
---
If additional PTR account is added here  [https://account.blizzard.com/games](https://account.blizzard.com/games) , you are in. Easier to just refresh that page.
---
Yeah I definitely had a “do not group” list in a notebook somewhere when the ignore only let you put 20 people or so on it.
---
Thank you so much! How does the formula for an enchant work? Can I trade it to the enchanter or do they have to posses it?
---
Legion below Wotlk, that is interesting. The most overrated expansion with A. Hmmm... If you put Vanilla in the S place, you just mustn't put Wotlk at A. That's literally two opposite sides of gameplay and expansion that - called by many - ruined it all.
---
I've leveled warriors to 60, its not as bad as you casuals think it is.
---
wow... someone is toxic here \^\^ this is a discussion board and discussion is what i do. so stfu yourself.
---
u trade him the mats the trade window will close automatically then u trade him again and put your gearpiece in the last slot, he then will apply the enchantment and if u see the name of the enchantment in green u will know its done on your piece of gear then just hit the tradebutton and u are good to go
---
skullflame shield i forgot about that guy
---
Maybe because I’m an adult now and have more limited time I don’t find it fun anymore.
---
I played on a pvp server though classic and BC but just finally got annoyed at the constant delays trying to run a 5 man or trying to get to a raid etc.
---
Get the great book called World of Warcraft Programming by James Whitehead II and Rick Roe (http://wowprogramming.com/) – there are ways of getting it for free but I would support the authors. It's a bit outdated but not much has changed really since then.
---
It's a great book and starts simple and once you're done you've got a much better grasp of everything. On top of this, I recommend checking out http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html for a Lua tutorial. To be honest, I prefer the approach where I try to brute force everything and google stuff as I go. That way I learn more. I haven't actually read through the entire Lua guide yet, but it's a good one.
---
Apart from those, just keep making stuff. Could be simple stuff, but the more you do the more you learn.
---
I mean flying mounts were bad in TBC and dungeon finder started later in Wrath but I rated them based on my overall enjoyment/engagement with the game.
---
Did you not read my edits? I said I discovered there are sub forums. The only misleading thing is that the general section is titled "Forums" instead of "General"  
---
By naming it "Forums", I'm lead to believe that all forum-structured content is within that link, when in fact there are other forum-structured items under the links nearby.  
---
Most websites feature forums (aka, the good stuff) along side a bunch of crap nobody cares to look at. "Realms" didn't really look like "realm forums" to me, so I didn't even bother for the longest time. "Guides" was probably the only thing that might have hinted that it *could* be in forum format, but I never bothered (again, I'm ALWAYS drawn to the thing that says "FORUM(S)")
---
They have to have the penchant already - you either give them mats first or pay them for mats+enchant.
---
Once they have the materials, you open trade window, put your item in the "can not be traded" window and enter in the payment amount. 
---
Then you don't accept the trade until they enchant that piece of gear.
---
Nah fuck that, good for you man! You’re allowing your wife and kids to have a better life by working your ass off. That’s awesome
---
But you are not though, you are dreaming, which is irrelevant and annoying to the rest of us. :)
---
In a duel?
---
Reddit normally ALWAYS downvotes comments like "this" because it contributes literally NOTHING
---
JohnDyr Classic
---
You think you do, but you dont. Once you play and see how good the game is. You start to care less and less about the models.
---
Farming EoS from hederines in winterspring. Unfourtunately only frost mages and hunters can do that with ease and i plan to be a druid :/
---
This is so cringe that I kinda wanted to not play classic anymore..
---
Val'shara is where is showed the most. There was no breathing room between "Lush Forest" and "Nightmare Corruption".
---
she's shitting out a 7th child? You must be a mormon
---
I am not qualified to answer that question I'm afraid.
---
But clothie dps classes are generally easy to gear up, because there is so much gear for them.
---
They will be in a zerg guild having the best items purchased for them by fans driving up the cost of everything 
---
Or having an unnaturally large presence in contested zones, as well as crashing the server during their cute little events.
---
Means literally fuck all to anyone not currently in game. Not to shit all over your “hooray blizzard” parade, but the game hopefully won’t have hundreds of people, it wants (and needs) thousands, of 10s of thousands.
---
I think he was memeing with 'provocative' from will ferrell. With you though, his shoutcasting isn't actually shoutcasting other than saying "I'm going to do this..." doesn't paint a picture of the scenario (which good shoutcasters can do beautifully) I guess it's all just fun and games, nothing serious. But to have him actually shoutcast something in this manner wouldn't be very enjoyable. He's doesn't enunciate, space his breathing or color cast. I think with practise and collecting his thoughts he could be pretty good simply because he can speak quickly an is enthusiastic.
---
Kungen .-  if he returns.
---
I like both models :) 
---
Highly recommend on doing his vanilla quests. He calls you worm and imbecile, but eventually you gain his respect when you slay Ramstein and help him avenge his death. It ends with him saluting you.
---
So we agree 3 weeks? Coolio
---
Duskwood, Silverpine, Tirisfal Glades for that gloomy astmosphere
---
7th of August is what I meant lmao nah our first
---
Most stuff is the same, but there are additional functions for PvP progress, achievement stuff is removed, etc. There are still some functions that don't work properly (like some spell functions not returning ranks of spells) but it will likely be fixed before launch.
---
Lmao people are forgetting the 40 man raids and everything that came with vanilla, I guess people are really blind with classic coming around the corner.

There are games like Monkey Island that had a toggle switch.  And despite some fans being rabid about the modern look of the character, i still enjoyed playing the modern style more.
---
I know WoW has always had great art direction.  And it’ll be mostly fine.  But I’m definitely interested in higher res textures, and better draw distance.
---
Things indeed Charge after that
---
I worry the servers would be too busy to play on the first week. Still booked leave though

You are a star - thank you :)

Yeah, I do, and I'm *not* in the Beta. Server list still shows the Offline ST realm with my 5 characters.

No problem! I don't think it will be a big deal but be careful of scammers - who take your mats and peace out on you.

There is one "pretty" zone per expansion, and it's been like that since Vanilla.

* Hyjal (An argument could be made for Twilight Highlands as well)

* Valley of the Four Winds

Most zones from most expansions get cluttered with junk to make them feel more unique to the area. To make sure you feel like you're in a different place than you just were in the last zone.

I don't know his financial situation but 60+ hours is too long to be away from your kids. Do they even know who he is?
---
Agree. It's funny, I never even noticed this preference of mine until I played ESO for a while. ESO graphics are exceptional for an MMO, design of the world is typically creative for the ES line. But theres no sense of distance or depth (at least not in the few areas I've explored) because theres just so much stuff. Hills and trees and towering towns.  Theres this huge world to explore but your experience of it is reduced to the tiny space immediately around you.
---
Yup. Guild bank is the only one for me.
---
You bet your ass I did.
---
More and more mmos are doing it. Wow isn't the first.
---
It's bad... it's overhyped, for sure, but it's the most annoying class to level in classic.  Once you know the ropes it isn't as bad but it's definitely the easiest to fuck up.  There's a reason none of the pserver speedrunners tried warrior ever in any run.
---
I used a crocolisk all the way up until I could get KingBang. This white tiger had me in awe.
---
Sorry for your loss though
---
The echo chamber is in full effect.
---
i still have the option, but when i open it, i only see stress test realms
---
I am referring to boss dps, which is what the person I replied to was also referring to. If it’s the whole raid length dps, its a different question.
---
Searing Gorge is hard. Those golems fuck me up on a warrior. 47 at least.
---
Cool story, no idea who he is.
---
Im with you.  
---
Currently im playing on a pserver to check out the hype for classic.  
---
Tbh i was worried about the graphics...  
---
But hey classic has some graphic features which you don’t have in retail (weather).  
---
Maybe this game will evolve into a new separate niche with it‘s own evolving graphics.
---
Wars are really not that bad, esp if you wep swing timer kite...
---
Lol, go read a book u jock
---
They have to possess it. Many of the best ones are a good farm so its not super easy to get them for people. Also make sure to tip!
---
To be honest Classic WoW is a distant departure from 'play whatever class you want.'
---
Some specs such as Retribution and Protection Paladins were so bad that they could not get raid spots at all. This is down to awful itemisation and talent design (Reckoning and Redoubt as two examples of dumbfuck talents that were awful for Prot Paladins.) Druids, Priests and Shamans are also outright unviable in any spec and had to play healers in endgame. There are a few exceptions, like Enhancement Shamans having godlike burst in PvP with a windfury 2h spec, but they were few and far between. 
---
I feel like it's a big mistake for the devs to recreate Vanilla exactly as it was without any balance updates because there was some really broken shit in vanilla WoW that spoiled the game experience. For example, Preparation used to reset the cooldown of Blind, which allowed for skilled rogue players to set up infinite stunlock chains and whittle any opponent down to 0.

Will do!
---
I mean tbh you can probably 20 man every raid except AQ40 and Naxx
---
Viable: capable of working successfully; feasible
---
Optimal: best or most favorable; optimum
---
Let's try them in a sentence.
---
As a Paladin taking a DPS role, having no talent points is *viable*, but putting 30 points into Holy is *optimal*.

Oh my god, why can't it just be August already.

Id be fine with that but was also hoping the next stress test would be higher level to stress test dungeons
---
Yeah Np, many guilds will have a dedicated enchanter who they funnel rare forms such as crusader to or that guy farms it himself and hes your go to guy. Or, give it a bit and there’ll be plenty of people who farm all of them
---
My entire guild is migrating to classic. Since we've all been playing together since classic it will be just like old times.

&gt;I guess so, but there are still a few more stress tests coming. Granted the next one is in 20 days, but it still surprises me that they straight up remove the Classic option from the sidebar instead of just making the stress test realm appear offline or having the Error show up when trying to log in.
---
It's probably because the first stress test is over (The 2nd one we got was extra I believe).

It will probably return for the next stress test.

Top 3:

* Mulgore
---
* Plaguelands
---
* Brill
---
Swifty fights a druid in his videos called Ff. I never forget that name.
---
oh yeah true... well i just listed the changes that had the biggest impact on me... some other changes were... somewhat understandable? like the rebalance of expierience of vanilla... i didn't find grinding XP without quests particularly interesting...
---
and the faction rewards increase was somewhat of a catch-up mechanism to content that was not that relevant anymore...
---
but i understand that those things invalidate the achievments prior to that change... i guess there will never be perfect balance xD
---
I liked McConnell when he used to do his own thing. Pilav is funny but I think he will very fast go back to bfa to defend his r1 title.
---
Being a healer or tank can be a pain without multi spec but as long as you carry some dps gear, spec won't be a major hindrance to day to day jobs like grinding mats or rep.
---
I think lhope stats showed that almost 0 players leave a character in the 50s.  It was like 0.0x% of characters at each of those levels. 
---
I think the motivation to hit 60 is so big, and you can start working on endgame content - attunements, gearing up, spamming BRD, you can go to any zone
---
Why is that?
---
You cant seriously expect people to play as they did when the game first came out? People expect you to take the raid even remotely serious by spending some time to get some consumes. Its really not a big deal.
---
I take you deleted your cosplay post there?
---
Checked your "submitted" section, nothing in the realm of either that subreddit, or WoW in general.
---
“Ishnu-alah”
---
Are there 5 regions now? Can anyone list the server regions they have for BFA / current wow?
---
I levelled to 60 as a resto Druid back in the day, it was painful as hell. Not looking forward to the same grind again although I’ll be going priest
---
Eh no it's not Krol blade is a main hand weapon lmao and it sucks for tanking anyway.
---
WoD was decent for the first half. I can't say the same for BFA.
---
Boomkin, Ret Pally, Elemental Shaman, Enhancement Shaman, Holy DPS Priest.
---
Feral and Shadow Priest are borderline, some guilds accept one.
---
Don't know if melee Hunter could be considered a meme spec as well, possibly.
---
&gt; In WoW, a very simple form of horizontal progression would be using the already-existing gear system. 
---
Yes, I've seen this example, but I don't think progression should be tied to gear in this fashion. Gear and stat bloat was already a problematic tie-in for additional abilities and horizontal progression, and we're going to see diminishing returns on that post-Naxx.
---
I firmly believe that while there can be minor focuses on gear (resilience for PVP, resistances for PVE) in this system, we really need to tie progression to either the talent system or "glyphs" or additional spells that can be earned and is actual *character progression*, rather than yet another gear treadmill. 
---
Much like what you state above about GW "mastery", although I'm not familiar with it.
---
Having a subset of another gear treadmill on progression (since we'll already need that as a carrot on a stick for content/raids) would make gear too valuable, and it already has that weight in the current game.
---
TL;DR - Gear can only get so awesome. Whoever designs the system should take into account it's already leaned on heavily and find a better route.
---
The blue scarlet chest dropped for me and paid for my first mount
---
Or maybe hillsbrad
---
You'll ask in UBRS, and they'll say "yes", but when you're in the Rookery or jump down to Rend and the entire instance comes running, you'll know that was a lie.
---
Yep, I want to play Druid this time but their tiers are such trash except tier 3.
---
nobody talking about redridge here :(
---
Dwarf priest for sure.
---
Rogue shares the tier token with warrior. Warrior gets very high priority on tier in Naxx for the 4HM encounter which requires up to 8 tanks.
---
Black Desert Online kind of did it for Xbox. They completely remade the game for Xbox, they didn’t port it.
---
I thought Ashenvale was the prettiest zone.

This guy can kill more than one at a time. Big shot.
---
Nothing.
---
In vanilla beta druids didn’t shift out of forms when they died. As a result your corpse was a... dead beast. 
---
Guess what? People skinned you, causing your corpse to despawn. To this day druids shift out of form when they die to prevent that bug.
---
Dont get the hate towards HS...Yes it forfiets your next auto but it also hits as hard as mortal strike at half the rage cost. HS is a perfectly fine rage dump pre slam. Sometimes after as well.
---
I mean, technically they have done final fantasy 14 twice. The first one was diabolical, so much so that the devs apologised.

I love to tell my previous experiences with vanilla wow back in the day. First of all pvp is a great meta of the game however it should be universally known that if you kill someone, especially if you are griefing, you only have at most 20 minutes to get out of dodge. First ask for help in the zone chat, and usually someone will help you out either with their current char or will log onto a higher level character. 
---
If that fails head to a major city and ask for help. Before you know it a raid size of high level players will head to that zone and cover it entirely looking for said griefers.
---
I'd say it closer resembles a half teenager, half man, half child.

I found a few longer ranged melee hits but that looked more like server input lag then this hitbox bug. 
---
Im hoping blizzard fixes this.
---
Bag space. Specifically items not stacking or not stacking as high. It's a minor inconvenience though.
---
The second stress test wasn’t actually the 2nd, more like 1.5. It was just an extra test linked to the first one, hence our progress was saved. 
---
There’s no reason to believe everyone who got to play last time will get to play next time.

T1 shoulders on a Tauren male are amazing, so huge.

Agreed. I love to just hang out in that zone

Panel 1: "did you dismiss your pet?"

Move MoP up to A and otherwise it’s good for me
---
! RemindMe 79
---
Just level in feral. You can heal instances leveling just fine with a bit of int gear. Then change spec at 60.
---
Was there a druid leatherworking pattern?
---
I’m going to have to this this one to the barrens
---
Easy there Satan.
---
It's much easier on a mage, although I did die a lot learning.
---
WPL zombies farming is pretty fun.
---
I still have my Tier 0.5 “purple” shadowcraft set and dual Dal’Rend blades on my rogue for transmog, love that look.
---
This is why things like raid-finder and dungeon-finder became standard. Perfectly viable builds get dubbed "meme-spec" because they aren't in speed-run guides.
---
When the game stagnates and the raids become more and more solved. Let's see how thrilled you are when the meta is a dps tank and raids take longer due to repeated wipes and idiots blindly following speed run guides.
---
I never wish harm on anyone...
---
Would join his guild and run a low profile. Just laugh my ass off, but don't drag any attention myself. Maybe play Hunter or Druid, something chill like that.

 I think he was joking lad.
---
Find a prot pally friend. WPL farming for days.
---
This is actually a neat idea.
---
Gotta get to max level first
---
That's a retarded claim to be honest
---
Thanks for the compliment. Having been away from WOW since BC pretty much i am excited to do a Dwarf hunter again. My alt was a night elf druid as well which was super fun. I enjoyed healing for raids as well as the flexibility of tanking or dps.
---
Not with the spelladin build, my understanding was that a Spelladin ret pala can be considered just slightly worse than a rogue. But I could be wrong I haven't read much about it more than that it was significantly stronger than strength ret.
---
Well you didn't miss much, Horde only have a few quests there. Still a cool zone if you want to go do some farming out of the way for a while (Felcloth, Thorium).

---
It's a 1 slot bag
---
Skinning is great till about 60. You can vendor a lot of the low level leather.
---
Also, when the darkmoon faire is in town, rugged leather kits sell well and can be farmed from the yetis in winterspring easily enough.
---
S2 Gladiator for priest is the apex of wow armor.
---
It says Forum, singular. I think I'm wasting my time here now.
---
Grizzly is great and all but for wrath I'd have to give it to howling fjord.
---
So, when i first got WoW (way back in BC), i read up on the lore of the world before i actually got to play, cause i was downloading it. 
---
Funny thing, the best way to read up on the lore back then was to read the lore books from Vanilla wow. WoWwiki had them, and when i first read them, it made it seem like the Night elves had the most lore significans of this story, and that humans were insignificant, lorewise. 
---
World of Warcraft was my first Warcraft game, i hadn't played any of the Warcraft RTS games before, so i didn't realize that until Warcraft three and WoW, Night Elves hadn't appeared the the lore at all. 
---
So, naturally, i rolled a Night elf, and I was blown away by the Beauty of Teldrassil, and I thought: Man, these night elves must be running the show. 
---
Then i went to Darnassus and found it completely empty.
---
We’ve done it twice now on Pservers in greens only. Yeah, we know they’re not 100% accurate, but you severely underestimate our preparedness.
---
man I don't even know anymore, I see some ridiculous posts and comments on here daily hard to tell whos joking
---
I had a friend in Vanilla named Tq or Tk... something like that. Definitely 2 letters.
---
this is great! ty
---
I loved Loch Modan and the dwarf starting area too for all the snow.
---
100%, put me in.
---
Did they nerf the weather effects they added in 2006? Those were sweet!
---
Eh. Too many rules. I like the dwarf only thing, I had a guild once that was just dwarves, gnomes and people will exalted Ironforge.
---
keep surfing the new section bud
---
Well, imps don’t pull at least
---
Nesingwary
---
&gt;As an IT guy, I can only shudder at the thought of one blade getting smashed to 100% load while the others just cruise. You know the end times are coming; you just dont know when.
---
As a not-IT guy, i have no idea why this made me laugh as hard as i am, but god my sides hurt...
---
That's pretty much vanilla vs retail in a nutshell.
---
Hinterlands and Tanaris I can get behind, but Feralas? Fuck that place! (But I am glad some of you seem to enjoy it)
---
Never expected to see a Seinfeld reference here👍🏻
---
Ashenvale without hesitation.
---
But I’ve loved Desolace and Azshara for the sensation of loneliness. Those zones were really remote!

Dude, you have no clue. The guild Apes will destroy MC first or second reset.

My rogue has both claws, didn’t need them but nobody else wanted them. The effect is still really fun to play with and it procs often.

Publix life! I love my job there but I'm so excited to take time off and enjoy this amazing game for at least a week off.
---
i have no fucking idea who this is but yes someone needs to hire him
---
Yeah and you definitely have enough information on this complete stranger to say hes wanting his life away.
---
Chinglish on his stream has confirmed oceanic servers, just not on beta.
---
10-4 Grats on your Flamingo it was one of my 5 back in Vanilla and will be again. 
---
He was my sacrifice to Rag each time we did that instance. Tanks and Melee DPS loved his little noises haha.
---
Legendary commitment
---
I decided on rolling a dagger rogue (and level as such) this time around. I don't think there are any equivalently great daggers from quests around  :(
---
I remember three dungeon quests that gave amazing swords. Razorfen, SM and Mara.
---
PS: Please do not tell me that sword spec is better and that I should level swords. Been there, done that. Gonna duo level with a friend (feral) so it should all be okay and most importantly: fun!  :)
---
What is the Night Elf wielding?
---
Not with that attitude.
---
If they intend to test the content at 30-60 then they would need players to reach that lvl.
---
Blizzard teased us with glaives but never delivered until Demon Hunters iirc
---
Dude, you’ve got no idea. The first guild to down rag will do so first or second reset. You just don’t understand that you don’t need to farm fr gear to down him. If you actually think it will take 3 months from launch then I feel sorry for you :)
---
Yes, it's insane. I guess this is the extreme end of the #NoChanges mentality where all rationality is dropped in favor of wanting to keep broken shit like this in the game.
---
How these idiots managed to create a reddit account is beyond me.
---
BC druids were bae
---
It's cool but has an extremely low proc rate.
---
If you are on a pve server do the nesingwary quests in STV.
---
There are great grinding spots for 32-38 and a lot of quests that ask you to grind mobs.
---
As a Tauren Mulgore is definitely in my top list, it just feels like home. But in general I love Kalimdor as a whole. Im surprise no one here has mentioned Thousand Needles. From on top of the mesas I think it’s one of the most beautiful zones especially when you can see the shimmering flats open up in the distance. The rugged peaks of stonetalon, the red sands of durotar, the shadowed woods of darkshore. I could go on.
---
Eastern Kingdoms definitely have some beautiful places (Hinterlands, Arathi) but I think as a whole Kalimdor is my favorite.
---
Vendor as in NPCs? Rather than auction house that is.
---
I think I grinded out 2 levels in Tyrs Hand in EPL. I dont think I even quested in winterspring. I did WPL, EPL and thought oh man, no more quests ... well, gonna grind elites then
---
Oh and that as a prot specced warrior using a twohanded weapon (I think it was the polearm from the AV quest)
---
In the autumn I like West Fall, in the summer I prefer The Green Hills of Stranglethorn before the rains come, the winter can always be best appreciated inside Ironforge with the tree.
---
That's what I'd go with too. Even the music is what I would consider the most beautiful soundtrack in the game.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwMic-KXQlY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwMic-KXQlY) 
---
Feralas is my all time favorite zone. I love everything about it.
---
Arathi Highlands because of the pensive piano music.
---
Actually, this seem rather smart to me. I mean ... I leveled as a prot warrior using two handed weapons or going dual wield. So I am not sure who was dumber back than.  :D
---
You can’t seriously expect people to play as they do on pservers? Not only are they tuned totally differently, but due to accessibility the populations sensibility will likely be different too.  Guilds can buy their tanks flasks it’s really not a big deal.
---
I just want this to happen, whenever dks come out instead of just creating a new one you should be able to talk to some npc who kills you and ressurects you as a dk. I would like to play dk but i dont want to let go of everything i achieved on my character. It wouldnt mess up the game because you wouldnt be creating a copy. This would be permanent and you would lose your original character forever. It even makes sense lore wise. All races can be dks and dks are just resurected. Just make it a simple quest where you die and get resurected.
---
&gt;Alliance PVE
---
Yeah loved it, loved it the other 9 million times it’s been posted here too
---
Was gonna say 47-52, but yea. Somewhere around 45ish I always get somewhat burnt out.
---
It's a shame that the only armor I like worse than my old main's class armor is Paladin T1, made up for by Paladin T2
---
Sadly Mage T2 helm had horrible clipping issues and the shoulders ... not as bad as I used to think they are but still hella weird. And T3 just looks like a child wrapped in thich winter clothing.
---
All the other armor looks pretty fucking cool to me.
---
1.3 is the fastest wep. If boss hits give you a full rage bar you can dump it quicker with heroic strikes. Iv also heard faster weps generate more rage but havnt tested myself. On some private servers the meta is slow 1h wep, I believe due to boss hits not generating much rage and never crushing so tanks could stack crit over def. Will be finkels skinner or alcors sunrazor if I had to guess.
---
I can't wait for people to see how difficult Vanilla progression actually was getting 40 players geared up to do these raids is not easy. Especially in gear check bosses that require lots of DPS like Ragnoros, Vael, and Nef. I don't even see a single boss dying in Classic in the first 2 weeks. Everyone that downplays the difficulty of gearing up in Vanilla and taking down the bosses I can't wait to see their surprise.
---
I always thought Winterspring was beautiful and I love snowy places.
---
Feralas, for sure. That was one of the most immersive, and mysterious zones I experienced during Vanilla. Second would probably be Wintergrasp.
---
First of all you’re objectively wrong second of all put the soymilk down
---
This is exactly what retail is around. People must understand that there is no perfect environment. Even your lives that you are in control of is different from what is ideal to you.
---
Endgame you will only need crossbows. The only exception is the hunter quest bow in mc
---
Does that particular bear have different stats or a different look from other bears? Love the proper vanilla adventure to tame him, but what are the practical benefits?
---
All look better than bfa gear
---
Oh that is demon hunter 100% -&gt;  glaive/naked chest/eyeband
---
I really like Teldrassil
---
Project1999, which I highly recommend for one play through, is the closest think outside of RuneScape to do what Classic is doing.
---
I always liked Arathi
---
During the early patches, WoW couldn't handle 40 people together.  When you went to MC you basically had to allow an extra 5 seconds for each spell to cast.
---
Much of the communication in our first MC runs was about who was currently completely lagged out, and who was back and able to do things.
---
If I'm honest, graphics.
---
I really liked Feralas, the zone felt so huge with the massive trees
---
All things being equal, a Paladin is *never* just slightly worse than a rogue in terms of raw dps.
---
People have a misconception that what we are talking about is some kind of negligible 5 to 10% penalty to Ret damage that keeps them from being optimal.
---
They are nowhere near optimal. Their damage is very, very low. They are viable the same way a Holy Priest spamming Smite instead of healing is viable.
---
Yeah, you can probably clear the content. You can also run a mile in ankle weights.
---
Dorf guild was a thing on warhammer online pserver.
---
They were hardcore rp but somehow still the #1-2 guild on the server (return of reckoning you should check it out before classic)
---
They already have some on beta. Not AAP quality but they show you where to pick up quest and where to go to complete them.
---
I have always loved Stranglethorn Vale and loved questing there. I spent Levels 29 - 42 there back in Vanilla times. Not only is it huge, beautiful and mystical, I also loved the tons of leather I could gather :)
---
Un'Goro comes close, and certainly there are other beautiful places in this vast world, but STV will always be my favourite.
---
They had an artifact weapon that was a glaive believe GM only. Had a pandaren face on the hilt.
---
Around 25 I stop buying skills I don't need to get to 40 faster. Saves you some gold towards mount and you can pick up the skills later
---
I tried liking felwood, but yea, i give it a solid 5/10
---
I did level to 4 in the first test, and didn't have time to play during the second test.
---
Great post.
---
I am so happy that it’s Christianity in WoW and not some Jewish Star of David or some Muslim symbol. That’s how you how that Christianity is the true religion

Parry haste does not work like you describe
---
We got the Warglaives of azinoth and Illidans blindfold
---
and that was all we got till real DH were a thing
---
Fun fact: A lvl 20 Paladin can be just as good as a lvl 60 for BoK and BoF support. Though you will die quickly if focused on so keep a low profile.
---
[Yeah referencing Illidan in Warcraft 3](http://i.imgur.com/y3HDVO8.jpg)
---
You were only invited to the 1st one. You need to be invited again for the next one.
---
Can we get a confirmation on this? Do you have a link to a vod or a blue post?
---
How does it work? 
---
Tbh I've played WoW from BC to WoD and I never knew of parry haste haha
---
Saying these things is such a cop out, though. From anybody having played on private servers, it's quite clear Druids are the least used class for raiding, because of these things.
---
In terms of PvP all 3 specs play the same. While the playstyle is interesting and you're rotating abilities across all forms, it just isn't as fun to spec Feral/Boomkin and play the same way as if you were resto. Which is why in the end, most people go resto for PvP, because you're harder to kill and do almost the same damage as the Feral/Balance specced druid.
---
Innervate is cool at entry level raiding and dungeons. But fights are so fast now, most people don't run out of mana or need the Innervate.
---
In combat rez is cool, but them having that is literally part of why they're the least favored healer out there, because people want the OOC rez, in case half your raid/group wipes.
---
Tank druid is fun, but still outshined by warriors. There's a reason why you bring 10+ Warriors and only 1-2 druids.
---
This is coming from a druid main on private servers.
---
When esfand did the nerd weeze when the lvl 18 4str 4sta belt dropped I became a fan for life lol. Also check out Payo, genuine dude makes funny pvp videos and anytime I ran into him on private servers was always friendly (at least to a fellow hordie) I dont watch much streams but I'll click any video from these 2.
---
The autumnal afternoon Azshara will always have a special place in my heart.
---
Yeah, vendor everything up to medium leather. Then take a look at the AH. With so many leveling, it might be worth it just to vendor it too. Alternatively, send it to a bank alt and wait till the economy is a little more established before AHing it, like when you hit 60 and need the gold for the epic mount. 👍
---
Tbc was good, and I had fun (for me personally) but I would agree that it was the very beginning of the end :/
---
Why so empty
---
I'm very lucky to have extremely flexible vacation scheduling so I'm holding off. I'm not confident the release is set in stone with the issues I've seen pertaining to layering. They were some pretty fundamental gaps for exploitation, as simple as logging in and out.
---
1. Lesser Arcanum of Constitution (Head &amp; Legs) - This comes from a repeatable quest in the Burning Steppes, anyone can do it, you just need the right Libram (drops off high level mobs at random) and the (usually quite expensive or timeconsuming) materials to go along with it. You can buy the Libram off the AH, but not the finished enchant, those are BOP.
---
2. Lesser Agility (Cloak) - This formula is a rare drop from mobs in Tanaris, you'll have to find an Enchanter that has it and bring them the materials and some coin.
---
3. Major Health (Chest) - This formula is less rare because it's from a vendor in Winterspring, but she doesn't always sell it. The materials are going to be expensive.
---
4. Superior Stamina (Wrist) - Another rare drop formula.
---
5. Superior Agility (Gloves) - This formula won't be dropping until guilds get into AQ, so you won't find it for the better part of a year. It's very expensive.
---
6. Minor Speed (Feet) - Every Enchanter with the proper level will know this.
---
7. Fiery Weapon (MH) - Another rare formula, but this one only drops from one boss in BRD. Be prepared to pay.
---
8. Weapon Agility (OH) - You have to be honored with Timbermaw Hold to buy and use this enchant. That's quite a grind. Again, be prepared to pay.
---
Home

You could practically feel the humid jungle heat, while questing.
---
I remember around lv 50 in Azshara, you get a whole level very fast if I recall correctly. :)
---
Tier 2 Pally will be forever known as the best looking tier set ever created
---
Doesn't it come out the 26th in NA?  At like 3 pm.
---
Forgot about those. BC was so mixed for me
---
What? Matters where the individual resides... I mean it comes out the 26th in the US
---
Yeah sure, paladins with Nightfall will probably always be able to get into raids as DPS. They objectively do horrible damage though, but it's not all that matters in classic.
---
It‘s okay, it‘s classic.
---
They already exist. How ever none of them are as good as blizzards implementation we got in cata.
---
Don't know if you plan to play a mele or range but some of the quest awarding weapons or wands makes your killing a lot faster
---
Sorry about that one hater. Anyway. This might be "dreaming," but I like dreaming.
---
I liked the early days of WotLK. Before Dungeon Finder was created. Before ammo and soul shards were gone (I think that was the pre-Cata patch?), before AOE abilities had a cap, before spells and professions were simplified. I liked how there was this big, looming bad guy that you couldn't even access. I didn't appreciate that one until you could finally kill him - it was like there was no point anymore. At least before ICC, there was always a reason to keep going. After it, though, it felt like "Okay, this was the buildup since Warcraft 3. So... let's farm for some mats? Or something?"
---
Anyway. My Dream Patch would be the early, pre-ICC days, with simplicities removed, elites brought back, XP reductions removed, gimmicky class and profession stuff returned (including Rogue professions and borderline useless abilities), heirlooms removed, class quests, etc.
---
Man please, you do realize we are talking world first guild now right?
---
Anyway, so how long time do you reckon BWL take to be cleared? Months?
---
I know for a fact that Nef will die first day BWL is released, change my mind.
---
Keep it as is, snowflakes have no business in Vanilla.
---
Good work, looking awesome!
---
In Legion I would've 100% agreed with you and it was one of my biggest criticisms--but I do think they took steps toward fixing this in BFA (one of the few highlights of that expansion). Stormsong Valley and Vol'Dun do a pretty good job of making a zone feel open and vast but still lived-in.
---
You just parry
---
Just checked.  I was removed as well.
---
What do you mean by snowflakes?
---
Mulgore is definitely my favourite, I don't think that I'd have kept playing WoW if my first character weren't Tauren.
---
So full of sunshine and greenery, it really got to me.
---
yea i'll keep checking
---
Keep it, I need everyone in my raid to be the best spec to get the job done
---
!Remindme 87 days
---
Parry is the best type of damage avoidance because of parryhaste. I can't confirm if it's 40% or 50% faster attack, but it does increase your DPS, which no other avoidance does. I think many would agree it's worth picking up deflection while levelling warriors and paladins.
---
Anything in the right brackets 19, 29, 39 etc that makes sense, e.g. leather gear + agility is worth googling to see if it’s worth holding in to.
---
Weird thing. I never really liked Nagrand. I always skipped that zone while leveling alts. A few days ago I got fed up with Northrend on my 74 lvl mage and decided to go back to see TBC again. I picked Nagrand and... it was beautiful! Peaceful and eldritch at the same time. Had a blast getting to level 80 there. I hated the fact I had to move on when I dinged 80.
---
Well it took 77 days for fully MC geared raiders to take down Nef before they were clearing BWL up to Nef every time but he's hard af and a huge gear check. I would guess that it'll probably be faster then that depending on if they release him Nerfed or not cause a huge issue with Nef and why he was such a major gear check was the adds health your DPS had to be in almost full T2 to keep up so after the world firsts were out of the way they did nerf it.
---
Such a cool spell too. Shame.
---
Wow, you listed it perfectly, in the excat order I would have. Good job.
---
Well, some of them may be in a PVP spec or PVP hybrid spec because they can’t afford the switch between the 2 each time move from PVP to a raid.
---
I used my first respec at level 40, went from Affliction to Destruction. It was only 1g, but knowing it would increase always made me hesitant to do it. It was nice - it meant your choices really mattered, but not to the extent that you can never go back. I've got no issue with it.
---
And don't be that guy who says that world first raiders know the strats now like they weren't on test servers prior to the release back then testing the raids.
---
First zone I ever seen in WoW. It cemented my love for this game for ever.
---
I fail to see your point. There is no creativity in retail.
---
There will always be an optimal spec for every class and most people will play said spec.
---
Yes some people don't care about being the best or seeing the biggest numbers, but the respec cost has nothing to do with class/spec design.
---
I quit after clearing TOC hardmode too
---
Shadow moon Valley in WoD is one of the prettiest zones in the game
---
Wait, there’s no weather in retail?
---
I always thought brd dropp ironfoe to be one of the best tanking weapons pre raid. To bad about the dropp rate
---
Hopefully, since I don’t do pve raids, them defaulting to pvp spec is best
---
I always loved Desolace too. There are dozens of us!
---
Was during stress test and Org was actually down. Basically it was just my character on his own and then disconnected, but got this screenshot before I did.
---
You know that all Bosses will be as they were in 1.12 so you do the math, he will die first day. 
---
This is also why MC will be cleared first weeks not months...
---
The remainder of your swing timer is reduced by 40% unless it would result in less than 20% of your swing timer remaining, in that case, it does nothing.
---
Reddit will be redditt dude, dont take much notice of the spergs
---
I appreciate the more monster approach Forsaken had in Classic and the like, than the "sexy undead" their main characters have now.
---
We don't know how the bosses will be tuned we know the game is 1.12 but that would mean that all of the raids were already out.
---
Limiting the amount of times you'll respec will increase the identity of your character. "I'm an aoe grind frost mage" vs being a mage that changes specialty often between pom pyro, frost, deep fire, aoe frost, etc. Just one example. Forgive my poor grammar, hope my one  opinion was clearly expressed
---
Yea.  They were trying to pull WoW's version of EQ to look cool.
---
Hmmm so many, but for each xpac:
---
Vanilla - Azshara
---
BC - Nagrand
---
WotLK - Howling Fjord
---
Cata - Twighlight Highlands
---
MoP - Eternal Blossoms/Four Winds
---
WoD - Nagrand
---
Legion - Suramar/Azsuna
---
BFA - Stormsong Valley
---
Play however you want. Just don't expect people to have the same mindset, when you ask to join a group/guild/dungeon/raid.
---
Some people want to get shit done fast, so they can do whatever they like doing in WoW.
---
I mean spoiled children.
---
There is no room for creativity in retail. It’s a shit game with no flexibility. In classic, there is a lot of room for really cool and creative builds, but almost none of them will be experienced because people don’t want to waste their entire bankroll to try out a few versions.
---
Nice.
---
Personally am going to be using old graphics, but i'm all in optional visual options if they make some people happy
---
I wouldn't say they look that bad.
---
At 60, the best blue youll be able to get in P1 is a crossbow, in P3, a different crossbow. In MC, youll be able to get the Hunter quest bow fairly quickly and use that until you can get the Chromagg crossbow, if not, Ouro's gun (which is worse than the crossbow, but better than the bow). Finally, the best epic you can get is the crossbow out of Naxx.
---
So mostly using crossbows once youre 60, if you fall into the niche of a casual MC raider, you might use a bow forever though.
---
I still have Lupos and The Rake, 2bad Lupos doesn't do shadow damage in the classic release!
---
Bro you still have to dismiss your fucking pet in BFA.
---
Pets are constantly "fixed" and still regularly pull entire dungeons.
---
Winter spring was a good one. I haven’t been there since tbc came out and I was leveling there before going to outlands.
---
All raids Will be 1.12, they are just waiting to release them.
---
A lot of people here including myself wish we could be in your position and experience WoW for the first time again while knowing nothing. It only cost $15/month to play classic. I would recommend considering going in blind and try it out a month or two.
---
Earthsong Falls in Mara.
---
How can someone seriously play a class to 60 and raid on it, log in many dozens of times, open their character screen thousands of times, and never read the name of their class? 
---
To be honest OP, if you like being able to use all the weapons and tier gear from early content, and DPS to your hearts content with all the good rogue panic buttons, with no expectations in raids besides melee DPSing, you should stick to Rogue. Warrior can be legitimately frustrating for that kind of player - I know from my own experience, wanting all of that and not getting it. I'm just going to tank for classic instead.
---
Dying
---
Always gonna be Darnassus and Darkshore for me. Been my favorite since BC when I bought the game
---
Not even Naxxramas, at this point, is considered VERY HARD for the hardcore guilds. It's just that it's the hardest it's going to get and it's the last raid, so they care about getting the 'first' kills of their server/faction. Naxxramas is cleared by the best guilds the same day it's released.
---
Remember to leave Aspect of the Pack on at all times.
---
I am talking about people generally Being super mega bad at the game 14 years ago. There are people who have played vanilla for 14 years now on private servers, sure they are not exactly the same but Very very close to it. 
---
You’re gonna be so disapointed when the best guild clears everything so fast :)
---
The Elwyn Forest song stuck in my head.
---
You sound like a good dude!
---
In the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter for 95% of content.  Just spam threat building abilities and position the mob/s properly.
---
I have been following Classic since the reveal they've made 0 mention about how they're tuning the bosses in raids. I would assume they would go with original release tuning to make it challenging but also to ensure raids last longer to keep Classic relevant longer. To assume they're going straight to 1.12 tuning would mean they might as well come out with Naxx right off the bat cause everything else was nerfed to nothing.
---
Respeccing is a big gold dump. It helps keep the economy in check.
---
Indeed, the FOV slider is a meme but it actually had a hude impact on how developers approached their games, we need to keep reminding developers about FOV slider and thing slike that.
---
Small things aren't in the content progression, or so it seems in the Beta. What if cultists in Silithus will be present, will drop the 3-piece set and we will be able to summon tier 1 council elites? Some healers likely will be happy, but if Cenarion Hold quests not related to the raid would be present then possibly even tier 2 and 3 summons. (and if CH is operational - they could offer gear turn in quests too...). How much of this actually should be under content progression to not overshadow early WoW gear?
---
Yeah I hate clutter-ness the most out of any zone design. Makes it hard to navigate and avoid mobs if you're trying to get to a certain area. And lots of the BFA zones are very hard to navigate with so many mountains. Makes it really annoying to traverse on foot.
---
We won’t
---
Hyjal was great and all but I’da given the Cata award to Vashj’ir (sic)
---
Good is subjective. I think most classic players are happy without the full map integration we got in cata.
---
Hi, this is from my personal notes I ll be using. Maybe it will help. Its focused on alliance tho, and around arms spec with axe specialization.
---
WEAPON PROGRESSION:
---
lvl 15 - Smite's Mighty Hammer(Deadmines) or Taskmaster Axe(Deadmines)
---
lvl 23 - Bloodpike(World drop)
---
lvl 29 - Corpsemaker(RFK)
---
lvl 30 - Whirlwind Axe(Warrior-Quest)
---
lvl 34 - Bonebiter(Cathedral-Quest)
---
lvl 44 - Stoneslayer/The Rockpounder(Uldaman)    OR lvl 43 - Executioner's Cleaver(axe)(World Drop)
---
lvl 51 - Lord Alexander's Battle Axe(World drop)
---
lvl 59 - Warlblade of Caer Darrow(Scholo-Quest)
---
lvl 58 - Demonshear(Stratholme)
---
lvl 60 - Obsidian Edged Blade(Molten Core)
---
lvl 60 - Bonereaver's Edge(Ragnaros)
---
As a casual I enjoyed wod. Lots to do, no pressure. Actually the only expansion that doesn’t feel like there are things to do without it being a weekly/daily/whatever grind is BFA. All the others had some fun things for me.
---
Right there with you. Im traveling a bunch this summer and fall so it’ll be interesting balancing out days. Most of my days will be actually vacation, but every night though I’ll be hopping on for a couple hours I hope!
---
Most private servers aren't even close and the few that are still aren't on the money and back in vanilla small percents mattered. Hence why Nef and Rag took so long to be killed because it was mathematically impossible due to gear issues.
---
I'd recommend a [funeral service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ) at the Winterspring Frostfire Hot Springs.
---
Mulgore 'til I die.
---
Great list, this would be very close to my own! I freaking love Loch Modan.
---
Ferales
---
The abilities will remain the same for 2-3 years.  Think about that.  In all of WoW's history there has been constant revision and iteration.  For 2-3 years all skills, talents, abilities, will be the same as day one.
---
Cookie cutter is all we will have.  Sorry.
---
Look at all the thousands of hours of fun streamers and beta players have had without ever hitting 60 or stepping foot in a raid the past few weeks. Since the vast majority of beta players (and even streamers) are vanilla accounts, they've all done it before too. Raiding is not the be all end all of Classic. 
---
If you find everything else about the game but raiding pointless, and you have 10 hours a week, then no, I guess you shouldn't play, because you probably won't keep a spot in a guild that satisfies you with 10 hours a week (and no professions to make up for it).
---
I was in Kryptic, we were a small guild, but we tried making waves wherever we could. I don’t remember bumping into your guildies specifically, but alliance on our server were a hard bunch to fight. We had a lot of great fights, and a lot of hard losses lol. Especially to Inquisition.
---
The only guild we would KOS was SFC Alliance. I never appreciated them camping lowbie areas. The trouble with them was when you killed one of them, their entire guild would respond.
---
I hope that the Classic launch is better than the original Vanilla launch.
---
Although some loot lag would really make it feel authentic.
---
Hey at least you can make your chars Aug 13th!
---
How long was the run?
---
The wolf from LBRS is the answer... for he pulses Attack Power
---
Also, purple
---
Yes sir, I did. I also mass delete my entire account every so often.
---
Would have been cool to opt in/out of better graphics like you can use old models in retail.
---
[I honestly don't even dislike it](https://i.imgur.com/7Gz3uPQ.png), might be Stockholm syndrome tho.
---
Enemy players.
---
Dude. Using Patch 1.12 basically means every Fix a boss got from release of the game until 1.12 is in. Don’t make a fool out of yourself. Why would they revert stuff? They have been saying it’s going to be as close to 1.12 they can make it. Which means they wont buff Bosses to pre 1.12 state.
---
Blackwing Lair and beyond at least.
---
No one has mentioned this Bc this is obviously not going to be in the game phase 1.
---
Shout out to you folks who get that kind of PTO. A little jealous that you get more just for that month than I get in a year! :)
---
It wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't as strong as what you could pick up in the raids
---
The snobs and elitists wish they were you, experiencing the game for the first time. They're trying to get back something they never will.
---
Honestly seeing so many different answers from so many different people is a testament to how incredible the overall design of the entire world is. 
---
Tons of time, thought, and love into each and every zone.
---
I still have them on my shaman , still to this day in inventory so i equip them from time to time and try to get a proc.
---
Thank you. The ret pally sympathizers are out in full force.
---
i mean every idea starts as a dream ;)
---
but i expect no change... i just wanted to post my opinion and hear what others had to say.
---
Ammo and soul shards were removed in cata /pre-patch to cata... Thats why i said i'm not intrested in gameplay after wotlk... they made too many changes to the gameplay...
---
well, we will see... if classic is a success, maybe we will see a classic branch of wow and those dreams become reality? who knows... in the mean time lets enjoy good old wow classic \^\^
---
Do you have a link to this exact talent setup mate? Is it a damage/tank-setup?
---
My first character ever was a Tauren, and I still remember even 13 years later walking along the road to Bloodhoof Village, hearing a low rumble, and turning to find a herd of Kodo stampeding past. I had no idea that something like that could happen in a game lol, funny how easily impressed / immersed I was back then.
---
Accurate.
---
There's nothing wrong with having a few people try to be offspec and do the niche roles.  However, I feel that far too many people are trying to be contrarians and it's going to muddy the fuck out of the waters in the beginning.
---
/s? Clearly the context is about dates.
---
It took time Because people sucked and when MC was released you had wierd stats on many items. Those are fixed in 1.12 so it Will be way easier this time around.
---
You've clearly never played a paladin in pvp.
---
If it was as bad as you imply, priests wouldn't last very long.
---
TBC is not on the same tier as Vanilla. It introduced flying mount, introduced dailies, destroyed wpvp, and killed old vanilla content.
---
I fully intend on having one alt in Classic whose job it is to pick the weirdest, most situational builds ever.
---
He'll be "...THAT guy" with all the weird talents.
---
Hey, I don't know why I remembered this 3 months later, but here's a video of an ele shaman getting mad procs from hand of Edward the Odd. Enjoy!
---

---
It just has to be all or nothing.  Having highly detailed character models back-dropped against low res world textures is too jolting.
---
Duskwoods slams all zones for moody, creepy atmosphere. If you like that thing (I do) it's the best zone in the game.
---
We could expect that, but still small things like patch 1.9 fish and consumable additions are in the game. We can expect cultists camps to be empty but what if they aren't and Blizzard sees it as a to small thing to bother? It's bit theoretical situation but still plausible.
---
I love desolace! It's got this beautiful bleakness to it. The coast is also really quite beautiful. Can't help but imagine how stunning it would be covered in night elven structures and shrubs.
---
It's not viable. Period.
---
Any guild good enough and organized enough to kill a couple bosses in BWL will also be experienced enough not to bring a ret.
---
what a brilliant idea :D would play that xD
---
Bosses weren't broken just because they were hard and required gear checks to achieve and it took longer to get geared up. You keep saying people sucked back then but 90% of my guild came from Everquest which was far harder WoW was a joke and the game was not hard to pick up at all it's actually funny that people think that players from Vanilla just sucked at the game.
---
Vanilla &gt;&gt;&gt; TBC
---
Flying mount and dailies suck. Wpvp and socialization die in TBC.
---
I don't do dungeons with hunters.  Rules to live by.
---
Bringing your best bud back up to speed would be a *chore*?
---
I have made one ;)
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flcreations.wowcountdown
---
it's not too far from the undead starting area
---
Agree on most of this list, but I by far preferred High Mountain in Legion.
---
So that's 40% reduction from 100% remaining to 60% remaining...  Range of 40-20% reduction from 60% to 20% remaining (average 20% reduction.)... Then a 0% reduction under 20% remaining. So that's (0.4*0.4+0.4*0.2+0.2*0) =0.24 or 24% weapon swing reduction on average per parry?
---
Ironically, full lock tier sets are great for pvp since they have almost the exact same amount of stamina granted which is mega useful in pvp.
---
So wearing your cool sets will give you an edge over wearing clownsuits for pvp purposes , discounting engineering items ofc which can often be hidden anyway (goblin rocket helm etc).
---
Why you attacking from the front.
---
Sounds the same as osrs, point is im pretty efficienct mindend with mmo's and I would like to study what I want to do when it gets released, if I want to play it.
---
Just remember this when it takes 2-3 months to kill Ragnoros for even the top guilds. One of the biggest issues of modern WoW is how gear is handed to you and raids are easily cleared by low tier guilds in the first month or two from release.
---
Thank you! This is what I've been looking for!!
---
It wasn't that bad, I think it was about an hour of repeated deaths, from Deathknell to the Marris Stead. 
---
Unfortunately, if you die and reach spirit healer A, then walk to spirit healer B and rez there - you get teleported all the way back to spirit healer A. So you can't skip graveyards. So it's very repetitive. But so worth it.
---
We also ran all the way to the old (and closed) mount Hyjal, which took 4 hours of repeated deaths, all the way from the nelf starter zone. Also totally worth it. 
---
On the previous stress test last week, we ran all the way from Stormwind to the chapel on Eastern Plaguelands, to see the t3 quest givers (there was a great cutscene there, a summit of Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn officials). However, they were missing - they're probably not there because the Naxx patch isn't out on the stress test server yet.
---
I posted another photo of us from retail before:

---
Oh my, yes. All opinions on expansions aside, I can't wait for a world where I don't have to race to the finish line!
---
Your memory is false then, all footage on YT is from pservers.
---
Most big games takes 4-8 years to create. 3 months is no fricking time, you attenspan limited potato head!
---
Yes. Another way to put it is 0.24 extra swings per parry.
---
This is the only Nathanos I know so when I was watching BFA I recognized the name of that character but I couldn't place it because the model was so different. His little shack area was one of my main chill spots in Plaguelands when my Rogue and my buddy Rogue were out ganking Alliance.
---
Not sure if you’ve been trolling all this time or not lol.
---
This.  I hate seeing people push for BC to release after the original Classic content is finished.  Much better off going the OSRS route.
---
You’re not alone.  I would welcome the updated character models with open arms.  Shittier graphics isn’t what I liked about vanilla.  It was the gameplay.  And better looking graphics wouldn’t change that.
---
We’re all adults this is a 15 year old game.
---
lol it's penor and balls. Nice my dude.
---
I accidentally pull so much shit as a priest with shadow word pain but always blame it on the DPS/huntard
---
Dude, that's brilliant.
---
Shitty dps and usually the worst skilled players
---
So they fakeout by reserving their names on a server they won't play on when that service opens, allowing others to take their name on their intended server? I don't see the biggest streamers giving up their names all of classic, all for the sake of a couple of hours of peaceful leveling on launch.
---
So did the server survive or did it start lagging to all shit? This is the most people I’ve seen in a small condensed area since Pandaria.
---
Definitely not if you think that a guild will get 40 people attuned and geared up to kill the first boss of MC in the first week you are trolling and you don't just think that you think that a guild is actually going to get 40 people to 60 and get geared enough to kill Ragnoros in the first week or two. That's actually the funniest thing I have ever heard and cannot wait for Classic to release and people to get a huge wake up call about how much harder Vanilla WoW was then current.
---
What would lower respec costs accomplish tho? Everyone would have the same soecs for raiding and everyone would respec to the same specs for pvp?
---
People don’t want to try them cause they aren’t as good.
---
That's what I have been wondering, but seems like general consensus is that this behavior is working as it should be.
---
I always had a soft spot for Feralas.
---
I prefer darkshore.
---
The mage tier set in Firelands did the same thing. It would summon mirror images that you couldn't control or click off the buff and if anything hostile was within casting ranged they'd target it and start casting.
---
That would be such a stupid reason to have to miss launch day.
---
I think Feralas would be my easy #1.  I actually remember when I first leveled my very first character.  I was running through Feralas on my mount over a bridge and I just stopped.  I just looked around at what they made and thought "this is beautiful."
---
Warlocks would like to have a word.
---
Blizzard should've never started giving lore NPC's unique models, IMO. It makes the game so much more grounded to have lore NPC's using the same model as you do. They look just as plain as you do, with at best some unique armor, but they need a freaking raid to be killed. It feels very different than when they're using some model that just looks like a different race or new breed.
---
I always used to think the dwarf was firing the fireball from his gun
---
And for any inclined,you could follow the nearby river north and say hello to old school Tirion Fordring living in his crappy shack^^
---
Its not the same raptor. And he’s only level 19. 31 levels is a long way to go considering I can only fight things my level to get him exp.
---
We have zero confirmation that blizzard is even remotely thinking about an open beta.
---
Generally an open beta is for hype generation and stress testing, because the closed beta is intensive bug hunting.
---
Wow classic is hyped and we have stress tests, don't hold your breath for an open beta lol.
---
S: Vanilla
---
A: The Burning Crusade
---
B: Wrath of the Lich King
---
C: Nothing Here
---
D: Cataclysm
---
F (Logged in and out tier): Battle for Azeroth
---
The rest of the expansions I never played.
---
What a lousy gate keeping attitude. Let’s try to explain why something is the way it is instead of shitting on people, no?
---
I wis demon hunters had that death animation. Stabbing themsleves in the chest with the glaive.
---
The cultists weren't there in the stress test when we all did the "first to touch the gong wins" race.
---
We also didn’t have weak auras telling us every mechanic that was happening so the complexity being higher now is true but we also have the tools to easily deal with them.
---
Far from it.  I’ve been playing EQ TLP (time lapse progression) servers for close to a decade now.  And finally tried EQ2 for the first time when they released their most recent fresh TLP server in March. They release fresh ones every couple of years.
---
The WoW devs should study up on how EQ has done it because it’s honestly done really well after some trial and error on their part.
---
I raided and PvPed with two exceptional hunters, but most who picked the class enjoyed the utter ease of sending in a pet and doing damage in safety.  That mentality leads to a lot of low caliber players ruining the reputation of all.
---
The second they start streaming classic content - which for many will be day 1 - viewers are going to find out if there is someone with that exact name in that exact spot, with the exact gear etc, on their server. It won't take long at all.
---
Weary traveler
---
“If I want to play “
---
Answer that question before doing anything
---
P99 is a private server.  Not the same thing as the actual company releasing classic versions of their games.
---
However, Daybreak Games does do fresh Classic servers for EQ every couple years and has for a long time.
---
really? nice :) The streams I saw stick to the road so the camps weren't visible.
---
Rift did that
---
Expense limits experimentation, but forces creativity. If a player is ignoring guides and such and wishes to develop their own builds in isolation, this can be an issue.
---
But in the long term, cheap or free respecs result in a meta where all players use the same cookie-cutter builds for each playstyle - so they'll use the best PvP spec for PvP, the best tank spec for tanking, the best DPS spec for DPS, etc. They can even swap out talent builds for individual raids and battlegrounds, since they they likely stop by a major city anyway.
---
Expensive respecs mean that players have an incentive to generalise, and make builds that are good at a lot of different things, instead of being the best at only one thing.
---
Cheap respecd also remove a layer of defense against social pressure, because it is a lot harder to demand that another player respecs when there are actually serious obstacles to them doing so. When you could change your spec at will to help out the group at little or no cost (and trivially change back to your preferred spec afterwards), refusing to do so makes you look like the arsehole. If changing your spec is costly and has weight, and has more of a lasting impact on your enjoyment on the game, it is a lot harder for other players to demand that you change without THEM being the arsehole.
---
Start by reading up on classes and go from there. A few solid content creators for classic you could try on YT would be Frostadamus, Classic Winds, Platinum WoW and MadSeasonShow. But again i would highly recommend only researching the minimum of what your looking for.
---
They broke decursive, they broke nameplate addons that told you were to move and they banned for rotation helper. Keep burying that head into the sand.
---
Wat?
---
If that is the correct maths... For a paladin where auto attack is what matters, you have 5% base parry + 5% from talents = 10% parry chance. 
---
For simplicity sake you have equal weapon speed as the attacker. Your DPS will increase by parrychance% multiplied by average weapon swing reduction. So 10% x 24% reduction would give 2.4% DPS increase overall? Then the overall DPS increase is the number of mobs attacking you multiplied by 2.4%.
---
If then the mobs had double your attack speed, each mob attacking you will grant 4.8% bonus DPS.
---
So your DPS increases by (0.24% / parry chance%)x(your weapon speed/opponents weapon speed)x Number of mobs attacking you?
---
Sounds cool
---
Wow, didn't know that.  I still think BDO is the best game you could possibly buy for $10.
---
I love the St. Bernard Puppy dog face on that glaive
---
Finally some new content here
---
Final Fantasy 11 kinda has these kind of streams where they show live footage from different cities.
---
Do you watch sports? Same thing. Now replace "streamer culture" with "celebrity worship" and you're there.

He is referencing competitive guilds, so comparing to top 30-50 retail guilds who hard stack seems fair.

What do you mean by I need to pay for things ?
---
I love the warlock T5. Never understood why people get moist over T6 when the far superior looking T5 exists. I get T6 has wings now and then, but the huge helm and odd colors never did it for me.
---
Attuned? Takes no time to get attuned dude. 
---
There are tryhard guilds now, tryhard people that Will get to 60 within first reset yes.
---
First Bosses will die first reset.
---
All Bosses dies second reset or third, nog longer than third. Still think two resets. 
---
Btw, going by your name here on reddit, can I assume you are born 1993? 
---
You talked about you played everquest and wow was nothing in comparrison. If you were born 1993, you were 12 years Old 2005. And so yes, I think you sucked back then.
---
I joined SFC Alliance in Wrath. In the early launch days I remember a troll rogue named Bosu. I also remember the first high warlord for horde. An undead warrior named Krauser. Our first grand marshal was a human mate named Cronis
---
There is a thread specifically for questions like this where lots of people have the exact same question. You should probably look there for tons of information.

Orc Shaman. For that sweet random WF proc to slap people around with, and off heals.

Oh yeah, for sure. I still play it on my xbox. Such a great game for the price.

You are not alone. I would rather have the Modern Art with Vanilla gameplay
---
I love you dude
---
Is it on this sub? Have a link?
---
I never understood why people are so against BiS gear. In groups/raids it’s not even about min maxing in my mind. I want to do it because I’m in a group with other people who depend on me, and I’d like to do my best to help them. I would hope they had the same line of thinking as well.
---
Always been my two favorite zones.
---
Remember guys, Every Wand Matters.
---
And that's a down vote.
---
Those post a really cringe seriously
---
If someone wanna tryhard let them be
---
I guess it’d depends on what you like. I grew up around forests so I like those. 
---
Elwynn, Feralas, even Duskwood.
---
You don't have to justify yourself to me.  Justify it to *him.*
---
60 hours is modern slavery, as long as you dont run your own business.
---
You know the dps aren't attacking from the front so increased parry doesn't affect them at all, right? Bosses don't take more damage than in vanilla on private servers, you're just making stuff up now. Armor reduction stacking is also not wrong on private servers, that has been confirmed many times (don't listen to TipsOut).
---
If private servers changed their data to take account of the data in the blue post, barely anything would change - maybe the dps would have to hold off for 1 more global at the start of the fight in case the tank gets parried. Big deal, the BWL speedrun would go from 25 minutes to 26 minutes or whatever. The change would also be completely not noticable for any non-hardcore guilds.
---
I'll spend just as much gold on a 25g respec cap as I will on a 50g cap. The difference is just how many times I'll respec.
---
I 100% believe Blizzard is going to release Guild Banks with a later phase. Maybe not with all the features, but certainly something that doesn't encourage account sharing like Vanilla did. They're just not announcing it now because they have a lot on their plate and there's too much momentum in the "we're listening, no changes, we promise" marketing chant. But once they have all the old school players on the crack pipe again, they'll be able to do it.
---
Your wife should get a half time Job aswell..Just sayin man!

When I first got T2 on my hunter I wanted to throw it in a trash can. T1 looks so much better on male orc hunters it’s not even funny.

I'm glad i'm not the only one. I love winter irl, so Winterspring is just so quiet and cozy.
---
Ashenvale
---
I have a weird admiration for the "darker" zones. Duskwood, Felwood, the Plaguelands, etc. I gotta say that I do love STV though.
---
Ashenvale! The colors and the music are utter magic.
---
The original game box remembers.
---
Post it again dumbass. Boomer who can't even post on a forum
---
I knew a bunch of people from pservers who migrated from OSRS. They still liked OSRS, but did admit there were things they preferred about vanilla. The two games are dissimilar in a lot of ways, but I think they appeal to the same kind of person. In vanilla, there are so many ways to progress your character. Originally it was going to be a lot like runescape actually, everything being numbered skills that you level. They changed that in Alpha or Beta, but some things still are - all the professions, weapon skills, defense. Even without the numbers, there is always something to do with regards to progressing your character, and you can choose how much time and effort you put into each aspect. The old school grinding + community philosophy is the foundation of WoW, and I think it's a near-perfect iteration of that philosophy.
---
They had a blast, and I imagine you would too.
---
Oof, you are probably right, I misremembered
---
Is it good to have at lvl 60 also? For gold
---
&gt;I have heard a lot of complaints recently
---
From whom specifically, by what communication channel, and where is your proof that you did? This sentence is such a red flag for a post that is nothing but one guys personal opinion, desperately trying to fake credibility by making a fake argumentum ad populum.
---
It's okay if you have an opinion.  
---
But discuss it as YOUR opinion.  
---
Don't try to fake public opinion.  
---
It's not gonna work.
---
&gt;the #nochanges crowd
---
Dismissive and derogative towards people who want the game recreated as faithfully to the original as possible. Another red flag convincing me that there is nothing to discuss here.
---
&gt;you’re going to see 95% of each class rocking an identical spec they found on a min/max website.
---
Which they are going to do regardless of the respec cost. Retail has different specs (your assumption below that there is no room for change is nonsense) and everyone plays the cookie cutter build.
---
**Because of the above, I don't by that your criticism is out of concern for creativity. You just want the convenience from retail, that lead to further mumbled and destroyed class identity and character identity, imposed upon Classic, because it's more convenient.**
---
That's all there is to your post, and that's why it eats my dowvote.
---
-----
---
Bottom line:
---
* There is room aplenty for creativity in classic. If people DECIDE they want to play what others tell them to, that is their fault
---
* The respec costs are high so people identify themselves with their character and to create a permanent, noticeable gold sink in the economy...something retail is sorely missing.
---
* If people WANT to respec often, they CAN. They have to invest extra time in gathering the gold, but there are ways to do so, if one is dedicated enough.
---
never stop posting, tbh
---
&gt; He was politically biased
---
Everyone with half a brain and understands the impact of politics on their daily lives are politically biased.
---
It’s really cozy and stands out from virtually every zone. The purple hue permeating winterspring complements the snow perfectly as well!
---
Fights rarely last long enough in 5 mans to warrant a mana tide totem. And since the set up of the team varies a lot, mtt isn’t needed.
---
Actually in proper phase1 because of no thorium arrows the epic gun whatever the name, is actually BiS. In phase 2 you will have a bow. In phase 3, you MIGHT VERY SMALL CHANCE, get a xbow from chrom. In phase 5 you MIGHT get a gun that's better than bow but worse than phase3 xbow.
---
I played a paladin 2004-2007, it’s a solid support class but not a damage one. After that I craved DPS so much that I re-rolled mage for BC and have an alt rogue (like everyone)
---
If we are doing zones outside of Classic, I think Nagrand comes on top for a lot of people. Nagrand and Grizzly Hills.
---
You think "elitist tards" are only comprised of the hardcore raiders ? there will be a lot of random lvl 60 players who act that way sadly, most of those pug so you can expect to find at least 1 per 2 to 3  dungeon run.
---
There's also a high chance they'll be a dps class and link their damage meters every time you clear a pack of trash mobs, proceeding to spam their 1 button rotation and pulling threat off the tank causing a wipe which will then be followed by saying " shit tank / group"," it's not my fault the tank cant keep up with my ossum deeps" and the classical " l2p scrubs".
---
Human warlock will be my main. I'd like to eventually get into raiding with him, as I never got the chance back in vanilla. Druid will be my "just for me" character. Kalimdor is so pretty. They're my two favorite classes.
---
I don't know what survival hunters were like back in the day, but I've always been curious. At some point, a rogue, probably further down the line. I leveled one into the 50s in TBC as subtlety. Not exactly speedy, but I loved just stealthing around the place and picking off mobs.
---
Shaman! I never did a lot on the Horde, and my highest level shaman was only like... 25? And that was in WotLK. So two birds with one stone.
---
Just go straight there from level 1 and try to level in kalimdore. You will be a lot closer than if you just start donating cloth at level 60
---
Love STV too. Always felt like I was in actual danger in STV due to the large amount of gankers and dangerous mobs. Really nailed the jungle vibe too.
---
Before WTF Is he had a hugely successful show called "Blue Plz" which was literally a 2 hour show based on changes and whats going on in WoW and and nothing else.
---
TB and WoW Hobbs were my go to for everything in TBC, it's hard to explain just how big he was it's like something that everyone listened too, I even downloaded a bunch and listed to them on a 10 hour plane ride
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blue_Plz!
---
He then started a show called Azeroth Daily which was more of a video based version on Youtube and literally put out a show every day or two (This was around the time Firelands came out in cata)
---
Unfortunately, it was never as good as it originally was.
---
I'm surprised no one else mentioned Tanaris. It's honestly a gorgeous zone and has my favorite music in the game as well.
---
&gt; point is im pretty efficienct mindend with mmo's
---
Honestly thats a good way to ruin the experience for yourself. Part of what made RS/WoW (Was lucky enough to be graced with nostalgia of both) was the wonder and curiosity they both gave initially.
---
Partly why I no longer play OSRS is because everyone is in a min/max efficiency over fun mindset.
---
If I were you I wouldn't read anything and just go in blind. You have the rest of the game time to be efficient, but don't ruin your first week(s) trying to play it calculated.
---
Felwood is underrated aesthetically.
---
Ret was meant to be a dps spec according to orginal designers but they got initial design wrong and then never changed it as community was used to them as healers even in Ret spec
---
When leveling on horde you’ll use bows until around upper 30s/lvl 40 where you’ll use master hunters rifle. At 60 you’ll first use a bow from the hunter quest, and if you raid you’ll eventually use the crossbow from BWL and never use bows again.
---
I fucking love the Shimmering Flats and old Thousand Needles in general. Feralas is a close 2nd and then Desolace probably
---
The polls I saw said mages, warriors and rogues will be the most popular. 
---
Healing classes will never be in the top three. Forget it.
---
Tanaris is whats up!
---
You are honestly better off that way.
---
You will be competing for mobs and resources with everyone on day 1. 2 weeks in will still have a good amount of starting players but you will actually be able to quest
---
Unable to quest at launch day, Adam decided to get a cold one at the Goldshire Inn.
---
Hearing strange noises from behind the inn, Adam saw Eve ERPing with 3 gigantic Taurens.
---
Shouting at the sky : "is it how you intended things my Lord ? Have you forsaken me or should I partake in this madness ?".
---
It’s ok they had to balance the painfully slow paladin with classes who can actually farm gold at that level.
---
You ever consider a feral Druid? Can still tank/heal while leveling up you just gotta keep healing gear (can stay feral spec) or just tank 
---
It has the fun of rogue in PvP but honestly hits a lil harder and you can be a beast flag runner and tank. 
---
Also, Tauren get 5% more health and an extra stun so pretty helpful for PvP
---
I think that’s what I’m rolling first
---
Oh shit, almost forgot that!
---
At this point I am just going to assume you never played back in Vanilla. You act like their weren't try hards back in original release? Half of the hardcore raiders probably more than half came from Everquest which was far harder and were specifically playing for world firsts and server firsts. And yes I was progression raiding as the MT back then and pretty sure being 12 was quite an advantage I was in school from 7-2 sure but after school I literally played for hours I had over 400 Days played on one character before BC released. My guild was one of those that came from everquest we were getting multiple server firsts in MC, BWL, AQ-40 and Naxx I did even better in BC before I fizzled out before the release of SWP.
---
Here was my forum sig during vanilla for my guild forums....
---
https://i.imgur.com/EIOZanH.jpg
---
That guy pulls statistics out of nowhere and calls it truth, it made me mad tbh.
---
Maybe I gave the idea im super efficient in everything. I am not, I love quests and pvm but I also don't mind tick manip skilling for example. The biggest thing I like to do is completionist stuff but also interacting with the community (volcanic mine is an activity I really like).
---
Warlock pets could do it to iirc.
---
What software is this?
---
Night Elf (f) Hunter. Can’t wait.
---
Hopefully patch 1.13 and not TBC.
---
all that we know for now is that it's going to just be the first game, no expansions planned. besides, what would be the point of releasing the expansions? eventually, we'd end up with bfa again.
---
Okay, here is the explanation:
---
**One:**
---
Respec costs are one of only two stable, permanent REQUIRED GOLD SINKS, which stabilizes the ingame economy (The other one is repair costs).
---
We have seen over the years how inflated Retails economy has become. That is, in large parts, due to the fact that income has been through the roof, but gold sinks are stagnant or have been removed altogether.
---
**Two:**
---
Respec costs further identification with the class and your spec. If I cannot afford regular respec, and most players can't, I have to chose and compromise. I wanna be viable in PvE and PvP, or do I specialize? Do I want to be a Healer with some dps capabilities? Which of my blessings do I want maxed out?
---
You are a holy priest, or Affliction Lock, instead of just another faceless priest or lock.
---
I am a bit doubting myself if I can alt osrs properly while I play wow. I have a mediocre laptop and it seems wow is full screen?
---
Now that's an original question.
---
Enemy cast bars, focus bar ( although there may be addons for that )
---
I think it does. I know some pop cooldowns on pull and LiP. However, the issue is quite subtle and there may be discrepancies with private servers. We'll know for sure soon enough.
---
Definitely good reasons. I'm leaning more towards horse this time round because I've mainly played alliance and is very familiar to me. However I dont get along with druids for some reason, I have kept trying with them but there isnt a connection there. Not that it's a bad class Its just the one class I'm least interested in playing.
---
Nagrand, duskwood
---
Thank the the elements Shamans are low. The more demand there will be for my totems.
---
Thanks, that excites me to start looking into wow more.
---
Hi, /u/SquilliePlays
---
Ppl who didn’t play before summoning stones aren’t going to be mentally patient enough for those ppl who keep dying trying to get in the zone 
---
This also reminds me of some of the WPVP outside dungeons 
---
Damn I’m excited
---
The guide is looking good. Currently working on formatting it for the internet and getting the site up!
---
jesus christ what are these hypothetical situations that won't happen people make up on this subreddit. It's like trying to apply every normal stereotype and say it'll happen
---
That's the point. It doesn't have to end as BFA.
---
Something is going on with the brightness. Doesn't look right
---
I actually want to see a whole bunch or Dwarves in identical gear in formation. That sounds so fucking cool.
---
I'm playing lock so I can't join the fun tho
---
Omg its amazing
---
someone please make a screenshot that looks like the windows mountain "bliss" wallpaper
---
People that had the stress test complained that they had to log in to see if they had beta. Seems like a good fix.
---
You'll often find tanks either at 100% or 20% in Vanilla. You don't have time to start casting a big heal, you just have to get your tank up asap.
---
&gt;But not just to relive but rather a chance to reinvent
---
No. This is a recreation.
---
The goal is to deliver CLASSIC. Not Classic+, not MyClassic, not Classic2.0, not "Classic with some extra Stuff". That's what we, the majority of the community, want, and have wanted for years.
---
Yes, there is a chance that Blizzard will draw conclusions from this, and, going forward, invent a new game out of those conclusions. But there will be no changes to Classic itself.
---
Go away please
---
Dozens! Desolace lovers unite!
---
Yeah I think it will be one of the least played. One of the reasons I’m probably rolling it too haha
---
Skilling in WoW is way easier than OSRS, you can max a skill in a day if you have the gold for mats. You can also only have two skills at a time, so you can't max them all without making multiple characters.
---
There aren't really any exploits that were allowed to continue to exist in WoW like there were in RS. In RS tick-flick based exploits sort of became part of the skill, especially with prayer and special attacks in pvp.
---
https://imgur.com/hVp4l6O
---
But I *do* understand eating and crapping. I'm really great at both!
---
I actually really like this idea. Just the music and animations as the ambient noise. If they did this I would watch at work
---
I agree, Watching that clip it just looks buggy if anything. I understand he did it at the last second but he still bubbled before he hit the ground. Just looks bad
---
 I believe what I've updated the original post to will shed some light on what I was talking about.
---
Was just gonna comment this.
---
If it bleeds we can kill it
---
Doing SM as ally was a gauntlet just getting to the instance. Good times.
---
&gt; I have experienced a lot of loot systems over the years, and read about plenty more. 
---
So what's the best one in your opinion ?
---
People here swear by loot council but for me it looks to the worse of all.
---
Just DKP then ?
---
Exactly my thought. If I have to wear cloth as a pally I might as well go play a priest and at least look good while doing it
---
What the hell kind of opinion is that? Online games are made around the ability to create an identity through how you build your character. How will another player choosing to play the game differently negatively affect your experience? What a sad outlook you have
---
In all honesty class systems is turning me a bit off. I know it probably has to be that way for wow. But I can't imagine having that system in osrs.
---
Meh, it's pretty I guess but I prefer hanging in Duskwood
---
Discussions like these are temporarily banned from the subreddit until Phase 3.
---
EVERY. WAND. MATTERS.
---
I'm stealing that for my guild name.
---
The larger one behind looks angry.
---
We don’t do that here
---
But but but ... Fear Ward!
---
Oh, so you're saying if a druid or pally get killed carrying the flag and the closest person to the flag is a warlock, one of the tankiest PvP classes in the game, they shouldn't pick it up and instead let their opponent get it?
---
That's weird. I'd rather have someone just pick up the flag to keep it going even if they die again, just to keep it out of your opponent's hands.
---
And if they turn it in - bonus.

He didn't want to play a populated class though. Polls show shaman and warriors as the most popular class horde side, rogue is actually down the list.

Do those youtubers have playthroughs? Or is it more guides?

Every year around Halloween I want to start a new Undead character just to run around Tirisfal, the music, lighting, and dark blue-green tint to everything. Also spooky scary skeletons.

Succeded at winning the mission.

By changing the game they change it for everybody, what do you mean this won't affect me ?
---
Man. Bring a small health potion. Starting taming. When he interrupts you take the potion and start again. He will never interrupt again in the same fight.
---
Tirisfal, Ashenvale, and Feralas are excellent in terms of atmosphere

---
No super-spikey, grimdark-Warhammer-Flair bullshit.
---
No army of NPCs to cover up the fact that the game world is essentially just a queueing-lobby.
---
No high-res textures to cover for the fact of low-effort game-depth.
---
Almost makes me sad that I will have to go there with some friends and burn your stinking huts to the ground, horde filth :-)
---
Feralis was always my favorite.  All the waterfalls, mysterious dragon gates and the ruins of dire maul give it a great feel.  The slow methodical gameplay kinda lets you take these places in a little better.
---
They said that if it was popular they would come out with further expansions.
---
Exactly, I forgot to mention that Blizzard has done this to please the #nochanges crowd. I am too for recreating vanilla in the purest form. However, I don't think anyone would find frustrating scenarios like this enjoyable. I fail to see how the positive (if any) of a big spell batching window can outweigh the negative.
---
The ally quests are nice and the naga cave is incredible for grinding .  the horde have more but theyre a bit more spread out.  Still very worthwhile with the bugs and gnoll lines.
---
So that good ol vanilla feel.
---
At launch paladins were everywhere rolling on all the gear. Wasn’t til the great paladin exodus after the seal fix of ‘05 that they stopped trying to do every role the best.
---
i'm not the only one that remembers the pandarian face, always said the ones you got from BT should have had it and people though i was crazy for saying it
---
I don't get why people are confused. Obviously people who only were in the Stress Tests got it removed. If you have the real Beta its still there.
---
doesn't look THAT much way before it, cause he fucked up trying to spam it on the mage, and pretty possible that he just barely missed the batch that WOULD'VE saved him.       
---
Also IDK how batching would fully work with all actions, but assuming that the interaction is similar to the heal + person still dies, or interrupt and spell goes off. Couldn't in one batch you take the nova freeze + nova damage + sheep without the sheep breaking?
---
The mage sets all look so dorky:/
---
I love desolace but I don’t think that’s a popular position.  I am looking forward to picking a centaur clan and trying to get my succubus again though.
---
This actually makes your role &amp; spec somehow special because you stick to it most of the time. People will get known by roles once again because you can't swap them 24/7 (at least not all players have gold for constant respecs).
---
I think the "one character can be anything" approach of OSRS opened the door to a lot more flexibility in your character. Pures, hybrids, good at everything etc. And since you never really started over you were always moving forward.
---
In WoW you are fixed to a class which slowly begins to undermine the experience because as you create alts you grow sick of the world. That was how I always viewed it at least. I think its a bi-product of the heal-tank-dps group format.
---
I'd love to see your cosplay
---
Love your videos, great work
---
Oh great another one of these posts. I was just about to post how there aren’t enough of these fucking posts. Use the search bar dork.

Think he's the guy who keeps running for president and losing badly.

Had them on my fury warrior, I continued to use them in following expansions in the beginning of LFR, most people didn't understand when I transformed
---
Rofl
---
I mean it's 40 people raids. You're not gonna be rolling Rejuv on 40 people by yourself.
---
&gt; The only exception to this will be a death in the family. 
---
I swear I have this very big family, there's at least one that dies every week !
---
Oh the sorrows man ! Actually, this Thunderfuy would help me feel better, thanks :-)
---
I never had them in vanilla, but went back to farm them in later expansions. Set siting in my bank on live. Too bad I’ll never go back!
---
I can agree that it was indeed a very clutch BoP. But I want you to look at this clip where the shaman is clearly influenced by Seduce and still takes a shadowbolt to the face!  [https://clips.twitch.tv/LitigiousFrigidOrcaRalpherZ](https://clips.twitch.tv/LitigiousFrigidOrcaRalpherZ)
---
Respec costs make your choices matter more and solidify your character’s identity. From the “Roleplaying” part of MMORPG, your character goes on an epic quest and develops specific skills/strengths along the way. Allowing people to change these choices too easily compromises the importance of those choices
---
When WoW Classic was first announced there were huge discussions about features that future expansions have but vanilla did not. The 'No Changes' movement got a lot of traction and I assume Blizzard took notice of that and gave them Vanilla spell batching. The community prefers a couple of faults over potential poisoning of the game.   
---
On the subject of spell batching, has harsh as it sounds you just need to play better. Esfands case he should've used BoP earlier on himself to make sure it went off.
---
Well to an extend i guess but if you watch professional arena tournaments or i dont know league tournaments the shoutcasters are entertaining withoug being this on the nose about it
---
Ok thanks for this writeup! Very insiightful
---
Luckily respeccing was horribly expensive at 50 gold (if you do it regularly) so needing 3 or 4 sets of gear was not a concern for the average gamer.
---
I don't think that's a good idea, skills that help you level faster is always a priority. gold gain is exponential
---
what you can do though is pick up skinning and just go to town on heavy beast area, and vendor all the skins. thick leather are 3s each vendor, doesn't take long at all to get to 100g
---
This is pretty great news for anyone that was in the first test if it's true. And disheartening for anyone not in the first test since it means that many less spots... if it's actually accurate. 
---
I'm not doubting the legitimacy of the screenshot. But everyone is human, including employees. A few of the sentences in there also seem to hint that everyone in the first stress test getting invited back is not a set in stone thing.
---
I'm just glad he didn't say that it going away means you are done in beta til launch.
---
Will be happy to win or die defending this city lol
---
Surprised there is no love for vanilla Barrens!
---
Dude the game isn’t out yet and they’ve done a blue post about layering in the beta. 
---
Chill wait for the real game, in a month or two you’ll never have to worry about it again when they remove it.
---
I wonder what loot is drops.
---
That’s the only reason why I first played as a dwarf hunter
---
Why does everoyne have rogue alts?
---
He got a new model not because of being a lore character - Sylvanas had a val’kyr transfer him to his cousin’s corpse. There was an official short story that explains it, Dark Mirror.
---
I would have been hype to just a stress test inv but here I am waking from dead sleeps to run in to check if I got into anything.
---
Yah, one reason why I LOVED Nagrand in BC.
---
It's a bad example because the Shadow Bolt is about a second delayed, at least 2 spell batches went off. There's more at play in that clip than just spell batching.
---
Was looking for this response. I spent so much time just hanging around Azshara in vanilla.
---
It's easy to see why people would be confused IMO. It was removed without any notice and there was no explanation as to why or what it would/could mean for future stress tests.
---
I'm terms of "efficiency" it's nothing like osrs. 
---
Osrs, the grind is the game. So from level 1 all the way to 99, every choice you make will have a pretty large impact on how fast you finish the grind. And that's really the only grind anyone's concerned with. 
---
In Wow, there's two distinct "grinds". The leveling grind from 1-60, and the gear grind starting at level 50 or so, and finishing when you have all the best gear. 
---
You really don't have to be concerned with "efficiency" up until the gear grind. There's not much you really need to know about the leveling grind to maintain efficiency. Do all the quests, kill all the mobs, look up what talents you should choose, and know what your skill rotation should be. Other than that, there's too many variables to accurately map out every step of the leveling process from 1-60 at server launch. 
---
Leveling 1-60 while being efficient should take around 7 in game days. And the difference between a 100% efficient player that doesn't break away for any fun side goals will only really shave a day or two off that (depending on the class you choose). 
---
It's not worth it considering the gear grind is time-locked content that you can only access once/week. You'll have time worry about efficiency at that time.
---
I always liked Dun Morough
---
&gt;minimizing death time by **banks**
---
You can't win against the bankers man, it's like the casino : they always win at the end !
---
Something definitely feels off about it. I've been questioning if it's truly working properly, and if there are certain priorities that are supposed to happen when conflicting things happen in the same batch. I wish we could get a dev to clear up the confusion.
---
Ooh I’m totally doing that on the next stress test! Excellent idea!
---
That's so strange because I always thought there were more horde players on normal servers. Maybe it's just an oceanic thing?
---
“Why are we in combat?”
---
So do people actually have old screenshots like this or do they just load up personal private servers and take pictures like they were there in the beginning? Genuinely curious. It’s a bad habit of mine to think the worst of people.
---
You are actually wrong. I played vanilla, I was 14 back then and I sucked, eventho I sucked and most of My guildmembers sucked we managed to down everything up to C’thun but not him and a few Bosses in naxx. 
---
Ofc there were tryhards back then, but nowhere in the same league as todays tryhards. Doesnt matter that everquest was harder (which it was) but the information that is out today and new stuff that people learned over the years on private servers will show. 
---
You sound like a true hero lol.
---
You may have misread what I said.
---
'Buy only skills that help you get to 40 faster. Do not buy skills that don't increase your speed to 40'
---
whaaaat. my very first memory of WoW was watching my buddy play his Undead Warlock in Felwood.  Doing quests and PvPing.  I thought the zone was so fitting for his character.  I fell in love with the game :p
---
Ahh yes. Well you still have to enable it, it's basically the same result as disbanding it.
---
How has no one said silithus?
---
It also happens if you sit down to drink a second after landing from a jump. It will cancel the drink buff as if you were still falling from the jump. Effectively wasting a drink because you’ll need to drink a second one
---
All of the quests just seem way too spread out in that zone. Dunno, I've tried it once and always opted to skip it since then. I only ever do the ZF pre-quest there. Depending on how starved I will be this time around for XP and quests I might do it, but I doubt it.
---
Yikes. x) curse you phone. 
---
Ganks*
---
Sounds strange, but the most relaxed system we had, was just plain, good old, fixed-price DKP + rolling. 3 guys want an item? 3 guys roll a dice. One guy wins and gets the DKP the item costs subtracted from his account. (There were just 3 price-levels, Weapons, Sets and everything else). Next time, in the same raid-lockout, that guy is interested in an item: He now has low priority.
---
You earned DKP on a per-boss basis, and new recruits got a 150DKP baseline starter (set item price was 50 iirc).
---
Optimal? No.
---
Functional? Yes.
---
Were there complaints? Yes, but significantly less so, than with any other system I experienced.
---
I actually fail to see your point. The shaman is clearly under the influence of Seduce for almost a whole second before the shadowbolt lands. What other forces are at play here?
---
It's detailed because that situation has happened to me recently, it might not happen to you the same way but there are always people like that around, classic can't really change human nature sadly.
---
Ion himself stated that any "new" content after phase 6 is a definite no
---
i was in two stresstests
---
Lol finally wtf
---
So you'd better have groups of 2 or 5 but not in-between.
---
They were part of the same stress test.
---
okay, blizzard had multiple reasons why they didnt want to make classic servers.(i wont list all here but youll get the point hopefully)
---
on paper, every single part of the game was improved. therefore they didnt see a reason to go back to a inferior version of the game outside of nostalgia. nostalgia doesnt hold players and therefore doesnt produce enough revenue to support the game let alone develop it.
---
even if that were the case they couldnt find an efficient way to restore the old game without reintroducing some game breaking bugs and making the game vulnerable to hacking and exploiting.
---
also, even if there were a way to restore the old game. they had no reason to since the modern game was doing very well and it was not worth the risk.
---
the private server players changed their minds on the first point (there is a huge following, classic is not a worse game in of itself, running it is cost efficient, etc.), wich in turn made them search for a solution to point 2. and with wow not doing too well they started development.
---
we might not be the sole reason we get classic but we sure as hell pushed them to do it more than anyone else.
---
Tanaris.
---
Samesies
---
Thanks for sharing. I was specifically hoping to find something like this within this thread.
---
Fucking hell you're going to struggle in life.
---
The freefolk have breached the wall, and are slowly streaming into all subs since the stupid, stupid end of GoT. They have *revenge* on their minds!
---
You have to keep those all those allaince city's working just not hordes.
---
Window mode
---
The great thing about Classic is theres no 2 year plan now to move on to the next expansion. 
---
Im going to take my time this time, ive done all the rush to 60, raid hardcore thing, just gonna enjoy the world now, hopefully find a good guild again which matters most to me.
---
hm yeah that looks pretty weird. If anything that might be a bug with an interaction rather than batching being to long. Because the seduction applies while theres ~.2 seconds on the shadowbolt cast, then the shadowbolt hits AFTER seduction is already up.          
---
I'd bet the seduction was say batch X, then the bolt was batch X+1 but that's a guess
---
Westfall
---
 Undercity
---
My stress test account was still in the launcher last night, after lots of people had theirs removed, but as of this morning it is gone. 
---
So keep checking if yours hadn't been removed yet, because it may still be coming
---
Ehhh... M'uru was indeed one of the hardest bosses pre nerf without a doubt, but Heroic ragnaros 25man pre nerf, helya mythic pre nerf, lei shen heroic pre nerf, kil'jaeden mythic pre nerf (not the very first version that no one killed cause it was impossible) were all harder. M'uru wasn't so bad if im honest if you had the raidsetup. (You know 6 shamans a bunch of glaive rogues and as many warlocks as you could muster.)
---
They’re a guilty pleasure I’d say. Fun to play even in classic, excellent PvP opportunities and single target DPS.
---
Anyone else feel like the draw distance of objects is really short? Even in WSG you need to zigzag in the middle to see people on the sides. I don't remember doing that 12 years ago. Was that a thing even back then?
---
Realistically it will be tbc though.
---
I am all for no changes, and I also fear the slippery slope of bringing in QoL to Classic. However, the big spell batching window was for technical limitations and not designed by intent. I also fail to see how any negative side effects by lowering it by a small amount. I still think it's necessary for a bigger window than retail to maintain the vanilla spirit, but my argument is that it is just too ridiculous as it is now.
---
Careful, people in this subreddit don't like it when you say TBC was better than classic. Funny enough they are usually the same people who didn't play it as current content.
---
What makes this a good pet?
---
imps have phase shift moron.
---
Spell batching in classic is a perfect example of the idiocy of #nochanges. Spell batching was an artifact of a slower internet and less powerful server hardware that was never designed or balanced around. A few pvpers used some addons to exploit batching, but the notion that pvp was balanced around batching is utter bullshit. The game would have been better had they never tried to reimplement it for no good reason.
---
no it's autocast dipshit, stop lowering the collective iq of this sub.
---
That's the whole thing. It doesn't hit as hard as mortal strike because mortal strike is a free bonus attack. Heroic strike, the only extra damage you get is what's written on the tooltip. 
---
So at level 40, heroic strike is 80 damage, plus the extra damage you get for UPGRADING your melee attack to yellow damage (which  gets some bonuses, I don't recall what.... I think it is immune to glancing blows?). And it doesn't cost 15 rage. It costs 15 rage plus whatever rage you would have gained on that melee attack you replaced (yellow attacks do not generate rage). So the slower the weapon, the worse heroic strike is in terms of rage efficiency (remember that you are typically trying to level with the slowest 2 hander you can find). 
---
I am not an expert on rage generation, I am not in the classic beta and interrupted my private server play when I reallized classic was coming out in august, but I think a typical leveling value around 22 is probably ~9-10 rage per swing of your 2 hander?) So Put heroic strike at probably 24 rage per use? Maybe you can talent it down to 20? 
---
In contrast, mortal strike is not like that at all. It's not 85 damage. It's 85 damage PLUS your weapon's damage. It's less than twice the rage cost (it doesn't take the rage for the attack it replaces, as it's a bonus attack), but it's not "the same" damage, as your weapon damage is added to it, and that's likely to be MUCH bigger than 85. 
---
As for heroic strike's place pre slam? I feel like the class ends up in this no man's land. Heroic strike is not worthless, it's just, imho, much worse than rend, obviously worse than overpower, and hamstring is just kinda mandatory for hamstring kiting, which I certainly would not level without using.
---
So you, no matter how many rage talents you take, don't really have the rage to repeatedly heroic strike, UNLESS you forfeit much better abilities, like rend, hamstring, and overpower. Which I am not willing to even consider. So even if I did talent heroic strike (which I would be very willing to consider), I still am not using it very often, and therefore, my rage generation per minute is very low out of the heroic strike talent.
---
It might be different if I were using a fast 1 hander, but I am very much not doing so.
---
I like everything except the hue and saturation of the grass right in front of the camera. All of the rest of the grass looks good at a distance, but this grass up front looks photoshopped even though it isn't
---
I really hope they fix it if it is a bug. Or if it is a batching issue, that they reconsider the large window.
---
Bosses don’t scale based on how many players you bring though.
---
More contrast please, grass only looks poisonous.
---
I found darkshore less moody and creepy and more grey and dreary. It reminded me most of a costal area right before/after a rainfall. I think the really cool thing about that area was the contrast between it and the super colourful area of teladrassil where you just came from.
---
Oh I have loads of old screenshots, although this one is probably from tbc since my highest level in vanilla was 44...
---
You know I never connected it, but yeah there's a resemblance.
---
EverQuest box art for comparison: https://www.keithparkinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/EQ.jpg
---
lol that explanation has a huge fault. "use x sooner" = changes to balance, duration based spells nerfed. the window needs tuning for sure
---
They wrote that in because he was a lore character, though, and they didn't want to just randomly give him a new model.
---
I think BFA might be more your style. All classes are equal, all classes can do everything.
---
Yeah, you should play BFA.
---
phase shift
---
Is that from beta? Love the ui it takes me back.
---
Retail mulgore is much more beautiful.
---
I don't think being logical is heroic. Theorycrafting was not unknown in WoW people played for hours and hours and hours to kill every boss in Vanilla. Even guilds that were like yours that weren't the best but were still good couldn't even complete everything while the average guild finishes mythics in current. I guarantee the people that played on PServers are going to be the most shocked when they find out how much easier their server was then actual Vanilla WoW. In no way are the tryhards of today that can beat the new raids in under a week different from the ones from back then the difference is the content they don't make raids as hard as they used to where bosses could be actually mathematically impossible U'nat was like the first boss I have seen in BFA that was mathematically impossible first week it was great to see hopefully Blizzard realizes they need to create harder content that has to be worked to be beaten. But don't worry Classic is out in 2 months and we will see how long MC takes.
---
for me it is durotar, the best hometown ever
---
&gt; Unfortunately, if you die and reach spirit healer A, then walk to spirit healer B and rez there - you get teleported all the way back to spirit healer A.
---
Some say you can trick this by logging out and back in again before spirit ressing, but I don't know if it works like that in Classic.
---
They def changes their layout philosophy.  Zones now are more stacked vertically with varying heights and levels to get as much content as possible in smaller areas.  Theres really no more flat flast zones
---
There aren't any big EU streamers, they're all NA.
---
Not sure if it feels off or is wrong, or its that we don't play with 200 ms and 25 FPS and therefore feel a difference since networking have come a long way, and are now used to more responsiveness. I'm sure the systems original intention were to even the playing field between.. oh I don't know, dial up modems and the new ADSL lines. You see a kinda evening of latency and lag in many games.. probably the reason it's in classic. 
---
That being said, maybe modern network infrastructure, and server hardwares responsiveness should be taken into consideration and not emulated for reason of ... Err.. experience. But at that point they might as well emulate all the 200 ms lag and cap fps at 25 - 12 for raids of course. So not sure why some should be emulated and not all (;
---
My favorite as well
---
Where is the love for tanaris? Or Feralas?
---
You're not my real dad!
---
It was in the German Stream of the Allimania guy, not sure if this is in VoD, but he posted it in chat, so if there is a VoD it should also be recorded.
---
I’d like to see more posted then. I started playing in WoTLK so I missed all the “best years” as everyone says.
---
SM and Maraudon weapon quests for sure. Big upgrades that will last a while and improve your grinding speed.
---
What does that have to do with anything we just talked about? Oh my god, you are beyond stupid.
---
Thats what i was getting at... just to dip in from time to time
---
I mean it's the same map so duh
---
Depends on server population. I found that in private servers where the markets were over-saturated, selling things on the AH wasn't too worth it. Also with a fresh economy, gold will be worth a lot (every copper counts). I always recommend skinning and another gathering skill. 
---
Skinning to have mass volumes of vendorable mats, and gathering because resources will eventually be worth selling on the AH, when people start trying to level up their professions.
---
rock hard
---
It can be set, you have to set it manually. And it's 10 secs cool down, so it's no where near fool proof.
---
Nagrand so nice, ya had to say it twice lol
---
You don't want to know the answer.
---
There was also that Demon Hunter in Azshara, [Loramus Thalipedes](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/3/3d/Loramus_Thalipedes.jpg)
---
Pretty, yet the most boring starting zone.
---
You raise good points and I'm suddenly very unsure about it... So I fired up my own testing server to check some numbers. Here are my findings: 
---
I compared three different gear points. Pre-BiS, BWL/ZG and full Naxx BiS:
---
Pre-BiS I used mostly gear from phase 1, but I'm not sure if all items will be available so it's a bit inaccurate. I landed on 548 +heal, 10 mp5 and 93 +intellect which with buffs (not world buffs) and talents gives me 13.4% crit and 4967 mana. 
---
The values on Flash of Light are as follows: 
---
|Rank|hps|hpm|HtOOM and TtOOM|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|1|280.15|13.86|126,425  |  451.3s|
---
|2|308.83|10.70|77,999  |  252.6s|
---
|3|349.46|8.65|55,610  |  159.1s|
---
|4|393.28|7.57|45,684  |  116.2|
---
|5|452.24|6.81|39,275  |  86.8s|
---
|6|515.97|6.38|35,780  |  69.3s|
---
Legend: hps = heal per second, hpm = heal per mana, HtOOM = heal until OOM, TtOOM = time until OOM.
---
and Holy Light:
---
|4|483.10|7.64|42,383  |  87.7s|
---
|5|573.45|6.02|33,097  |  57.7s|
---
|6|677.18|5.36|28,690  |  42.4s|
---
|7|801.46|4.98|262,11  |  32.7s|
---
|8|953.47|4.75|24,703  |  25.9s|
---
Note: spells learned before level 20 doesn't get the full amount of +heal so I've ignored them, also rank 9 Holy Light is missing because it was added in AQ20 and similarly rank 5 Blessing of Wisdom instead of rank 6 has been used to calculate HtOOM and TtOOM.
---
So in pre-BiS Holy Light isn't that good. It's a very slow heal and it doesn't have a good efficiency or throughput to make up for it. 
---
For BWL/ZG I ended up with 977 +heal, 3% crit, 22mp5 and 189 +intellect which gives me a 20.4% crit chance and 6707 mana.
---
Flash of Light:
---
|1|440.62|23.72|423,795  |  961.8s|
---
|2|470.25|17.72|211,201  |  449.1s|
---
|3|512.21|13.79|134,475  |  262.5s|
---
|4|557.47|11.67|103,399  |  185.5s|
---
|5|618.35|10.13|83,908  |  135.7s|
---
|6|648.18|9.21|73,194  |  107s|
---
So already at this gear level we can pretty much spam max rank Flash of Light for the entirety of most boss fights with a mana potion or two. I would probably still use rank 5 mostly though.
---
Holy Light:
---
|4|620.23|10.75|89,192  |  137.2s|
---
|5|743.54|8.49|65,652  |  88.3s|
---
|6|850.67|7.32|54,537  |  64.1s|
---
|7|979.03|6.61|48,121  |  49.2s|
---
|8|1136.03|6.15|44,024  |  38.8s|
---
As you can see there is not really any way to keep casting Holy Light for any length of time without going OOM pretty quick. Maybe rank 4 could be used in a similar way as priests use Heal and Greater Heal.
---
Max rank Holy Light does heal more than Flash of Light but it's far less effective.
---
Now let's look at full BiS. For this I got 1167 +heal, 5% crit, 97mp5 and +255 intellect which gives me a 25.1% crit chance and 7907 mana. I'm also using the Libram of Light which adds 83 healing to Flash of Light and I'm using max rank BoW. Notice that the mp5 alone combined with blessing of wisdom is almost a new max rank Flash of Light every 5 seconds, sick!
---
|1|548.34|31.38|infinite|
---
|2|578.60|23.17|infinite|
---
|3|621.46|17.78|650,554  |  1046.8s|
---
|4|667.68|14.86|300,987  |  450.8s|
---
|5|729.86|12.71|192,218  |  263.4s|
---
|6|797.09|11.40|148,274  |  186s|
---
Yeah, rank 1 and 2 spend less mana than you regain from your mp5 so you can technically just keep spamming those forever and they still heal for a serious amount. Naxx is where the paladin goes completely off the charts in terms of efficiency. 
---
Holy Light (also including rank 9 which comes in AQ20):
---
|4|732.53|12.87|196,183  |  267.8s|
---
|5|827.83|10.05|119,033  |  143.8s|
---
|6|937.24|8.57|90,426  |  96.5s|
---
|7|1068.34|7.67|75,481  |  70.7s|
---
|8|1228.69|7.07|66,375  |  54.0s|
---
|9|1411.72|7.14|65,532  |  46.4s|
---
So as you can see, even in Naxx gear Holy Light is such an expensive spell that it doesn't make sense to use it as a main heal. It can be used as tank healing for intensive fights like Patchwerk, but it will never be a go-to heal. One thing that might change this is switching out some of the mp5 heavy gear for crit gear.
---
We must also take into account that Flash of Light and Holy Light have a chance of giving Holy Power to healed targets and with Flash of Light having a shorter cast time it will keep Holy Power up more often. Holy Power gives an 8 second buff btw; 700 armour to warriors, 140 attack power to rogues and hunters, 80 spell damage to warlocks and mages, 28mp5 to paladins, priests and druids.
---
I mean UO released Siege Perilous (an old-school style ruleset realm) I believe after Third Dawn. That would imo be the very first classic mmo re-release.
---
Then you have EQ, EQ 2, and runescape who all have done it.
---
I feel like a slight reduction to the spell batching window would solve a lot of these issues.
---
No thanks. Maybe it's not rational, but this one really breaks immersion for me.
---
A whole second is much more than the batching window so it's unlikely to be the culprit. Possibly a different bug
---
I'd def bet on the priorities being messed up with how WSG flags are
---
He's a good dude
---
The only negative side effect I can think off having spell batching window close to 0, is that rogues with improved gouge at 5.5 seconds will always get a restealth after, which can seem a little bit overpowered. But as it is now it is just way to big, it needs to be lowered by a small amount.
---
Which needs to be enabled manually, to auto cast.
---
2 years in the future - wait and see. That's their official response, see how this goes and react accordingly based on community wants.
---
TBC seems like the obvious choice tho, since it's no cost nor time for development.
---
When gold is scarce, vendoring items is essential. I always recommend skinning because of the scarcity of gold.
---
It's the same map so it will be.  All the other old stuff is there like Karazhan crypts n stuff.
---
Working 60+ hours a week in a job you don't want to be at is MORE than enough information. Are you retarded?
---
I think I remember reading where a WoW dev said they had to account for addons like DBM automating a lot of the callouts and raid mechanics. They ended up in a constant escalation between making harder and more intricate boss mechanics and the addons getting better and better at trivializing those mechanics.
---
Until now, we’re at the point where raid bosses can’t be beaten without those addons.
---
He's the mvp of classicwow
---
Power of nostalgia, I personally think WoTLK was the best expansion, so hey you didn’t miss out on all of them!
---
Hahaha you sound like you're having some difficulty dealing with this?
---
&gt;Next time, in the same raid-lockout, that guy is interested in an item: He now has low priority.
---
What does it mean ? I thought you were rolling on the items, do you apply a penalty to his roll ?
---
Very well written comment!
---
Perhaps it's not *you* proof, but then you are lowering the collective iq of this sub.
---
Someone posted a video with the perfect solution if there will be a demand for it. Redo all the expansions with classic principals. No lfg, flying, challenging, etc.
---
Sounds like you could use some anger management. Someone has their undies in a bunch.
---
It's not fool proof, aka an imp has pulled before in the history of wow.
---
They had to pay back for the whole Astranaar thing. Leveling horde through barrens, Ashenvale is so radically different and lush, you just get lost in it as a lowbie runing the roads and then *Bam* Astranar guards aggro. And they are tenacious too.
---
Because it was beautiful both times.
---
I get what he's saying though, it's not that everyone will be speed leveling and min/maxing everything but I fear anyone who has played several of the recent expansions has been somewhat brainwashed by the concept of optimization.
---
Even if people won't play like they do on pservers, they will naturally gravitate toward optimal setups for their class because they've been forged into that mentality expansion after expansion over the years.
---
I'll show you guys that shamans can tank!!!!
---
*gets one by Verdan the Everliving
---
Perhaps but likely only if that player is someone, like you, who's reducing the collective IQ of this sub.
---
Agreed. I don't want it to be reduced as close to 0 as retail, but a small reduction is needed.
---
Westfall!!!...just me? Okay...
---
Yep. Still one of my absolute favorite zones to quest in 🙌
---
not played the new monkey island but did get the new day of the tentacle which has the same feature and i play with the new graphics, i like the old ones but it just feels so stretched on a wide screen monitor at 1920x1080, from what i have seen when i was on the stress test the old graphics hold up well in wow and i honestly dont really notice the difference
---
Why would you want to play with them, they use you for gold and items, then quit the game when the hype drys out.
---
Very possible. The iq of this sub is already really low. I mean, you have to repeat your self 3 times, because you are afraid I didn't hear it.
---
It really doesn't seem like the batching window is 50ms on the classic beta.
---
Commentating on your own actions is one thing, commenting to that same level of detail based on others actions is a whole other ball game.
---
no not really
---
Yea, that’s the whole point dude.
---
Your spec is a *meaningful choice*. When you introduce dual spec or remove the cost to respec, your also removing meaningful choices the player has to make. 
---
That’s the of the biggest pros about vanilla. Your choices matter.
---
Depends on mechanics.  Maraudon if anything is more likely since last boss is easy to kite.  Been a while since I have done Eranikus so not sure if there is an easy way to get around his mechanics.  I only really remember he hits fairly hard and does a sleep(I think? I know you can lose your tank/healer for a bit).
---
Spell batching feels like rogue energy generation though, something that may have been limited by the technology of the time but wasn’t the intent. 
---
I don’t know anyone that wants less responsive gameplay, and to just say “play better” is pretty stupid for something that’s not actually intuitive. The nochanges crowd is wrong on this, spell batching isn’t what made us love Vanilla wow.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about and now you're just wasting my time. Boy am I glad idiots like you are not on the Classic WoW development team. Blocked.
---
Thanks for the reply. I don't get all the fuss about avoiding streamers servers?
---
My friends and I are mainly looking for a Horde-heavy server, PvP with lots of people. We don't mind waiting queues to get online as long as the server is flourishing.
---
For me Vanilla : A, BC: C, Wotlk: B, the rest: F
---
love hinterlands, so many good memories, looking forward to it so much when classic releases
---
Water down, everything else up. Best of both worlds.
---
Feign death drops combat and then you can shadowmeld but you'll also have to recall pet or it will keep the combat going iirc.
---
"Thanks warrior for taking my turtle shield!"
---
Oh yeah, I never answered your question. It's because you are whining about class balance. :cry: hunters are too op. :cry:
---
Yeah, I'm trying to level an alliance right now and it's way harder than horde imho.
---
Huh, guess I would. This being the internet, the only reason people who don’t like rp would go to an rp server is to harass and grief, which makes them even worse individuals than I thought
---
A warrior friend who has leveled warrior to 60 countless times on private servers always said : you go fury at level 10 but level with a 2H because you don't have the hit chance to dual wield while lvling, then at 45 you go arms , 5 points into fury for the crit is advisable but you can go arms at 40 just fine so long as you have an axe and points in axe skill.
---
Joana has a playthrough of his WR speedleveling to 60
---
8 in 2004? JESUS I AM OLD.
---
!RemindMe 70 days
---
If you want to DPS pally is the wrong choice
---
You obviously don't know what you're talking about. The dev team specifically stated that they are keeping everything in Classic, warts and all.
---
They have a huge list of things that people consider bugs, but were actually in Vanilla WoW. So they are explicitly not changing things LOL ;)
---
Great write-up !
---
&gt;the world record fastest 1-60 at just under 4 days played.
---
Joana's record is 4 days and 20 hours.
---
It will probably be beaten, but I wouldn't bet it will be sub 4 days.
---
I didn't register it the first time, but this Soundtrack was just perfect for the zone. Only with my second char going into the zone, i felt something was missing. I had disabled the music in the game, when i started 60's content, to be able to understand others over ventrilo. Then i activated it again, and it just felt right. They did an incredible job with this zone and the soundtrack, it sucks you in like in a good movie.
---
Pally tier 2 judgement armor is still the best looking armor in the history of WoW.  Fight me.
---
When you say "we" in terms of "we the private server communities of all 1000+ private servers that existed" are a major reason for classic wow, it is just upsettingly cringe:/
---
Plenty of people saying blizz was given the code or that it wasn't until a few hundred thousand people signed a thing saying "we want classic" that it was said to be made, yet there are tons of people listing qoutes and links showing blizz was already in the making of classic and they needed something as WoW is dying.
---
P servers had way less parry though which will hurt TPS a lot.
---
Cookie cutter is what retail is. Wow classic actually has a ton of very good hybrid build. Builds that would never be possible in retail.
---
Are you me
---
But transmog ruins the game KAPPA #NoChange
---
Deadwind pass boiii
---
&gt; So something like the mountain jumping to get to the airfield is likely impossible then? From your description, I would assume goldshire inn would be impossible to climb as well; isn't it quite flat on the way up?
---
Can get therre via loch modan. I don't have beta access, but the same method is possible in retail, which is possible in classic, I tested that out on the 2nd stress test and it made me cheer. \o/
---
Yoooo that place is just scary
---
That's because people have been using the past 10 years figuring out exactly what works and what doesn't. I can promise you, you won't find a single new thing in classic. Everything has been tested and tried.
---
This also means alot of very creative hybrid builds have emerged.
---
&gt;What does it mean ? 
---
It means, if you won an item, next time multiple people you included wanted an item, you couldn't roll for it, unless there were only people on low prio wanting it.
---
This "low priority", ended:
---
* When the raid lockout ended (aka. it reset every week)
---
* When we went to another raid (each instance had its own lockout list)
---
* When you wanted an item (which had to be usable and an upgrade)
---
Example:
---
Boss 1 drops an item. You and 2 others have the DKP and want it. You all roll. You win. Grats! **Now your low priority begins.**
---
Boss 2 drops an item. You and 2 others want it. The 2 others roll, you are on low prio. One of them wins the item. **Now your low priority ends.**
---
Boss 3 drops an item. You and another guy want it. You and that guy roll, because you are no longer on low Prio.
---
Monkeynews is the chillest and most laid back of all the dudes. He's very knowledgeable and easy going. I can recommend Tribe as well, he seems very helpful. Both of them are in APES.
---
Warlocks are great for a beginner. Leveling is very easy compared to other classes because you have a pet tank, little downtime with Lifetap and healthstones, pretty much free mount at 40 and great utility in groups with summoning, soulstones and curses etc. You're not going to be topping dps charts (until phase 6) but you will be valuable to any raid. Plus once you get a hang of the class they are very good in PvP if you ever feel like giving it a try.
---
well if you plan to level as a healing priest pick up wand spec and spirt tap first 
---
start out like this https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/AjPAAAHD    then head down the holy tree
---
&gt;Thats because private servers are biased in what is considered a Okay exploit or unintended feature, and whats not.
---
Oh the irony.
---
There are alot of wank players out there bro. With the right gear and if you know how to play, palas can slap. But you're right not the best dps
---
Ah ok
---
I agree with this, I always find myself leveling through fjord over borean because it’s so gorgeous
---
Half that reputation just comes fr9m gold farmers.
---
I remember grinding satyrs in Azshara between one of the levels in 54-60 strech. For pretty much 16-17 hours. Fun times.
---
That was amazing
---
Fury warriors are usually expected to off tank during raids if need be, there's no such thing as a warrior that only does dps on all encounters ( depends on the fight), this becomes especially true in the later half of the patch progression (AQ/naxx).
---
That's why there are so many warriors in raids, they're top dps and top tanks but are annoying af to maintain ( proper gearing/farming consumes /repairs etc).
---
Must’ve been hard to keep an eye on that large site.
---
Wpvp died when battlegrounds come out. I dont know why people think tbc killed wpvp. They actually tried to revive it by putting pvp objectives in every zone. But people just wont choose to wpvp when battlegrounds are a better option
---
That's right. I saw the clips where the flag was re-picked and got returned at the same time, and the person who re-picked it had it appear on their back for a moment, and then it vanished as it got returned. That's got to be wrong.
---
Fatherhood.
---
Ziqo, hydramist, perplexity, monkeynews, tribe, pshero
---
But 'muh retail circle jerk!
---
Same! This has been my problem with the game since WotLK ... every zone has way too much epic activity or infrastructure and nothing feels remote, off the beaten path, or unimportant in the larger scale. A good example of this is Borean Tundra, which I would have massively enjoyed if it had even less of the Lich King/invasion type stuff in it. Just give me the zone to explore, with scattered wildlife and little ruins - I don’t need constant reminders of some current epic conflict. 
---
For this reason, my favorite zones in Vanilla were Feralas, Tanaris, Thousand Needles, and Azshara.
---
I would love to transition into BC after 2 years. BC was WoW at its best I feel.
---
You're in your own bubble, man.
---
Came here to say this.
---
lol ret pally
---
I've never used a FOM build on any toon during Vanilla and I still managed to be one of better players around.  If you want an optimum build at all times then you need to farm the gold for it.
---
STV is gonna be such a shitshow on Streamer pvp servers its gonna be amazing.
---
You're way better off leveling as Shadow imo. It's way faster and you can still heal dungeons with ease until 60.
---
Tanks always attack from the front. Even if he’s the only one, those parries are still going to significantly increase the boss’s damage output.
---
Was this on stress test or the beta server?
---
I tried that last stress test and it didn't work for me
---
Oh you mean playing the game to have fun? Haha
---
I always felt like 50-60 was the longest strech. Simply because there were very few quests and you mostly had to grind.
---
The problem I see with pairing horizontal progression with transmog is PvP. If the developers remove the gear treadmill that is vertical progression then the only way to make new gear worth obtaining is to give it interesting effects. If you're facing someone with this new gear in PvP wouldn't you want to know what those effects are?
---
Inter-fucking-punction!
---
You stay at the same threat level as you were before using it. You won‘t be targeted during that time, but can for example aoe taunt and still hold aggro
---
[Hot take.](https://imgur.com/YKO6rOL)
---
Yeah, I did. It's completely gone for me now.
---
The speed it depends really. You want as slow hitting weapon but fast enough for you to spam heroic strike for rage dump. So it depends on your overall gear. As for stats well just like other gear.
---
Most of the stuff in Un'goro. A lot of easy quests in a relatively small area. And since you're doing so much stuff there, might as well do the more annoying quests too. One of the places where you can return to the quest hub with a full log of completed quests. Spirit of Aquementas is still great even in the nerfed form.
---
flag carrier
---
What was there to do in wotlk? Wotlk introduced raid logging for a fuck ton of people.
---
Seriously, assume your in a raiding guild. What was there to do outside of raid? Arena, bgs— that’s kinda it
---
Most of wotlks “content” came from the achievement system still being so fresh and you feeling like you had a bunch of stuff to do because older expansions content was semi-rehashed because now it counted for achievements. This wouldn’t be the case if they did a wotlk server.  You wouldn’t find getting achievements for explorer or for fishing in a fountain fun
---
Bwonsamdi 😩👌🏻
---
That could be the one.
---
I could've sworn the kobolds outside the mine were neutral but the ones inside were hostile, though.
---
[Wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kobold_Laborer) says kobold laborers "are no longer hostile" as of 3.3.0. This patch note didn't get mentioned on the Gamepedia page for the same mob, though. WoWhead comments for the mob also suggest this mob was hostile prior to this.
---
As far as I can tell they are supposed to be hostile, but maybe there was a 1.12.1 fluke where they weren't.
---
I don't remember who I hated more lolret or huntards. Both would roll on just about anything and most were just terrible.
---
So what you're saying, if you quit WoW you'll get responsibilities that will make you unable to play WoW in the future? 
---
That sounds awful. I'll do my darnedest to dodge that bullet, thanks!
---
That stuff is aq patch related and will be released with aq
---
It was on Blizzard's Bonechewer server.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSNzf9AEATADzkUk](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSNzf9AEATADzkUk) pick your weapon spec of choice. 1 point in Imp Charge can go where you want it (in the arms tree), for pvp you can lower Two-Handed Weapon Spec and take Imp Hamstring.
---
No it does not reset aggro, it does make you invulnerable for the duration which means if a mob has another player on the aggro table, it will go for that player instead until the duration runs out and then it will reevaluate based on threat. So in raiding you use this if you overaggro and hopefully the tank will get back aggro within the duration.
---
Riposte is also great while you level, add rogues to the list too.
---
It's a lot closer with the search term "classic wow". Who in their right mind types out the full name "Classic World of Warcraft"?
---
https://i.ibb.co/B3MQgbD/IMG-20190601-104733.jpg
---
The bigger tauren hitbox means nothing. I don't get why people keep talking about it. If a tauren melee runs towards a gnome melee the tauren and gnome will be able to hit eachother at the EXACT same time. The increased attack range basically cancels itself out with the increased hit box of the tauren. The only instance I can think of off the top of my head would be vs. a warlock, since it is a caster and doesn't have any dangerous AoE spells to watch out for really, so you would be able to hit that caster like 0.1sec before any other race. But it will be easier to hit you would Cone of Cold, Frost Nova, Grenades, Blizzard, Sapper Chargers etc. etc.
---
Are you sure about being able to heal until 60? I don't recall having shadow priests healing low level dungeons. Could be wrong tho since it was AGES ago lol
---
why are people messaging support about beta/stress test stuff like this? what a waste of time. No one is 'entitled' to play any of this until its launched, just be happy if you got it, get over it if you didn't.
---
Soooo, are you playing classic?
---
Winterspring is gorgeous. The trees and the pinkness and the endless snow, and with the music it's just perfect.
---
Watch world of roguecraft. Or experience getting one shot in an ambush crit.
---
Well yes, because PART of the Lush Forest was corrupted. Not a completely different forest, but a part of the uncorrupted forest.
---
All gear is our gear
---
-hunters and lolret
---
You 100% do not need to put a single point into any healing talent to heal dungeons all the way up to 60 and even at 60. I could probably de equip all my gear and reset my talent points as a druid and still heal a leveling dungeon. As long as you have water you'll be absolutely fine to heal any leveling dungeon regardless of gear or spec
---
I appreciate the authenticity of this. Back in WoW classic, MsPaint was the only thing that existed for making marketing.
---
Are you aware that a significant portion of the playerbase *enjoys* this min-max that you call a "trap"? They don't want to do *fine,* they want to do their maximun. I mean, I myself don't understand *why*, but I still respect that they like it. Similarly many friends don't understand that I don't use BiS lists but I absolutely roll for Transmog itens.
---
We all play how we want.
---
But I still can't force others to bring me if they don't like my lack of optimization. And they can't force me to bring them to my dungeon runs if they keep bullshiting about optimized routes and parses/logs.
---
But we still respect eachother.
---
Lately it really is a challange to filter out the sarcasm from the straight out ignorance.
---
Cool. You know how viable this will be? Just don't want it to be atroucious hehe
---
I love Uldum.
---
Cool story bro
---
Seams right, bears are heavy and slow, cats are fast
---
Agreed. Mulgore is my fav zone. I remember when I made my first tauren. I txt my buddy I play with Ms told him how beautiful it is. He made a ray ten and agreed fully. 
---
Loch modan is a close second tho.
---
I have a sweet spot for Dun Morogh and Winterspring. I am an exclusive Horde player but Alliance zones are just much more diverse and interesting to me. Maybe because I am less familiar with them.
---
I agree.
---
Appear offline is a thing
---
Well yeah, Outland is pretty empty. They probably figured it was too empty for the few zones there (compared to vanilla).
---
Any publicity is good publicity for blizzard. Just look at how they announced Diablo immortal lol
---
you can heal as shadow just fine for the most part
---
I plan to level as sort of a hybrid myself
---
if you are holy you can heal much higher level dungeons that you could otherwise lol
---
back in the day I healed mara in the mid to low 40s for some folks because I was holy
---
Cool, this is an answer I was looking for :) thanks!
---
Let me list the vanilla zones I DIDNT like...oh wait lol. Even plaguelands and felwood and silithus grew on me with time. Just such a gorgeous game.
---
Wait, what is a "regular" EU realm?
---
I thought this post would end a bit like "..and it was worth every second of it! For the alliance!"
---
Wow classic saved my life last time and I'll spend a lot of time, love and energy on it again.
---
Cu online :)
---
I heard that if you ghost run all the way to your destination zone, and then go out into the water to fatigue distance you will get ported to the nearest graveyard and then you can rez.
---
No idea if this works though. It also assumes the zone you want to get to has a coast line.
---
What happens in classic stays in classic. Got it.
---
im not sure what the entering level is though, i know u can entere BRD at lvl 44 i think
---
Please sir, my nerdboner can only get so hard.
---
viable at what, for questing you do steady damage but not great, and you have no down time at all
---
for healing you will be just a monster once you start going down the holy tree 
---
of course at 60 you will want to go full healing but for leveling thats just foolish
---
You should be fine so long as you know what you're doing. Just bring enough water and be conservative with your mana.
---
Sounds awesome lol. Guess the solo experience would suck as holy tho
---
Remind me, Is mara a part of phase 1?
---
If he joins your guild as a casual member or rolls the same server as you, they can especially see you online.. You would have to avoid posting in any chats if you're on the same server.
---
Appear offline ain't gonna save you when he sees you in Trade Chat /who's you and then you made it even more awkward because he/she is going to figure out why you appeared offline.
---
More like most of the comments don't even get how true this video is. Instead they talk about CoD. Man I hope these ppl stay with retail wow. Thats why I think PvP RP servers would be the truest last bastion against, streamers/retail wow kiddies.
---
This is a neat idea.
---
This whole exchange gave me cold sweats
---
tbh i wouldn't hate to see the barber in classic. i dont see any harm in letting people change their hairstyles.
---
i also wouldn't mind transmog but that'll get me executed on this sub so.
---
Running into someone to attack, then running away during the weapon delay timer. Comes from Everquest where this was the prime method of fighting because weapons often had like 5.0 speed, and you weren't always slowed like you tend to be in WoW PvP so you could freely move away after swinging.
---
This is well put. Thanks. Hopefully others will take the advice
---
BC killed wpvp because of flying.
---
Wpvp was alive and well during Vanilla.
---
Just farm if you want to respec. Just like we did back then :)
---
Your brother and his dad? ^^ gz btw that sounds like a good time
---
Speaking of bank alt, do you know how many msgs the vanilla mail box can hold?
---
I messaged support about this because Blizzard themselves failed to keep us updated on what they are doing and why. 
---
I do not feel entitled to have access to the beta whatsoever, this is/was never about that. When it is removed without any reason I just want to know why, and I don't think that's very strange.
---
&gt; Consistent shadowpriest low dps is better than mage who dies couple of times every boss.
---
Sure, and with the recent reveal that raid boss parry is 14% (and not as private servers have it, 5%), this is even more relevant: You'll want a damage dealer that can do as much damage as possible while not cresting the tank in threat. More boss parry means that every single player needs to play that much better (tanks get less threat generated, take more damage due to parry haste, which means more pressure on healers, and better threat management on damage dealers as well).
---
Plus, the only people getting BR'd at all in my raid had been people in roles absolutely crucial to the success of the encounter - tanks and healers in almost all circumstances. A damage dealer that died through his own fault would have gotten ridiculed, gotten a "keep an eye on threat next time, your dps doesn't mean shit if you're not maintaining it through the *entire* fight.", and people would move on.
---
My point was more about the importance of numbers anyway; If you were a designated soaker at Huhuran, and didn't bring your NR resist pots (or have the requisite NR equip), you could not mitigate that shortcoming by "playing better": You simply would lack that much effective HP, which made the encounter that much harder on healers, and regardless of your skill level, you would either be benched (if a soaker with pots was waiting on the bench), or someone would hand you over a stack.
---
Of course you would take a skilled player over a lazy one, specifically because later raid mechanics punish the entire raid if even one person fucks up, but numbers were important. A raid in half blues, half T1, and with barely any resist gear simply would not succeed in AQ40, regardless of skill level. Hell, the Broodlord was a major obstacle for us for longer than necessary because our old MT quit, and we had to gear up a second one before he had a chance to live through his MS (yes, even if properly bubbled by priest beforehand).
---
...Speaking of the Broodlord, he is one of those bosses that is more than just a list of his own abilities. Yes, his MS is the bane of every under-geared tank, but the fight itself is mostly about applying universal gameplay in a particular manner: Threat management and damage.
---
viable? wand spec with spirit tap is the only way to level a priest.

As I mentioned in my comment below (https://reddit.com/comments/bvfhb3/comment/eppj79c?context=3), Laborers are labelled as Neutral. There weren't different variants of Laborers that had different aggressiveness, and videos from TBC show the ones in the mine are neutral too.
---
I removed the patch note from Wowpedia because evidence from the time suggests that they weren't hostile.
---
This. I would gladly play through Classic&gt;BC&gt;Wrath over and over again. This whole Classic+ with new content garbage needs to die.
---
Alright mate, just check in with multiple old time players, they will tell you the same
---
Feralas for sure. Deep forests, high mountains, waterfalls, long beach, old epic ruins, mystic islands and more.
---
The ones in the first realm tab not DE or RU
---
Yeah okay but...
---
**why?**
---
People have made this mistake since WoW's inception. It's easy to make a rookie or even veteran mistake and adding a co-worker to your battlenet because you get along at work.
---
we all know appearing offline dosnt work. good advice in general
---
Pretty certain that a tank won't die. If the heal and boss damage is calculated in the same spell batch, the heal will either save the tank or the the heal won't save the tank.
---
If the boss hits for 100 damage and the heal is 200 damage, even if the Tank would've hit 0 HP, the heal still counts and the Tank will be at 100 HP.
---
Got it, thanks.
---
This goes for university buddies or group members too. You know you'll be a scummy person not giving your real life any attention for many weeks or month. Don't let then see your depravity.

I can't believe people are missing the forest for the trees. I don't care about the WSG exploit either.

Pack it up boys, Classic is cancelled.
---
Ah, so you're telling me to use science.
---
But they can literally do whatever they want whenever they want, it's a beta. They don't need to give a reason
---
I think so
---
WotLK was fucking trash.

Watching the sun set in Shadowprey Village in the Desolace. It's quiet and I usually would have a hearthstone set there at some point even if it was inconvenient.

Not particularly great at 60. When the darkmoon faire is in town, then rugged armour kits sell well as its a hand in for rep. But other than that, no, another profession is better.
---
You know you can eat healthy and exercise and lose yourself in WoW all at the same time.
---
Example: wake up go for a run, come home make healthy snacks for the day, then play WoW till you bleed out your ears.
---
Just saying.
---
All we want is the entire vanilla -&gt; pre cata
---
I also love Tanaris. It is just so vast and quietly peaceful.
---
I wpvp a lot in bc. I often flew into someone and attacked them and vice versa happened to me. I also remember watching tons of wpvp right up until wsg and av were released.

I played on a pve server so maybe I had a different experience, but the only wpvp that went on was between consenting parties Looking for wpvp. But once bgs came out that was no longer efficient and no one really did it apart from some messing around. But no more battling over contested territories. 
---
I dont know if pvp servers were different. Maybe the meanginful wpvp while leveling did fall off because people could fly away
---
Still. Talking about faction specific popularity. There both paladins and shamans are 3rd or 4th in any polls.
---
Nagrand
---
That's not how it worked back then. Either the heal is counted first in which case the tank lives with 100hp or the damage counts first and the tank dies. Deaths aren't calculated after everything in the batch is through. You die if any damage takes you below 1 hp. Nothing in the batch after you went below 1hp matters.

There’s a LBRD trinket that transforms you into an elf that I know of.

Ah, the sweet smell of hypocrisy.
---
Look dude: Just because you had no self control at 15, doesn't mean this is the case with everybody. A lot of us weren't 15 at the Age of Vanilla either, we were already adults in charge of our own life.
---
I played like a maniac back then. Basically invested most of my time awake into it. Now, years later, I have 2 degrees, both MINT, I work as a software developer at a successfull company, I have a wonderful girlfriend, a loving family, and no money troubles whatsoever. Oh, and yes, I can cook, any no I don't have a belly.
---
And I will still play like the literal dude from "Make Love not Warcraft" (that's the title of the southpark episode) when Classic launches.
---
And I **hate this lifecoach-reborn-spirit attitude with a passion** where people, who had a shitty phase in their life, and recovered, automatically assume that they are in a position to tell others what's good for them and what isn't, because they delude themselves into thinking they now know better. The fact is: A person who had such a phase in his life, ever, is the last guy I listen to.
---
I've struggled with the same thing myself. But I am constantly arguing over whether wow is the cause of my problems or it's helping me survive. I feel like wow is a non-judgemental world where I can seek refuge in. It's like the chicken and the egg scenario for me now - have I always been depressed and wow is helping me cope, or is wow causing my depression.
---
I personally love desolace!
---
It fits its theme so well. I remember being so crowded in stv and constantly getting ganked so I said screw and made the journey.
---
It really felt like I had escaped to the ends of the earth and was just a lonely adventurer in a vast desolate place.
---
Also seeing rexxar was badass and arriving at shadowprey village felt peaceful.
---
I also have a special place in my heart for earthsong falls in Mara, it felt so epic.
---
Distorted
---
Teldrassil/Ashenvale and Mulgore are the top in classic for me. 
---
Prettiest in all of WoW is Shadowmoon Valley or Spires of Arak.
---
I just tell people they’re trash or I don’t want to play with you. Grow some bawls.
---
If i was on the beta I'd make a troll mage and go kneel before a mailbox, in honor of his blueplz mailbox show during cata
---
as someone who maxed on OSRS a few years ago and only ever dabbled in wow, i'm excited to grind hard in an mmo again and  in classic..i have been reading about it and messing around on a private server so im not completely clueless. I think if you love a good grind you'll enjoy wow classic at least for a while.
---
personally I'm mostly burnt out on OSRS so i'm ready to start something fresh. tbh if you aren't ready to completely lower your OSRS progress you might have a hard time juggling both games, so i'd say at least sub for a month and give it a go come august.
---
Definitely Plague Wood in Eastern Plaguelands.
---
I've never tried it but I'm 100% sure you can't seaforium the door in an ogre suit
---
I do no care how busy they are I will camp and grind until I pass the bottle neck. Most likely going to go 30+ hours without sleep before I take a quick nap, then do it again
---
Im looking forward to going down said rabbit hole lol
---
but only to an extent, im to old to go without sleep, and my hand issues act as a limit on my play time.
---
And... since classic is not out yet, I think ill go for a nice long bike ride today
---
MadSeasonShow ans Frostadamus
---
Co-worker: Hey, can I add you on bnet?
---
Dahnaroo: You're fucking trash bro, fuck no
---
Surely that won't make it awkward.
---
It's much easier to tell people you don't see IRL these type of things. Much harder to avoid hurt feelings IRL. And that's the whole point, you're FRIENDS at work, so you don't want to hurt their feelings. I'm sure your co-worker would take that well.
---
If i get notice, at least a month before any changes are made with official launch dates, i can adjust
---
Actually planned my vacation around the time the release, and i did that before  i knew about the release.
---
I’ve done it and works out.
---
i agree alot
---
Isn't it the ghostsabber?
---
It's not PTO just time away, but it still has to be ok'ed and approved
---
" I lost interest basically in everything else except the WoW ." This is the reason that I quit WoW the first time.  I had just started college, and upon realizing that I couldn't hold a conversation with anybody unless it included discussion of World of Warcraft, I realized that I had to quit.
---
And I did.  For 8 years I didn't touch WoW.  Then I came back during the last couple of months of Legion.  During this time several things happened in my life:
---
1: I went into a deep depression - the deepest I've ever experienced.  This may have been more related to a new Job that I started (and quit) within the time that I was playing.
---
2: I became unemployed for a spell (as I had to quit my job because of stress).
---
3: I quit playing practically all other video games.
---
I stopped playing WoW BFA in January of this year.  My reason for quitting was because BFA no longer felt good to play.  I felt tired after every session, and I didn't want to log in because all I could see ahead of me was a loot treadmill that didn't feel in any way fulfilling.
---
But I'm here now because even though I quit 5 months ago on bad terms with BFA, I'm still interested in finding out if classic wow can recapture the magic that had me so entranced when I was a teenager.  I want to be able to go back to the mindset that 'WoW is not addictive, it's just a really great game'.  I worry that my interest is misguided, and that this is akin to an addict yearning for just one more hit, but I swear it will be different this time.  Lucky for me there's still a few months before it releases for me to change my mind (if I do).
---
Ah sorry, my Retail brain simply assumed you were talking about the Classic side of the conversation not the dumb Retail issue.
---

This is true. Quite literally the first thing I did when I decided I should return home.

Yeah it's not PTO for me, I'm losing money taking off launch but I'm going to save so my bills are covered for the time off
---
Or just communicate your boundaries/social needs and be a responsible employee in the first place and you won't have these issues.
---
Some people won't be excited about it, due to the difficulty of getting things like baron cape and truestrike shoulders, but as long as you mention it beforehand, it's totally doable. I would go with something like "LFM strat, tank is rolling on cape." That way, people can just not join if they aren't down with that. As a tank, your groups will fill up quickly anyway.

If alliance: que AV

If horde: que everything else.

I think it includes all searches that include the term, not just single-word searches.
---
Eyes of the beast and put them on stay!
---
That works to avoid playing with them, yes.
---
The other aspect.. I doubt it. I am doubting your co-worker takes kindly to you calling them trash before you ever played with them.
---
Anyone can avoid playing with someone if they want. So that tactic isn't exactly special. It's the challenge of dodging co-workers while not having them offended or impacting the work friendship.
---
Vanilla storms could be huge.  it was great
---
Oh that Polearm was pretty decent, ya know, if you have MS and a whole bunch of Arm's talents.
---
I couldn't imagine using that to level with instead of dual wielding, as at least that way you were keeping ideally 2 different weapon skills maxed out.
---
Yup. Anytime my co workers want to play something I make an entirely new account.
---
he is the representative of the toxic people i certainly dont want to meet in Classic WOW.. AFAIK these toxic cancer started when WOW become mainstream and many immature people revel in toxic chat as he seem to prefer.
---
I’ll say, as someone who hasn’t played since early TBC, all this BiS talk for “pre MC” etc just seems so... unnecessary. I raided MC with a bunch of shit greens/blues as a DPS/OT warr and the rest of my raid had just as shitty gear and we got through MC, slowly gearing up each week until we were able to take on harder content. 
---
This min/max mindset I see so commonly here going into Vanilla is so... yucky. Disappointing to see everything be taken so seriously like this months before the game even releases. I feared it’d be like this. Hopefully it’s just the reddit try-hard community and not a general reflection of the community.
---
Exactly, which is why it should be 50g. Respecing should have consequences to make it meaningful.
---
What? Photoshop existed long before that
---

---
Transmog - I actually do not want to see this in Classic. It will have a tangible impact on economy and the way we had to size up a PvP opponent in vanilla (and thus Classic) involves being able to see their gear because you can't see their health. But I'll miss it all the same lol
---
Area loot - I don't think it would be a good addition to Classic but it's so damn satisfying lol
---
All the updated graphics and art assets - If they can't or won't make a working toggle so this is optional, I would not want to see it. The old graphics are too important to a great deal of people and it's vital that those are maintained and prioritized. But I like the updates we got over the years.
---
So its a triptych
---
When vanilla first came out, People didn’t have every micro aspect of the game mapped out in advance. Everyone is seriously hindering your experience with this mass planning. I’ve been there and I’ll tell you, it’s more fun to just do it on the fly.
---
Ziqo, Swifty, PShero, Pilav and Perplexity are what comes to mind regarding EU streamers.

I just quit my job anytime they ask tbh. Much easier.

"Want to play WoW? Here's my battlenet. What's yours?"

*Submits two weeks notice*

An a one and a two and a r/woooosh!

Ugh Satyrs, that feels like an awful mob to grind on, either they are ranged or have rogue abilities or their caster mobs always seemed to have a fear or horrify spell.
---
Isn't Duskwood  always night?
---
Only if you accept gnomes!
---
Nobody else is having fun when we wipe because of your original spec.
---
This is basic common sense, but it seems that people are so self centered nowadays that you have to teach 5 yo !
---
it's pretty clear in the propaganda that we think gnomes are too short
---
They usually laugh and that’s that. Sometimes I add co-workers and just deny playing with them. Gotta man up.
---
T3 really makes me want to play a druid but having to run 5 mans without a rez for braindead DPS just sounds like a recipe for a lot of wasted time.
---
Where did these gear designers go, tier 13 was the last set that really had a good class / raid design.
---
Guaranteed whatever you tell someone to dodge them isn't working as well as you think.
---
The whole point is to avoid adding them on Battlenet in the first place. Even if you gotta lie.
---
It's much better to go "Oh shit, I didn't see your friend request for X months because my battlenet has been bugged, currently have a ticket in to get it fixed." 
---
Rather than "Yeah, I'll add you, but let's make it straight. I'm hardcore. You're a pleb. We won't be playing together. At certain times, you can inspect my gear. Whisper on a limited basis, as I'll be busy doing content. But no, we will not be playing together."
---
You aren't posting this for the benefit of others.
---
You are posting this to justify coming back to the game while highroading everyone else.
---
You're speaking to the wrong audience, bub.
---
But we are big in heart!
---
Seems like you must know a whole lot about Classic to make that many absolute statements in one comment.
---
yeah, but as I said ... I was specced prot, so all of it was kinda stupid  :D
---
You could roll 50 warranty and not have that weapon combo
---
If there's cross realm bgs, it doesn't matter which faction you choose tbh. Just make sure you join a premade and you'll farm honor. If you don't join a premade I'd say horde tends to win wsg and ab a little more but I've actually never won an av as horde lmao
---
haha I also got fully prepped for a kodo tame only to be very dissapointed!
---
Have these. Underwhelming items but the proc looks cool.
---
Hinterlands is one of the prettiest zones. Coolest too with the ZF mallet stuff you can do there.
---
If that was a woosh you got me good, aye
---
Why should they hire him? All he does is just say what's happening in the game. No analysis. No reasons why he's doing things. No anticipation of what might happen. I mean I get that he was probably just doing that cuz it's funny to his viewers, but it certainly doesn't make him a commentator that I'd want to listen to.
---
You don't cast max rank though.
---
But can Blizzard be trusted with that?

Social anxiety: The post
---
Hands down Mulgore!

Just a funny clip I made because I'm bored while waiting for classic.
---
Idk dragonstalker is a great look and i think cryptstalker is my favorite set in the game, and ive never played hunter
---
Looks like I’ll be an Orc then. Thank you!
---
I think an issue like that could be solved with the clever use of game mechanics. A skull-headed axe should have a skull-themed effect which shouldn't synergize with Paladins.
---
I mean if you tell people what you want to roll on before the group has started I don't see a problem.
---
And then they be talkin that shit when you're not at work, 100%
---
Going for the lie is way better than being blunt with them. The only exception is if theyre a close friend or you knew them before work. But managing the co-worker relationship is an art in itself because they're cool enough to be your work friend, but not cool enough that you want their ass on you everytime they see you on WoW.
---
There won't be any battlegrounds for the first 5 months, at least.
---
I expect to see some guilds collapse under the burden of classic. I polled some folks in an old guild and they were all like "eh not planning on it". But I think they are just trying to dodge out on retail stuff incognito so don't want to show their hands.
---
Fuck No. I loved ogrila and netherwing. It was cool to have a dayli rutine that took 25min to do. Nothinh too intrusive and it was 100% obtional and a good way to work on epic flying
---
It's my understanding there will not be cross realms.
---
It's always been that way, horde has the better 1-35s but alliance has it easier after that in the 35-60s , since most of the leveling areas you plan on visiting in 35-50 are for the most part on the eastern kingdoms  , it's all about capital city placements really.
---
BRM / burning steppes/ searing gorge/badlands/swamps of sorrows/ blasted lands are so easy to get to for alliance.
---
personally I think elwynn is pretty gorgeous
---
That's the exact specc I ran in vanilla on my warrior. Worked like a charm!
---
Got him
---
&gt; Respec costs are one of only two stable, permanent REQUIRED GOLD SINKS, which stabilizes the ingame economy (The other one is repair costs).   
---
In classic they also have random vendor reagents for certain spells like Sacred Candles which you'd go through a few gold of per raid night (Fort, Shadow Prot, and maybe Spirit). Druids had Wild Berries, Mages had Arcane Powder, etc. Hunters have Ammo, Rogues have poison mats, Tea, etc. There were many more permanent gold sinks than just the two.    
---
None of this takes away from your overarching point. Just worth remembering that they did a good job of gold sinks in classic.
---
Skinning is even better with lw paired. You can make far more money vendoring craftables than vendoring raw leather. Although most people say it’s a horrible time investment. I just use the craft time as afk time.
---
Which it always always is? Lol
---
what are the second pre bis weapons for orc fury? dalrends? or are other axes good enough?

Tbh alot of the vanilla zones were really good, i cant name that many for eeach expac.
---
1. Vanilla - Ashenvale, Teldrassil, Mulgore, Duskwood, STV, Elywn Forest, Westfall, Barrens.
---
2. TBC - Eversong Woods  Zangermarsh, Nagrand, Netherstorm
---
3. WOTLK- Grizzly Hills
---
4. Cataclysm - Uldum, Mount Hyjal
---
5. Vale of Eternal Blossoms,  Kun-Lai Summi, 
---
6.  Frostfire Ridge,  Nagrand 
---
7.  Suramar,  Highmountain , Stormheim.
---
8. Stormsong Valley
---
And, as I said, evidence also suggests that they were in fact hostile, as evidenced by comments around that patch change also indicating that they were previously hostile. I think removing it might be hasty, because at one point they appear to have been hostile.
---
My thinking is that they were not hostile in 1.12 (or maybe even all of vanilla) and were flagged hostile at some point later on. If they're flagged neutral on the classic beta, it's almost certainly because they're flagged that way in the original 1.12.1 DBC.
---
Everybody remembers them being hostile for a reason, most likely because at some point before 3.3.0 they were. Maybe 3.0 made them hostile, it made some other changes to starting zones too did it not?
---
Maraudon is special. Princess runs were my single favorite dungeon from all of WoW.
---
Riposte in PvP is so strong!  I loved playing with it in TBC. Just a shame it contends with other strong abilities at low levels, could be a fun alternative to the usual rogue style tho.
---
I replied to another horde player post couple hours ago. 
---
What? Bloodvine is BiS til t3 and before that it's skyshroud which are just brown pants
---
Naw. Blunt with them and they’re blunt with me in return. We actually have pretty good relationships. All that pussy footing will get you no where.
---
Okay...and people dont really need a reason for wanting some clarification.  Asking a question isnt some horrible thing.
---
Polls I've read show shaman way at the bottom.
---
Cross realm BGs have been confirmed.
---
same, have to have the fun factor that comes with shadowmeld
---
I really loved Northrend's environment a lot. Each zone was pretty cool imo.
---
Wands and maces are fair game, be happy we give you lesser classes anything
---
Because there is so little to do there. But that actually gave it a kind of mystique, too.
---
On the bright side...now we can go back to checking the dropdown every 5 minutes to see if we got into the beta....

It’s not classic but I’ve always had a hardon for Nagrand
---
How
---
Flash of light is significantly more efficient.  Holy light is more HPS but very expensive.
---
do you mean holy light? there is no reason to use low rank holy light over max rank flash of light. it will still have 2,5 sec cast time and be less efficient while healing less.
---
I will forever love Silithus and Tanaris
---
Have they? I knew they were implimented in 1.12 but I didn't know if they were confirmed for classic
---
What do you plan to wipe on because your group isn't min maxed? Either you didn't play vanilla or you forgot, it's pretty damn easy. We do 40man druid raids and clear Mc.
---
Very true. But the times have changed and people do know how to be more efficient. Efficiency is great. But I think I am so attuned to retail WoW, my outlook on levelling is not how it should be. Should I be rushing as fast as possible to 60? Or should I be keeping it slow
---
Omelette du* fromage
---
Unless you don't enable it. You need to manually enable auto casting of stuff. Right click stuff, or am I remembering wrong and mixing warcraft 3 into it?
---
It's not auto cast by default as far as I know.
---
Shaman tanks WC
---
\*tanks better than Tips\*
---
The consequence, in this case, being one hour’s farming.
---
I really hated Silithus before the AQ events and after... it got worse! But I admit that it has a very cohesive theme and if you wanted something that wasn't a straight Tolkien fantasy trope in your Warcraft, there wasn't much else.
---
Great advice
---
No Arc Reaper from blacksmithing ? Sad times.
---
I played Osrs from release till near max.. quit two years ago with I think 150ehp left. Classic WoW will likely follow Osrs footsteps and continue development after Naxx. Blizzard has copied a few things Jagex has done successfully.
---
Maybe it is for you, but for a lot of us it isn't.
---
Again, as said probably 10000 times on this sub, the first tier you wear is t2 (and only some classes wear it). T1 is maybe your RP set
---
Good post. I will also live healthy life and not play much until 27th Aug
---
Apparently some don't, based on the random doenvotes here. I'll upload it later today :)
---
Ashenvale for sure.
---
You don’t need to be efficient when the experience is enjoyable. I’ve played it before and I’m still not planning for classic. Going to make a character and wing it.
---
Lmao that rogue at the end , best vid ive seen today

In northshire abbey the only aggressive kobolds are the ones inside the cave, the rest are non-aggressive

&gt;It was just me, my Warcraft and my depression. I thought it was helping but in reality, it was only a band-aid over a deep and rotting wound that was hidden within me
---
Was your depression caused by Warcraft? Because depression is a much much more life-fucking beast than videogames.
---
Anal [Treats for Greatfather Winter]
---
they added voice chat in retail and no one ever used it.. the quality was awful
---
They made what should be very boring (a Sahara-like desert) into something quite interesting. I agree, I have always found it to be one of the most well designed zones and there's lots to look at.
---
I don't have a "method" because I don't have to stress about it and I know how to have healthy work relationship. I understand what's appropriate at work and isn't.
---
This isn't that complicated. If you feel compelled to lie to coworkers because you can't communicate that's on you. That means you are sending the wrong message.
---
Yeah but the sit macro won't work in classic wow lime it did in beta
---
That song is just perfect for the zone.
---
Which is reasonable. You need to find a balance between respecs being effectively free (bad) and them being impossible (bad). An hour of efficient farming seems like a fine middle-ground, particularly as they give you a handful of cheap respecs before then.
---
There are a lot of philistines wanting to play Classic.
---
You don't have to but I'd personally recommend getting raid gear if you want to heal in pvp, it's pretty good for that. Pre raid bis is alright but it's gonna drop off hard if you don't start getting pvp or raid gear as the phases continue on
---
I have heard about a fire rogue with fiery enchants that supposedly were pretty cool, also known as the spellpower rogue. It supposedly got nerfed in pservers so the enchants wouldn't scale off your spelldmg, but whether it works in classic or were an oversight from pservers we'll have to wait and see.
---
Ret is an absolute joke in PvE even with the best gear available. It's just nowhere near consistent enough to compete.
---
All of the other meme specs are meme specs mainly because they run out of mana in longer fights. Ele shaman, balance druid, and shadow priest can compete with everyone except warriors in short fights.
---
Source?  I assumed when they said no cross-realm grouping, they meant BGs too: [https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2054](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2054)
---
And the paladin bubbles!
---
Yup, that is 100% true but Blizz will get people wondering what's going on every time they do things in the dark.
---
In my guild they were. AOE damage heavy fights me and the one other druid destroyed the COH priests. Illidan/Mu'ru/etc.
---
FWIW - I had to exit [battle.net](https://battle.net) completely and launch it again before it disappeared.
---
I find that weapon too expensive and it can get replaced very quickly with a bit of luck in MC
---
Maybe in casual guilds. Tryhard guilds will have 40 competent people.
---
Exactly this.
---
Most often those are the types to ask for forgiveness and not permission.  So it's after the roll where they try to argue with someone after winning.  Avarice, pure avarice.
---
eVeRY wAnD MaTtERs!!!!!
---
Pre raid bis is probably bad for pvp since not of it is like cloth
---
It doesn't wreck shop but the druid pvp gear is actually pretty well itemized for balance druids. If you stack some spell crit on top of that you can do some gnarly damage if you're allowed to free cast
---
Having a plan makes it more fun to me.  I like to have my race, class, and professions chosen beforehand so I don't do it on the fly and regret my decision.
---
Seems like a you problem.
---
Get some stam and MP5 oriented gear and you should be good to go.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM
---
 I got both of those in one run on my rogue. Never saw them again on any character.
---
What evs. You’ll never know the true experience.
---
Do not rush to 60. Vanilla leveling is vast and long and one of he best  parts  of the game. You will meet new friends and maybe some one them will stay friends for a long time.
---
what do you mean, 40-50 is was makes people stop
---
Almost certain the enchant didn't scale with spellpower in vanilla.
---
did you need pair for templars , group for dukes and raid for high council? if in non-raid gear?
---
this is why I like classic zones, the contrast from stepping into a forest into the plains of westfall is great. Also classic Forest feel more of a forest than retail. In retail there is a path and outside that path is mountains blocking your war, cliffs all packed with dense mobs that don't let you feel safe at all. While in classic there isn't forest or mountains blocking anything if you wanna go south you go south.
---
Nobody forces you at a gunpoint to join a HC raiding Guild and give them your resources, so no, they are not Communists.

I don't really like the idea of of tying loot ninjas to off-spec players.
---
There are plenty of main spec loot ninjas, and honestly I'd be willing to bet more of them.
---
The problem with Mulgore is that it *really* becomes evident how bad the draw distance is (or at least was on my private server)
---
He really *milked* that for all it was worth.
---
Live to win
---
That's a possibility, yes, and it undoubtly happened. It's not **that** easy however, because as pointed out, the item had to be useful to you, and be a noticeable upgrade to your current gear.
---
As a quick example, I was denied calling need for [Ebony Flame Gloves](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=19407) because I already had my [Nemesis Gloves](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=16928), which completed my 3pc T2 set bonus.

I actually wanted the EFGs, because down the line I planned on using them instead of the set-gloves, but in this instance, I couldn't announce need. However, I got them the very next week, because without low priority, you are entitled to announce need on whatever you want as long as it makes sense for your class and spec to do so.
---
For completeness sake a few other things:
---
* **Trials could participate in the loot system like everyone else.** They were not locked out. If they did win items, the cost was subtracted from their initial 150 staring DKP. Trials did not earn DKP per boss kill (a trial periods lasted 20 bosskills (that's 2 MC clears), so essentially, a trial paid 50 DKP in total for his Trial).
---
* **There was no** [**50 DKP MINUS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDytJC655c). We didn't punish via DKP. We punished by benching and kicking people. Punishment was handed out for asocial behavior, not mistakes (we were progression, but not Hardcore).
---
* There was no preferential treatment for tanks (or anyone else). However, this was NEVER a problem during all of classic. Tanks were pampered, supported and essentially carried on our hands by the entire guild.
---
Overall, our system was extremely relaxed, and our guild was the better for it. We had a good reputation on the realm, no shortage of applicants, and we cleared the content up to and including Naxx. We were not the server first, but we had fun, and had a good time =)
---
You're wrong though. The only difference was parry chance, which is 14% in classic and 5% on pservers. 
---
Damage numbers and boss health has been turned way up on most blizzlike servers. KT had 9 mill on Feenix for example, while he had 3 mill in Vanilla.
---
Wa the paladin hearthing out of there?
---
Why would you talk about a social MMO to someone if you don't want to run the risk of playing it with someone?
---
You're sending mixed messages to your coworkers, and it honestly makes you a dick if you shut them down.
---
If you have this much of a problem, don't talk to people you don't want to play the game with about it.
---
Just to add to what Haynajohn said, often enchanters will charge a fee that tends to be higher the rarer the enchant is. You want to add the fee in the last trade, when your item is getting enchanted, just in case that player tries to scam you. It's not going to make him give you back the mats, but at least you won't be out of the gold too. Once the servers settle there will be renowned guilds with trusted crafters that won't screw you over, so go for those when possible.
---
Whatever server you're on it usually feels like you're outnumbered.
---
There were honestly a few nights in my early MC days that I just couldn’t afford to raid.
---
I might just do cat till Moonkin then.
---
LOL
---
The Alliance, The Horde, and the Three Hammers!
---
I mean playing a community game like a greedy narcissist.
---
14% vs 5% parry is a huge deal for tanks though. Less threat means less dps = harder fights
---
From when Esfand actually targeted himself and THEN pressed the button, I counted 16 frames.
---
Boopy da dooo enscotter snoozer.
---
It will be.
---
Rogue T2 4ever.
---
Rushing is only good for 2 things in my opinion, world firsts (which lol already been done) and pvp realms.
---
If either of those don't apply, I'd recommend not rushing if anything.
---
You can burn yourself out very easily if trying to rush, just think about the fact that the average player will take 8-13 days /played to hit 60... and that's if their priority is leveling.
---
Of course getting to 60 asap has other benefits as to gearing and farming but it's completely unnecessary to rush the first 15 days and then be burned out :)
---
Grab Plate healing pieces and go
---
My problem with ElvUI is 2 fold. 1) The guy that made it had at one point added a way to spoof the chat of people in raids(ie. he could speak in public channels with YOUR name if you were in his raid) which was removed shortly but he couldn't understand why it was a big deal? 2) Didn't that guy get into legal trouble for trying to have sex with underage girls?
---
Lol I get it, I really do. I am just curious if she has a unique skin.
---
I said one sword worth using over an axe. Can you read?
---
But EQ never had cool looking armor in the beginning.  However, the game was far better expect three crucial flaws that both made it great and ruined the player experience; bottle-necking, ruthless death penalties, and non-instanced raiding.
---
My first character was an Orc in vanilla, the first time I was truly blown away was when I randomly wandered into Ashenvale at level 14 or something. Never forgot that feeling
---
lmfao
---
Tanks attack from the front you mong. Less threat means less dps = harder fights.
---
Parry resets the swing timer of the boss as well, leading to the tank taking more damage.
---
True.  But most warlocks weren't retarded.  Hunters on the other hand.
---
TBC is crap. pls keep that away.
---
Cross realm bgs are in the beta currently, and since blizzard doesn't want queues in any fashion (which is fucking dumb and the main reason we have layering...) I think it's safe to bet on them being in live as well.
---
There arenas they are barely a thing
---
The choice is very easy, no one will have gold, you want gold? You want 1000g mount.
---
Then you will have to roll Mage or Hunter.
---
Hunter has less downtime btw...
---
Keep it up. If things stay as planned and there are no gbank functions added, addons and tools like this will be necessary.
---
Maybe the pve/pvp server thing made a difference. I was on a pvp server and stuff was always going down during Vanilla.
---
Someone would gank someone. That person would want a revenge gank, then the 1st person would get a guildie and it just escalated from there.
---
Back then guildies actually helped each other in the world. Now in retail everyone just afks in the city of their choice waiting for their queue to pop.
---
Yeah fine in the terms of GDP and stock growth. Outdated, non representative terms of how the average american is doing.
---
60+% of people work paycheck to paycheck 50% cant afford a 500$ emergency expense. People working 2 -3 jobs to barley not be homeless and strait up be in poverty.
---
This country does alot right, but we are the wealthiest nation on this earth and the whole "fuck you i got mine" attitude is absolutley whats wrong. God forbid you help out your fellow man
---
Is clearing Naxx beating all the bosses, or is it getting all of the drops you want?
---
Depending on class/build/gear you can solo templars but if it would be  a greater gearing effort then a group would be optimal to spread the loot and kill stuff quicker. Dukes require few people while high council is close to a raid group requirement.
---
Not really, i tried that approach in vanilla/BC and would often spend upwards of 2 hours running an entire instance looking for gear off the last few bosses, only for the lead to kick me at the end because he didn't want competition. Or never even make it to the instance at all because it's easier to replace someone than run the dungeon multiple times for a piece of gear, so they'd rather just find someone not looking for it.
---
I'm absolutely keeping my mouth shut unless i know the people i'm running with.  
---
*Downvotes are to the left, chaps.*
---
Yes and the demon hunter is strange 2. loved that  everything was a little bit more chaotic back than
---
Yeah there are only 2 white bears under level like 50, so if you want one at low level you gotta go here
---
Ulduar is the pinnacle of raid design to me. Every fight made great use of the fight environment, and the hard-mode style used (different activation methods and such) should have been the benchmark for hard-modes going forward.
---
A private server with the full permission of Daybreak.  The Daybreak progression servers are absolutely awful.  The Daybreak Classic servers are basically what would happen if Blizzard made WoW Classic with all of the Retail QoL additions.
---
I consider P99 the true product comparable to Classic.
---
Thanks Thrall none of my co workers are into gaming
---
Aspect of the daze!
---
Poor Mages :(
---
That is alot of days played. God damn lol. I was expecting to get to 60 with like /played at 5 or 6 days. Maybe even less. Guess I'm in for a big surprise
---
Music was amazing as well.
---
Moderation babies! If you aren't getting your ducks in a row right now in preparation for Classic... you are already fucking up.
---
It's okay to completely binge for a week 2 weeks a month whatever you want, just don't mope around now.
---
Have everything outside of the game under control before August even hits :)
---
It reminds me of my homestate, oregon. :)
---
Have fun
---
The PvP gear is mostly ret oriented and so is 1.9 T2. T1 is a mix of everything but quite decent for PvP. I'm fairly sure pre-bis holy paladins don't want any of the T1 so you can probably get a lot of it if you explain its use in PvP. 
---
There are of course some really nice off-pieces in raids that are crap for raid healing but really good for pvp.
---
Je ne parle pas Français
---
Ah man fucking Monkey Quest
---
Because only horde gets them. Last big poll showed 16% warriors and 8% shamans. So they'll be as overpopulated as warriors without being as necessary as warriors. Healing is nice but not as rare as a tank.
---
Nagrand is the single best zone in all of wow, change my mind
---
I used to play OSRS back in the day when it was current before migrating to vanilla wow circa 2004. I think I got to level ~84 or so on OSRS, but mostly focused on making gold through WC. OSRS and WoW have a lot of similarities, but here's where they differ.
---
Combat: the combat system is far different in WoW than it is in OSRS. Unlike OSRS, where youre free to pick your style of combat (melee, ranged, mage), you have classes in WoW. There are far more abilities that each class has, which makes for some very exciting and engaging fights. However, once you pick a class you're locked into those abilities (unless you play a hybrid class such as a Druid). Ex. A warrior does not have any long range magic spells, etc. Unlike OSRS, you can create a new character on the same account if you decide you want to go for a different playstyle. 
---
Professions/Crafting: unlike OSRS, you're limited to 2 primary professions instead of having all of them unlocked. Some craftable items are locked and you will need to learn them from a "recipe". These recipes can be bought through vendors, or some of the more sought after recipes drop from dungeon bosses. This helps a lot with fostering a community as professions are fairly important in the late game, and it helps having a friend who can enchant your weapon, or create a potion for you, etc. 
---
Grinding: yes, there is a lot of grinding in Wow. You can level 1-60 by only grinding, but some of the quests are pretty epic and arguably it's a lot more efficient to quest than just kill 5000 mobs to your next level. You do not grind specific abilities (Strength / HP), but instead you have an XP bar and every kill rewards X amount of XP until you fill your bar and level up. Later in the game you will be grinding for reputation, as killing certain enemies will increase your reputation with certain factions within the game which will reward you based on your reputation with them (friendly/revered/exalted). You will also grind resources (thinks fishing, wood cutting, mining in OSRS) if you picked a gathering profession. 
---
Gearing: it's not quite as linear as OSRS. There is A LOT more gear in the game, which make fun and interesting combinations. Think back to the quest when you needed to kill the dragon to get your Dragon Longsword. You needed that dragon fire shield. WoW has similar resistance attributes (fire resist, nature resist, etc.) for defeating certain raid bosses. 
---
Gameplay: this is purely opinionated, but I really prefer the WASD key bindings to clicking on where I want to go on the map. If I recall, there is an option in the game to let you click to where you want to go, but I feel like WoW is far more immersive than OSRS. 
---
Those are some of the bigger points I can think of off the top of my head, I'm sure I missed some things, but hope this helps.
---
You're right, googled it a bit. Poisons and enchants scaled off spellpower in ManGos. So it's a private server thing that doesn't translate. 
---
Rats. It looks kinda fun and so different..
---
Just form the group yourself and let it be known in the beginning.  I agree that many types are pure scandalous greed.  Like all of those Onyxia pugs with one Warlock raid leader and 17 Mages.
---
Rogue
---
You mean who remembers the game box?
---
Play what you want, there’s roles for class in PvP and PvE.
---
[Shit quality video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw8-FRJYgOg), but you can see me get within 10 yards of the Crocs a handful of times without taking any damage whatsoever. On Classic, the mobs would have hit me from up to 20 yards away. There is 0 doubt it is majorly fucked in Classic client.
---
This classic team seems up to the task.
---
More than not having it, that's for sure
---
They're not. Alliance is better.
---
World records are like 3-4 days I believe and I think that's only hunters and multiple people playing that character.
---
So yeah I believe majority of people that play Classic will have a big reminder or a surprise that leveling to 60 is not something that can be done over a long weekend.
---
That's why I'd recommend not putting too much pressure on yourself to level - especially with learning how the class plays and the frustrations that will pop up :)
---
Arcane Science == Best science!
---
This question has been asked to death and is utterly rediculous... the game isn't even out yet and people are already looking to ruin it with expansions. Enjoy the game and just go with the flow...
---
Because he’s a lore character
---
Classic will be the best thing for people new to WOW
---
That dude has a gnarly forehead

To learn what content is slow and inefficient so I can pass the rush.

---
&gt; We all want to play classic, alot of us would love to be in beta but guess what I dont bring 8000 viewers and millions of social media followers around with me. Get over it.
---
Classic is not supposed to be for "viewers"... Classic is specifically for the dedicated players who loved the game and want to enjoy that era again. aka not for the CASUALS. How hard is that to understand. When you have the audacity to have a "Criteria" for being selected for beta, how could anyone in their right minds be OK with a retard like pokimane getting access when she is dumb enough to think you need to SAVE YOUR PROGRESS BEFORE LOGGING OUT. That is the definition of casual. That is the embodiment of the player type that dedicated WoW players HATE... Stop sucking blizz's dick and accept the fact this isnt what Classic should cater to. This shouldnt be accepted at all. Congrats on being the type of person that inflates the egos of every major game developer like activision, fueling their crusade to make every game about CASH GRABS.
---
The comic displays a ret paladin rolling need (it's not said but inferred) on tanking off-spec gear, which is the character type to which I was referring.  No one, at least not the sane, has ever given a fuck about people rolling greed on off-spec gear.
---
Hopefully those of us who got into the stress test won’t get in to future ones. Would prefer new people get invites and a moment to enjoy the early levels of classic. It’d be quite boring a 3rd time around
---
True, fair enough. :)
---
Fuck, i hope so. r/Freefolk has been such a shitshow for the last two weeks we might as well adopt all of their bots.
---
Play whatever you want man.  Both classes are fun. 
---
If you plan on raiding at all, you’ll be required to heal as a shaman.  Rogue is obviously DPS, and top end DPS for the entire game at that.  
---
Rogues are fun in world PvP, super boring in group / BG’s IMO.  Shaman are fun and good in both.
---
Well that's crazy. As I previously stated I must be so attuned to retail. I was so young when I played classic I probably got to level 20 or 30 and it took me weeks. First time I ever got to max level was like wrath. I still had alot of fun for sure. I'm going to just forget what I know about retail levelling I guess haha.
---
High respec cost is good  
---
You have 2 choices pick a overall build you like 
---
or farm to minmax
---
Simple i like it
---
Horde loving zones areassive, boring and confusing as all hell. Horde as a whole is just inconvenient to play as, but damn do we look good.
---
Pretty much that but also the CRZ works different in PvP or at least it did
---
On horde it's wonderful and pre dire maul it's a great refuge from the PvP fuckfest that is tanaris.
---
Horde has Barrens chat which is the best part of the game
---
I happily submit my theory to the principle of falsifiction as outlined in the principles of empirical science by Sir Karl Popper.
---
As there is evidence to support my claim (widespread community support for an unchanged version), the *Onus Probandii* is now on you, if you want to disprove me.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Barrens leveling is always a good time, after barrens I'm not really sure where else zones are more fun, as they're mostly put together aside from various quests.
---
Yea but i really like the look of Shaman from Cdew but hes just a really good shaman its like watching chance and go druid, thats my thinking, and wont people have alot of rogues set out already?
---
On Imp, not on any other pet.
---
lol, I love people losing their minds and having to go to support when any little thing in their launcher changes
---
The only think keeping me back from playing Horde is that their capital cities are garbage. Orgrimmar looks like a kid with orange Play-Doh built it. Undercity is super cramped.
---
None of the bosses you listed were harder than M'uru.. and M'uru wasn't even the hardest out of Vanilla + TBC.
---
Imagine listing 25-man heroic Ragnaros 🤣.
---
You are right, those totally slipped my mind, thanks for pointing it out!
---
Yea that makes sense . Unfortunately real life will be hating on me so the initial rush will pass me by anyway so I should be ok at my snails pace lol
---
The Hinterlands for me :)
---
That's a debuff you get.
---
&gt;Part of the fun of Vanilla to me was the unknown and being a total noob.
---
I cant erase my memory, it is not unkown for me anymore and im not the noob i was in vanilla. Im practicing to level up efficiently, but i am also deciding on which class to play, reading about it isn't enough for me, if i hadn't tried it i would have made a priest 100%, and i would have regretted it. After that i wanted to make a hunter, i would have regretted it. I know those things because i ended up playing them and they just weren't for me. Im sure on which class to play now. If in classic i'd have to reroll when im 60 i would probably just stop playing and i didn't want to do that.
---
You can't speak for the whole community and tell what made us love Vanilla.
---
😂😂😂
---
Alliance zones are cool for sure. But somehow I feel like you get better friendships on horde while leveling, and the world feels so much bigger and more immersive. The quests all relates to the prosperity of the horde, and you're trying to be a good grunt in the force, whereas as alliance you're the errand boy. 
---
Also you look more awesome, your shoulder game is on point and there's more variety. 
---
That being said, westfall, duskwood and redridge are amazing quest zones and some of my favourites in WoW. But I think I'd recommend the horde zones more (outside of those three) for the entire rest of the game.
---
can't wait to get surprise insta-gibbed by mor'ladim again
---
I am in the same situation. I hope it is just temporary and we will get back. My Druid is just before getting the Bear form...
---
*Points at the "dead" hunter*

You should build shouldn't be like gear changing it to match the situation

He waited too long....this has always been like this....You can't pop bubble a few micro seconds before you hit the ground...classic coding was..... special....you have to overly time shit. 
---
Jesus people....stop acting like things work on modern code....
---
This needs blizzard attention and it needs to get removed from wow
---
I love how people say "they're streamers its free advertisement" the wow classic was made as a nod to the people who've asking and fighting for this for years. To tell me that Asmongold and Soda's 100k+ viewership combined is not enough advertisement that streamers with 2k - 4k viewers who never played WoW need to have access and only level to 10 is actual proper beta testing? what a joke
---
You do have to enable it but you only ever have to enable it once and it's always on every time you summon your imp.
---
Classic Beauty
---
Well, if the layers are big (2-3k), if u dont get ahead of the pack, the starter zones will be really rough to level through. Quest mobs will be dead all the time, etc. People practice to get ahead of the pack so they can actually play the game.
---
Maybe because being caught in the masses of dad gamers trying to mob tag isn't a very enjoyable experience
---
His death did not affect me emotionally very much back than. Obviously I was sad about it, but mostly I recognized him and respected him for the good work he did. I just watched the documentary and the ending, especially the live reactions that were shown made me tear up.

&gt;2: If you miss work but you're on Classic WoW, they know. I'm of the opinion you keep your work life and home/hobby life separate. You might think they're cool, but work gossip is no joke and word could spread they saw you on WoW the same day you called in sick.
---
You're not allowed to play video games if you're sick?
---
Considering certain things like honor ranks and DM aren't in at launch or phase 1 I wouldn't say people are doing it for those reasons... I imagine it's purely for the first 48 hours of launch.
---
Which I can understand because I'd like to go into launch with a loosely planned out path, the more time spent wondering where to go or what skills to grab and leave behind are more and more seconds and minutes of over crowding.
---
I don't plan on practicing but know because of that I will be "behind the pack" which I'm okay with - I'd like to be within the first wave of 60s, but understand that anything can happen between launch and the first week or so :)
---
Yea that makes total sense ! I know a bit of things I will remember as I start to play again , but I haven’t played much for private servers for vanilla and I’m going to roll horde where I was alliance as a teen . Hopefully they will add some newness! Def understand wanting to nail down a class
---
I'm on the fence between rolling hunter or druid in Classic. I know hunters are always over-represented, but I crave well executed pulls in dungeons, and their kit really supports that.
---
This needs blizzard attention and it needs to get removed from wow. Spell batching is also included on one pserver because well "trying to capture real blizzlike experience" and people wouldnt stop btching about it. I dont understand, why they even considered putting this "feature" inside the game at the first place
---
Probably the first thing you said is the most important. My father worked 60+ a week to provide us with a comfortable life and I’ll never forget that sacrifice, it was hard at the time but he was doing it for us. Not nearly enough context here to judge the guy.
---
Read my question again.
---
Wow that's something I never thought about, but you're right! Explains why those zones tend to be my favorite ones.
---
This counts double for students. I added a student once in warlords. He ducked and was annoying. But luckily he wore himself out and quit.
---
Blacklisted forever
---
Could do, you're not entirely wrong. But I'm a simple man, and don't have the same amount of free time i had back then. Finding one tank is hard enough; finding one that doesn't mind running an hour+ long 5 man that we may not even finish if the group's not up to par, only to then have to roll against me for a piece of gear they really want is significantly harder.
---
Yeah I bet they can , the sluts 
---
This! This is my feeling exactly! This is why I want classic!
---
Dude was projecting something awful. Show me on the doll where the character model you didn’t like touched you. Am I right
---
they're to
---
Nah man not boring at all. I love spending some time each week concentrating on profs. Do some fishing, do some herbing, mix some potions. And they are definitely one of the ways you will be making gold in the game.

To me it seems like many people who didn't play classic and have been scared by older players saying how its "hard". When people that aren't max level are being brought into a raid, I think that tells you all you need to know.
---
Gratz. I was under the assumption that you could not tame animals higher level than you. I must've been mistaken

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

While alliance is better you have to decide whether or not to play with your friends.

My friends are going PvE alliance while I want to go PvP horde... I'll probably end up making a horde alt later on in classic :)
---
Got a link to the poll?
---
I always loved STV personally. The music, and over abundance of hostility just rustled my jimmies.

Did you do ALL these bosses in their first killed form on live? Just curious.
---
ziqo is going to play us though
---
Mine is still there, hit 4 on the first stress test but was one of the ones that didn't get flagged right till later due to having two ptr accounts. Got to 10 in the second stress test. I can login and see the server is offline.
---
When did Swifty move to EU? He is american
---
What do you mean? I’m looking at his face right now.
---
Rogues definitely not. Tier 1 and 2 sets are definitely good but several pieces are not BiS most notably t2 shoulders having a super great model but somewhat poor itemization.
---
Part of it is having decent gear before you start raiding so that your raid can succeed, but only part of it.  
---
The other part is what kind of person gets their pre-bis vs. doesn't?  Will a raider farm consumes when progression fights actually require it?  Will they bother enchanting their items?  Will they bother moving out of fire?  A person who farms their pre-bis is a person who is saying "I am ready to raid and you won't have to carry me". 
---
You are right, MC isn't that hard in greens.  Some guilds/raid leaders don't want to have to carry a bunch of people all the time so they set standards early to let people know what their expectations are.
---
what are you all on about?! The free and open midt-west American ambient feel to grizzly hills is by far the most beautiful zone in all of Azeroth. The music is just spot on and i often listen to it when i want to relax. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWTSK5waNs8 for ambient music.
---
I must admit I have never watched a video game tournament.
---
I did, also got Bear Form and that was awesome.

It's gone now.

Every horde Zone is a different color barrens

I thought he was EU based? idk.

It's good to know we're not out of the future stress tests.
---
Great, thanks!  I guess this should at least cut queue times way down.
---
Rhok’delar and Lok’delar quest chain!! It’s at 60, so not for leveling, but you get a dope epic staff and bow! It’s kind of tedious but very rewarding!
---
One day you too will be a dad gamer.
---
You seriously just lectured us because you were a pathetic loser who could not manage his life. Pathetic........
---
Is he moving to NA?
---
It'd be nice to see dual spec for the multi role classes so they could actually utilize the versatility of their character, dps classes aren't really an issue in vanilla because pvp wasn't based around arenas and you don't really need multiple dps specs the way a prot warrior sucks at everything except tanking.
---
For now though it just puts more emphasis on which class to role based on what you enjoy.
---
Now you are given another chance to get the set while they are still relevant, and raid as a badass weretiger!
---
did you guys know that wands in the french client are called baguettes
---
My main thing I'm doing on the beta right now is just making different characters for fun and going through the beggining areas trying to find "different" areas to kill the beginning mobs. Like in the Orc starting zone, killing the boars off to the right of the starting spot versus going towards the imp cave. Just things like that, I've also been seeing how much I would making from doing skinning while leveing to see if it's more viable than doing mining/bs or eng, as my first round of classic was pure noobness, I barely made it to 40 as 3 of us were taking turns on one account at a buddies for like 3 months. So it's less practice in learning a class and more of doing research on how  I want to level, and by no means am I racing for world first anything.
---
Honestly although I dont agree with the whole reasoning behind adding spell batching in ( in it’s vanilla form ), we have to live with it. I understand it’s meant to keep the whole Vanilla vibe present but it’s obviously a flawed mechanic in it’s present beta state. Going to cause more trouble than good. It’s like riding a coach to work when there are cars available, may seem fun untill you realize there’s a bunch of horse shit on your driveway all the time. Guess we’ll have to get used to the smell, the goal was to stick to the original as much as possible ( even though some of it may be flawed ). Personally I dont feel like having the current retail spell mechanic would hurt the original Vanilla feeling or have any significant influence on class balance. It is what it is though. It’ll still be fun.

Havent watched him for a couple of years so he mightve moved but he is puerto rican living in Florida and played on US realms.
---
In vanilla the talent you are talking about actually refunds 100% of the mana cost. It was nerfed in TBC to 60%.

Look at this guy and his super computer. Single digit gang 2004-2007.
---
The only thing we've really been practicing is clearing MC with 1 Tranq Shot and minimal gear for that week one Rag kill.
---
Alright. I did some research on this.
---
Issue we have right now is Thottbot stopped displaying mob reactions in search lists by the time Wrath came around, so we can't use it as a source. Allakhazam's CSS wasn't saved properly by Archive.org, so I can't tell if it had data on the reaction.
---
However, WoWHead did. Let's have a look at a September 2007 page:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070911104158/http://www.wowhead.com:80/?npc=80
---
Now, here, the mob is listed as aggressive for both Alliance and Horde. I'd like you to take a look at the source for this page and note the &lt;span class="q7"&gt; tag used around the letters for the reaction. This is important because of the next page we're going to look at, from January 2008:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20080115100325/http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=80
---
The CSS is broken, and only Alliance is listed now. Go back to the source for this new page and note that it's still using the "q7" class, which WH uses to show aggressive.
---
However, we can look at a video from a few days before the Wrath prepatch dropped here:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSsQdcubD4o
---
Here's another video released slightly before the second page I linked with neutral mobs:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkBdqVZmROY
---
As you can see, the mobs here are neutral all the way in the cave. It seems to me that WoWhead always had them listed as aggressive for whatever reason, but even up to before Wrath, they were listed as aggressive even though they were demonstrably not. I have to question whether these mobs were ever aggressive (I can't find any evidence post-Wrath, unfortunately), or whether someone noticed them become passive on WoWhead and assumed that was just the case in game.
---
I think that WOTLK was the best expansion, but not necessarily the best expansion to start in. Vanilla and WOTLK are way more similar to each other than either is to retail, though, so you didn't miss too much.
---
Get t1 from MC and you'll be fine for classic tbh
---
🤔
---
You realize millions play WoW without the issues you experience. YOU are the problem not WoW. Get help.
---
I'm talking about people rolling need on their main spec, which people might consider an offspec.
---
I guess I misunderstood what you were saying.
---
I assumed you meant "A prot paladin should never roll against a prot warrior on gear".
---
I wasn't responding directly to the comic, but to your comment.
---
Sorry I misunderstood you.
---
&gt;Quest wise you feel more exposed as a horde than alliance to ganks and danger zones.
---

---
If you dont even realize how casual friendly classic wow is than you probably shouldn't be in the beta. 
---
Its clearly they are trying to get more eyes from more places on the beta. Pokimanes audience probably has some crossover with wow but she also probably has a lot of fans who never played and through that blizzard can grow the audience for the game with 1 beta invite. 
---
It's a literal no brainer 1 invite for potentially thousands of new players as well as how ever many social media followers she has. 
---
Classic might be the most casual friendly version of wow. It's a game with a ton of rewarding content with great rpg players where casual players can feel rewarded for simply leveling or completing a low level dungeon and getting a good blue item. The game will be much better with a larger audience especially with first time players. The casual audience is one classic wants because it will increase the longevity of classic as well as show blizzard that these elements of wow are good for all their consumers which hopefully pushes them back towards more traditional rpg elements rather than the current wow system we have
---

---
It's mostly an issue in the first few seconds of the fight, since dps could pull aggro if they don't wait and the tank gets parried at the beginning. Over the course of a fight the high threat tank specs will make sure that the dps decrease is marginal - even if these tank specs do take more damage with parry haste they won't die as long as the healers are doing their jobs and precasting big heals.
---
[all yours](https://m.imgur.com/S7hLtlF)

&gt;The best faction for raiding will definitely be Horde, because Bloodlust is too strong to overlook.
---
Lacking critical information.

All correct except you missed Soulstring from 4 horsemen which is amazing too.

Darkshore, I used to wait in Auberdine asking if anyone needed help with quests
---
It's just a cheeky way to put it.
---
&gt; and not emulated for reason of ... Err.. experience. 
---
Its a big deal in pvp.
---
I wiped plenty in MC with my first Vanilla guild, we had iirc fire mages, ret paladins, mortal strike warriors, PVP rogues, not sure about druids.
---
We had at least the excuse that WOW was completely new territory, nobody really knew what they were doing.
---
&gt; We do 40man druid raids and clear Mc. 
---
And I heard about hunter and spriest tanking Onyxia. You do that when you over gear the raid.
---
Have you ever heard of a 40 man druid Naxx ? Me neither.
---
IMO meme specs won't get passed BWL.
---
Do what you want, but don't be surprised if you stagnate on the harder content.
---
Was about to ask the same thing.
---
I think the whole music in WoW is just amazing.
---
Sure I will, I leveled multiple characters to 60 that I ultimately regretted.
---
the expansions zones became rollercoaster rides, every nook is planned within the quests parameters to fulfill is purpose. it lost something in the way.
---
You can't write this shit
---
They also need to change their last name and get the kid baptised, so he can be Thunderfury, blessed child of the Windseekers.
---
would also be worth keeping in mind everything far less taxing in gfx with classic, running around with over 200 fps there with everything ultra'ed, that is not the case for bfs, higher res models, gear, spells and all the jazz will have it's impacts
---
Remember, shaman at level 30 is not anywhere near shaman at level 60. At level 30 they are Hella strong. 
---
I had a shaman twink in level 30 back in the day what dominated bgs (way back when the ranges were 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 etc). So powerful with your windfury and corpsemaker with crusader on it.. ghost wolf mobility and frost shock slow to catch up. Was a sad day when they changed the brackets and my 500g investment went down the drain.. xD
---
But yeah, don't base your wanting of playing a class on someone else or what's needed. A lot of things change and happens on the road to 60 :)
---
I wouldn't consider it in the upper echelon of video game soundtracks, but there are definitely some standout pieces.
---
If spell batching is what made you love vanilla, you’re stupid.
---
Rogue main for years in Vanilla. Always a fan of the Dagger MH//Slow sword OH. Best of both worlds, but Rogues are always good despite weapons used if the person playing just simply understands the mechanics. All weapons are fun :D
---
If you have ever had a serious addiction, you would know nothing is as simply as you describe.
---
Op was basically a meth junkie and wow was his fix. What you describe is a somewhat healthy relationship to games, not an addiction.
---
I played both my shaman and rogue to 85. Honestly I enjoyed the shaman a lot more, it’s really like 3 classes rolled into one.
---
But don’t get me wrong rogue is a lot of fun too. The best part of being a rogue is the ability to choose your engagements, amazing fun in world pvp and battlegrounds. It’s tough to go from that to literally any other class except Druid, so if you make a rogue first you’ll be hooked. In PVE however it is very simple and one dimensional.
---
"Shaman ! your totem, the patrol is coming ! Shaman !"

Oh dear...

Yeah, well, I'm not your buddy, guy!
---
What can I say - had just had my christian 'confirmation' party back then, so got a ton of cash from family and friends. Since I had no responsibilities as a young teen they all went into a computer. Was damn worth all those hours of pretending to be religious! Mom was happy, I was happy. Win win!
---
I actually like how hunters play, and find them completely acceptable in raids and groups.  I just believe the ease of their play style leads to people who care less to the class, which gives the good a bad rap.

Hi, /u/Dylkington
---
That's one biaised and ignorant view of communism you have.
---
I think i hit honered at lvl 12 or so as undead
---
How is skinning looking for mount money?
---
While it is a great journey indeed, some of us have already walked it times and times again. I find much greater joy nowdays being ahead of the curve and pushing the limit.
---
Of course it is. Play what you want, leveling will take time, so level how YOU want to. Unless you want speed, then look for efficiency.
---
What is the point of having a slow weapon in the offhand? OH damage is rather low anyways, so rogues benefit more from fast OH weapons to apply poisons. And after having dagger specialization I'd want to have two daggers anyways.
---
I am seriously curious as to why a slow OH would be better.
---
It's not terrible, but I really don't think it's optimal. 1% crit is roughly 1% bonus damage (100% extra damage on 1% of your attacks). this won't change until you start getting deep wounds and impale talents, but you are delaying all that by 5 levels by speccing cruelty.
---
And improved rend is really good. If you figure that as a warrior, you are generally fighting mostly enemies 1-2 levels lower than you, and ticking rend fully once (which is my rough experience), Rend starts out at 10 (when you can talent improved rend) at roughly 14% of your damage, and so 15% of that is a 2% damage increase overall, and all 3 points are  4.9% bonus damage.
---
I arrived at this by taking the average mob health, and calculating what fraction of that health a single rend application would do (rend ignores armor and does 15/28/45 damage at levels 4/10/20). But of course, rend cannot crit, so cruelty is only eligible to apply bonus damage to the ~86% of mob health that is not accounted for by rend. Making cruelty roughly 0.86% bonus damage at level 10, or 4.3% bonus damage for all 5 points. you get less for 5 points than you get for 3 points of improved rend. 
---
So at level 10-15, improved rend is quite a bit better than cruelty. At  15-19, When you are probably fighting mobs up to level 17-18 (380 to 400 health ballpark), and rend is still doing 28 damage (I suspect it's higher, but I am not in the beta and there seems to be a bit of disagreement as to what the actual scaling with attack power and weapon damage rend does in vanilla), that means that rend is 7% of your damage  and now 2.45% increased damage for 3 talent points, or .81% increased damage per talent point.... at worst.
---
But that assumes you don't reapply rend, which I really feel is worth doing (rend does not require anything like a duration to be worth the rage, and with even one quarter of a new rage application, that's going to be up above cruelty again, which is getting as low as .86% damage per talent point. Beyond that, staying in combat while leveling is often beneficial, so having a fleeing death sentenced mob while you bandage can just be pure benefit, so I often reapply rend. 
---
TLDR:  improved rend is just better than cruelty, pre deep wounds/impale, and if you are taking cruelty, you are delaying deep wounds/impale. 
---
I think it's not a bad idea to backfill for cruelty early, possibly before mortal strike, but i would really just rush sweeping strikes personally. improved rend is worth taking before cruelty, and then it's only 2 points into dump talents until you go for the whole reason you are in arms: tactical mastery, anger management, deep wounds, and improved overpower/impale. 
---
this might change if you are so twinked that your time to kill mobs is under 12 seconds, but that ain't me.
---
I'm quite sure they've won awards for it.
---
All good and I agree.
---
First two are easy, but challenging? That's really vague.
---
Nevermind, I just looked and realised that Bloodlust was added alongside Heroism for Alliance Shamans. It was never in Vanilla.
---
I take that back.
---

---
!RemindMe 85 days
---
As a prot paladin main in Vanilla this is why I'm gonna just make my own groups :P
---
Okay how about this, a class that slaps at pvp and isnt over played?
---
Yes, a tactical retreat... at least that's how they call it.
---
Spellbatching is part of the Vanilla experience. It doesn't matter what your opinion are about this.
---
I’ve not played since cata but I saw a video the other day and the npc lore character models are like twice the size of regular characters? Sucks
---
If you don't wanna learn from other people mistakes and addictions, you are simply a fool.
---
People like op had a serious addiction, you didn't. You managed to balance it, op didn't. There's a huge difference and a lesson to be learned there. You might already know this lesson, since you didn't get addicted like Op, but there are tons of people who haven't learned yet.
---
How did you tame him at level 10? That's a bug.

[It really, really wasn't.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Gamergate)

I saw it develop from the beginning. There was never anything there except for a jilted ex-boyfriend trying to tear down his ex-girlfriend that turned into a witchhunt once it got picked up by groups with an axe to grind.
---
Actions speak a lot louder than rhetoric. And the actions taken by the gamergate community were definitely not about improving the reliability of journalism.
---
Got them both in one run on my hunter.
---
That’s the choice they make, Life’s full of choices and if you choose to let that happen to yourself then that’s on you.
---
I know what addiction is and what it does to people but the cool thing about WoW is you can have it both ways. You don’t have to be the South Park description, you can choose tenuous the game and enjoy life.
---
You get 100% of mana cost back on a crit with 5/5 illumination.
---
Nope, this would happen during live. Not often, but it did happen and it was often memberable. Just another reason why spell batching should be seen as a bug that was fixed long ago.
---
Feralas. Absolutely loved that zone.
---
That's difficult when no where near everyone is on reddit mate. So it's gonna be difficult to lower it for everyone. But I will do my best!
---
Flash of light is the most mana efficient heal in all of vanilla.
---
Baguette of Fates, Necrotic Baguette, Ritssyn's Baguette of Bad Mojo.. sounds epic!
---
Not sure what made you love Vanilla. Was it easy raids, casual gameplay compared to other mmos at the time, some specs being useless, totally broken pvp rank system or whatever but i wouldn't change a thing. All the small things are part of the experience. And no, i am not stupid even thoughi love the Vanilla as it was.
---
Yep, after you enable it. A very key point.
---
To justify wasting time on a pserver even if you know deep down it'd just because you really want to play classic right now, but can't, so you tell yourself and others it's 'to practice', but when the game comes out you'll be enjoying the ride just like everyone else.
---
Of all the meme specs, this is the worst.
---
I got this on my alt hunter. Dont know what happened to them :( regrets to this day
---
I might be weird but I loved Tanaris.
---
Whole heartedly agree. Min max mentality might actually drive potential players away.
---
Ofc it had but when the first addons  I read about is about a dungeon finder and all that other community killers I can’t hold myself back
---
Don't worry, I'm just advancing in a different direction!
---
STUPID BOY!
---
I was so sad when they sent rogue energy generation back to chunks. Smoother generation is so much more to the actual point of the class. Think about this, vigor is a talent that gives you an additional 10 energy, but just by playing with one little add-on you effectively just got 20 energy, twice the result of a 31 point talent just due to the unforeseen interaction of large chunk energy regeneration and the cleverness of the add-on community.
---
Yeah this thread was more about to ask what roleplayers that like to RP **and** PVP are going to do. Not what people do that only like to do one of those things, or what non-roleplayers like to do, I don't care about that.
---
I still remember logging in for the very first time and being absolutely blown away by how beautiful Teldrassil was.

Always looked forward to duskwood. 
---
Creepy scary music with the undead setting.
---
If u are talking about shockadin, that was only a thing for PvP I'm pretty sure.
---
Alliance can’t level in the barrens?
---
It really helps if I remember correctly as I'm not sitting in front of my launcher a full stack of light leather sells for 1s 25c so it's great for beginning skills and such so you can bank a lot of your quest rewards for stuff. If your starting as horde and are wanting skinning and you can be a tauren, i had my skinning close to 100 before even getting out of the starting area, i was also leaving the zone with close to 30-40s after getting skill upgrades. It's not much but by 14 I had my first gold.
---
Ashenvale by far
---
I just hope you don't actually think that people believe that flimsy lie. What next, you have to cancel plans because you have a bad headache lol? It's the same as telling them you don't feel like hanging out today, except they know to respect you less because you're afraid enough to lie.
---
Well, I can already tell you that macro isn't going to work on Classic.
---
If you think serious addiction is an active choice, you don't know anything about addiction mate. Just saying.
---
There was a great quote from some other discussion back when there was nothing but radio silence about games that never change. Basically they said that if a game stays buggy for so long (ie the lifespan of private servers) the only people left playing will be those who think every bug is a feature.
---
Try it for the memes and live the dreams imo. Find a community and some friends who are like-minded and play the game the way you want to. Worst case you'll play the game on hardmode, which may in and of itself be fun as fuck. Best case it works, if not we'll, just well enough. So you won't be a speedrunning god - but you'll have fun.
---
I am, which is why I'm annoyed. Maybe you should read a couple books if you think op's text doesn't need more commas.
---
If you have time to make and eat healthy food every day, exercise on a daily basis at least for an hour, go to work every day for 8+ hours, spend time doing other necessary activities as shopping, showering, pooping or if you have GF spend time with her, have at least mediocre sleep and still have time to play WoW each day till you bleed out your ears, I want to know your magic. Because that´s some 30+ hours right there.

Erudites are like the super frail wizard dudes of EQ. And they have a sick fivehead.

Some of them discovered necromancy and split away from the capital to found their own city called Paineel. A civil war ensued, and Paineel was magic-nuked into a literal hole in the ground.
---
What? No this shows you that if you can find enough mobs then the more the merrier for people in your group.
---
The main thing is that it makes it feel like you always want to group up with friends or strangers nearby because you can level faster. Which is how it should be.
---
Frost resist is only important on Saph and KT, the two last bosses of the last raid in Vanilla.  I applaud you for playing the long game, but I would not choose my race based on the frost resist racial.  My 2 cents.
---
Ya I think it’s a solid idea. Like literally a channel on tv that broadcasts twitch streamers various zones possibly a commentator? Or just various ingame sounds. I think it would be popular tbh. It would be one of the few channels I let my 1 yr old daughter watch. By few I mean only lol.

Growing up in Canada, despite how cold it is, there's something pristine about the glimmering of a fresh snowfall at twilight. The sky is purple and light is reflecting off the snow as you walk the sidewalk in the dead silence of the early morning. You can even sometimes see the northern lights. Winterspring totally reminds me of home, and it always held a place in my heart for that. Special mention to Dun Morough, but Winterspring really captured that purple hue of the twilight.

---
I don't know about that tbh, casual guilds may be more likely to have bad tanks who don't know how to generate threat properly. Even badly geared warlocks and warriors will out-threat a tank who doesnt know what he's doing.
---
My current guild's MT has Thunderfury but he's dogshit, so threat is always an issue.
---
It's actually The guild that you join that would force you to have a certain spec. If you want to use a special, less-than-optimal spec, make sure to join a guild that is okay with that

Can you explain the engineering trinkets? Is it like a teleport?

MC sure, How about AQ 40? or Naxx. You can have fun but if you're being a detriment to others in a social game it's on you.

It depends on your job.
---
If you work a physical labor job, you can.
---
If you work an office job that doesn't take much physically out of you, truthfully? If you can play WoW, you could have worked. So yes. Especially if it's the type of job where your absence is noticeable and may make the work load higher on others.
---
Man I love vashj'ir, it too had little breathing room but I dont level through Cataclysm and not go there, I skip Hyjule everytime
---

---
I'm in your shoes however I'm not working 60 hours. Change careers! It might take a long time for me to got 60, no time to raid this time.
---
Good stuff, was curious because I've only done it once on a pserver years ago and it helped a ton - I'm sure classic will be a slightly different animal :)
---
You mean PvE? Your only damaging spell has a 30 sec CD. I hope that answers your question.
---
In PvP there was a trinket from AQ I think that would bring down a meteor on a target. Paladins with this +holy shock crit could sometimes have high enough burst to kill someone once every 3 minutes. But that's about it really.
---
I like this system a lot, except that I would add priority on certain items (like Thunderfury etc).
---
You were fine for example with a hunter getting an Ashkandi instead of the warriors ?
---
You didn't even gear the MT first ?
---
Do you remember the cost of the items (you said 50 DKP for set items, but not the rest).
---
I'm going to bookmark this thread for future reference.
---
Again, choice. You choose to take that step backwards again or you choose to step forward.
---
On the darker side..
---
I love finding a hunter as a rogue/feral druid and then camping out with him for his rare pet spawn.....then when he goes to tame it? Boom. Ambush/ravage the pet.
---
......Yes, I also camp lowbies. (inc downvotes lol)
---
Battlegrounds killed organised WPvP.
---
Flying killed incidental WPvP.
---
You are right about incentives being an issue though. I think Dishonourable Kills were a bad idea for this reason - if anything, you should be encouraged to assault enemy towns and bases, not discouraged. DHKs are one of the major factors that killed off most WPvP outside of ganking and FP camping.
---
Yes. The house on the hill. I can barely remember some of the quest. 
---
Going to be fun returning.
---
Oh so everyone else from the stress test lost their entry in the battlenet launcher ? Whew, I thought I was banned or something. That's a relief.
---
Currently sat on a private server with 13k horde logged in (and we're the smaller faction) and no lag. Vanilla levels of spells/procs definitely seems easier to run.
---
No tjsts not how it works on the beta.
---
They may have quests in there but its mostly horde area and its about the chat in there not the zone otherwise
---
As a Shaman you are pretty much expected to be a healer during raids, if you are okay with it, it is a great choice as they are in a very high demand and imo have a very fun and satisfying healing style.
---
I saw someone posting the old vanilla wallpaper and I wanted to update it so it fits better on newer Monitors, Adding here in case someone wants it :D
---
Dude wtf, I recognize that macro xD used that on my priest back in TBC I think! 
---
Won't work in classic, as classic uses retail syntax. Bit of a bummer for me since I know the vanilla but not the retail one.
---
I'm not expert on the matter but I think fury still pulls slightly ahead of arms in the earlier levels, getting crit that early is massive.
---
Firm downvote. Very cringe and false post
---
Desolace... I’m not even trolling. I love that zone.
---
Yeah, you lost to DW fury warriors, exactly.
---
Note, you’re proving my point when you say this. You’re not reading the content of my post, you’re seeing what you want to see.
---
Vanilla was made by the community, not by the lack of technology to make the game more responsive. That’s all I’m saying. Changing spell batching and energy regeneration doesn’t change the game, or the content, it just makes it a more intuitive, fluid experience
---
*** EVERY!! WAND!! MATTERS!! EVERY!! WAND!! MATTERS!!***
---
Yea that makes sense haha, i get what you mean its just looking at all theses videos saying rogues- dont go them cus its hard to get in to a guild that needs or wants one you know, thanks for the help tho man
---
What a bunch of pussies.
---
&gt; stop acting like things work on modern code
---
Actually this is the modern code and they had to make a custom change to emulate spellbatching in classic.
---
I assume even people who never saw it, it gets posted on /r/wow every so often.
---
I've primarily been a Horde player so I have a fondness for their starting zones, but the alliance zones are way better. There are more options and the leveling path is less linear. 
---
UD: Tirisfall -&gt; Barrens
---
Orc/Troll: Durotar -&gt; Barrens
---
Tauren: Mulgore -&gt; Barrens 
---
The Alliance has Loch Modan, Westfall, and Darkshore -- the horde has The Barrens... and yes, I know that Silverpine is a thing but most people skip anyways because The Barrens is better.
---
My argument would be that if you work physical labor, illness obviously takes a lot of you, so it's valid.
---
If you work an office job and are "sick", but are conveniently well enough to play WoW for 8-12 hours that day.. You probably could have worked.

Anyone know where I can find the original comic?

On pserver it's really not too bad, you can have some dry spells but I'd say it procs fairly often. Unfortunately for rogues the MH is 2.2 speed.
---
Yea i mean its not either being fun or not i just want to do both PVP and PVE but i dont wanna have to go take like 3 months to find a good guild willing to take a rogue or something like that cus they are all premade
---
***EVERY!! WAND!! MATTERS!! EVERY!! WAND!! MATTERS!!***
---
But nobody who is addicted can make that choice. That why they stay addicted. They need help from people who know how to handle it. Most people will never get rid of an addiction by themselves.
---
There were major balance issues early on in terms of crowd control. PvP could get very "un-fun" if you were just being locked down 100-0%. Adding the PvP trinkets in 1.4 or 1.5 helped a lot in terms of allowing people to have a chance to actually fight back.

I am not proving anything, just stating you can't speak for all of the community. Gaming and enjoying it is subjective, what people feel good or love is subjective. You can't make a statement and say some change would make the experience for everybody factually better just because your subjective experience says so. Sorry to inform you but you still can't speak for the whole community.
---
Your mom’s the prettiest zone.
---
That's not going to affect server stability though, that's all handled locally.
---
Yea thanks man, the whole everyone is gonna go rogue thing is kinda scary i guess
---
It's a very fair point. However the warrior idea keeps tempting me, and I'm definitely not going to be the first to 60 or doing any world firsts.
---
This one.
---
I think another issue I had was just *HOW MANY MOBS THERE WERE*.
---
Ask him to take out his helmet then :p
---
It was removed from WoW. Just not till after classic.
---
I think you’re missing my entire point to this thread. 
---
The only thing I’m trying to get across is just as you have the rightful choice to play whatever spec you choose - any raid leader also has the right to tell you to pound sand because you want to try and do negative dps on your ret paladin. 
---
You are not entitled to anything. Even with a meta spec and ESPECIALLY in a non meta spec. 
---
My biggest issue is people are getting upset that they are treated as a less than desirable raid member when they actively choose to play a less than desirable spec. 
---
How fucking dense can you be?
---
But thats my plan for classic
---
I remember dueling a tank in my guild with these on in ironforge. Using the pillar next to the bank to start the duel. I would auto attack while i was naked until it procced and use the elixir of giant growth to make myself massive and show off in front of people....
---
One of the better content creators. Not an obnoxious loud mouth like some others.
---
Oh I concur, it definitely wouldn't be the same if there was a retail WOTLK expansion - Partly the reason why WOTLK private servers get stale FAST. 
---
Release WOTLK was awesome, but that doesn't mean it aged well looking back on it.
---
Please God no... the world started dying in TBC with flying, Wotlk officially killed it. Would just happen all over again.
---
Design new content with the classic philosophy in mind. Theres no reason to make the same mistakes againm
---
Eos propsbly wont drop until the phase with BWL since its part of benediction
---
dun morogh, loch modan, ashenvale
---
Vagina: An 80% approval rating since 40,000 BC
---
Ah so there dps is just awful for raiding full stop and isnt viable? they just look cool but rogues are my main sort of, but i havent ever healed at all.
---
And get everyone sick? My coworkers all but push me out the door when I try to work when I'm sick.
---
Hate people talking about world first as if its a thing...
---
These world first things happened 15 years ago. Cmon...
---
bought an apartement and my planed moving schedule is last week in august. put in 2 weeks vacation to move and get settled, start at the 22 to move as quickly as possible nd get everythinf set up before the 27/28
---
now i suddenly and unexpected have about 10days vacation leff and nothing to do....
---
odd..
---
Has anyone got this in 3840x1920 to cover two monitors?
---
I'm going to kite Anachronos to Orgrimmar again
---
How will that work with honor system? Cross realm bgs but rank is still based on your realm standing?
---
It really is because you can't right click it to remove it.
---
This guy gets it
---
Aw jeez Rick there's no mana left aw jeez.
---
We all know the helmet is actually part of his head now he can’t take it off!
---
If spell batching is the hill you’re choosing to die on, have fun. It’s essentially a bug. Cheers man, just goes to show that the community isn’t always right, even if they get their way.
---
WoD and Cata was just as bad as BFA imo. Legion was worse than MoP aswell, don't understand the hype about Legion at all.
---
Everyone's going warrior and mage too. 
---
Yet somehow I always lack a tank or a mage for groups in pservers :p
---
No idea but you can try on their webpage!
---
Yeah I dont understand DHKs. On a pvp server you should be encouraged to always be at war with the other faction and every kill helps your faction stay ahead. On a pve server there isnt really an incentive to kill someone lower level so it shouldnt be such a huge problem
---
I saw the other day someone posting this wallpaper and I just wanted to update it to fit in newer monitors. Posting here in case somebody wants it.
---
 [https://ibb.co/2SGn1NT](https://ibb.co/2SGn1NT)
---
I see what you're saying.
---
PvE ranks:
---
1 - Neutral
---
2 - Friendly
---
3 - Honored.
---
PvP ranks:
---
1 - Scout
---
2 - Grunt
---
3 - Sergeant
---
Yeah, that's why I'm doing 5/5 in crit before going down arms.
---
Ill, contagious people should stay home. The net work done will be higher than a sick person coming in and getting everyone else sick.
---
It’s fantastic
---
For whatever reason I could never enjoy mulgore. It always seemed so boring
---
I leveled with my pvp turned on cause I liked that part of the game. The unknown and the risk. I got into lots of little skirmishes and stuff. But I always felt like the minority on my server
---
Wrong. Soulstring has much less DPS. You’re linking to an outdated pserver database that uses TBC stats on a lot of items inclusing Soulstring. Look the items up on itemization.info to see their stats on a given patch.
---
That's fine then. But if you call in for a "bad headache" but somehow are able to play WoW for 8-12 hours.. That's a dupe.
---
Personally, I don't think staying home for a "bad cold" is a thing. You dont just call in sick at the most minor inconvenience when you aren't 100%
---
I’ve always loved Dun Morogh
---
Question here, what is the real dps of hybrids if you include the buffs they give? I've heard people say they were still brought to raids because of their utility. As much as 4-5 shamans/paladins and 3-4 druids.
---
I really don't know if you're trolling or just a retard. Either way it's impressive.
---
You're right, Soulstring is clearly superior to  Ashjre'thul but since you're in Naxx I'd wait on the Slavemaker which is BIS.
---
Just play a Paladin if you want OSRS combat in WoW Classic.
---
Thanks man, must what I was looking for!
---
Spells skills and abilities that show an effect to everyone impact everyone. That's why we have an option for raid gfx changes specific for when in raid groups
---
 LI think it's pretty fair to say there is a lot more of that happening now than on classic in terms of said effects
---
&gt; So he sheeps the target, nova right after cast goes off and the target is then frozen and stuck in sheep. This just seems way off.
---
This is possible on retail aswell btw, it has nothing to do with spell batching. CC is just immune the first 0.1 seconds or so. If this wasn' how it worked in vanilla, you should submit it as a bug.
---
Pali should be. “Will never be able to do any endgame content as anything but holy pally but pvp is good”
---
!remindme 90 days
---
Well I think you got your answer lol
---
Ouro gun is only good if you don’t have Ashjre’Thul by the time you get to AQ and get it to drop, which can happen.
---
My guy, you are one knowledgeable person, thank you very much! Could I perhaps swap the Superior Agility (Gloves) with Enchant Gloves - Greater Agility instead and Weapon Agility (OH) with the crusader one? And how much would this cost in the grand scheme of things?
---
So I can pretty do what every I want if I’m addicted “ it’s not my fault, I have an addiction”?
---
Something about there not being much going on in azshara is part of it's charm I think. Barely any questing, and a world boss. It just has this sort of abandonedporn beautiful and ancient and mysterious sort of vibe to it. I hate how the expansions treated it. It always seemed to have so much hidden historical significance to it.
---
 I  figured it was going to get an old God, well of eternity, themed raid at some point. Something comparable to ulduar mixed with serpentshrine cavern: plunging into the shattered depths and battling the Naga, queen azshara, and N'zoth. 
---
Instead they turned it into a goofy goblin city. What a waste.
---
Definitely neither if you think that MC will be cleared faster than 2 months closer to 3 then you definitely are trolling or are retarded
---
I didn't choose anything. That was part of vanilla, that will be part of Classic. Case closed.
---
Just you existing is doing enough harm don't worry
---
its supposed to be 200ms in vanilla, comfirmed in blue posts
---
Let's be honest, people are going to use other search terms if they want to look at porn.
---
Hey man I can play for 14 hours a day if I want.  Just because you can't manage your life doesn't mean I can't manage mine.
---
&gt;You were fine for example with a hunter getting an Ashkandi instead of the warriors ?
---
Yes, we were completely fine with that. Ashkandi is a great Item for some Hunters, why shouldn't they have the chance to compete for it?
---
&gt;You didn't even gear the MT first ?
---
Not via rules in the DKP system, no. But as I said, equipping our MTs was something the entire guild participated in. We donated tons of materials, Repair-Gold, and people actually stepped down from needing items if it meant an upgrade for the Tanks. There were no rules set, but people did it anyway.
---
&gt;Do you remember the cost of the items (you said 50 DKP for set items, but not the rest).
---
IIRC, and bear in mind this is a long time ago, it was 60 for weapons, 50 for sets and either 35 or 40 for everything else (I can't really remember).
---
&gt;can you go negative DKP or if you don't have enough you can't roll on an item ?
---
No negative DKP. If no one could afford an item, it went free-for-all.
---
I have had my share of vices. It is as simple as he said for most. Only the most extreme on the spectrum have low enough will power to be completely absorbed beyond self control.
---
You speak of an extreme minority and rarity as if that's the baseline. Please don't enable people. Learn about the topic and speak on it in a cogent manner.
---
What I mean is that going to a group of 5 doesn't nerf your xp so much more than a group of 3.
---
So why make a group of 3 or 4 when you can make it 5.
---
indeed. thankx for the info!
---
so id call it still a viable upgrade to Ashjre'thul yet significantly worse than nerubian.
---
LOL my friends and I did this back in the day. Dwarves only, gnomes were allowed though. I would so join this guild until raiding.
---
Proper hunters farm Doomshot for their xbows in phase 1 /s
---
The blue rank 9 armor has +stam, +stg, +into, and spell dmg/healing on all pieces except gloves. I think gloves have judgement dmg on them.
---
The epic rank 13 armor has what you want. Same 3 stats, but this time all of it (minus gloves) +1% crit. Gloves have the same judgement dmg. Rest of armor has spell dmg/heal, crit, and mp5. 
---
The set bonuses are the same for both sets. I think they're spell dmg and crit rating. I dont know what the 2set bonus is.
---
No, you're not mistaken. You can't tame an animal higher level than yourself. But what makes you think that was being attempted. Both the bear and the nelf are level 11 in the series of screen shots shown.
---
Yes, a high end engineering trinket teleports you to gadgetzan in silithus, or to a point in silithus high enough in the air to get you killed.  One or the other lol
---
The Dark Elf is pissed that the healer is posing for the camera and the mage is checkin out dat ass instead of helping fight.
---
Then tank it yourself if you want tank gear. Or keep trying -- I have always managed to throw together a DPS set as a tank via only rolling if nobody else wants it, and I'd be waiting for up to 3 people to not need it instead of one.
---
You're concerned about your own time investment, but what about the tank that courteously ACTUALLY plays the in-demand role, runs an hour long 5 man that they may not finish if the group isn't up to par, only to have some guy need on his gear out of nowhere?
---
Some people being greedy assholes towards you isn't a license to be a greedy asshole towards others.
---
&gt;40-45ish isn't that bad b/c you just got a mount
---
I wouldn't expect to have enough money for a mount at 40 on a fresh economy.
---
No, I don't believe you do work with addiction. Your verbiage is straight out of the nineties and lacks and real insight into the topic.
---
Either that or you are ancillary to the process and are playing armchair psychologist.
---
Ah thanks my dude.
---
Say whatever you wish about Silithus, but I find it gorgeous.
---
So a 1% difference.
---
So DM pathing exploits for farming gold should be part of classic too, right?
---
Now you are just being silly. It's clear to me you don't know the first thing about real addiction.
---
Number one is pretty true.  There is nothing worse than being the fella bringing the R-Tard along to all of the adventures.  Eventually people stop inviting you as well.
---
If there's content you cannot clear because of a few off specs in a 40 man raid it's because your group sucks not because of the off specs.
---
Bro that was HYPE
---
You sound like a loser
---
Well I want my character to look like how I intended for other players as well.
---
Light leather vendors for 3s a stack, it’s not bad. However lw makes more money paired with skinning if you know what to do.
---
A vice isn't a serious addiction. A vice doesn't take over your life.
---
Im not enabling, you are downplaying how serious it can be. And I know, I'm taking it to the extreme. That's because those are the people I work with. I see this every day.
---
Interesting. I noticed this as well. I noticed in my WoW folder the "Beta" files were still there, but the option was gone and I was wondering what was going on. I get why they did it, but a post about it would have been nice to have. It's probably a minor thing, but having an option just disappear from the launcher without warning is a bit jarring for me, and I was worried that maybe I was now ineligible for future Stress Tests. So a brief post explaining like, hey this is what's going on, would have been nice to have just so no one freaks out about it. Still, good that we know now so thanks for that OP.
---
Sadly Dwarves aren't allowed to be mages in classic (in BFA my mage is a dwarf)
---
Yes. People on low-end specs complained about the weather and asked for a nuclear option instead of just, y'know, personally disabling weather. There are still some zones with weather effects in retail, but it isn't nearly as nice as the Vanilla stuff.
---
Ohh you, with the personal insults.
---
That's the thing. I don't want a daily routine placed before me. Let players figure out their own grinds.
---
Wonder how many rolled Paladin for that sweet their 2 set
---
Given the surprisingly low difficulty, I'd say this is a much more feasible way of playing than people were expecting.
---
It's those understated ambient pieces that stand out the most to me.
---
And now you’re deflecting.
---
To say choice isn’t a big part of fixing an addiction is fucking ridiculous, if you don’t choose to be better you will never get the help you need. It starts with you because if it didn’t then you will never get better.
---
Nice!
---
Fury feels real bad until you get to blood craze and enrage. I leveled a warrior to 20 going fury and then said screw it and started a second warrior as arms- that went much better. Rend ends up being a lot of your damage early on, and imp rend makes it even better. Tactical mastery is a must have because there are times when you need to camp out in defensive stance while you fish for overpowers on a dicey encounter.
---
That being said, if you're leveling with a healer friend then disregard that and play whatever.
---
100% could not agree more, I feel at peace when I visit this place! Take my upvote!!
---
I know I'm going to get shit for this (I'm a pvper) but; https://i.imgur.com/PLzUjhl.png
---
I feel loot fantasy is part of what made end-game vanilla fun for me (and what lacks now). I played hunter in vanilla and now I'm thinking rogue or warlock. Which class gets you more excited for that next upgrade, or makes you drool like I used to drool over Ashjre'thul?
---
I found Borean Tundra to be pretty breathtaking the first time visited.
---
Also a lot of the reason to bring hybrids is for their utility.  For example, an enhancement shaman in a melee group can twist totems to increase the dps of the 4 other party members and/or reduce their threat generation, while swinging Nightfall to increase caster dps too.  The total raidwide dps brought by that shaman simply isn't immediately apparent when looking at personal damage.
---
I hope so. I still have a jump macro from vanilla that gets you to the tippy top of the mount hyjal zone.
---
That dude sounds exactly like keemstar to me
---
I don't disagree that EQ had flaws, but the things you listed are kind of a personal preference thing.
---
I'm not sure *exactly* what you mean by bottlenecking, but I'm assuming you mean stuff like the 4-7 day respawn fights required for epics and such. It was really just the nature of the game, some rewards were reserved for the most hardcore players. WoW had similar stuff, but I'd take EQ's super involved epic quests that everyone could put work into over something like "get lucky and loot two bindings of the windseeker." Bottlenecks filtered the undeserving. They also removed a few of them over time.
---
The death penalty in EQ never felt bad to me. It was just another construct that fueled social interactions. Some classes could resurrect you and restore most of your lost experience, and a lot of people have stories of having a full raid wipe in a place like Plane of Fear and having to ask another whole raid gear to come help recover corpses. That stuff was pretty cool, imo. It also made the game feel a lot more dangerous and restrictive, but in a good way. When you came out of a situation that looked like certain death the excitement was just that much greater. Games like WoW actually feel weird to me when there's no penalty to losing/dying. 
---
No instanced raid content I can understand. The technology wasn't there yet in 1999, and EQ actually had instanced raids before WoW even released. It's kind of like saying that EQ was bad because most people had dial-up at the time. Not really the game's fault.
---
There's still problems with instancing though. It doesn't allow for guild to guild interaction like I mentioned above. It removes meaningful PvE competition from the game. It funnels way more rewards into the game and having the best gear on the server is a lot less meaningful when everyone else has it too. It also doesn't make much sense from a realism standpoint. There's advantages too of course, so there can never really be a definitive answer to the instancing vs. no instancing debate.
---
Just remember that in certain situations fun ≠ balance. Classic WoW was unbalanced as fuck but also soooo fun anyways.
---
I am sorry to inform you but any of the stuff that was in Vanilla and therefore is coming to Classic is not chosen or created by me. I wasn't a part of dev them then, not a part of dev team now. All i can say is that don't play the game you don't like or feel it haves too many problems. Let the people who don't find those things as problematic as you enjoy the game.
---
Dude, world firsts in Classic will be a big deal. Not because the pve content is hard or anythibg but because the competition is hard.
---
Do not add co-workers to your social life in any way. There, done. They are your co-workers, not your friends. You can be friendly, sure, but don't mistake them for being actual friends.
---
Well you are in the minority opinion.
---
&gt;Courteously ACTUALLY plays the in-demand role
---
I suppose i should mention I'm the healer.
---
I mean, then don't roll shaman. No one is going to want you unless you're resto, so you're going to have to look pretty hard. No "good guild" especially
---
Warriors are 25% of a raid group also, that's actually the correct % to have, other classes are incorrectly represented based on how many you need.
---
“And here we have Human Priest Metzgro. He looks entirely lost. Fighting mobs 6 levels lower than him, absolutely pointless. And now he’s dancing. And crying. Someone check on this guy IRL.”
---
Hahaha sick days and days off working in a restaurant... ;-;
---
Shaman the is probably my single favorite set in all of wow to date.
---
The batch window is 0-400ms, I tested this on the last stress test with an addon: [https://streamable.com/vvcrr](https://streamable.com/vvcrr)never went above 400ms, on average 200ms.
---
I do agree that the window is too large for this day and age, all mechanics would still be present if they reduced it to say 250 or 300ms, but it would feel a lot less clunky.
---
Well believe what ever you want. This is the reality of many addicts, it's not an active choice, it's an evolving choice that takes over lives without the concent of the user.
---
It's easy to go personal when you got no other arguments.
---
I loved uldum
---
This character always made me wonder why Undead couldn't be Hunters. We got them eventually though :)
---
Uldum
---
I would
---
Ironically not really i think the guy that made that joke thought i was talking about shockadin not spelladin
---
Question: will an Imp phase shifted aggro things on its journey to reunite with the warlock?
---
Came here to say this, uldum was my fav
---
He just likes the look.
---
It's fine. Like I said,  you're colleagues, not BFF. If he comes into work every day expecting that everyone likes him, that's his problem.
---
How does playing an off spec make you a greedy narcissist??
---
I didn't say choice wasn't a big part. I said most people don't actively chooses to be an addict.
---
There's a big difference mate
---
Perfection
---
yes.
---
Ah right, forgot its using the retail bits for that.
---
Maybe it would've been fun to watch if the guy didn't talk like a damn 13 year old.
---
Mulgore is great, and there are so many zones that could be a favorite. I think I’d go with teldrassil. The “twlight forest” look is so good, they kind of reuse for darkshore, ashenvale and even feralas.
---
Man that's such a low brow move to lie to people about friend requests.
---
That strafe bug is so annoying. Hope they fix it.
---
It's a 9% difference actually. 14% on Classic, 5% on Pservers
---
Depends on the mood but if I had to pick somewhere to stay, it'd be STV
---
Shadowmoon Valley in TBC
---
No shit, I never said addiction is a choice. I said it’s a choice to stop being addicted.
---
Teldrassil, Ashenvale. It just captures night elven mystery so well
---
You do You. I do me. BC to me had the Best of both worlds where theres room for both
---
the game was made 15 years ago bro.
---
You crybabies made your bed, now you get to sleep in it.
---
&gt;but there are tons of people who haven't learned yet.
---
That's the exact hypocritical, better-than-thou mindset I was talking about.
---
People can be gaming maniacs without having an addiction. The problem here is perception: People who overcame a personal crisis, tend to see one in everyone else. Not because they actually want to help, but because they want to feel better about themselves.
---
And let's say someone actually has an addiction: What makes you think everyone who has an addiction CAN learn from such an example? Some people can't. Some people may need professional help. To them, this _"I just pulled myself up by my own bootstraps and YOU CAN DO IT TOO!"_ - bullshit is not just worthless, it's outright dangerous. The same in reverse would also be true: People who had outside help trying to push everyone to a psychiatrist.
---
Bottom line:  
---
Overcoming a personal crisis doesn't mean you suddenly walk on water. It means you fell into a hole to begin with, and that means, you are not in a position to tell anyone what to do. The guy who fell into a hole, is not the guy one should ask how to avoid holes.
---
While I agree and would prefer the crossrealm bgs not to be a thing, as it takes away a large portion of server rivalry, I can see a few benefits from it. A lot of organised wintrading will be made more difficult or inconvenient for high ranked PvPers, and running into a more balanced pug team when you pug yourself is higher. 
---
Blizzard is in their rights to do it as it was in classic (albeit at the end). And it seems most of the community are cool with it too, sadly. I'll accept it.
---
Yeah bullshitting people in your social life is kind of fucked. Just be straight with others. They'll respect you more than the flimsy lies you throw out.
---
Dude, give it a rest. I've got coworkers wanting to add me on Facebook and Instagram and whatnot, but that shit's not for work. I'll accept their LinkedIn invites, sure, but after 5 PM? Fuck off, Im going home. It's got nothing to do with frayed feelings or awkwardness. You go to work to make money to live, not to please whoever else works there.
---
How has no one mentioned Red Ridge?!
---
~~Ashenvale or Mulgore~~JKDESOLACE
---
If spell batching was fixed would you still play classic?
---
Thanks a lot for this detailed answer, I think I can recreate your system now \^\^
---
&gt;Yes, we were completely fine with that. Ashkandi is a great Item for some Hunters, why shouldn't they have the chance to compete for it?
---
I'm saying this as someone that is considering maining a hunter in classic but while Ashkandi is great for PVP hunters it is by no mean game changing, compared to a warrior who rely entirely on its melee weapon to do damage.
---
I would have no problem with a loot system that reserve first 2 handers for melees, daggers for rogues, ranged for hunters etc
---
While I'd rather keep peace (and my reputation ;-) and don't roll on Ashkandi in front of the warriors, I'm sure some would and that could create some internal conflicts that could lead to the guild breaking.
---
Greater Agility (Gloves) is found at the Trainer, so yeah, most enchanters should have it.
---
Crusader is going to be rough. The formula only has a 0.5% drop rate off a few mobs in Western and Eastern Plaguelands. They're heavily farmed because of this.
---
Not only is the Formula rare, but the Righteous Orbs only drop from mobs in Stratholme with a 5% drop rate. They're expensive.
---
Getting all these enchants is certainly possible in 2 months, but it'll probably cost you as much as your epic mount.
---
Can not compete with Loch Modan ✌️
---
I agree with you, however I think it hardly has any impact on the game/pvp.
---
However I’ve heard people saying that it would be more difficult to progress through the pvp ranks because of cross realms bg but I don’t understand why, if anyone could explain me I’d be grateful lol
---
Naw it's Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Keychain
---
I liked the death penalty, the consequence of failure, and how the world felt dangerous for even small mistakes.
---
Bottlenecking I'm referring to camps.  There were, and are in P99, very few cash camps, or good leveling camps, and often you find yourself sitting around and waiting for hours and hours just to play.  It breeds a play style where when you obtain a camp you play for 16-24 hours straight because you are likely not to get it again.  I'm okay with epic quest bottle necks, or rare mob spawns.  Non-instanced dungeons are great for that.  But the camps and the difficulty of finding areas to level meant a great deal of your play time was spent sitting and waiting while accomplishing nothing.  
---
Non-instanced raids lead to BatPhone situations where it's a matter of who can mobilize the fastest.  I enjoy rarity, but I don't like the idea of mechanics that force players to almost literally give up their lives to achieve it.
---
A different take, but in a lot of e-sports that came after SC2, it seems the meta is to have shoutcasters or play-by-play casters that literally just repeat what is happening on screen.. but in a yelling tone and fast.
---
I totally understand this comes from sports, and people shouting what's happening fast can get crowd hyped etc... but I miss the SC2 commentators like Day9, artosis, tasteless.. where you could be hype when needed, but be funny and just generally enjoyable when not needed.. rather than hype 24/7 at even mundane points. The chemistry with the sc2 pros and commentators was very tight knit and gave a really good feeling when watching games, getting lots of laughs, and enjoying the action.
---
I already can see with my own eyes what is happening on the screen, I don't need to be told what's happening, but would rather interesting _additional_ dialogue / play-by-play that isn't so surface level as just what blanket what is happening.
---
I know this is some "remember the old times" meme... but we're all boomers here in classic wow. Just felt like I'd rant a bit about the current meta of e-sports casting.
---
Had a gnome rogue with noggenfogger on our server named Trubbs, fuck that guy!
---
When I set up UBRS groups I did so because I didn't want to invite other priests, because I only wanted the robe. That's why I'd fill the second healer spot with a shaman or druid instead.
---
I regret playing on Pservers, I have only gotten to around lvl 30ish so I still have lots of content to discover but still kind of dissapointed in myself.
---
Naah, wow classic was made 15 years ago. Today they are trying to jam a 15 year old world into a newer engine/game. It's not the same mate.
---
Nope. I won't be going either 2 hour queues or literally losing 100% of bg's just because the other faction just decided not to play on my server.
---
Shared bg's is vanilla. Doesn't matter if it is 1.12 only. I mean, Naxx is 1.12 only. Should we take it out because it wasn't there more time?
---
I'm on mobile, does this tip still work? I see other subreddit emblems? It's weird...
---
I think blizzard fixed every unintended dmg scaling from spellpower by patch 1.12. But who knows, people are very creative as shown on private servers. Maybe some new things will come up, could be cool.
---
You are saying you don't have time to search for/build a group that is alright with your want to collect a set of gear that isn't meta.  But then you are willing to waste the time of other group members by taking gear that they are hunting for.
---
 Hypocrisy at its finest.
---
That spec is atrocious for PvP. No improved hamstring and if you were ever going to put points in Prot for PvP you’d need to max out Iron Will. Otherwise, you’re just severely gimped in PvE and PvP.
---
Cross faction wholesome
---
That it is, but most people can't just stop. That's my point. Most addicts need help and guidance to stop the addiction.
---
Same, we should totally create a guild called Dad Bod Squad! We know our family life will more that likely cause us to raid much especially past BWL even though internally we want to be hardcore.
---
I have heard this repeated often but I have never found anything behind it on further investigation. To my mind, improved rend is clearly better per point than cruelty for any reasonable level of gearing (if you start clipping your first rend due to ridiculous dps that may change). Fury has a huge amount of dead space in tiers 2 and 3 because their second meaningful damage talent is nonexistent: unbridled wrath on a 3.0 speed 2 hander (which is FAST for a 2 hander) is going to give you .13 rage per second that you are actively beating on someone with your axe.
---
That's about the same rage as if you went improved charge (which no one does at arms), and charged every ~23 seconds... but that assumes you are ALWAYS hitting something with unbridled wrath, never eating, never bandaging, never looting, just always swinging your relatively fast 2 hander. 
---
So basically, as soon as you hit level 19, you are already in such a huge hole it's almost impossible to dig your way out of, in terms of total value of talent points, fury vs arms.... unless you are serious about pvp.... in which case booming voice would not be useless but tactical mastery would be absolutely essential. 
---
Meanwhile, arms is getting real value from 20 to 30, like deep wounds/anger management/impale/improved overpower. 
---
Sure, fury is also getting cool stuff, but I really don't think it competes with straight arms. Blood craze has poor synergy with hamstring kiting, as does enrage. I feel piercing howl is completely unnecessary as simply dropping into defensive stance and running away with your shield out has almost always served me well enough. So until you get to level 30, I don't see how fury can possibly compete with arms for solo leveling at least. Maybe it's different for group play simply because your improved shouts are more relevant. 
---
dungeons may be different, as rend struggles in dungeons and
---
Enhancement leveling is so much fun, ganking with wf crits is satisfying as fck. Raid in resto and save some enh gear for pvp and get ragnaros hammer. U will have the best vanilla exp.
---
Well it doesn't really matter because cross realm bgs we're in 1.12 and no changes is no changes
---
No changes. Give us cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Ok. 
---
Anyway, supply and demand. Supply-side dictates terms where there is high demand. Get rekt chump
---
Are you just trying to get negitive karma? Why keep responding?
---
Its GRRRRREAT
---
CRZ?
---
Its still fucking bs, competition or not. Everyone knows exactly what they get and how to get it wich make it not world first in any possible way.
---
You have to be in a very casual guild for someone to let you purposely bring a bad spec to a raid.
---
We still don't know the proc rate of Ironfoe.
---
And at 2.4 speed, you feel very lonely when you miss once or twice while your DPS are happily sending everything they have \^\^
---
r/mildlypenis
---
Firm delusions. Stomping your feet, covering your ears and screaming about it won’t change the fact those of us who did play vanilla wow know the truth!!! Cringe away
---
Without cross realm BGs:
---
1. Queue times will be much longer and might not pop at all during certain hours depending on server size.
---
2. Premades will easily be able to dodge each other and farm PUGs until they quit, leading to even worse queue times.
---
Yikes that sounds awful.
---
I love how simultaneously patronizing but ignorant this response is. 
---
It's obvious you both read and failed to comprehend what I wrote. Your counterpoint to my "Classic is more than raiding," was... "but muh raiding."
---
Perfect.  10/10.
---
You don't even understand a single thing about people's preference for Classic. You don't care to understand it. And with once of the most amazing examples of projection I've ever seen on the subject... suggested that people who disagree with you are the ones in a bubble.
---
It's not that I don't understand your criticism. It's just vapid and one dimensional... and if I'm being totally honest... a bit of a meme at this point. 
---
Thanks for dropping by, lol.
---
Keith also did some work for Blizzard on Diablo 2 promotional stuff. Such a great talent taken too soon. RIP.
---
Yeah, like I said, I love the situations that non-instanced content creates, like exploring a massive sprawling dungeon and coming across another group of adventurers or competing with a rival guild head-to-head on downing a dragon. But there's definitely downsides too. I wish there was an easy answer, but there really isn't. No matter which system you go with there's going to be a bunch of positives and a bunch of negatives. That's why I'd like to see newer MMOs go with a healthy mix of instanced and non-instanced content, but the trend is to make a stand and go either 100% one or the other.
---
Exactly, the new zones are just annoying to travel through and literally make me want to stop playing.
---
That is another thing I do not get. Say you do 0 DPS and 0 HPS, but you do bring a buff that buffs 20 DPS characters by 10%, then you in fact do the DPS of nearly two DPS players, despite doing no DPS.
---
I do know what your saying, the problem here is that you don’t know what it is I am saying, and you don’t know what you’re talking about. 
---
Are character transfers free on retail?
---
Pog
---
What's strange is i didn't see it once when playing the stress test Wednesday. Everybody was too fixated on above mentioned weapon. Or LFM for raid on the bosses Blizz kept dropping in SW keep (and the horde equivalent I assume).
---
Anyway I did not wanna be known as the guy that brought anal back so I minded my business 😂
---
Gadgetzam is in Tanaris. Silithus is on the other side of Un'goro Crater.
---
I cringed.
---
&gt; want to join a streamer community 
---
You are the *worst.*
---
Teldrassil for me.
---
Sorry for bothering you with more questions, but can the mats for all these enchants be bought off the AH or do I have to kill mobs for them myself? Thank you so much btw! :)
---
People were routinely kicking the healer before the last boss(es), in an era where a poor group might not be able to make it through the dungeon? Not too sure about that.
---
Regardless, tanks have always been far more in demand. If anything, it lends more credibility to the argument you should be setting up your own groups instead of being greedy.
---
Teldrassil is the only correct answer here
---
Warlock is great. Dont forget to do the class quest that gives you that awesome looking weapon.
---
What the fuck are you getting at? Blizzard put this classic team in place.
---
&gt; Classic might be the most casual friendly version of wow.
---
Have you ever played classic WoW? or have you just been watching a little too much Asmongold?
---
Retail WoW is the result of Blizzard catering to casual players... Which just destroys your entire argument. If Classic WoW was the most casual friendly version of the game, there wouldnt have been numerous revamps of the entire class/talent systems to literally CATER TO CASUALS.
---
Your talking about a game that came out 15 years ago. You think 12 year old kids watching pokimanes stream, that werent even alive when the game came out, are the target audience for Classic Wow? Or do you think dedicated WoW players who played the game since Classic are the target audience?
---
Again, your argument is the exact embodiment of what WoW players dont want involved in Classic wow. The game isnt supposed to be a cash grab that is catering to getting NEW players involved. Its literally a free version of the game that you can play if you are subbed.
---
Sometimes you could have a raid coverage or battlegrounds.. just random stuff happening around the servers..
---
Interesting I guess
---
Depending on what weapon it is and what other classes are in your group it can be fine.
---
Rolling on a polearm with hunter stats with a hunter in party or on a 2h mace with a enh/ret? Dick move.
---
Rolling on a 2h sword when you're the only one who can equip it? Fine.
---
Or storm peaks in my opinion!
---
The general difficulty level, man. Pulling a few mobs is dangerous, having to eat/drink, having to CC in dungeons... ETC.
---
Winterspring or ashenvale for me
---
I just mastered it manually with hundreds of hours of practice on my level 27 human rogue :\^)
---
I’m not sure either tbh.. maybe because it will be harder to do things like win trading and such? I’ve no idea
---
Azshara and the Shimmering Flats.
---
Azshara really captivates the feel of an untamed, enchanted forest. The fact that I’m on the side which intends to conquer it, plunder its resources and fill it with the scream of dying Night Elves doesn’t make it less beutiful.
---
The Shimmering flats are just calming. Only the wast desert on the horizon, quests that require you to grind the fauna for quite a while and really relaxing music with the occassional WPvP to make it interesting yet not bothersome like STVietnam.
---
&gt;While Cross Realm Battlegrounds are technically Vanilla they were released in 1.12 so they were NOT around for the majority of Vanilla.
---
By that logic, Windfury nerfs should go away, as with the rogue talent tree changes, and anything that came in after an arbitrary  patch release.
---
&gt;We all don't like the direction that subsequent expansions have taken in World of Warcraft
---
Irrelevant to vanilla mechanics and game features. 
---
&gt;Players wanted to instantly be able to run a dungeon with less effort. Blizzard implemented LFG and meeting stones that could summon.
---
Irrelevant to vanilla, aside being a huge generalization.
---
&gt;Blizzard implemented LFR so now you can instantly queue. Players wanted to be able to transport to anywhere in the world easily.
---
Has nothing to do with why Battlegroups were added.  This is different that full blown cross realm battlegrounds.  Unlike modern wow, you could only enter BG's with other players if those regional servers were in the same battlegroup.  They were added because on most servers wait times made the game unplayable. &gt;2 hour queue times depending on your faction is totally unacceptable.
---
&gt; If your faction is dominating on a server there should be a reason you don't have many queues, you literally aren't allowing the enemy faction to level up.
---
Yes, that was the idea. A literal war between the factions -- because shared resources in the world (farm spots, mining veins, black lotus, devilsaurs, etc.) were very limited and pvp servers. The intended solution was domination and pvp, and to the victor goes the spoils.  
---
&gt; Don't support Cross Realm Battlegrounds just because you are afraid of a queue time
---
Ok, So I will continue to support them because I experienced those horrific queue times first hand was I was a teenager, and I saw queue times getting cut down to a mere 15 minutes as a huge win.
---
&gt;Don't give it up.
---
Great, I will continue to root for blizzard implementing this 1.12 game feature that existed in vanilla which follows their seemingly set rule of "if it exists, you're getting the 1.12 version".
---
No it doesn't, but it means you possibly leaned something that could help others, with the same issues. 
---
For crying out loud, if we didn't learn from our mistakes and pass on knowledge, we wouldn't be here today. We wouldn't have this convo. 
---
If you aren't an addict you aren't an addict, I agree. You can play alot and not have an addiction or you can have an addiction without knowing it. Nobody will know if you don't explore it. But shutting yourself off from eveone who has experienced something harsh, because you don't wanna listen to their "I know better talk" is silly. You can possibly learn from these people. But not with that attitude.
---
This isnt a 1:1 Vanilla 2004-2007 recreation. It's almost like joining a fresh server in 2006, but with AQ and Naxx locked
---
can you stop spamming this board with your shitty clipped videos
---
I don't see why me rolling against the tank for gear is amy different than a caster rolling on my gear, or two dps rolling against each other for gear.
---
It's not like I'm not going to use it. It's not like i want it for transmog or flexing. I'm running a character that would serve a group better by healing than tanking at the beginning stages of endgame. I'm playing a role i don't want to play to get gear in order to play the spec i do want to play.
---
You can be salty and mad about it all you like. I'm playing my role same as anyone else here. Try to spin it, twist it, shape it however you like. Your argument is literally the reason why i don't tell people what i'm after. You're not entitled to *anything* just because you're a tank any more than i am for playing a healer.
---
What level does the quest become available?
---
I have to agree, I'm typically a "no changes" guy but BGs can be impossible without cross realm players
---
Hey, do you mind if I message you when MC is cleared ? I really want to hear you reaction about it
---
 But they’re going to be at work. How can they see you in game when you’ve called in sick and they didn’t
---
It's a scheduling app on my phone that the company uses. It used to be called fruit but I think it's just called schedules now
---
Yes i would. Wanting the game to stay as authentic it can be doesn't mean it would make it unplayable if changes were made. Though changes can and will affect how much i enjoy the game. The threshold where changes are too much for me to not wanting to play at all is pretty high. Mostly because there isn't any other MMO that i could play. In retail the threshold was reached after Legion. Atm i really wait that i can go back to the old Azeroth with all its problems so i can finally enjoy MMOs again.
---
Not sure, think i obtained it lvl 50s had to do sunken temple for it.
---
Part of the group sucking is because the people with shit specs are not contributing much. :)    
---
In our casual friends and family guild we were carrying 10 people on any give 40 man raid night, and although we were clearing Ragnaros, it took awhile to get to him since we were dragging so much dead weight with us.  Part of the reason they were dead weight is because many of them had green to purple as their upgrade plan, and they felt their spec should be whatever they wanted, rather than what was useful to the raid.
---
For me these are some if not the best armour sets introduced to wow!! Druid T3, rogue T2, paladin T2 and hunter T3.... oh baby!
---
I mean, even a cold is considered contagious if you get your germs somewhere and they touch it. You aren't going to call in for a cold though.
---
Has anyone beaten hunger?
---
While this was funny in it's own way, I don't think I could handle listening to this for 3 hours.
---
&gt; ou mean PvE? Your only damaging spell has a 30 sec CD. I hope that answers your question.
---
You're thinking shockadin. This isn't shockadin.
---
I always go hard for every launch
---
This is why u always name your pet Leeroy, that way they will understand.
---
Warlocks have it a little harder as they cannot use that excuse.
---
... Teleported
---
Seems smart to sell.
---
It would be cool if they started bgs off like that and went to cross realm in phase 6. Same thing with the old av.
---
Nahh I put it in late at night she just didn't get to it. I got verbal approval before I put it in
---
Shaman will be everywhere
---
Start a new account.  You are starting over on Classic anyway.
---
Somewhere to die* hahahah
---
I'm on vacation for the weekend for real. It's out of my hands!
---
Heya Rhena, good job!  
---
Any chance you will update HealComm as a standalone as well?  
---
Cheers!
---
The Shimmering Flats (pre flood) at night is gorgeous.
---
TIL
---
and with each successive expansion, we absolutely cannot separate our lessening feeling of 'that was so challenging boy do I feel accomplished!" from our increasing feeling of "god this dungeon is taking forever let's just pull everything and gogo"
---
at what point did it tip the balance for people?
---
top tier mythics in BFA are challenging. for you and me, they're challenging in the "oh god let's just do it fast and get it over with" way. But for a new player, they very  much find it challenging in the "boy do I feel accomplished!" way
---
Ask for  [awesometographer (u/awesometographer)](https://www.reddit.com/user/awesometographer) he has a discord called Pretty Lame Paladin sheet or something.
---
I think he theorycrafted something cool but I didn't look too much at it since I won't play a Paladin.
---
I probably would to lol
---
Wonder if it has to do with overall latency? IE they are trying to replicate batching like vanilla, but because typically people were running higher latencies, the batches were less intentionally abusable?
---
If I'm not mistaken Horde Warlocks in Classic are Orc and Forsaken. I believe that Trolls Warlocks came in Cata.
---
&gt; I'm sure some would and that could create some internal conflicts that could lead to the guild breaking.
---
True, I'm not denying that...however, I have never seen ANY player-controlled loot distribution system, regardless of how simple or intricate, that didn't carry that risk.
---
Surprisingly though, needing away items that were far more beneficial for another class wasn't that much of an issue. People cared about their reputation, and people cared about the guild.
---
I was surprised myself by this, because when I joined the guild, I had these exact same reservations that you just pointed out.The GM didn't even give a technical explanation why he didn't do reservations, he simply went: "Don't worry about it."
---
And so that's what I did :-)
---
I think it's still one of the most beautiful zones in even current WoW. Vast, beautiful, with it's own identity.
---
Sounds like a badass name. I wouldn't have minded being called that. Teasing couldn't get much worse than I already got as a kid so I wouldn't have minded much.
---
Is it weird I want to say the barrens? It was beautiful to me lol
---
Would be incorrect to change your mind on this.
---
Fun fact to the comments. Spelladin is NOT Shockadin.
---
They're COMPLETLEY different. 30+ points in completely different trees.
---
Yep they removed it.. FeelsBadMan. Was hoping to see it turn into the beta dropdown menu but oh well
---
Whelp my memory sucks then.  In my defense, both places are filled with a desert.  One just has more bugs than the other lol
---
You lack tanks because the real tanks are all in raids and the other warriors are only DPS.
---
No idea for mages, though.
---
Oore reason: he and sylvanas were boning before the scourge it is heavily implied that she brought him back to serve as her right hand man/lover
---
Dude you’ve got issues. You need to learn to
---
Set boundaries with people - they will respect you that way. I have no issues adding people from my work and telling them no if they have a request for me in game that I don’t want to do.
---
I'll try and find a good skinning farm.  There are a ton of high level beasts in vanilla, so any particular spot is less likely to be crowded.
---
I'll sell the stuff once people have gathered enough gold that prices have stabilised.
---
Yes unfortunately saw the same thing last night
---
They'll snag their name on the chosen server first or have a friend snag it so they can assign it later. Or maybe make a deal with blizz to reserve it. I'd be fine with that frankly.
---
"He's rolling on my gear! The greed! The avarice!"
---
That's why i don't tell people what i'm after. I'd rather apologise for rolling against them after the fact than deal with entitlement.
---
Not even close.
---
Because between stress tests 1 &amp; 2 the option stayed there.
---
PServers are incredibly inaccurate as soon as you start dealing with math. They're tuned via guesstimates at best. Hell, Geddon doesn't even pulse aoe damage on the pserver I play on LOL. All but one PServer uses TBC experience calculations (not vanilla). Rage generation for all warriors is hilariously inflated, in-combat spirit regeneration is laughably wrong on most. Just to name a few problems.
---
Ascent spent weeks getting Rag down the first time. This wasn't some random mashup of wow children. Ascent was made up of very committed, experienced, and efficient players from Everquest. They actually had the requisite gear and resistance gear to kill him and it still took weeks. Again, not some random pug, one of the best Everquest guilds at the time.
---
My first character ever (age 11, classic wow) was a Tauren  hunter. The beauty of Mulgore was one of the reasons I fell in love with WoW so much. Started playing again for nastalgia.
---
One thing I learned is to never be too specific when you call in sick unless you're actually going to see the doctor. Usually I go with "I'm not feeling well and would like to take a day off", or "I've accumulated some work fatigue and would like to take the day". Obviously don't do it too much and generally people will be okay with it.
---
I love un'goro

I always enjoyed the Tauren starting zone, nice open spaces for a young cow to hone his skills on the migration to the barrens, and Thunderbluff is my favorite horde city. Which leads me to the barrens, possibly the most iconic leveling area in WoW, the majority of the horde goes through there so there is always plenty of activity. After that you have plenty of options with Ashenvale, Stonetalon, Thousand needles, all enjoyable imo.
---
Undead area is pretty neat for it's own reasons, but Orc/Troll starting area was really boring to me.
---
That being said I'll be going alliance simply to experience different leveling zones since I only ever played horde.
---
Spec is 33/5/13 actually.
---
-1 Charge, -3 Toughness -3 Defiance -1 Imp SB
---
+3 Imp Hamstring, +5 Iron Will
---
I'd assume harder to progress as premades / people trying to wintrade or whatever. Otherwise I don't see why it'd be harder because you've got quicker queues which reward you being able to win in pugs more, and it's easier not to vs the same premade on your server
---
Without cross realm bg, entire servers will die out. It's to easy to dominate one of the factions, and effectively stop the other faction from ever getting anything done.
---
Sure lmfao when MC is cleared send me a message hope this isn't a strictly if it is cleared quickly thing because I can't wait for all of these people that think Vanilla is easy to be in for quite a surprise.
---
Is this subreddit just becoming a circle jerk? Like seriously. Not trying to be an asshole just curious if other people feel the same way. These kinds of posts having been getting more and more common and I just want to see if people just feel the need to upvote these or what their motive is. It's just....this is just a picture of one of the most iconic things in classic. The first thing you see on the box. I mean lots of people who didint plat classic remember this too Just because of how iconic it is. Its like me taking a screenahot of the character select screen with an undead warlock and I make a post on reddit with the title " who remembers these bad boys?" Its just a giant low effort kind of thing. Idk. It bugs me on a lot of levels. If you agree please let me know. But i have a feeling the downvotes are going to prove me wrong.
---
That’s the point I’m trying to make. Spell batching is not a content change, it’s a mechanics fix, so who cares if they fix it? I’m all for blizzard fixing shit that needs to be fixed to make the experience better. Authentic doesn’t have to be identical, see the layering debate.
---
The Aladdin remake doesn’t suck because Jafar’s voice isn’t deep enough, it’s updated and different, still nostalgic and still fantastic. I envision classic wow the same way, update it, make it better, keep the essence the same but fix the bugs/exploits to make the experience better
---
Only weapon with procs x on hit can proc said thing. Can't have bow procing crusader of mele weapon you're wearing, lol.
---
How are people kiting these mobs SOOOOO far from their spawn?
---
Like, how did the big dragon get kited to Stormwind without turning around?
---
And Hogger? How the HELL did Hogger not reset?
---
Ashenvale, best music, ambiance, aesthetic, best map layout, lower mid level quests and end game content, pvp. Perfect
---
For example the quest lines for 0.5 gear will be delayed.
---
I get bad headaches quiet frequently. That's a big favor in what got me into playing wow so much actually
---
Thank you kind sir! I love that more likely for me to obtain T0 set :)
---
You can so, you just don't drink enough lol
---
63 isn't a magic number weapon skill works for all levels.
---
Thanks, appreciated.
---
The thing I wanted to get across in my response, and I am not sure I worded it well, is not that you shouldn't learn from others.
---
My point is, that not every experience is worth learning FROM, and not everyone who thinks he has something to teach is worth listening to. A lot of people think overmuch of themselves, and as I said, especially people who think they overcame some great challenge in their lives, tend towards that mindset.
---
Never invite a hunter.
---
i just asked in our discord about Lionheart Helm and got this reply:
---
## HyltonToday at 9:46 AM
---
No  
---
It’s available from launch
---
No he fucking BoP'd the mage dude, 100% his own damn fault lmao.
---
&gt;Change My Mind
---
Sorry, my mom told me not to lie to people.
---
Well I set a reminder for 1 month after release, if its not cleared by then I will set another until it is ^^
---
No need to.
---
waterfall parts of evelynn forest is my favorite
---
I seem to have lost mine too, but on my desktop I have a shortcut to the WoW Classic Beta and my launcher seems to be completely re-installing WoW. Did this happen to you as well?
---
It's not mine, I just talk too much there. Others have done all the heavy lifting, I just want to play with the spec.
---
We wanted 1.12 #nochanges. We asked for it for over a year after the announcement. I think it's fine that we're getting just that.
---
Fucking truth.
---
I literally just say "I'm taking a sick day."
---
As a person who played in the time before cross realm BGs I can say that it sucked I remember waiting hours in the queue we ended up raiding OG and ganking the starting zones out of frustration which was fun but I wanted rank 14 so yeah.
---
Eh it's not always the best to do stuff like PvP with friends.
---
I had a similar experience where me and my lifelong buddy were stuck floundering at around 1700-1750 we just couldn't get a grove going win arena's ever.
---
Then one week I couldn't show up and he went and found a new partner and in that week he pushed too 2200 and I was super salty for awhile but I ended up doing the same thing or close too.  I found myself a new partner and got up to 2150 and was super happy with myself.
---
Anytime we played together after that we expected great things and were routinely dissappointed falling back into the 1700-1800 bracket and floundering.
---
Sometimes the best of firends are the worst of Partners for PvP.
---
Yup. Same here. So sad. 
---
At least I can play BfA until August. I’m planning to split my time between both, and likely will end up playing twice as much as I do now, LOL.
---
I used the blue one on my hunter throughout Vanilla, BC &amp; Wotlk, still have it / use it as my cat in BfA when I play survival.
---
I like that as a Rogue or Warrior I could benefit from Intel buff! Sure it's only Weapon Skill, but I'd rather keep that as high as possible while leveling anyways so why not! :D
---
Something about the dry landscape is very soothing imo
---
-high fives-  btw I'm aiming to heal untill 41 for both consecration and sanctuary. What's you plan?
---
Killing bears in Feralas for 2 hours is your respec cost, like, how little do people want to play this game?
---
Better low-level dungeon rewards/access with less tiresome prequests.
---
Barrens chat shitposting never gets old.
---
You can assist the Orcs in despoiling a beautiful forest for lumber and the Forsaken in terrorizing civilians, developing biological weapons and genocide in Hillsbrad.
---
Travel between continents is more convenient via Zeppelins than via boats.
---
You don’t have to endure Night Elves and Ret Paladins.
---
The modern zones feel like theme-parks with attractions. These feel like they're part of a living breathing world. WoTLK was the last expansion that captured this for me.
---
Well that's like your opinion man
---
Tough call. On the one hand, you like what you like. No one should convince you to play THEIR way. Do you think you'd have more fun looking for an Alliance guild, or is playing with friends more important to you? Can you make characters on both factions, or are your friends going to be super hardcore?
---
That said, Thunder Bluff is totally awesome, even if the layout confused me for a while.
---
Now if only they were still inviting new players to the Beta. :(
---
There are a pile of quests out there.  Blood elves and a huge troll temple and an elite turtle.
---
As for classic races, the horse are a bunch of ugly fucks. But their racials are way better than ally.
---
Nah, it comes from 90% of hunter players not reading anything outside the game. It's unreasonable to demand people know the game inside and out before they can competently do anything.
---
Blizz fucked up with hunters. And as such, never invite them to groups.
---
Naxx was 1.11 I think.
---
I added my previous boss and 6 months after I had moved on, he was hitting me up to see if I was interested in my old role or knew anyone suitable on bnet
---
Seems like normal human interaction to me
---
I think its more the result of the batching working differently in the modern client and they have just modified spell priorities to make it feel as vanilla-like as they can, although maybe they can still tweak it.
---
Don't run anything with hunters.
---
You raise a fair point, and I can't really refute that. Only time will tell I suppose; I'll be playing classic either way.
---
It felt so big and as a Tauren I felt at home, and WC was my first dungeon so I remember the whole place fondly
---
Yup! I got downvoted for saying the same.  One if the first UI mods Im getting is a Blacklist mod for precisely this sort of thing.
---
Its ok to ask for off spec gear in group but you dont get to demand it or ninja it.
---
&gt;If you work an office job and are "sick", but are conveniently well enough to play WoW for 8-12 hours that day.. You probably could have worked.
---
I don't know if the "come to work no matter what" thing is an American attitude but it's horrible advice, coming into work when you know you're unwell is incredibly selfish and just plain stupid.
---
If someone tried to do that over here they'd be out the door again in minutes.
---
&gt; It was a 1.11 item and thus won't be in the game until Phase 5 iirc
---
Are you looking at wowhead, which started during 1.11, so lists everything pre 1.11 as 1.11?
---
Thanks a lot for the very detailed reply mate! Very helpful :))
---
&gt; it was EPIC.
---
Even more epic for people who were on the other side of Kalimdor, who were dealing with all the stability problems.
---
Its been a long time, but I seem to remember this happening occasionally back in vanilla.
---
Practicing in the beta makes sense since it's authentic, practicing on a private server is a waste of time
---
I don't know that would require me having sex...
---
It sounds like the only thing you think is better is the way the characters look? 
---
I personally make my character as ugly as possible and just care about winning PvP haha
---
Entitlement? The community has a 15 year history of when it is acceptable to need on gear, and we're in a thread making fun of people that are too greedy to abide by those rules. You're literally here posting because you wanted to point out YOU feel entitled to needing on gear because you think you've had such unfair experiences and that you don't want to invest the time to get the things you want while playing under the rules accepted by the community.
---
The fact you think its the people around you that are entitled is frankly pretty funny.
---
Horde is more of a brotherhood, if cities are that big of a deal pick for that then
---
For classic? I honestly agree with the alliance side. right now in BFA i main horde, but that's because i like there's more choices for race. For the main 4, orc, troll, undead, or tauren don't really...do it for me. I know it's all about opinion, but for me... not really digging the choices for horde. i was alliance back in vanilla so i'm gonna go back to that. still keep up my horde in BFA though
---
Pretty much yes. Some people may claim that Enhancement Shaman can be viable, but they can’t and if you roll a Shaman and want to DPS, you are going to be disappointed once you hit 60.
---
I have these on my Hunter. I used to wear them in Wotlk dungeons as they proc'ed off of range attacks.
---
That is one of my fondest memories of WoW, turning in a giant tiger when people were not expecting it in dungeons.
---
That just results in me forgetting the wrong things
---
The VC chest is strickly better for a feral druid.
---
Lol. Yeah I played vanilla too and also picked whatever and played like a noob because I didn't know any better. If "knowing the truth" means ignoring all the knowledge I've gained and regressing back to being a noob, then I guess I don't want to "know the truth", as you put it.
---
Definitely Preach
---
What mission?
---
Huntard fever
---
Find something original to post, mate.
---
Well this is what we wanted. It's fine
---
Dormammu I've come to bargain
---
Always my favorite along with Silverpine, until the Ghostlands &amp; Eversong come out.
---
Then it's tied.
---
There's also something special about Desolace, Swamp/Dusthallow and Felwood, though. Wish Felwood was wider.
---
That is not a point you try to make. The fact that i would still play the game after some change ! = it didn't affect how much i enjoy the game. If you think game mechanics are irrelevant for players experience of the game it seems that you don't really understand the subject at all. Some reason it just seems to be hard for you that someone would like to have Classic to be as original it can be. You just have to accept that not everyone think the Classic would be better experience with changes.
---
I think many of the class restrictions were due to the character creation UI only being able to fit up to 6 classes per race. Also they probably didn't want to give some races too much class options compared to others. It didn't make sense why humans can't be hunters and blood elves warriors too, until when they redesigned the creation screen and allowed more combinations.
---
Yeah the time I learned how to make wine I forgot how to drive
---
&gt;yet there are tons of people listing qoutes and links showing blizz was already in the making of classic
---
Never heard about that. Mind giving me some links?
---
lmfao i work in an office dude and the environment is much different. You are given X amount of sick days per year. What you do on those sick days is nobodies fucking business and everyone is aware of that. People use sick days all the time where I work for frivolous things... it doesn't matter youre allowed to do whatever you want on them. It didnt matter whether you were actually sick or not. You could use sick days to go on vacation and run into a coworker and nobody would bat an eye. Idk if this is true for everywhere but I work for my state gov't and it seems like a lot of offices work this way as well. But I could use a sick day and not actually be sick and play WoW all day and tell my boss and he'd be chill with it. One time one of my directors accidently spilled coffee on his pants in the morning so he went to his director and told him he was taking a sick day then and there because he got off on the wrong foot and we all thought it was hilarious... These things happen in life
---
Alliance is a brotherhood, Horde is a dude bruh dude bro u my bruh bro hood.
---
Only 2 co-workers ever played WoW. One lost his account for reasons, and the other is a scrub.
---
Neither are interested in classic.
---
[This blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/spell-batching-in-classic/137118) explains what they have done. They've modified things to try and make it more like vanilla was, but obviously there might be bugs or they can tweak it more.
---
Orc, definitely
---
And to think all I did as far as a corpse run was head to Darkshire to pick up the FP. Maybe if any of my old WoW buddies still played I would have come up with something cooler but sadly afaik every one of them doesn't have any interest in the game anymore.
---
That I can agree with, but you should just shut off automatically mate. There are bad teachers and good teachers out there.
---
I also agree some people can be obnoxious afterwards, but thats another extreme they are taking it to. Like the addiction, now they aren't very wrong, they are very right.
---
That usually means they aren't done working with themselves, which is often the toughest thing to do. It's so much easier to point fingers at others hehe.
---
I'm sorry if I came off harsh, I didn't want to. The written language can be tricky.
---
You can do it! Just head on down to r/tinder!
---
The funny part is I had my gladiator friend and myself group with one of my buddies, and we just fucked around and played Holy paladin and two arms warriors and the gladiator consistently doubled or more the others damage.  That was the part that crushed my RL friend, and he kept almost weeping and going on and on about how he just didn't understand.
---
But I agree, some people just can't jive well together, and in PvP when things go wrong everyone likes to yell and point the finger.  
---
God I miss when arena was good.
---
This is true. The main reason why blood elves couldn't be Warriors originally (only six classes each max). I likes the new race/class combos in Cata :)
---
Claw of Shirvallah before it was cool
---
It's so good for leveling
---
Loch Modan and Westfall for me 😍
---
Ok sure
---
facepalm.jpg
---
Tinder is not a thing round here
---
Well, not without a lot of messy fallout at least...
---
I've been shammy tanking up until Zul Farrak and only quit because I wanted to play resto. Until max lvl, knowledge of tanking and aggro mechanics &gt; plate armor.
---
Which ones would u recommend?
---
The light wills it.
---
I prefer the open world pvp in Hillsbrad &amp; Tanaris. Stranglethorn feels so choked in all ways that there's so little room to 'breathe'.
---
Its so bullshit to claim that Classic is easy and I’m sure it’s mostly claimed of new players and not people who actually raided back then. 
---
Also it’s ridiculous to say that people were just kids back then. No... YOU might have been kids back then because you still have time to play the game, but the average player was a mid 20’s player who came from hardcore games like Starcraft, Warcraft III or Counter Strike. 
---
OF COURSE we raiders had rotations etc.
---
In Soviet Russia guild loots you!
---
We didn't want changes, and my vanilla experience was rolling new servers the day they opened, finding a fast leveling pvp guild and trying to server first battleground wins. We always played against the same people who were doing the same thing on the other faction. We knew them and their classes by heart. That was Vanilla, I'm not asking for something that didn't exist.
---
It truly doesn’t matter. If anything the bigger PVE advantage for orc is not the stun resist but the axe skill. 
---
Hell throw a curveball and go troll for that regen and berserk!
---
&gt; I don't see why me rolling against the tank for gear is amy different than a caster rolling on my gear, or two dps rolling against each other for gear.
---
Because you aren't filling the tanking role and, as you said above, you aren't advertising that you are seeking tank gear.  People often build groups to try and 'corner' a specific item/type of gear for people.  If you are coming in as a healer/dps, why would the tank consider that you would roll against them for gear?
---
&gt; It's not like I'm not going to use it. It's not like i want it for transmog or flexing. I'm running a character that would serve a group better by healing than tanking at the beginning stages of endgame. I'm playing a role i don't want to play to get gear in order to play the spec i do want to play.
---
And I am not admonishing your for wanting to gather gear for a tank set or for wanting to play as a tank.  The point I was making is that you complain about the lack to time to try and construct/find a group that will fit your needs if you want a specific gear set that is considered off meta.  Yet, you are totally willing to cause people to have to run the dungeon more times than needed by taking gear that isn't in the spec you are playing or have previously advertised.
---
That is hypocrisy.
---
&gt; You can be salty and mad about it all you like. I'm playing my role same as anyone else here. 
---
Yes, and you are entitled to compensation by having priority, either sole or equal, on gear that *is for your current role*.  If you were a Holy pally, and a piece of cloth Healing and Spell damage gear dropped, I wouldn't complain if you won it over me.  I get that you are still going to use it and you are performing a role that should have equal priority on it.
---
But, if you want priority, equal or sole, on other gear types, then advertise that you want that type of priority instead.
---
&gt; Try to spin it, twist it, shape it however you like. Your argument is literally the reason why i don't tell people what i'm after. You're not entitled to anything just because you're a tank any more than i am for playing a healer.
---
You say that I, or anyone else, isn't entitled to anything, yet you feel entitled to take gear for a role that you aren't filling/performing.  Hell, why not roll on agility leather as well?  Got to get that ret set up to par and that rogue doesn't need it *that* much.
---
You hypocrisy is palpable.
---
Ahh you’re gonna have to do it the old fashioned way, 3-D tinder.
---
Aww. There's something sweet about WoWing with a romantic partner. &lt;3
---
It's not about raid gear, really. It's that, while you might still run up to Maraudon or so, there suddenly became zero reason to experience all the 55-60 content in Azeroth. TBC felt like it was bolted onto the endgame, and they went way overboard with the stats inflation to make it clear that if you wanted to keep playing the game socially, the purchase was mandatory. Nobody else would be in Azeroth.
---
Personally, I think there are some stun mechanics you can't avoid so that 25% becomes less effective. The 5% HP definitely helps across the board and war stomp can help in smaller trash/pack pulls.   
---
However, this is a min/max scenario that you most likely won't see the average player need to consider. Play what you like the "look" of.
---
Everyone and their mom has an Alt rogue, in PVE they’re nowhere near as desired as competent shamans. I have a mage and rogue, the mage is my main and never has a problem finding groups... rogue on the other hand...
---
Blizzard is the one that made retail how it is now. Blizzard is the one that told the world "You think you do..." Blizzard is the one that asked us if we "didn't have phones." You can probably understand why I hold a bit of distrust when Blizzard is given the reins.
---
"bobs and vagana bitch lasagna"
---
I feel like they will make changes to it before launch. I think the current setup does replicate some of the things that used to happen in vanilla, but its more extreme and some things that are happening with this system certainly didn't happen then.
---
Downvote hell down here. Maybe there are more horde idk, makes sense to me because everyone will play blue master race come launch
---
The Barrens. It really felt like the frontier.
---
What are the system requirements?
---
Unshared BGs were Vanilla as well, even more so than shared BGs. People don't seem to remember that.
---
What other pet are you using for dungeons?
---
My college roommate works for blizzard and he had 2 keys to give out, so instead of dealing with the mad rush of everyone trying to get the same quest mobs I now have level 30s in the starting zone “working on rep and gold.”
---
Nathanos used to be cool and badass back in classic, now he's just a pathetic toy-boy lapdog.
---
I agree that this is a good example of what would have usually gotten you killed in classic. Its why people didn't try to use blink to save themselves from falling back then, it almost never worked.
---
Troll berserk makes them theoretically the best horde pve tank iirc.
---
Succubus for CC for example.
---
It was smoother than any WoW experience I've ever had, and I can't play Pservers because of how chunky they are compared. 
---
Compare it to expensive Vs. Cheap knifes. Sure, the cheap knife does the job, but once you try a quality product you can't go back.
---
Just two eyes, get out there and get it done in person.
---
Streamers aren't the best players and guild leaders. Lol
---
Tauren for nature resist
---
His shoutcasting is faster than the gameplay. His shouted how he had Arcane Explosioned three times before the second animation was over. He just needs to actually shoutcast what's going on and it's fine, not what he thinks is happening.
---
pSA: invites are over, for awhile
---
Hi, /u/dreev336
---
Skeletal Warhorse is the most badass mount in the game, IMO. Main reason why I'll probably main Undead. Also I love their casting animation.
---
I see the fat man laying down with outstretched arms after falling down too.
---
Yeeees I love Luna!
---
Isn't it World of Warcraft Classic goal to solo everything anyway ? We wanted vanilla features but, that's it. #Troll
---
Sounds good I would guess end of October you’ll prolly see your first attempts at Rag and then maybe early December the first kill. The longest part will be farming the FR mats and patterns to get people the cap for Rag.

Taking 3 weeks.  Shit is about to get real.

At some part of this video i thought he was having a heart attack.
---
Uh... pretty sure laptops from 10 years ago will run it.
---
And bfa has 8 games within it.
---
 That's what I am getting at.
---
People over time have come to addopt one or the other.
---
This was due to the RP communities by and large abandoning RP PVP, which left people who 'must have both' like my self without any decent RP community to interact with. 
---
When I wish to RP I have to create an alt on argent dawn or get some one to phase me over. 
---
This is the sad reality. 
---
The story in short, Some RPers left due to getting PVP'd when they did not want and they got rebuted by GM's (rightly so) who told them that pvp ruleset was final regardless of RP. 
---
Hardcore RPers who did not mind PVP had to move to follow their friends and communities for the 'best rp'. 
---
RP-PVPers were then left with 1 or 2 guilds here and there but overall the community of RP died on RPPVP in europe. 
---
Which is why blizz does not want to make a server. 
---
As they know better than us exactly what went on.
---
I played a holy paladin in PVP healing my brother, our raiding guild’s maintank and usually at least 5-10 guildies. So yes, a full-on protection warrior in all Wrath gear with Thunderfury and 8000hp tanking Drek. We won a lot of AV matches because we approached it like a raid and he was unkillable.
---
T3 and to lesser extend T2 made me decide to rolla an undead warrior
---
bootleg death knight here we gooo!
---
Lux vult
---
Sounds like Shaman with extra steps.
---
Why can't you avoid them?
---
I'd just be like "Sorry bro, playing with some friends!"
---
It's not that hard to tell people you are busy or don't want to hang out with them.
---
If you have a hard time telling people you don't want to hang out with them, you need to work on yourself.
---
"Omg private server are so wrong it's not gonna be possible on Classic"
---
I've had Beta &amp; Stress Test and only had access to stress test, never had it removed and it is still there
---
Four letters, UBRS. Right before Rend...

The Libram of Consitution quest requires level 50 and 30g. You can buy the Black Diamond and Libram from the AH but the Lung Juice Cocktail is BOP and requires doing a repeatable farm quest in the Blasted Lands. The 4x Night Dragon's Breath is also BOP and requires some collecting in Felwood. It's a quest chain that lets you cleanse herbs found in the zone, you get the cleansing materials through various means.
---
Lesser Agility Cloak requires 225 Enchanting
---
Major Health Chest requires 275 Enchanting
---
Superior Stamina Wrist requires 300 Enchanting
---
Greater Agility Gloves requires 270 Enchanting
---
Minor Speed Boots requires 225 Enchanting
---
Fiery Weapon requires 265 Enchanting
---
Crusader requires 300 Enchanting
---
Note: All of these prices are from a stable economy after BWL was released, before that, they were much more expensive.
---
* 2 Libram of Constitution (these are easily 100g each, if not more)
---
* 2 Black Diamond (usually pretty cheap, maybe 2g each)
---
* 60g
---
* 3 Lesser Nether Essence (maybe 1g each)
---
* 11 Large Brilliant Shard (maybe 5g each)
---
* 18 Illusion Dust (maybe 50s each)
---
* 3 Lesser Eternal Essence (maybe 2g each)
---
* 1 Small Radiant Shard (maybe 3g)
---
* 1 Aquamarine (maybe 50s)
---
* 3 Essence of Fire (maybe 2g each)
---
* 2 Righteous Orb (maybe 50g each)
---
So an a fresh economy, it's safe to assume the prices will be 200%. That adds up to ~830g. Then you've got to assume at least another 500g for fees on the rare formulas.
---
All of them have chats that are spammed with his face too

BFA is absolutely terrible and we can all agree on that, but WoD is absolutely worse than BFA. Some of Y'all need to load up youtube and remind yourselves how shit it was.
---
Meme. I was a spelladin
---
It doesn't matter that the queues are faster or slower because everybody you are competing against for ranks has the same queues you do.
---
Like they randomly gave every other lore character a new model? Where was Gallywix’s short story?
---
I'm in the same boat, still there
---
What is your expectation buying world drops? I am curious, I have never tried doing it. What are you hoping to pay for bloodpike, for example?
---
Also, anyone else reading this: don't be afraid to just take the consolation prize quest rewards after instances. If you do deadmines and don't get the axe or smite's hammer.... you have to forfeit the chausses of westfall, but the staff of westfall (quest reward) is actually better than the taskmaster axe in terms of dps. 
---
similarly, wailing caverns, the best weapon there is the living root, which you may feel slimy about rolling need on as it's a caster staff. The second best weapon is the cresent staff you get as a quest reward at the end, and it's not even a sacrifice to take, as the only other quest reward is a 1 handed sword you don't need.
---
I mean, it's definitely fine to have a different opinion on the way stuff looks, it's mostly all subjective. That being said, I think T2 looks like a fucking clown set and T3 is objectively the blandest-looking set compared to all the others, including non-Hunter sets. It's just baby shit brown, with piss yellow boots, pink flecks and a little bit of purple glow. Gross as shit, imo.
---
Rogue T3 comes in at a close second. It's also bland, but the color scheme is actually very good and crisp. It doesn't particularly look like a rogue set or have any special model shapes, which is why I don't like it either, but at least the colors aren't gross.
---
My favorite vanilla addon, thanks!
---
Not sure about authentic vanilla playthroughs but soupasoka has some vanilla private server playthroughs of different classes. Some are retail playthroughs and not relevant at all. But that’s a good source if you want to research full 1-60 gameplay.
---
"I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to work today. Thanks for understanding."

I work on a fishing boat in Alaska, the satellite internet on the boat can barely load Reddit. Would be impossible to play up here. Thankfully for me, I'll be off right around aug 15th for 2+ months :)
---
If you go Horde, you have to go Orc and try to use an axe..  
---
The +5 axes spec is great for threat generation (which is pivotal) and by far more useful than the tauren racials in the long run.
---
We had hope, for a time.
---
Now it's taken...
---
Love me a cave
---
I still think elwynn is #1
---
I was a Ret Pally in vanilla... I was 13... I was guilty of this, mostly because I didn’t know tank set vs damage vs healing (my Ret Pally literally used a shield)... I have atoned for my sins over the years.
---
Speaking of lore character models, Is Sylvanas' model in old-school WoW back to being a nightelf?
---
Agree, sure would like them to get rid of showing the flag carriers on the map since that wasn't in vanilla either.
---
r/wowcirclejerk
---
I got the shortcut too, dunno what thats about.
---
I got the blue one as soon as my hunter hit lvl60. I never change it. Still the only pet I use. Even in BFA
---
yall forgetting loch modan
---
I remember learned that the hard way.
---
Or that yeah. The reason I say it my way is just to make it clear to HR/management that I'm not dying in bed, but just need to breath for a day.
---
That's the beauty of Vanilla and this community, you're entitled to your opinion!
---
No matter how delete-your-hunter wrong it is.
---
Nah, that's just a ton of people trying to type 'vanilla'
---
Wonderful
---
Which is great. I'm already sick of stormwind after all those years, and in classic it's virtually identical. I think last time i even went to IF was to upgrade my heirlooms, it will almost feel like a brand new city.
---
Just like they will buy/share accounts to hit 60 by playing 24/7
---
The Horde zones are mediocre to be honest.  They have a few that stick out but Alliance has a better feel to leveling.  Depends if you want to play with friends or gank friends.
---
That works too!
---
Literally in this thread.
---
Hi, /u/loviethebasedgod
---
I really liked Redridge and STV
---
Well horde racials are superior for pvp If that counts for you. Also not sure why UD warlock doesn’t feel right as it’s lore wise pretty much the perfect fit. 
---
Apart from that if going Alliance is so important to you just ditch the guild. You’ll find another one
---
“y’all”
---
Just stay in the Alliance.
---
My favorite zone is Darkshore, any of the night elf zones really make me feel happy &amp; calm when questing in then.
---
Depends. If you end up being lucky enough to getting TF, you can't benefit from Axe skill and I dont think many bosses have (avoidable) stuns so your racials are effectively useless for tanking. 
---
A tauren will always have 5% more HP regardless.
---
I've thought about troll but berzerking only gives you either 10% or 30% attack speed increase depending on your health when you use it for 10sec.
---
Using TF as a baseline:
---
1.9 atk spd over 10 sec = 5.26 attacks
---
10%: 1.9 * 0.9 = 1.71= 5.84 attacks
---
30%: 1.9 * 0.7 = 1.33 = 7.52 attacks
---
So you're effective only getting 1-3 extra attacks in every 3 minutes. Doesn't seem super worth it to me.
---
He just said he could take it off.
---
But underneath is just another helmet.
---
I really think you underestimate how bad people were back then and how good they are now, but we will see. Have a nice summer !
---
Why?  Steamers incite huge community events line world pvp and level 1 raids on hogger.  What's the downside to following a steamers community?  I can always decide to not join in if I don't want to.
---
Classic is far less demanding.. I don't know the specifics, but on my system with BFA I have to turn on vertical sync and cap it at 60 FPS on ultra settings  1440p or I get tearing.. In classic with no vertical sync on I get the full 100 fps my monitor can handle with no tearing.
---
raiding is ALL of late game.. there is zero progression to be have once you cap out 0.5 gear 3 months into the expo. Not a single content patch post 1.12 will further progress your character if you don't raid
---
Same.
---
Glad to hear it mate! Can't wait to try it out myself! Are you able to increase the graphics a lot compared to BFA on the same hardware?
---
Stress test ended
---
Don't forget that many things Trump is doing are not yet represented in GDP or the Stock market. Things like these take time to really show their effect.
---
It's a technical limitation that they recreated because it affected the meta of vanilla and how classes could be played and outplay.  Obviously there are downsides to everything no matter what way you look at it but you're being very naive on this topic.
---
I don't really mind either way. This is something they could make like retail and I would be ok with it, but I also understand the attempt to capture what vanilla was like. I think this video is a bad example, though, because this would often kill you in vanilla.
---
Oh god you reminded me of probably my favorite angry arena group.
---
Had me as a holy paladin, my buddy from previous post an arms warrior, and our 3rd friend who was easily the best pvp warlock on the server at the time.
---
This was our 3's group and it functioned, well fucking terribly, this was after the warrior and myself went our seperate ways to get our higher ratings and our warlock though well if we could all get in the 2150 rating area alone in 2's then well together we were basically gaurenntied glad right?
---
WRONG!
---
Weeks upon weeks of constant arguing and blaming each other and just the most stressful PvP I have ever particapated in eventually culminating in 3 assholes sitting on our Gladiator Netherdrakes vowing to never again do 3's together.
---
I still can't tell but I'm leaning towards retarded. Give me something a little less subtle
---
Sweet! :D
---
I think small stuff like this is what retail is missing.  Granted I was only 13-14 when I played vanilla, it was stuff like this that made the game feel magical.
---
Ohh man...this one
---
Yaaaaa. Do it right man
---
Dude, speedrunning older games is a large community. There are competitions for super mario and all kind of games going for world first speeds and whatnot.
---
Chess have been the same for hundreds if years. We still hear about. Football, same every time. Basically all sports and games. Everyone know exactly what to get, so we compete against other humans. duuuuuh.
---
For khaz modan
---
I think people underestimate the grind that it took to get geared just to survive the first bosses there’s a reason it took 2 months after release for the first kill in MC and it’s not skill all of those raiders literally came from Everquest and were beta testing the game.
---
I'm not worried that people know my old account, I just never liked the battlenet ID system. When I log on to a character, I think the only thing that should show is the individual character has come online. That's how it used to be.
---
all i know is that the best raid guilds always had a big ass tauren as the MT
---
Spreist and enhancement crush spelladin if played competently
---
Lmfao you can just tell when someone hasn’t played vanilla and thinks retail is good
---
RemindME! 95 days "Prove /u/Gazzuk wrong"
---
We asked for 1.12, we asked for #nochanges. The community was very clear on this. We've gotten exactly what we asked for which is commendable by Blizzard standards.
---
In my experience, having played both side in vanilla and being in a server first guild on both sides (might -&gt; method on sylvanas EU as alliance, then Fates Encompassed on The Venture Co. as horde) I found hordes were way more likely to help you out in a tough spot of you were getting ganked, or would help you out or just chat than alliance. It was more chill and mature.
---
Mind you though, The Venture Co. was an RP PvP server that came up later than Sylvanas server though, and that may have attracted a different crowd. Didn't ever see anyone RP though. xD
---
Om the pservers Ive played on I've done both horde and alliance to 60 fairly recently - I experienced more toxicity as alliance than on the horde side, more.. let's call it NA LoL toxic mentality than team spirit. More cannot handle criticism vs. accepting feedback, and less providing feedback  Vs. constructive feedback. 
---
I may just have been unlucky consistently on alliance side compared to horde. But I will be rolling horde, yet not opposed to switching side if the community sucks :p
---
I forgot about Preach.  Thanks!
---
Well if you gave us your laptop's specs perhaps we could say for certain :)
---
But yeah, Classic is MUCH less demanding than Battle for Azeroth. But keep in mind that it's also MORE demanding than the 1.12 client from 2004. 
---
Also it takes about 10GB, not really sure on this.
---
Nah, I have social anxiety, doesn't make me so desperate to be liked that I have to lie about playing video games. OP just has bad social skills
---
Theres a second system that is interacting with the Spell-batching system that is causing the issues people are seeing.  I was going to make a post about it, but I got sidetracked.
---
They didn't understand the joke, as it wasn't really a joke. The actual words was never misunderstood :)
---
So I am a complete 3rd party reading this exchange (I don't know Sage and I don't know you). I've got to say that outside of your very fair warning of exp values being wrong at higher levels, you are coming across as somewhat obsessive.
---
I just went to his site:  [https://sage-guide.netlify.com/index.html](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/index.html)
---
I see credit given to the speed levelers right at the top of the page. Those speed levelers posted videos online to the public, which was the basis for this written guide. What are you on about copyright? Do you know how copyright even fucking works? Your issues with "copyright" and credit are way overblown - and don't apply here. He gave credit, and there is nothing here for the speed levelers to copyright.
---
Now as for the exp values, that is definitely a fair point. But it's a little tough for the guide to be 100% perfect right now when Classic BETA literally just came out, and the basis of it had to be private servers. From what I've read, Sage intends to adjust the guide as he runs through it on the Classic BETA. Sure, a notice on the pages above level 30 saying "Under Construction: Adjustments Being Made Due To Experience Value Differences in WoW: Classic" would be appreciated, but other than that I think the site is fine.
---
I have not come across a better looking written guide for leveling. It is clear, concise, has hyperlinks for every interfaced NPC and quest, and uses nice-looking iconography. To state that Sage simply ripped a guide from someone else and presented it as his own is down-right insulting. I can only imagine the amount of time that had to have gone into this just for all of the formatting. This is going to be my guidebook for early leveling in Classic, and I hope that Sage gets the higher level experience issues worked out by the time I get there.
---
Go find something else to bash, man.
---
&gt; I love how simultaneously patronizing but ignorant this response is.
---
Most people cannot tell me why they like Classic without giving me a vague and unconvincing argument. It often boils down to, "That's my opinion about the game." which is the religious argument equivalent to "You have to have faith."
---
"I think Classic is better than retail." That statement is ***purely*** subjective since objectively, Classic is way worse in almost every category than retail. 
---
Understanding what you like about the game helps you to convey what you would like to change going forward. The vast majority of people I have spoken to on these forums want new content added to Classic. In the same breath they also say, "No changes."
---
Imagine you go to your favorite burger stand. You approach the chef and tell him, "I want a combo 1 burger, but I want something new added to it. But don't change anything that's already on it." He'll rightly give you a weird look.
---
&gt; It's obvious you both read and failed to comprehend what I wrote. Your counterpoint to my "Classic is more than raiding," was... "but muh raiding."
---
That's because the guy I was talking to was discussion raids and raiding environments and I guess it looks like you changed the subject or wanted to talk about something else. 
---
&gt; It's not that I don't understand your criticism. 
---
I think you see it as a personal attack rather than criticism. Likely a sign that you have strong feelings about the game rather than an objective outlook. Like for example, objectively speaking, Classic was the worst version of the game for hybrid classes. If you were not healing you were doing it wrong and a detriment to your party / raid in pretty much any context of the game. 
---
Each expansion afterwards improved upon those classes to the point where it wasn't a joke to have a bear druid as main tank. Or a shadow priest in your group. If you recall the MC Raiders song, they jest about how Druids tanking Rag should require a nerf to the class. Priest going shadow form is "unacceptable". That's how people felt back then. 
---
So yea, when you look at something purely from a subjective standpoint, you're bound to feel attack and upset when people approach it grounded in objective reality. It's not wrong to look at things from a subjective point of view, but you have to realize that's the ground you're walking on too.
---
It certainly was... Maybe not on your server but to just pretend any viable item wasn't used in chat by someone somewhere is pretty silly.
---
I see numbers that range from 16% to 21%, and even those numbers are a bit inaccurate since they count paladin and shaman as separate.  You reasonably need 1 warrior out of 5 per dungeon, and 8-10 out of every 40.  20%+ is a healthy number for warrior population.  
---
That being said, warrior is a struggle to level and one of the most expensive classes in terms of BoEs, especially if you are trying to gear both dps and tanking.  I would only go that route if you really like the class, and not merely for raid acceptance.  
---
The number one requirement to get into a raid is availability, if you can raid every night, you almost for sure will find a competent guild.  The only classes where I saw competent players legit not able to find a raid in vanilla(didn't raid on private) was rogues.  
---
If you legit don't mind what role you play, other then that you can kill people in pvp and can get into raids, perhaps it is better to look at it from a different direction.  What classes pve specs are desirable, and also pvp capable.  
---
Warrior:  Has to respec
---
Rogue:  Overpopulated
---
Priest:  has to respec, unless you are that one spriest,  Note* Holy is the goto pve spec, but Disc is still quite good pve and you need at least one per raid, and it is reasonably able to kill people in pvp. 
---
Paladin: has to respec  Note* like disc, hpaladin once geared can be played as shockadin and be reasonably capable of killing people, while not a dps class
---
Hunter:  Specs are almost identical, Deep Marks is quite good in pvp, at some point deep survival becomes better, but both specs are pvp and pve viable.  
---
Mage:  Arcane/frost is best in pvp and pve early on, pve eventually forces you into arcane/fire but that is still quite good in pvp.  Elemental pvp build is not good in pve though
---
Warlock:  Soul link is a pure pvp build, and Demonic Sacrifice are pure pve builds, but SM/Ruin works quite well in both.  
---
Druid:  Deep resto for both pvp and pve, but resto druid if played right can get kills in pvp, it is great at hunting people down in world pvp as well as being flag carrier for WSG
---
Shaman:  Deep resto is best in pve, 30/0/21 is best in pvp, so you would need to respec, but a lot of shamans got away with healing as the elemental build in pve, you only lose 10% healing and manatide.
---
does that not seem like something a 12 year old would search for?
---
If you get another character to farm Mars with or buy them you can
---
I might be in the minority here. I gave my bnet to two coworkers in WotLK. I ended up standing up in one of their weddings and the three of us play games together regularly. We've all gone on to other jobs but are still really close friends.
---
And the rivalry continues!
---
The spec requirements to run the Classic Beta are nearly identical to Retail. The only exception to this is space, you only need about 8gb.
---
I’m with you, was looking through expecting more mentions. It’s the zone closest to my heart, although I haven’t played much past vanilla so maybe my memory is a bit flawed.
---
Hey, just letting you know that as a teacher you're really not supposed to have contact with students outside of school. This includes adding them on social media/playing video games with them. In many states/school districts this can get you fired, in addition to being unethical and can be seen as kind of creepy to some parents.

Haha, while I agree with your points about raidbuffs and flightpaths, I've the exact opposite experience when it comes to attitudes xD i think it may be depending on your server luck or lack thereof how the community acts
---
You can buy the mats for engineering.
---
Gets expensive
---
Not if you're like me and love creating multiple toons to grind with and pop with at 60. Getting titles takes a lot of work and you need to continuously play every week to keep them
---
Count me in bros, prot paladin from vanilla through Cataclysm.
---
That's basically how it was with my real life friends.  Constant complaining and bitching.  So I recorded every game we had so that I could review our play, but mostly my play, and I kept recording after we got out of a match with one of my friends losing his shit in skype.  I then made a video and emailed it to the whole group of my review of the match and him complaining about never getting freedom, then I clipped the four times in the match he had freedom, and looped his complaint, and those clips twice more.
---
He didn't talk to me for a very very long time.
---
mouseover macros
---
Ah ok, what I may do is just roll an alt to do enchanting and mining so that I can farm my tailoring and engineering on my main. Thanks!
---
This is actually a mirrored image of the one that appears on the inside panel box art
---
People just say "Yes".
---
You still ask that in current WoW... at least on Gnomeregan
---
Imagine being born a human with the last name *Blightcaller".
---
Hey guys, it's me, Joe Blightcaller.
---
&gt; There's not much you really need to know about the leveling grind to maintain efficiency
---
That’s just flat out untrue. Joana makes leveling guides for this very reason.. to be as efficient as possible to get to 60 as fast as possible
---
i think that's a debate in itself.
---
There are so many variations of depressed, self diagnoses of depressed, etc. Is it a "sick day" if I just don't feel like going because I think it'd help my mental health to stay home and play WoW instead?
---
And when most people refer to "sick day" they mean using a paid sick day, not just "calling in"
---
Hm, interesting, thanks for the info.
---
Yes for winterspring! With timbermaw rep, wintersaber mount, firewater and eko farming theres always a reason to go back there throughout the whole game
---
You dont seem to understand that world first have nothing to do with pve and everything to do with being faster and better than other players.
---
I had the stress tests. 
---
My computer can handle BFA smoothly too, but not as smooth as classic where I get some 350-400 FPS. Mind you I play with classic settings. I don't want non of that BFA graphics !
---
People do remember it, and that's why they don't want it
---
Former prot pally here. Unless you have a guild that supports you, it's tough. I'll admit, warriors will have an easier time tanking, but pally tanks can hold their own in Naxx and MC.
---
Yes, I'll feel entitled to play my game how I want to, especially when some myth in the community is hindering it. Just as I would feel "entitled" to live my life how I want to even if there is some stigma from society discouraging me.
---
Dude the queues for BGs were so long you could play another game while waiting. On top of that, you weren't event allowed to leave the war room and stay queued
---
Yeah you don’t ever need a hunter anyhow. I’d rather have mages and rogues
---
That sounds like the exact level of Petty revenge I can appreciate.
---
Druids were quite broken in vanilla, as with most hybrids. If your interest is healing, I’d suggest a priest- shadow to level (you can heal fine 5-59 as shadow) and then holy/disc to raid.
---
What is we voted for changes as a community? OSRS style
---
addons
---
focus frame or others
---
Damn really? Bring dat 400Hz monitor ;)   
---
Thanks for the replies mate. I am hopeful!
---
I don't understand why playing WoW when you call in sick would make for a problem? It's not like you're out snowboarding. Playing most video games while sick is a perfectly acceptable activity.
---
Before they shoehorned in the romance between him and gave him enough plot armour to go toe to toe with the literal avatar and a fury filled goddess and survive though right? I for one loved the old Nathanos Blightcaller and his very ominous presence in EPL.
---
I love Tanaris, a big desert. I love STV, the jungle and the beaches are awesome, i also love the music there :)
---
The true test of a friendship is to play Ranked/PvP with an IRL friend.
---
I cannot find any confirmation for this. I'm going tauren for classic and if they can ride War Raptor I will grind to rank 11. But I kinda want to know for sure that it is working
---
Yes, 100%
---
I did skinning/herb and saved skins to craft a bunch of goggles when I dropped skinning for engineering.
---
Paladins turned out to be the best single-target healers in Vanilla.
---
Shamans turned out to be the best raid-damage healers in Vanilla.
---
But yeah, Druids were lackluster.
---
It was absolutely worth it.
---
How many druids would there prospectively be in a raid?
---
This was me, but also at that I didn't know the difference
---
As one of the least played classes you'll enjoy a lot of loot for sure :)
---
Honestly, T1 is probably the least offensive of the three Hunter tiers, but it doesn't actually look like a Hunter at all, imo. It looks like a warrior set that got pushed onto Hunter because they couldn't make furs work graphically and not look like shit. 
---
That's a problem that Hunter tier has even today. Sometimes you get objectively cool or ridiculous sets like the Murloc T11 or the Dragonstalker T13 that actually looks kinda cool, at least the helmet part, but it still doesn't scream "Hunter". There's never been any furs draping over the shoulders, the vest or the waist or anything. There's no gun belts (that I can remember) or knives hanging off the side of the leg. It's just random, usually bland sets with no theme to it.
---
The real kicker here, is come WoD, which while a garbage expansion, did have Durotan. He has a HUGE fucking wolf skin draped over his back, a wolf pelt belt with an animal skull on it and animal skin lined wrists/boosts to match. Why did Hunter tier never get this treatment? You can keep the "mail" look underneath, just toss a fucking fur on it or something, Jesus.
---
Good type broken or broken broken?
---
You won’t top healing meters, but you are still needed in raids for HoTs, buffs and innervates and as the least played class you will most likely easily find a raiding guild as a healer.
---
The lack of an out-of-combat Rez can hurt during Dungeons while leveling.
---
As raids usually have less Druids than other healers, you won’t have much competition on designated Druid gear. 
---
Afaik Resto is quite good in WPvP, though it’s one of the hardest classes to master.
---
&gt;Friendly reminder: Gamergate was about ethics in corporate journalism
---
Maybe you think that, but the fact stands that the actual real behavior of gamergate was the relentless harassment of predominately minority and female figures. People can do awful things when they've genuinely convinced themselves its actually a "cause"
---
It's sort of like Catan, where friendships go to die.
---
Depends on the guild sometimes as low as two
---
Is there a TL;DR somewhere ? I'm curious to see what's the theory.
---
It's hard for me to say because I've only come close to going over the 5-day threshold once, but generally yes.
---
Last time I was at my GP for depression she asked if I needed any time off work and if so was happy to write a fit note for me so I could take a fortnight off. It's not that uncommon if things get bad.
---
Also yes, I have called in sick due to just not having the willpower to go in before. Everyone was fine with it, and would be if anyone else on my team needed to do the same.
---
Come to explore a new zone, stay because you're being camped relentlessly.
---
Pretty excited about it. She finally agreed to try and got hooked on the stress test... reminded me of my first time playing. Only needed to get to about level 5 before I went and set up my own account.
---
Mulgore is a poor man's Tanaris :P
---
yeah imagine being Mark Kern, making shit up to try and resurrect his dead career on the back of a popular soon to be released product.
---
1. duskwood: because of its ambience, huge contrast to the other happy rainbowy unicorn starting areas before it
---
2. teldrassil: love the music and the questing expierence in general, dont like elves that much, but if theres a class traniner i run with my dwarfs/humans/gnomes there
---
3. tanaris: probably had my most pvp fun there, the field feels more evened out, more 40-50 questing/pvping there and less 60s ganking than in stranglethorn. love sandstorms, the tracks in the sand telling stories and love zul'farrak
---
There will be plenty of addons that bring the Focus Frame back. It existed in Vanilla before Blizzard made it official.
---
Yeah I may do tailoring and enchanting as well. I'm very undecided
---
Is this the beta? [UD rogue is level 31?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEGFUOcq1E&amp;t=0m41s)
---
So glad to see Jeffery get some recognition !
---
Broken broken, and one of the least played classes in general.
---
The mechanics themselves were much simpler in early raiding, but attuning 40ppl plus backups took forever. And dont get me started on the countless gearing runs through DM, Strat and BRS to get those 40ppl sufficiently geared to even start.
---
And lets not forget what i rarely see mentioned...the lack of online resources. There were no guides for new raids. You had to get in there and figure it out.
---
cant find anything even close to beeing relevant to your point. unless you post evidence that blizzard started developement of classic wow before the whole nostalrius signature thing, im going to assume you are full of shit. have a good day.
---
Get ready to buy arrows again.
---
The idea that the UI prevents you from having fun is a completely mindbloggling idea to me. I don't know how it could possibly bother someone that much. We'll have to agree to disagree there.
---
Ashenvale is bis

Maybe that's it then- English is not your first language. You type / speak over-the-top proper, and it gives off a holier-than-thou and condescending tone. Also, yeah, the whole question to begin with is kind of silly. If you are truly trying to live your life as an intellectual, forget about video games right now, maybe an hour or two here or there of something quick to relax, but you're in school with a family dawg. 10-20hrs a week could be put toward them, or even toward a better hobby, something you didn't already COMPLETELY do for thousands of hours back when you were a kid. I apologize for my tone in my post, I was just trying to sling some back at you. But if you really didn't intend on making anything sound condescending then i'm sorry. English is a shitty and confusing language and unfortunately speaking it 'properly' ends up being far more proper than what is generally used. I wish you the best. It sounds like you've got a lot going for you, it sounds like you work very hard. Just keep it up. I doubt you will have the time (or doubt you SHOULD have the time) to truly enjoy it like you want. You will think it's a grind and then be worried about fitting everything into your schedule. A lot of us playing would be happy to not even reach 60 in the first few months. Just roleplaying about the world, being a small adventurer, dying to hard quests, making friends, making memes. At this point, for you, it would have to be like meditation for you to enjoy it from what it sounds like. There will be no new experiences (in your eyes), just something that overall relaxes and calms you to do. Either way, I wish you the best.

Neither, Troll is better.

Azuremyst Isle and Eversong woods are underrated

"I have diarrhea" works like a charm. Nobody asks questions, nobody asks for a doctors note, if anything they try to get off the phone with you ASAP.

Strangle Thorn Vale
---
May have had something to do with the fact that I played on the German realms all the time :D
---
I would be hesitant to level enchanting on an alt because: 
---
1. Lots of high end patterns are raid drops. 
---
2. The other source of income comes from DEing higher end BoP gear. It may be harder (not inpossible) to collect this gear on an alt.
---
Yea but there’s not a lot of things you have to do
---
Healers can keep up dual wielding Fury tanks on private servers without running out of mana. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that Druids against bosses with 14% parry take less damage than dual-wielding Fury Warriors on private servers. Not an issue.
---
One time I had my PIC log into battlenet and ask me to fill in a shift that day. Our manager had told him they couldn't get ahold of me. And he was all, "I know what to do!"
---
Female tauren bis
---
Ah ok, yeah I may just do tailoring and enchanting on my main. I just didn't know if engineering was necessary for classic.
---
TBC also had pretty hefty spellbatching delay/issues, I played a lot of Paladin in Arena and if you tried to holy shock your ally and he went behind pillar at the same time you would often trigger cd but the heal wouldn't go off
---

---
People talk about raids being easy then complain about respecc costs? I remember our guild struggling with raids, and we had a lot of hybrid specs and pvp or semi-pvp specs. I loved the high respec costs. It forced the bulk of your members to sacrifice and make tradeoffs
---
I played WSG on the stress test and three times I had my ally die as my heal was going off (and seemed to have healed for zero). I played priest back in the day and I don't remember this happening, at least it was not happening this often.
---
This is in fact not the case, as the textures are far lower resolution, so much less VideoRAM needed.
---
A 10 year old computer would be able to handle Classic without problems.
---
Any links to a good tanking rotation guide?
---
To me it will always be Winterspring. I still love that place!
---
Silverpine forest and then hillsbrad, it's by undercity, take zep from org to get there
---
One problem is Blizzard is using the newer API which doesn't allow for certain scripting effects like focus, but at the same time they don't have focus target frame. So not sure how Addons will add that.
---
Druids are good, and battle rez can change a wipe into a kill.
---
If his BoP went off the first time he tried to cast it, it would be fine.  The second one was way to late, and he would have died in original too.
---
Of all the playable races, Orcs were the first Warlocks.
---
This is what mmos are all about.
---
After naxx comes fresh.
---
Give us specs lol you can't just say "a laptop"
---
For me it's Hillsbrad, Barrens, Westfall and Tirisfal Glades
---
Depends on your goals. Class and role play a part in it. Engineer is always solid for raiding and pvp. Tailoring gets you access to some caster specific preraid gear.
---
Nah, I'm not sure of the process of enabling stuff like that for Mobile, was talking about the desktop version ;(
---
I like how you link this totally not insanely biased and left-leaning portal as proof.

[Here is a much better summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fnRSL3d_xU) of events in GamerGate for who's actually interested in the truth, in a video format.
---
Gamergate is essentially just regular people pushing back againt corporate, corrupted mainstream journalism. Of course, MSM attacked in full force, and played a victim card, like they ALWAYS do when regular people notice their BS and corruption and start talking openly about it. Gaming corporations defended their peers because they depend on their good coverage.
---
Here's a GG wiki https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=Main_Page

And a summary of early events: https://medium.com/@KingFrostFive/gamergate-august-2014-revisited-3b41832c061b
---
There's nothing in the API that prevents you from grabbing mob data for something other than your target.
---
In another RPG I played some time back, many big guilds discussed where they go, depending on who wants to go together or not.
---
Something similar might happen here, at least for pro guilds that are already full long before launch, so keep an eye on the forum.
---
I can't wait to run around on top of the bank doing nothing. Good times.
---
I don't think you sound entitled at all, unless you are simultaneously very disparaging towards other "off-meta" specs. The very nature of what you're trying to do involves convincing the people around you to give it a try before they're subjected to it, which doesn't sound to me like you feel you have the right to force prot pally tanking down anyone's throat or that you deserve special privileges. You're not pulling a fast one on anyone or cheating anyone out of their time or items. At worst you're handicapping yourself to increase your enjoyment. Completely different scenario from what that other guy does.
---
Not sure if I remeber how those work, but wouldn't I have to mouse over the target to cast the CC. Which would still mean scrambling to target the mob whole it's running around with 40 people and other mobs about.
---
Darkshore.
---
After coming from the lush safe-haven of the night elves you take the boat out from your home to go on an adventure.. you are immediately met with a dark omnious shore where wildlife becomes corrupted, rumors of cultists and large unknown creatures have washed ashore. You work to cure the haunted areas of the shore and uncover the mysteries of the Naga's, cultists and ghosts while resolving a furbolg conflict. Shit just got real - you're not in your safehaven anymore. 
---
It's gorgeous and moody. Always left an impression on me.
---
For me it’s hinterlands
---
Good hunters are one of the most useful classes in the entire game for PvE (yes even in the later raids where they don't scale well) and extremely dangerous in PvP. A good hunter can take down most of the classes easily.
---
Sadly good hunters are so rare, huge amount of players playing this class simply don't care, they leave taunt on, they don't dismiss their pet. Hell they don't even know what most of their spells do. I mean just look some of the beta streams, I've seen so many hunters literally not knowing what to do when duelling.
---
Now I'm not saying every class doesn't have these people, but hunter class just attracts so many people that refuse to learn their class when they decide to do some group content. And it's been like that since vanilla, altough hunter as class has changed a lot and now it's the most braindead classes on retail right now, meanwhile in vanilla it required some skill to be a good hunter, it still attracts the same people. Casuals mostly. There's nothing wrong with that, but damn why they can't choose a class where there's less to fuck up. I have a good patience, but even the most patient person feels dead inside when hunter in your group pulls the entire dungeon for 8th time. Then you just have to call person like this a huntard.
---
And people saying locks do the same. Yes, they could do the same. But it's extremely rare to meet a bad lock from my experience and imp can phase shift anyway. I seriously don't know why it's usually hunters. I mean I get it they attract these types of players on retail because BM has been the easiest spec in the entire game for years, but why in vanilla? Because if I remember corectly they were popular even back then.
---
3-10 extra hits over the course of a ~10 minute fight is "technically" better threat gen, but I can't see it being worth skipping the equivalent of +25-40+ stam.
---
That is correct

Haha! That's amazing, almost makes me want to roll a rogue again so I can show off too!
---
Mine will be alone in all 3
---
1.  Yeah we can play together sometimes but right now I’m doing this and you’re not geared enough for it sorry. See you at work. 
---
2. Yeah I was sick yesterday. Yeah I played some wow. So?
---
3. See #1
---
Summary: be assertive and honest.
---
That looks VERY decent.
---
Can the Portraits be turned off?
---
Does it completely replace the standard UI, or can you switch on a frame-by-frame basis?
---
I think they key here is "not contributing much" not their specs. There are consumables and trinkets that can support almost any play style. Going in to a raid with greens means they aren't trying.
---
People with "meme specs" who try and get the items to support their roles and learn their strategies will usually play better than the people who got their roles just because they rolled the right spec and didn't need to do anything else.
---
You rock. I know so many people that used your addons on pservers, and addon devs never get enough credit.
---
Keep up the good work.
---
Dunno about that. From [This](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/no-focus-unit-unsubscribing-2nd-account/184870/129) thread it makes it look like newer API limits that effect.
---
For me it's: Elwynn Forest, Hillsbrad, Redridge, Duskwood and Tirisfal.  
---
All of those zones also seem to have all of my favorite small towns in them too.
---
A well geared tank is what ? 6k HP ? Do you think having 6300 HP as a Tauren compared to 6000 as another race will make a difference ?
---
If you have only 300HP left, your healers are either dead, OOM or incompetent so you will die 1s later as a Tauren ;-)
---
Stun resist is mostly useless in raid. However axe skill will net you a bit more damages on glancing blows == more threat.
---
Troll master race confirmed.
---
DX12 and Multithreading support is not in the Classic Beta. No word on whether it'll be available on launch, but I doubt it.
---
No plate other than me in my groups because of this shit. fuck paladins
---
BFA has less content than classic.
---
Entitlement?  It's the established courtesy of the game.  You'll get blacklisted pulling that crap.
---
Desolace could be enjoyable if the quests weren't so poorly plotted. Visually it's unique, but I think most people just can't stand how inefficient it is.
---
It's that I've gotten used to the way I have my UI setup that to remove it would introduce such a poor experience that it would frustrate me to the point of not wanting to play.
---
No. I have over a month of sub still and I got removed :-(
---
Sorry but no, Shadowpriests far outperform this specc. As do Enhancers, but that comparison is kinda moot, given that they are not on the same faction.
---
Hearing expansion and vanilla wow in the same sentence makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit.
---
Rising level cap and making previous content obsolete is what killed wow. I'd like to see more horizontal progression, for example, the 1.13 raid doesn't have to be tier 4, but maybe another 20man for smaller guilds, that would still have some good loot so even naxx farmers might wanna do it. They could also add alternative tier 1/2/3 raids so the progression is less linear.
---
hunter tier 2 might look good if it weren't so horrendously coloured.
---
Reckoning is a talent in the middle tree (protection) for paladins.  Assuming you put all 5 points into it, you gain an extra attack every time you receive a critical strike.  You can have up to 4 stacks of reckoning. 
---
What this means is that when you have 4 stacks of reckoning, your next attack will be as if you attacked 5 times.  It does massive damage and can often one-shot people if you get a few crits or if paired with judgment + hammer of wrath. 
---
The term 'reck bomb' is used because of the massive damage you do and because you have it 'stored'- so as the player you know you have this massive damage to unleash on your next attack and you have to choose wisely when and how to do it to maximize the effect.  Having played this spec extensively it does feel like having a nuke ready to drop on some unsuspecting soul.
---
Interesting, I’ve heard of resto being the only class to counter a SL Lock in WPVP. I had no idea they were statistically the least played class, so that’s a huge plus for me.
---
I think the problem with it is when you are trying to get away from multiple people. It would be exceptionally bad for a druid, for example. I'm not sure how it interacts with AOE spells but I'm assuming Tauren will get hit with more of them.
---
My post wasn't exactly the most serious thing in the world either.
---
I started working in Germany and worked there for more than 7 years. 
---
Currently I am working in America and the “I go to work even if I am sick” is bothering me. 
---
I agree with you. If somebody would come sick to work in Germany, they would have get their butt whipped. 
---
Here in America. Nobody gives a fuck. 
---
I tell them, go home, you are contagious. They don’t care. I hate it.
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Reminder: the game is way easier than you remember and you will not have to min-max to win. If you wanna wear tier sets, wear tier sets. A good player in full tier will still outplay a bad play who has a BiS spreadsheet.
---

Abyssal dagger is my favorite looking OSRS weapon
---
I think you asked me, or someone did atleast, when I was doing some leveling 1-20s yesterday. Anyway It does not do anything. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432588754
---
Here's a highlight from classic beta
---
Exactly what I wanted to hear. I remember there being a fair amount of rogues in Vanilla, but stealth was sooooo much fun.
---
yes, everything will get cleared eventually, but it make take an extra 50 pulls that shouldnt have to be done because of a couple people being wastes of space
---
I wonder if he would've changed his mind on Classic if he actually got to try it. In the end I think his opinion on WoW was that it was pretty garbage.
---
If you absolutely must play in a streamer community, Preach is the way.
---
Prot paladin here. Did some MC and Naxx, but man did I love me some 5 mans. I will definitely prot again.
---
I was facing the same problem, what I plan to do I to pick skinning/mining. 
---
You drop mining at 60 once you have enough mats to power level engi; then you drop skinning to pick tailoring. 
---
You get useful mats from the two professions and they allow you to earn gold while leveling.
---
The downside is that you can’t craft your own stuff and bags, and that’s a lot longer to get to your final 2 professions.
---
This is WELL within the 200ms batching window. Not a bug.
---
OK, thanks. It seems like a nitpick but I hope they fix it. Hits feel wimpy right now.
---
Okay has to be a troll
---
This may be a dumb question, but would there be any noticeable benefits adding this to classic?
---
I already have a good bit my vacation used ._. my manager did let me leave early when I got the times wrong for the BFA release...what a waste that was haha.
---
It’s okay to min/max. Don’t listen to these SJWs telling you min/maxing is a bad thing. You’ll be harassed constantly for rolling a Night Elf Priest. Be ready for it if you decide to do that.
---
If we're talking about content exclusive to the phase of the game you're probably not wrong. It's hard to quantify "content" and bfa technically has an endless grind . 
---
I wasn't talking about bfa though.
---
No it’s Tauren hands down all across the board.
---
That's assuming you're using an Axe at all times which is not always a guarantee.
---
Additionally, the +5% hp stacks with all bluffs *and* last stand so potentially if you're in an engage phase, that 500+ hp could be the difference between a wipe or a kill. 
---
To each their own, but I'm sticking with my trusty Tauren... or Human, depending on how my friends feel closer to release.
---
I'm obviously not 100% confident but I'm pretty sure this happened in vanilla.. maybe even TBC. Some part of my brain remembers this being a thing for sure.
---
Sounds hot, count me in.

dicks will never not be funny
---
Ok thanks for letting us know I guess.
---
Warlock wins best overall!
---
Priests have a completely different toolset to offset and balance the fact that they wear cloth.  Why would you throw away a clear paladin advantage for pvp?  Armor and stam is 1000x more important than +healing gear in vanilla pvp.  You are basically a stun/freedom/cleanse/buff bot anyways.  No competent team is going to let you stand there and spam flash of light anyways unless you are bubbled.
---
Or you chose the best Hunter pet ingame, an Owl. So yes you are an awesome Hunter for doing that!
---
"not a huge resurgence" is not "not gonna have any affect[sic]". Of course it will have some effect. I just don't think it will bring about some new golden age.
---
Undead rogue with no jaw and a big Mohawk ?
---
If I re.e.ber correctly. There is a slot at the bottom of the trade window to put your weapon or gear in. Then the enchanter applies the enchant and you tip all in the same screen. Then press accept.
---
I go female undead rogue but yeah basically 
---
Also female Tauren Druid. Ugly AF
---
I was laughed out of a group for wearing cloth pants because I thought they looked cool... yikes
---
No, I simply didn't recall it being in the game at release, WoWHead said 1.11 (which is buggy, though), and I couldn't pull up patch information on any other site. So I am probably just misremembering.
---
Honestly if that happen, I will run DM again until I get one of those weapons. staff of westfall might be fine for a while (not sure if I can use heroic strike with it tho), but chausses of westfall provides +11 strength and it will last you until leather legs from quest chain in gnomeregan. They are too good to pass on. About world drops, there are multiple variants for level 20-25. Bloodpike is just an example of one of many. They dont usually go for much gold, but in case you dont want to afford it, dont buy it. You might as well get a good 1hander until level 29, where I believe, having corpsemaker is a must. (Due to whirlwind axe being hard and very expensive to get at 30). Not to mention, that as an ally, you will get Bonebiter available at 34, that is pure update from whirlwind axe. Only world drop, that I consider a must have is Lord Alexander Battle Axe and I ll be occasionally checking AH prices. By the time I hit 51lvl, I will have more than enough gold to afford it.
---
Yup. I live by the rule if I say I’m sick, that’s all you need to know.
---
&gt; the horse are a bunch of ugly fucks
---
Yeah but what about the Horde though ?
---
:) /dance
---
Id rather keep my integrity and not lie than be worried about them shit talking me. I'd play with em once and if they're not bad id play again. If they are trash ill do content with them where it doesn't matter. No need to be elitist about a social game.
---
I'm pretty sure spell batching was changed in WoD, so it's not like people only have experiences with the limited internet and computers of the vanilla era to compare it to.
---
Most of the bigger streamers are toxic dipshits with a god-complex, usually also sub-par players, who survive because they have a horde of drones around them, that will attack everyone they see as a "threat" to their god, funnel gold/items into him. They also ruin server economies and communities, simply by being there.
---
Kill a streamer? Prepare to get right-click-reported by 200 people, likely resulting in a time ban by some gullible Blizzard Employee. What fun. So not only do we have, usually toxic, obnoxious personality of some internet-persona to deal with, said persona is also surrounded by a fanclub of equal "quality.
---
That attitude is what makes me keep as much distance as humanly possible from them, which is easier for me than for most people, because I will play on the German realms.
---
If you absolutely have to be part of some collective, as outlined above, try for Preach, he's one of the few decent guys.
---
the word Gnomeregan is instant bitter taste in my mouth
---
Most people I’ve talked to hate the look not the poor quests. Granted I’m sure there are those who hate the quests. I never understood hating a zone for it quests though. Like you do you but I don’t get it.
---
Biggest issue of skipping quests is the missed REP. Getting rep ain't easy.
---
Expect the first 2 weeks not to kill any mobs, they all will be dead
---
I expect raiding to be similar to how it is in retail, which was always atleast have flasks and be enchanted
---
As tank i always had pots i dont wanna wipe because i couldnt spend some gold
---
I remember that happening in vanilla.  You would have people screaming in ventrilo "I HAD IT. IT WAS ON MY CHARACTER" when it got returned.
---
There “content” and there’s “things you can do, but 100% don’t have to do”
---
Classic has many things you can do but very little you have to do, especially when raids will be cleared stupidly fast.
---
Discussion about what happens after Naxx isn't complaining. It's discussion. The content isn't new, we know what it is and that it'll end at some point, and some of us like it enough that we'd like it to continue in some form. So that sparks a valid question of *how*.
---
Teldrassil is always a nostalgia punch to the face
---
Yes, but there's really no other way in the new API. At best you could do something like this:
---
    /cleartarget
---
    /targetenemy
---
    /cast polymorph
---
    /targetlasttarget
---
which would for example Polymorph your nearest enemy, so you could position yourself next to the mob you want to CC, but this is not always feasible. You could also create a macro like this:
---
    /targetexact name
---
    /cast spell
---
but this would only work for predetermined targets obviously.
---
How is raid tanking on a warrior? I'm worried it will be a bit boring, IE spam one button click another every once in a while. Am I wrong? Played classic but never tanked I tank in retail and really like it
---
I usually say, only roll a druid in Vanilla if you know what to expect. The leveling is really nice but the endgame will suck out your soul if you are not prepared...
---
Having played a bit, can confirm that it's not just nostalgia. :)
---
Honestly im only gonna play it to gank low levels. Not even gonna touch late game unless being forced by friends :p
---
Thank you for the clarification, I really don't know how to express myself any differently so maybe we just misunderstood each other. I decided, mostly based on other peoples comments, to just not get into it with the same reasoning like the one you wrote above. I think I've romanticized the game in my head too much and that in the end I'd just be disappointed due to time limitations. This is why I also decided to delete my OP. I really hope you, and everyone else, will enjoy the game to the fullest and best of luck!
---
There are some on ownedcore.com for like $1,000 lol
---
The vocal minority are putting me off but I genuinely don't see any reason to not be on the same server as a streamer? 
---
The only thing I can imagine is if they quit playing or change servers, but that's like saying chocolate cake is bad because you'll finish it and not have any chocolate cake anymore.
---
Explosive if you really need that second day
---
Ashenvale.
---
You can also enable that button in the settings if you are so inclined.
---
No communist country ever did that either.
---
You are confusing Communism with Stalinism or some similar fascist regime that abused the Ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
---
Literally everyone?
---
With chocolate cake, you're usually not in for the long haul.
---
With a game like WoW Classic, you are.
---
Well its supposed to look like a spider ala naxxramas so I think it fits. Plus its definitely better than the pally/priest/rogue set
---

---
I think you have bigger problems in life if your battlenet status can affect someone's opinion on you
---
and some hunters even name their pets like themselves so macros like that dont work as intended
---
Any idea on what the regen bonus math might look like?
---
Technically its a new version of the game, content wise sure claiming to be first to kill a boss that was downed 15 years ago is silly.
---
But i guess it rationalizes the crazy amount of time some ppl want to put into Classic.
---
The FUCKING BARRENS BABYYYY
---
Pots aren't allowed in their upcoming duel tournament so he's also trying to practice not needing them
---
It was seemingly part of TBC as well. It was implemented due to technical limitations at its time if im not mistaken, which obviously are not the case nowadays. As hard as im trying, I dont see any positive thing about this feature.
---
So tell me this, what will happen when everyone follows the guide?
---
Completely agree with Madseason. As he has only recently started streaming on twitch I thought it might be completely different to YouTube. However his informative and chilled persona really transfers! Cool dude all around.
---
I can't really dispute your point since I'm not a warrior main, I'm just repeating what I've heard from other veteran warriors,  whether you're right/wrong I don't believe it's that substantial dps increase from one tree or the other , the main reason I think fury was preferred is probably due to /sit proccing self crit on demand which made fury a better choice.
---
But since that's not the case in classic I guess no idea, i'll let others who are more experienced with the warrior class debate on your technicalities though.
---
100 days wasnt enough time? wtf
---
The Shimmering Flats (pre-flood) on a moonlit night is gorgeous and serene.
---
[Sure](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=light+roast+comic)
---
I agree with all your points. OP seems annoyed by the topic.
---
Why not removed? It would drastically improve PvP experience
---
I think it's hard to exaggerate how important music is to the atmosphere of a zone. I think most players eventually switch to other music, but if you want that strong feeling of immersion, you gotta turn on the music and sounds and just let it wash over you.
---
People still play Diablo 2
---
I effing hate Elwyn forest
---
could that be because they're not doing another stress test any time soon? I'm asking because I don't know, or do they plan on doing another one sometime soon?
---
You make me sick.
---
Tanking in vanilla is actually quite demanding. Not so much rotation I guess, but one small mistake with positioning or poorly timed taunting can instantly wipe out the raid. If you're looking for a challenge tanking is definitely for you.
---
Not to mention that the tank meta in classic has shifted to fury specced tanking once you get the gear for it. The fury spec is meant to let you go dual wield and generate as much threat as you possibly can to up the dps your raid can put out without stealing aggro.
---
It's a fun, challenging and diverse role all in all.
---
It's aged very well I think
---
*literally anything happens*
---
"does this mean I got into the closed beta? Better ask Blizzard..."
---
You dont "have to do " anything at all, because its a game. Content is everything a game offers you to do eg pet battles IS Content (not good Content in my opinion but thats not the point).
---
well....considering that i said i didn't really care to play orc, troll, undead, or tauren, that kinda limits it to Blood elf, Pandaren, or goblin. So....good guess?
---
A fun history moment. Thanks
---
If you say so.
---
Rips through casting classes!
---
That's very impressive you managed not to stab your balls or dick with it yet
---
Want to know how I know you're American?
---
Haha. I don't think I support any other off-meta specs. Yes, it is a bit of a handicap, but that's if your only major concern is min-maxing. There are many consumables, trinkets, and other items that can support the tanking role.  I just believe it is more viable than the community gives it credit.
---
I would never recommend pallys main tanking raid boss fights.
---
Thank you! I missed out on classic by a bit I bought wow 1 months before BC came out and only hit max level when WOTLK came out so I never experienced that style of play
---
Ok. Let me display the use of logic for you. The Emerald Nightmare is filled to the brim with "mobs" (not the raid lol, the whole thing). A small area has become corrupted in the "real world", so naturally the "mobs" figure to send in as many troops as possible to help spread the corruption. This is what any thinking organisation would do.
---
If im sick im obligated to stay in my bed and i cant get up to play games on my pc which is literally next to my bed?
---
Any major difference between this and Suf?
---
Right, but flashy spell effects aren't going to crash servers, since the rendering isn't handled by the server. You turn down your settings so your client doesn't crash, but the server isn't affected by it.
---
If everyone in that picture were replaced by modern models, the strain on local machines would increase and you might CTD if your computer couldn't handle it. The strain on servers wouldn't increase though.
---
non shared bgs were not 1.12 thats why we dont want it. 1.12 has shared bgs.
---
The argument of OP could be made for literally anything that was patched in vanilla.
---
I can tell you one example.  I played holy paladin in TBC, but played around with ret a bit in arena.  Important to note that the paladin ability judgement is off of global.  
---
With spell batching the goal to maximize your burst was to land your judgement and your autoattack on top of each other.  So you would use a swing timer, and right as your swing hit mod, you would judge and reapply your seal at basically the same time.  Since the judge and seal were in the same batch, so far as the game was concerned you never didn't have the seal applied so your auto attack would still generate your seal damage.  
---
On private servers this is backwards, since spells are resolved instantly, if I try and judge on top of my auto attack, I risk losing my seal damage on the white hit, so instead as Ret you install a swing timer and ONLY judge between auto attacks.  
---
With the spell batching window on 1-10 stress test, so long as I re-sealed as soon as I judged seemingly I never lost a seal proc on an auto.  
---
I know in pvp duelling spell batching is a big deal as it is functionally allows for ties with certain abilities.  Example Two mages running at each other spamming improved counter spell, on live one will CS the other, even though it seems random which hit the button first.  On vanilla so long as they both go off within that batch window, the mages cab simultaneously CS each other and functionally tie.  While both people CCing each other kinda feels silly, is fundamentally more fair then the game picking one over the other because of 0.01 seconds more lag on one input over the other.
---
Yes it is insanely configurable, you can change pretty much everything
---
Or maybe retarded? Idk it keeps replying
---
Its yucky for people to want to play the game well?
---
Or farm for consumables?  I and many other people missing having to do in world content that actually mattered and made a difference.
---
Also why have shitty gear if you can just play the game and not have shitty gear? Like pre raid bis mostly drops in fun dungeons. I can't wait to farm ironfoe
---
tbh my biggest problem with tbc is that it throws 2 massive continents into a garbage bin and replaces them with a single, small one.
---
the whole expansion system of rising level cap and making old content obsolete just doesn't work.

Yeah, playing WoW is probably one of the only things I *can* do if I'm sick and even then I'm not doing much on it if I'm in that sort of condition. Fishing, collecting herbs, doing outdoor quests... you can do that shit on your deathbed. 
---
Plus when you're dying of the flu, you need distractions. You're desperate for them. Too sick to sleep properly, too sick to stay awake. Stuck in turtorous limbo of pain. Fuck. I'll look for anything in that time to try and take my mind off the pain. So yeah, video games and TV are pretty much it. What else can you do?
---

It is from beta. Zperl has been updated and is now working, I definitely recommend!
---
Paladin tier 2 is still one of my favorite sets in the entire game. I won't be rolling paladin, but I did make one in retail years ago just so I could get that set to transmog into. So sexy idc how overused it is.
---
lol.  The ol' every man for himself, I hope that's working out for you over there buddy.
---
Can't say I've ever really thought about it tbh. I could check my Pserver Warrior and get a rough estimate. But 10% of an already low number isn't very much. 
---
I couldn't imagine it being more than ~20 hp5. Not including potential for ticks when you're topped off, that's ~2.4k self healing over the course of a 10min fight.  I wouldn't call it nothing, but it's not exactly good lol.
---
Don't forget to feign death and be the only one alive after the wipe.

I’m naming an orc rouge “mug mug” and he’s just gonna camp the Storm wind bank or iron forge bank and sap people

Seems like a major hassle for CC classes. Instead of CCing a target and then swapping to main target to dps, and then quickly swapping back when CC breaks to reapply. I have to try and click a target as it runs around in a sea of players and other enemies trying to CC them again.
---
in pic 3 they should all be dabbing and drinking monster energy
---
was in 1.12 so it stays, no changes
---
In theory it does.  In practice, how many of the zones in Azeroth are actually utilized at level 60? 20% maybe?
---
The only thing it makes obsolete are the level 60 dungeons and raids.  But it’s replaced by new content that’s superior IMO.
---
Yea this seems to represent my feelings about playing osrs quite good. I still am not done with osrs at all.
---
Probably, but not nearly as well as usual. Your work would be riddled with mistakes and errors. Better off staying home in that case.
---
I use F1-4, 1-5, qwerty, fgh, zxcvbnm. Not a fan of modifiers.

The fury spec tanking Meta is not an actual thing.
---
It was concieved and practiced on Private servers that as Blizzard is showing with their internal testing procedures to not be accurate in what was displayed there.
---
That being said there are some Gimmicky fights that allow tanks to do some rather unique builds.
---
I might go wand spec into holy actually. Or at least try it out :)
---
Looks like mommas wrong again!
---
Yeah, other zones kinda feel like they made the zone just to be nice, then populated it with quests they thought of afterwards. Everything in newer zones feels like it has to have a purpose in the form of a quest or something, nothing is there just for the sake of being natural.
---
I don't think it's just about crashing servers, I think having the game playable is also important. 
---
Even on classic, if you watch the stress test war or attempted war on the bridge of thandol span when they tried to layer everyone on the same one, things got mega choppy and this was not user specific, every one had mega chop game play. I don't personally want that, I don't think many people do
---
No no, it MAY suck out your soul.
---
It did suck out my soul after my first raid as resto, damn that sucked, but, I spent many many hours having fun as feral after in world pvp and dungeons. So its not all bad. Just a friendly advice. Make sure the druid is for you! If it is for you, great!
---
It's who I remember seeing the most of.
---
I mained a warrior and a priest in Vanilla.
---
As a priest I wouldn't give a shit about a tank racials, but I would take the one that knows his job and is not a prima donna any day over the one that have 500 HP more.
---
I maintain that when your Tauren has 500 HP left (so he started with 10'000 HP, T3 and full buff territory here) your healers are OOM or dead, they wouldn't late the tank go so low otherwise. So this is a wipe anyway.
---
Yeah maybe once or twice you will avoid a wipe after a big damage spike while your healers were asleep but is it worth choosing a race just for that ? Not imo. Choose whatever you like the most, I went with a dwarf then an UD myself.
---
Fwiw I like Tauren tanks the best (but don't like playing them), not for the HP but just because they look like the quintessential tank to me (I don't know how alliance let gnomes tank, I wouldn't feel secure behind that ! :p ).
---
I love the undead zones, way less walking and everything is close
---
Thousand Needles at night. Trust me, go see it yourself
---
Ah, now I understand. You want to be able to macro with the focus frame. Unfortunately, it's not possible and I think Blizzard is making a mistake not including it. The best you can do is use an addon to create focus frames and use mouseover macros.
---
Druids have flexibility, but you’ll have to work at it. You won’t top meters and if you’re ok with that you’ll be fine. Success as a raider is in boss kills not topping healing. You are one of the ultimate support classes. You’ll probably have to fight the notion that you’re less of a healer than shaman/priest/paladin, same thing with tanking for dungeons but you’ll make it work, it’s not as bad as anyone is saying, just stick with it and learn your craft.
---
The proc rate is extremely low. It doesn’t matter what private servers has it set to. You definitely could go an entire boss fight and have it not proc a single time.
---
Jesus Christ. No crap it’s just a game. We are talking about the game specifically dude. To raid and clear bosses or pvp, you don’t have to do many things.
---
Respect to you for crediting the original creator I assume you read my comment from 3 years ago
---
boomers
---
A bit of touch up and this could have ended like the better version of Claws of Shirvallah druid talent during WoD
---
\#no changes,
---
I hope blizzard plans to expand the removal of addons that weren't in vanilla like they are for decursive and heal bot \[I dislike that they are for older existing addons like these but there is not a way to change their mind now\]. This addon wasn't in vanilla and it breaks the classic experience using new raid frames that weren't available at the time as well as simplifies the game.
---
Azshara was great. I remember farming Runecloth off the elves on the northern part. It wasn't a well-known spot, and the elves died and respawned quickly. Really enjoyed the look and feel of the zone.
---
Also, great work man!
---
Wand spec and spirit tap are a must early on
---
Nice. Gonna bookmark this thread for future reference =)
---
Yeh iron Forge is one of my favorites aswell. I love it!
---
I also love undercity, but that will forever be dead unfortunately lol.
---
I think warriors etc had to learn it but not rogues
---
Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.
---
Teach a man to fish, and he complains you didn't cook it for him.
---
&gt; rouge
---
Oh boy
---
&gt; he’s just gonna camp the Storm wind bank or iron forge bank and sap people
---
You realize that sap brings you out of stealth in vanilla right?
---
&gt;You say that I, or anyone else, isn't entitled to anything, yet you feel entitled to take gear for a role that you aren't filling/performing. Hell, why not roll on agility leather as well? Got to get that ret set up to par and that rogue doesn't need it that much.
---
I'm running the dungeon, same as you. I'm doing my job, same as you. I'm there for loot, same as you.
---
The tank wants the gear to tank, neat. I also want the gear to tank. I also need it for the overworld, as trying to farm anything in healing gear as a melee class is absolutely miserable. I don't even need it for an offspec, as my main spec is 20/31/0. I'm the raid's BoSanctuary buff bot. I'm the guild's alchemist, farming mats for potions and what have you. I might not need it *as badly* as the tank, but that doesn't mean i don't need it.
---
Bringing up ret is adorable hyperbole at best and an outright strawman at worst. The gear I'm rolling on in these 5 mans aren't going to make me a better healer, but they *are* going to make everything else about my character easier.
---
So bring on your hate, call me names, insult me. Don't give a shit. Still rolling on that sweet, sweet tank gear. Their time isn't worth more than mine, and I'm not going to gimp myself in every other aspect of the game because tanks are special snowflakes with actual entitlement problems. I'm saying i deserve the right to roll on gear, you're saying they unequivocally deserve to receive the gear. We each think the other is wrong, but I've already said i don't mind casters rolling on things i need to heal, so between the two of us i don't think I'm being the hypocritical one.
---
I whish Shaman wore plate and had those dam bubbles !
---
Yeah I think that also has to do with why I can't see the emblem, being on mobile .
---
It's ok though, I'll live :D
---
&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
Gallywix was always supposed to look like that. They just didn't have a fat goblin model until quite recently.
---
That’s the mindset I intend on going in with. I just want to live the lore and help out where I can, with the occasional clutch innervate/brez and maybe relive a fond memory of the moon fire that killed a boss in ZA back in TBC when the entire raid wiped. 🤤
---
It's mainly the voice actor, imo. If he was the same character but didn't have such a great voice to carry it, I probably would like him.
---
The second one was 'spontaneous' - they plan to do one mid june and mid july as far as I understand. So yea, it'll be about 3 weeks.
---
What about the fact that we had no cross realm battlegrounds for the other 11 patches? No changes would mean we implement no cross realm battlegrounds for the majority of the phases.
---
I’m really glad none of my coworkers know about my WoW life. Feels like I’m hiding an addiction.
---
Wait...
---
Played  up to wrath back in the day and really looking forward to Vanilla. Do I need to buy all the expansions to play Classic?
---
"mmhmm mhmm"
---
.5 gear won't be available until phase 5, so the best gear without raiding for along time won't even be that good.
---
I mean, this might be true for some but Asmongold (like him or not) isn't going anywhere. Dude's been making WoW content for the better part of 10 years at this point.
---
No, but I would upvote it.

If I remember correctly Phase Shifted Imps are fine..
---
*whoooosh*
---
&gt; You aren't going to call in for a cold though.
---
I can, and I do and it is encouraged at most places I've worked and I only see that as a good thing. There are still those people that insist on coming in regardless and sit in packed meeting rooms sniffling and coughing.
---
Why anyone would think a cold is not a valid reason to call in is beyond me.
---
Its looking like dungeon mobs in the classic beta are not hitting as hard as they do on pservers. If raid mobs are also easier (pservers have scaled content up to make it harder) the. Fury tanking will be even more viable on classic than on pservers.
---
Advanced sap reduces that chance correct?
---
Grow some balls - if your co-worker is a scrub, tell him that your god-tier adventures don’t have room for peasants.
---
Sarcasm right?
---
All good points. A good grasp of how to play your character, remebering to bring all necessary consumables, and a pulse are without a doubt the most valuable racials. So of course, play what you want. No racial is gamebreaking by any means. 
---
And yeah, is that last 5% HP going to be life or death? Probably not. But it only takes one time where you're knocked down to 499 HP before you get a big heal for it to be worth it. (;
---
In the end, I just like playing the biggest possible races in mmos so I'd probably play a Tauren regardless of their racials lol.
---
Nicely done! You are like the Rextroy of classic beta.
---
Ashenvale was really special to me, coming in from darkshore it had a more peaceful and soothing look, they had the road path to the  main hub on like a ridge where you could see down on the land and that was the first time i saw how much depth was in this game.
---
Bnet is the true villain here
---
Speaking of returning players. Make sure you find your friends or register!
---
https://vanillafriends.com/
---
Kudos to the guy who made this/linked it on this subreddit, I found a few friends from the Greymane HWL team I use to play with!
---
RP-ish type guilds seem amazing to me. I'd like to join like an all Druid guild and see what kinds of shenanigans I can get into. 
---
That's something Classic had more of: shenanigans.
---
Man, I hope so. Not looking forward to keeping anything CC if there isn't a user-friendly way to do it without scrambling to require the target.
---
Asmon is a very entertaining streamer, so I don't want to take anything away from that... But he's trash at the game. He DOES have knowledge (an impressive amount) but he's not an above average player. I love him, but I wouldn't take serious mechanical advice from him
---
Tauren play throughis incredible, with barrens after this...
---
Also proceed to the nearest safe space.
---
good thing there are changes.  and Startattack is in the beta.
---
Eastern Plaguelands! Lol I love Mulgore- I used to travel all the way over with my undeads just to level up there
---
do this when Classic launches, not on beta.  the streamers won't agree to do it.  
---
almost no one is in beta.  it's like saying, we are having a memorial service in Fiji.  It's OK that no one is able to come to Fiji - a few people are there.
---
A very good player with a sub optimal spec tends to be OK, but a mediocre player with a sub optimal spec just brings everyone else down. This is the main problem, a lot of bad players want to play weird off specs and it just makes it harder for the others that are carrying them.
---
I play gnomes almost exclusively. Do what your short heart tells you 😄
---
That would be preferred that the release schedule would mirror vanilla in the exact months leading up to 1.12. It's aggravating enough the game is going to be released on August 27th of 19 as opposed to November 23rd of 04 making it harder to follow the same schedule upon it's release on August 22 of 06 637 days after launch. 
---
However since that seems unlikely do to budget and time restraints this is the closest we'll have to stomach for now for minimal maintenance. If it over all means no changes over all then it's a barely tolerable compromise.
---
Maybe, didn't last time but we'll see. I generally extend the offer to help the person get their gear afterwards, and having a dedicated pocket healer usually makes up for me taking that one shield they wanted. That's, ironically, how i got into my first raiding guild.
---
A Lanister always pays his debts and whatnot.
---
Can you link? Only blue post I've seen says 400ms. https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748
---
"Any action that one unit takes on another different unit used to be processed in batches every 400ms."
---
Purple one, because if you're pro alliance you'll get it as a mount too
---
Incorrect. Troll is the best tank
---
lol, it has happened in combat several times when you are in groups for WQs etc, when people join/leave, sharding gets all fucked up.
---
I played druid on a pserver some time ago. I'll try not to repeat what others are saying, but I mostly agree. I would like to add the following 
---
Druids are SO OP out in the world it's ridiculous. You won't kill everyone like hunters, but you won't die either. Quite a lot of tricks and subtle decisions to learn by playing, really fun.
---
On max lvl druid healer is great in pve. I got a lot of whispers for PUGs or organised raids en 5mans.
---
1/29/21 and 8/13/31 are great healing specs for both PvE and PvP. I prefered 1/29/21 when I hit 60 and had crappy gear, since this build gives you a huge mana pool. But both are fine. I never played a 24/0/27 spec (cos I love feral charge), but that's supposed to be a good build as well.
---
The one and only major(ish) downside of playing druid was the gear management imo. Swapping int / stam / str, tanking, dps gear, cloth and leather, maybe some more int for AV, whatever. Quite tedious. But others like gear management, jusy to keepin mind.
---
Being out in the world and being adaptable is so much fun. 30-40 is maybe the most fun in wPvP I've had. Absolutely disgusting. Now I'm broke, but had to leave my last 2 cents
---
It's possible it just respawned while you corpse walked?  I've noticed rare spawns during the stress test seemed to respawn like regular mobs.
---
According to what? It was stated to be 400ms back in this blue post from 2014. https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748
---
Play a Roman.
---
Hunter.   No doubts about it.  You will have a lot of fun.  Great threat dumps, lots of pulling in dungeons, you wont have an issue getting in raids unless your in a guild with a million hunters.
---
I mained hunter for most of my time wow, since mid bc.  I always felt like such a tit when I accidentally pulled half of gnom because of not dismissing the pet.  Though didnt you lose happiness on the pet with a dismiss?
---
there are plenty of bugs that were never intended and are used including in pvp.
---
Whether or not they are 'game breaking' is up for interpretation.
---
So let me get this straight: you gain a stack of reckoning when you land a critical strike, and then it’s not immediately used up afterwards? Like do you have the autonomy to save up these stacks after critting a few times and offload them with an active ability for a huge windfury type attack?
---
Aren't trolls and undeads even considered? I plan on playing an undead warrior, but i probably won't tank raids, only 5 mans.
---
Cross Realm Zone
---
The one big problem with this idea is the 16 debuff limit. If tons of people want to bring a spec that needs 1-2 debuffs to function, its just not going to work.
---
Likely not. Classic will require DirectX 11 compatible hardware. The oldest of those are 9 years old.
---
I mean it's a feature ... if you want to pull the entire dungeon
---
What if the teacher is literally the age of his/her students?
---
Despite the gear dependency, does anyone have experience playing a warrior casually? Maxing out around 10 person dungeons, maybe some ZG  or AQ20. emphasis on pvp though, playing with friends. 
---
I love the warrior class but am worried that my lack of ability to gear in a relatively timely manner will hinder my end game play time. 
---
I dont mind the leveling grind. I enjoy playing in groups, and I like tanking when necessary. 
---
Is it still a fun and rewarding experience maining a warrior that is full blues, a few epics at most? 
---
Does it just depend on what I want out of the game?
---
We've managed it. If the one hunter misses, we wipe and go again.
---
Hands down my favorite starting zone. The peaceful majestic  tauren might seem like calm beasts but they dont fuck around. Cant wait to roll my female tauren shaman 30/0/21 gonna heal and secretly blow shit up.
---
Mana tide totoem ? Whats that ?!?
---
Was definitely me that asked (TheOrkishslave on Twitch). Thank you so much for following up on it!
---
non instanced raiding was the single best feature of EQ. Guild rivalries without PVP was so much fun and it added meta games like who had the better monk to corpse or train each other
---
Troll is actually the best tank for the higher threat generation
---
Anything Forsaken themed... God it's so good.
---
&gt; that they reconsider the large window.
---
They added the large window because the community begged for it...
---
"Take a seat and pray that you don't get one-shot by a rogue I throw some lore your way."
---
Tier 1 - all good except Paladin.
---
Tier 2 - all good except Warrior.
---
Tier 3 - all bad except Shaman and Priest.
---
And then we had TBC where everything looked...just, god awful.
---
I think AQ and Naxx were the point where they started trying too hard to make sets look flashy and cool, then in TBC it went into full overdrive. Floating crystals on gear, more neon lights than a bloody KISS concert.
---
Are you able to get the enemy total and current HP? Because if yes, that's a bug. You couldn't do that in classic, deliberately.
---
How about enemy buffs and debuffs?
---
The best you can do is roll the opposite faction on a server that is heavily swayed in one direction and convince as many friends or people who play as you can to do the same.
---
We can't rely on adding a blizzard system to fix this issue and compromise the integrity of the game.
---
I played mostly alliance, always felt we had prettier cities, the paladin was a better PVE support class than the shaman, and we had greater numbers, at least on my server.
---
thats pretty much my point, there is numerous unintended bugs being used and 'exploited'.  Blind hunter isn't that much more OP then something like Broken tooth, its just a different flavor and a unique reward.  
---
Its not a particularly strong pet, its just annoying and never found it that brokenly OP
---
I find it's best to start with money makers, not spenders
---
Yup I love the night elf lore and zone, seriously so much fun! 2nd fav zone to the Forsaken leveling areas (Trisfal, Silverpine forest ect)
---
Probably
---
i'm in the reduce or eliminate batching crowd
---
Favored in PVE and yet they weren't the first to clear MC, or AQ, or Naxx.
---
It's strange, I think. People have wanted this for so long, and now that it's happening, they want new stuff. I GET it, don't get me wrong. And honestly, I don't know how the conversations used to go. Like, before Classic was announced, did people talk about what could be added post-Naxx? (I'm legitimately asking, because I don't know, and I don't want to assume things.)
---
That being said, I wouldn't be OPPOSED to some new stuff being added years down the road, so long as they were on different servers. We wanted vanilla, they said we're getting vanilla (I mean, mostly). It would be awfully silly of them to suddenly convert Classic servers into TBC servers in a few years, because that's not what was promised, and it's not what was asked for.
---
So yes, I understand the fear that it'll get stale. But releasing more content is a slippery slope. At what point is it no longer Classic? When would we all look back and say, "What happened to the promise of vanilla? We're four expansions into this. We should start a petition for vanilla servers."?
---
Yep, was talking with coworkers about re-release when I realized this mid conversation. Can’t play with them. Oh well
---
Whelps, left side!
---
I would quit with my income and invest it into another money maker and ghost every single one of my fans for classic. That's how into the game I am
---
Everyone saying spell batching isn't working properly should first make sure they have read this blue post from 2014 explaining how spell batching worked prior to Warlords of Draenor.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748
---
Maybe it isn't accurate but you should know. I would like to see Blizzard explain it and make sure it is working accurately and maybe even consider changing it.
---
#Crushim!
---
I second this.
---
Yes. But you keep food with you. And you can always use stay + eyes of the beast to jump them dowb
---
Yea I could live with Wotlk without the flying.
---
If you're willing to heal, shaman will always find a group. Rogue may sit in que for a few.
---
[https://classicwow.live/guides/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-phase-1-new-meta](https://classicwow.live/guides/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-phase-1-new-meta)
---
It was always fine to have a raid with 2-3 off specs. The number of people who want to play those off specs are much higher than this, though. A raid with 5 ret paladins and 4 boomkin is going to really struggle to clear content with such low dps.
---
Actually you're right.
---
That and falling off the tree in search of the fabled Kalimdor location
---
Fury tanking will be a thing, it's still the highest TPS spec. You will be taking more damage due to parry haste, but it's the same across the board, it only forces you to use your shield swap macro more often.
---
&gt;I've had Beta &amp; Stress Test and only had access to stress test, never had it removed and it is still there
---
Literally same. Had 2 ptr and only got access the day after the first stress test.
---
Haha I literally only noticed the mage stood at the back recently
---
I think I agree though I haven't actually played the beta yet but just hearing up to 400ms sounds terrible.
---
being a druid would truly be the definition of being mediocre at everything lol
---
Yes, just like it has been for the past 15 years.
---
I played a decked out holy paladin in a Top 5 realm raiding guild from 2004-2007, they’re an exceptional main tank healer and a strong support class. They do not provide meaningful raid DPS or level that fast, they are universally wanted in groups for a variety of buffs and very strong healing abilities. They’re mostly unkillable in PvP but also, don’t kill.
---
I dunno Bwon seems pretty dope. He's like the chillest of all the "hades-like" entities in that world. By hades-like I mean some kind of after-life watching over entity like the Lich-King or Eyir or the Waycrest Manor last boss. Bwon is fair and makes deals that he keeps.
---
Honestly the only thing I didn't love about Vanilla. I've come back to WoW multiple times because tanking is so much fun to me despite how mediocre the rest of the game has become, but having genuine tanking options is amazing. I remember pally tanks actually being really strong pre-raids. Mana issues aside I would imagine the issue with offtanking is more that they can't turn back into fury warriors on other fights than anything.
---
130-150 resistance, and you will be unkillable machine for that certain element in pvp
---
I will pwesonally go for a Tauren Warrior. The bonus stamina and aoe stun are very nice. My main reason is the buffy look of the Tauren though. Also I love to play their starter zone, Mulgore is amazing!
---
I always liked winterspring. Feels like home
---
Because it's not my first character anymore. I've seen the look already many times over. If I want to see it again I can just come back on an existing character too.
---
But there's only so much time in the day, and I need levels to do the things I want to do on this new character. Which leads to hating bad xp/hour.
---
Even on my first alts way back in the day this was the case. It probably depends on how old you were though.
---
Yup, the whelpling pets usually went for around 700-1000g and was basically a free epic mount
---
Don’t forget thorns, root, tranquility... Druid is all about having all your forms and tools ready. Even if you’re specced resto you can swap into a feral staff, tank a few hits / do some damage when stuff goes sideways. 
---
Endless possibilities with the class if you’re ready to use at least 40 key combos :)
---
I appreciate the normal nathanos too, but no. The  banshee queen's right hand advisor should definitely have a unique model with its own voice actor. You might not like the direction they've taken his character or the writing in general, but in vanilla he was a stock undead and the only indication he was important was quest text and glorified fan service.
---
Imagine tuning in on goldshire inn "randomly"
---
thats a shitload of latency to introduce just to try and be faithful to the feel of a 2006 infrastructure.
---
Vashj'ir hands down
---
I'd argue its purely a time thing up to a point. When the raids get harder in AQ it tends to be that guilds will either quit or start enforcing playing better builds.
---
Ironforge without hesitation.
---
As an Alliance main, he was pretty good at slaughtering us even without the help.
---
Whelp, time to toss this one. It's defective.
---
Everyone just ignoring the Hinterlands...:(
---
I mean if this is true that’s unfortunate, but I’m still gonna use ElvUI cause I’m not paying him for it
---
Ah that little wc jump... The memories...
---
yeah whereas live it's a travesty if a mage can't heal for some reason. classic is like a million piece puzzle that when it all fits together is so incredibly satisfying, whereas live is this weird amorphous puzzle with 4 pieces and all of them fit together no matter to placement or rotation so you're like "why even bother putting this together?"
---
In Sweden you can be sick for any amount of days and you get half pay. After a week (I think) you need a note from the doctors, just to prove it's real (or rather, your employer *can* require it, but in my experience most do).
---
So it's more of a good faith thing for the first week. The first day is completely unpaid to avoid abuse, but still, you can do it theoretically as much as you want (but practically people will start asking questions if it's all the time)...
---
So in some places it's not as clear cut!
---
Holy crap I forgot a out eyes.  I used to love using that. Back when pvp groups talked to each other I used to use it to spy, or just piss off hordies so they would take a second to kill my pet and give us a bit of time to get a defense in place.  God I miss that ability. 
---
Never occured to me to use it for actual pve things like this.  
---
Only time I used it in pve was a wrath naxx pug that fell apart due to the group running it was using dkp.  For a pug.  And thus all the pug kids who weren't part of their guild could get nothing from the drops.  Everyone was bickering inside the portal so I got pissed, eye of the beast, pulled a third of the arach wing and then popped out and misdirected/volleyed to a tank and dipped.
---
They are outstanding tank healers
---
Same, I'll use a couple days, the Monday and possibly Tuesday the week after launch. I got burnt by Blizzard using days on launch days, plus if you use the Monday and Tuesday it let's you go hardcore the weekend of launch so your not too far behind.
---
 !RemindMe 80 days
---
i loved when you fought Dr Weevil who was a gnome but needed a raid group
---
Shh, they dont understand that
---
Was about to say this. People are paying $1,000 for TEMPORARY beta access. Insane.
---
It seems spellbatching is even delaying looting, which shouldn´t really be the case &lt; it just seems all laggy
---
It depends what you want from your tank. Technically speaking, a troll is the mathematical best option. HP is a weird stat. It's obviously a needed stat, but let's say you never drop below 700 hp during your boss clears, you technically would have never actually used 699 of your HP, making that 699 HP effectively useless in this context. This would essentially nullify the reason people pick tauren. A troll provides the best TPS. This means dps can do more damage, meaning the boss will die quicker, meaning the healers are less likely to go oom, meaning the tank is more likely to survive. Taurens have their place in progression, but as the guild improves (via gear and skill), the viability of a troll begins to outshine a tauren.
---
Yep.
---
"what joy is there in this curse?"
---
\*bounce bounce bounce*
---
lol thats a penis
---
Really? That's not so bad then, Heard someone else saying 200 resistance = 50% resistance.
---

Pretty sure shes supposed to be a High Elf but wow classic will have her with the Night Elf model
---
Do you have kids? What is the housing market like where you live? How about the median income for your field? Which field is it, and what is your experience? Does the field have a high entry level of commitment that tapers off with seniority? Do you have a spouse? Is she well? Does anyone in your family have any recurring medical issues? 
---
Top of my head
---
Go watch cartoons. Adults are talking.
---
most fights wont have 40 people taking damage at a time, but as I said 2-3 (a few) will be fine, 4+ is gonna start being worse.
---
I think the second point you make is where we differ.
---
I don't play for or care about good xp/hour. Not what its about for me. Which is why I don't get hating a zone for its quests. I get that people do and that's ok. Everyone is different. I just don't get it.
---
Ya, but it's hard to pinpoint why this matters. It's not like gnomes are phenomenal looking, it's just more my style I think?
---
With gear they easily top healing meters without going OOM and their buffs are great so they are always taken for raids.
---
They are also the hardest PvP healers to kill with great defensive abilities who have the best synergy with Warriors. Paladins are pretty much the reason why Alliance is arguably better in organized PvP despite the Horde having the better racials.
---
Depends what n the server. No one knows until everyone gets on their server and finds out. It will vary from server to server.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Mangeclaw is Good because claw rank 2. And the easiest way to tame him is to bring another pet that hold aggro and just abandon that pet last second.
---
 I'm not sure if it's the prettiest, and maybe it's nostalgia taking, but I've always had a soft spot for Westfall.
---
Winterspring
---
Yes. But had to finish just before Bear form. I hope the characters will not be gone.
---
I am almost 100% sure this is exactly how it was in Vanilla. I think that is correct and should stay this way, or at least that is how I remember it to be.

Mulgore, actually love the fact that's it's so empty, Thunder Bluff is my favorite capital city. The music also hits me right in the feels. 
---
Then probably STV, Feralas and Tanaris.
---
Glaives of Azzinoth disagree
---
Don't forget that you can't swap gear (except weapons) while in combat, so you have to see the guy well in advance for your plan to work. If he has the drop on you, you won't have time to swap gear.
---
One of the dozens! I was always surprised back when the game was fresh when people hated on it so harshly.
---
I got to level 10 in beta last week on a cruise ship. the 800ms ping really isn't that bad for leveling. Considered I played the original over a cantana pointed at truck stop wifi which had about a 1500ms ping I think you could manage.
---
No ChAnGeS!!! /s
---
Yeah but it's only for raid, you get to wear your plate in town or pvp.
---
By choice or?
---
Can DM me if you want to be part of a casual raiding but progress focused guild on launch.  Not every member needs to raid just br civil and helpful to your gmates.
---
Raiding will be dkp based.  My progress in vanilla was main Hunter, officer, clear up to 4 horsemen before BC.
---
You don't have to be alone even if you lone wolf content.
---
Or if it's by choice more power to you.
---
yea because guilds don't exist in retail x)
---
1: we are reading reddit. We are the god ones
---
Btw. Sorry for the wipe. Forgot to dismiss the pet again.
---
I always thought it was poor lore for every important Forsaken to be a near-perfect body. It seemed to counteract their earlier themes of embracing undeath and what they are now
---
Give me an example of a bug they are leaving in the game on purpose that PvP implications that is even in the same ballpark of strength as a hunter pet that is completely immune to CC.
---
Quit being a selfish fucking idiot just because you want to have an unfair edge in PvP. The game should be restored and the integrity of competitive PvP in this game should be a top priority to everyone.
---
Yea I guess it's a slight nuisance to tauren druids.
---
I realize you were sperging out a bit - got that from the extreme melee ranges you used in your example :P
---
I was just posting for any other people that might read the post who were excited about this 'cause I have heard about it so many times by now. I guess a lot of it comes from Sonii playing tauren and him being one of the more popular (I think?) warrior streamers out there atm. I don't know if he, or anyone else, have been saying tauren is the best race for warriors or something. Orc is obviously best both for PvP and PvE. This has been know for a loooooong time. That being said people should of course just choose what they prefer and like the look of - you don't have to min/max everything (pathetic casuals LUL).
---
Alliance is favored in PvE and PvP due to paladins.
---
Horde has a better leveling experience as they have far less travel time later on.
---
Horde PvP racials are good but don't outweigh how busted holy paladins are in pvp.
---
Faction balance shouldn't be an issue as there are more than likely going to be fewer servers as that is the sole intention of layering.
---
Not many on there yet buy I did see one person from a guild I was in an eternity ago so hopefully as more join we will all get reconnected. Thanks.
---
The gnomes are too small in the last one.
---
Who pulled the surger with the core hounds? 
---
I think a hunter did, but he's dead now. 
---
Shut up noob, this is my song. 
---
Sorry!
---
&gt; I tried creating myself a 60 rogue on a Vanilla server to test it a little bit some time ago I was just appaled by the PvP gameplay, and didn't stand it 2 hours
---
&gt;I don't even know how somebody who experienced rogue gameplay in the golden days of PvP during S6-S7-S8 could even endure playing a Vanilla rogue, it's vastly unsatysfying
---
No it is definitely the most satisfying form of rogue to play, your zoomer brain just failed to understand the class exists for world pvp ganking, not BGs or duels. It's perfect proof of how terrible PvP was in the expansions, since they killed off world PvP and made it all about some boring duels and arenas instead of actual war in the wild.
---
\^\^ divorce incoming
---
What about putting talent points in each tree to build the ultimate hybrid?
---
Well, they're not drinking mountain dew or eating hot pockets in the first pic, so i think we're supposed to just assume.
---
Party haste
---
This is why I’m going to play with my friends coworkers and not my own. If they suck they can just talk shit to my friend about me saying they’re bad. No skin off my back.
---
I think we were all shocked the devs decided to implement spell batching. It had been something the community had been begging for for months, but I didn't think Blizzard cared about it. 
---
Now that they're doing it, they still have a lot of work to do. If they knew they were doing spell batching from day 1 it would probably be in a better state now.
---
If I am sick and call out what is wrong with playing wow? How is it any different from watching tv?
---
Generally add ons are written in simple LUA so C++ isn’t needed.
---
My favorite zone in vanilla has always been Winterspring. Every time I level a new character I make sure to hit Winterspring. The music alone is so calming.
---
You arent ready/capable of doing this.  You should shoot for joining a decent guild and climbing the ranks to maybe a class officer.
---
The highly talented will not flock to you.  You will get people who stand in fire and afk.  You will get a ton of drama.  You will get stupid specs.  
---
Im not even trying to be an ass.  You will have way more fun not dealing with it if you dont know what you are doing.
---
I have mained hunter for quite a while and I love Feign Death and am theorizing if you could use it against other classes. You could probably make a macro for swapping full gear-sets and adjust mid-fight.
---
I would spec the pet into frost resistance since frost mages are the pets worst enemy.
---
😂
---
So your version of “no changes” is to erase everyone’s memory so that no one knows how to make things that didn’t exist 15 years ago?
---
How will they know if you are on WoW if they are supposed to be at work?
---
It varied, it was completely useless against some classes but completely broken against others.
---
Not a Zone per-se, but I really like the Scarlet Monastery.
---
Sorry guys, afk bio break, what I miss?
---
I didn't like it at first, but it's grown on me.

---
Please just drop your char name in the comment below to save us all time
---
lol, wtf are you even talking about? All OP is asking is if Blizz is okay with their name being linked to the streamer's image.
---
Lol. I don't think you understand. The internet here is way way slower than 56k. Would literally take over a month to download the game files. Can barely use text websites like Reddit and Gmail. It's impossible. I've tried loading hearthstone on my phone, app is already downloaded, it can't even open enough to connect to the app to go online. I use duolingo to practice my Spanish, it takes ten minutes to load a new section. It's all text.
---
shoulda used a tripod
---
Op said Zperl in another comment
---
Not exactly. 
---
You gain a stack of reckoning when you RECEIVE a critical strike from another player
---
Otherwise you're kind of correct.  You 'store' reckoning attacks until you swing your weapon.  Then all your charges are used up (you don't 'use' any ability) and you attack extra times.  It does look basically the same as a WF attack on your screen, except you'll have 1 extra attack for each stack of Reck that you had.  So if you had full (4) stacks you would have 5 autoattacks on your screen.  
---
You lose reck stacks if you swap weapons, take a flight path, or zone out of where you are.  So you can't like, have a 1h/shield out gaining stacks and then swap to a 2h.  If you do, you lose any stacks when you switch weap. 
---
But if you download a basic addon like 'reckcounter' you can see how many stacks you have at a time.  I play a 26/25/0 spec so I am primarily healing/cleansing/blessing in PVP but then once I get attacked i build up stacks (since I'm not autoattacking) then I can unleash them on my attacker =P  Rogues and hunter pets are the best as they come at you with tons of small attacks that crit often.  Mages are good too because stuff like frost nova and arcane explosion can crit giving you stacks in exchange for very little damage received. 
---
Making sense?
---
That’s exactly what I wanted to hear, thank you. I am so stoked to finally be able to play a Druid in Vanilla. Now it’s time to find an ally guild on the west coast..
---
I have an exam week 2, so no one will question my time off. Just like being back in 2005 haha.
---
HP will always be better for tanking.
---
Bruh, you're writing gibberish but go off I guess.
---
Engineering is very taxing mentally. WoW isn't
---
I personally love Silverpine Forest.
---
Thanks but this article doesn't explain what spell is boosted by all this spellpower ?
---
I don't know anything about paladins really, I thought they were doing physical damage.
---
I mean I see what you're saying - but holy shit you're going to get a bad rep quick that way.
---
Man that's harsh.
---
Cya
---
That speaks more to the talent of one or a few top-tier guilds.
---
Based on these you should never go to Naxx
---
Looks much better on female orc wow wtf
---
I have the original vanilla box, with game instructions, game discs and I think even the cover case.
---
Brought back memories, might dust them off for nostalgia.
---
Dude? What? Absolutely call out for a cold.  If you can get other people sick you stay home end of story. Getting others sick is a dick move
---
How many of those are PvP specs?
---
Hi random guy here, why not just form your own group with a Druid tank?
---
It sounds like you're really trying hard to justify sneaking into groups and blind siding them with your loot intentions.
---
Because we don't know if it's like it was in vanilla and people thing it might be bugged. It's a valid concern. Why do we keep posting why do we... threads? Let them discuss what they want
---
Hunter t2 is not BiS because the set bonus will eat up a debuff slot, and RAP is pretty much useless for every single other class.
---
Go for it, as someone who started his (pserver) Vanilla career as a hybrid intending to go DPS yet ended up healing and loving it I’m always glad to see people who want to play the best role.
---
I just want to play shaman so I can be ele in pvp and resto for raids to just chain heal the shit out of everyone. Chain heal is for some reason the most fun spell ever for me
---
There was a dungeon finder add-on in Vanilla as well. Then there was that quest helper add-on that put an arrow on your screen. You're getting upset about things that people had in Vanilla. Chill. Add-ons can't add flying mounts, reduce the exp needed to get to 60, or get out of the fire for you.
---
Calling in sick = You don't get paid
---
Using a "sick day" is using PSST to get paid for that day you miss.
---
In most of the US, 40 hours worked = 1-2 hours of paid sick time.
---
Seriously though.. I laughed way to hard at this.
---
You can also hit a tauren from far, it works both for and against them
---
Thanks. This is good info. I played a gnome lock to 20 on a pserver recently and also experienced more toxicity than I expected. Granted, I also met some cool people.
---
Maybe not to him but in general not only are trolls considered, they are actually the best tank choice
---
We pretty much have our entire core group of our guild which broke up back in MOP coming back.
---
Two weeks may not be enough, most people won’t be max level by then.
---
He sees you on after work, or randomly checks his apps in downtime and sees you on his bnet mobile
---
Hi, /u/Kovol
---
I think you are used to pirate server spellbatch and not actual blizzlike spellbatch
---
People usually are talking about private servers, which have VERY, VERY wrong values for raid bosses. And the good wrong (bosses being overtunned) but the bad wrong (bosses being heavily undertunned on private servers).
---
Now, Classic starts with 1.12 patch build, which make the raid easier, but not by much. What will matter will be World Buffs, especially Rallying Cry, which have no CD on private servers, but 6 hrs CD in Classic. Another big difference is Black Lotus (main ingredient for flasks) respwan rate, which is like any other herb on private servers, but will have 4 hrs CD in Classic.
---
Adding up the above 3, Classic raids will be roughly twice as hard compared to private servers.
---
That being said, the best guilds will still clear Classic raids much faster than in Vanilla, but much slower than on private servers. But hey, this is why those guilds are THE BEST guilds.
---
The other guilds, which will make up 80% of the Classic population will struggle, just like in Vanilla. The raids in Classic aren't that hard, but Ret/Booms/Enha exclusive DPS raid won't make it. Not enough DPS. Unless they are overgearing the raid by a lot.
---
Was an spriest in pserver and dueled/killed a rogue friend of mine. If it's possible in the og 1.12 and blizz confirmed batching, as well as saying no changes, it should likley be the same. If you could do it then, you can do it now.
---
That's not really the correct way to look at it. It allows the DPS to ramp up quicker. Pull boss, take hit, pop berserking, build a lot more threat than a tauren. Troll doesn't really have much more threat over an entire fight, but they have substantially more threat in the first 30 seconds of a fight. The sooner dps can reliably dps without pulling threat, the sooner the boss dies.
---
Imagine being a fetus and you just wanna google quickly where you came from?
---
You can't fucking ride no matter your passion there's a height requirement and you sound like you swallowed a squeaky too. Good day sir.
---
The best part about tanking is that I get to choose which classes come.  There will never be a single hunter or paladin in any of my 5 mans.  Not one.  Those two classes just seem to attract the meme spec/gear people like moths to a flame.
---
That's another "maybe you do" thing lol.
---
I'm not all that concerned if other players see the same blue-eyed face that 500 other logged-in players also have right now. I don't really care too much if a player sees my clone with an old or new face that doesn't quite match the old face, they're still seeing a clone of numerous other players.
---
As an RPer I get wanting people to see your character a certain way, but actually RPing in WoW taught me they won't no matter what you do. I stopped being attached to the idea of people seeing my characters as I want them to be seen a long time ago.
---
If you miss your day job to play a video game you're a fucking moron. As if the 2nd point is even a thing.
---
I was about to come in and say the same thing.
---
Don't forget Illidan's legendary glaive set from Black Temple in TBC.
---
No clue why people are downvoting this, the “classic sucks” people are typically people too young to have played vanilla and feel threatened by its potential.  Typically the unwise shoot something down they haven’t tried.
---
If you are sick stay home
---
I really love Tirisfal Glades. That eerie atmosphere and the calm yet tense music hits me really hard.
---
"People with "meme specs" who try and get the items to support their roles and learn their strategies will usually play better than the people who got their roles just because they rolled the right spec and didn't need to do anything else."
---
I see this all the time in these meme spec threads and it is hilariously baseless.
---
This has been repeated so often, and it is clearly just a regurgitated feelgood circlejerk claim.
---
Why would a meme spec player be better, on average, than a player that specs properly for content?
---
Playing video games takes much more active mental brainpower than TV where your brain is much less active. It's one of the main arguments when republicans say gaming is bad for you. It's not, it keeps you mentally engaged.
---
The idea would be, if you're well enough to be mentally engaged in playing WoW, you probably could have worked.
---
If you are throwing up, you wouldnt play WoW for 8-12 hours that day, you'd have to take breaks to throw up. If you have a migraine, you probably would feel it even worse if you were gaming. If you have the flu, you probably don't have the energy/etc.
---
When the boss parries, its next swing time is reduced by 60% if there is more than 20% of the swing timer left. Having this happen almost 3x as much as it does on pservers right now is a pretty big difference in damage output. This also creates more bursty damage as well.
---
What makes sense from a story perspective, may not translate into a compelling gameplay or world building experience. There could have been ways to Val'Sharrah less of a tangle. Pretty much every zone in Legion, except for may Mac'Aree, struggled similarly.
---
Same here. We get 5 paid sick days a year on top of our allotted PTO days. How we use them is up to us. I generally try to use them for actual days but I really only fall ill 1-2 times a year. They days are use-or-lose and don't roll over so I burn the balance at the end of the year during the holidays. No one actually cares how they're used.
---
Fun fact: they proc off ranged attacks so they work for hunters
---
If it were possible but that is an unrealistic pipe dream. In the same way it is impossible to prioritize thottbot over wowhead which came out in tbc or remove streaming platforms which didn't exist, these are even outside of the influence of Blizzard. Alexensual made pretty realistic tweet about viewers destroying the vanilla experience for streamers like Azmogold.
---
That would be dream outside of taking a time machine back to November 23rd 2004. We have to be realistic however.
---
The best realistic alternative is to just limit any addons made after 2007 and reinstate the way old macros work.
---
Well they were in the Arctic so duh
---
Huh
---
Lol oops auto correct....
---
See you tomorrow:)
---
Even 90 u starting to resist a lot
---
keep nitpicking you chud, the economy goes on
---
It was definitely more subdued than the Fjord. But the music and art style did well to convey a compelling tundra biome.
---
Yeah I'm not sure two weeks will be enough either, but the thinking is that it may be enough to see who were excited at the idea but not the reality, as well as how many officers are in that category. 
---
It's not a perfect solution by any means though. 
---
Anyway Congrats that your old group of friends are coming back!! I hope you guys enjoy it! :D
---
Well it’s a big part of the game but some people don’t like that. I liked world pvp back when I played, but I also put a lot more energy into wow back then too. I still probably will roll on a pvp server, but if I end up deciding I just want to put on Netflix or some shit and just auto attack with my hunter all the way to 60 then I might reroll on a PvE
---
You realise the ‘community’, at least the vocal part, is a huge bandwagon right? Before Blizzard confirmed it nobody gave a flying fuck about it except for 2-3 people, after Blizzard confirmed it everyone jumped on the bandwagon.
---
Is that what's providing the custom map, ability bars and chat? Looks really good nice setup.
---
&gt;  We shared the same account for prolly 6 years as he slowly started playing less. We had an old e-Machines computer and dial up Internet in rural North Carolina. He would download patches at work and bring them home.
---
I wish someone comepletely randomly stumbles upon this thread, and this comment. Imagine reading a thread about classic world of warcraft and seeing people write "Go watch cartoons. Adults are talking."
---
Eh, but it doesn't really work that was as far as I understand. 
---
Let's use your scenario. 
---
You pull and op Zerk immediately. Your 1.9 speed weapon now effectively becomes a 1.71 weapon for 10 seconds. 
---
Over the course of 10 seconds, a 1.9 speed weapon will hit 5.26 times. A 1.71 speed weapon will hit 5.85 times. So popping Zerk effectively gets you 0-1 extra hit before it expires. I dont see that building much extra threat.
---
I think undead isn’t even a bad choice in some fights. You get the second fear immunity, which can be nice since you c any get fear ward and tremor might break fear with a delay
---
There's a 100% chance you delete your account when it is cleared by November at the latest
---
Oh wow. That sucks man. Sat internet is actually usually fast. It's just a latency issue with having to go so far up in space.
---
I'm guessing 3-5 times is the number of times you need to hear your own shit back for you to realise what a colossal fucktard you are.
---
Doesn't this just show that soloing is most xp efficient where you can?
---
&gt; As you can see here on this last play the Cowboys tried to stack the line with an extra tight-end to try and pound it right up inside but the Packers managed to plug up the hole quickly and stuff it causing the loose ball right before his knees hit the ground, fortunately the Cowboys their man was the first to pile on and recovered.
---
Are you suggesting commentary such as this is NOT riveting?
---
That’s pretty intense. So what if he did, I think you can play games when you call in sick instead of getting everyone else sick at the office
---
There already were a few in the beta.
---
Still missing the of
---
It sounds like you do understand you just don't agree with the mentality and have a different opinion. Which is fine, of course. :)
---
I wish I read this thread years ago. Added a guy from work and then felt extremely self-conscious about logging on since the job was very demanding. He'd message me randomly at night saying something like "broooooooooo" or "sup dude?" and then never say anything after I responded. There was really no value whatsoever in adding him and one night at 3 am I took him off my friend's list when he wasn't on and never mentioned it again. We still talk about WoW at work and I just go "oh yeah I never have time to play anymore!"
---
Ok but if I have a cold and don't want to get others sick I see no issue in playing WoW. And you should never play a video game for 8-12 hours a day anyway...
---
November 30th at the very earliest
---
But more than likely no
---
Half brother or adopted or consider yourself brothers but not familialy related.  Lots of different ways to be a family :)
---
Healers can also suffer the consequences of this. I've seen tanks specifically looking for priest healers because they're afraid a pally healer will roll on their gear, which to be fair some do.
---
these were available in Vanilla, tho. it was just called Pitbull back then.
---
Are you asking why we are discussing things about how things are in Vanilla?
---
There was a major bug with using flight masters. You would get dropped off somewhere in between the flight points during a flight.  This happened 5 times to me, 2 times dropping me in Elwyn, and 3 times dropping me in Searing Gorge - on SW to IF flights.
---
Put your hands down dipshits. Smokes, let's go!
---
To answer dude above, plate repair costs are significant. If you're MT or OT guild should be helping with consumables and repair costs but as a Warrior in general expect to spend a lot of extra time farming for consumables and repairs. Warriors are the best they also take the most effort. It's for tryhards.
---
Over 60% of the population living paycheck to paycheck isnt nitpicking lol. Thats 150 million citizens lmfao
---
Whole September off, checking in.
---
Yeah, that’s gonna be a no for me dog.
---
Oh shit, I went from "this is Amazing!" To instantly being irritated after seeing your comment... because now I can't unsee it.
---
But I still like it.
---
Warlock had the coolest tier sets that why I picked one in classic and they had the demons and stuff.
---
One time a friend of ours said he couldn't come hang out over the weekend because he had the GMATs, and then as we're all hanging out we see him log onto league of legends. We didn't let him know about it until after, but we watched him spend the entire weekend playing league by himself instead of hanging out with us. 
---
Big oofs all around.
---
Those numbers are correct.
---
* 100 resistance \~ 25% mitigation
---
* 200 resistance \~ 50% mitigation
---
* 300 resistance \~ 75% mitigation
---
That dog represents the Horde in retail.
---
Nobody gave a flying fuck about spell batching except 2-3 people.
---
I dunno, I’d argue the armor difference is negligible, the AP computation is the same as the  west fall chest (with the Westfall chest offering more +crit, and more +dodge over the Defias chest) 
---
Then the only difference is +60 health which I’d argue is of greater benefit to the war due to not being able to heal themselves. Assuming 50 or so armor loss due to wearing leather, is going to be probably a 1% DR on the high end (don’t have the values in front of me) considering a comparable level 13-17 green that’s probs +3 str +4 Stam) 
---
Similar situation to horde for https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10410
---
Itemization on both is so good I’d argue it’s worth rolling on.
---
Yeah, I've worked up here for 5+ years now so I'm used to it. There are pros and cons. When I'm off though I'm completely off for months at a time and can travel or just stay home and play video games, or do whatever I want. Fortunately my contract ends right before classic wow release date :)
---
Yeah they really do. I hate to lump people all together as I'm not really an elitist, but hunters and ret paladins are generally the worse people I've played with during my 14 years playing WoW.
---
I main a healer so I always put my own groups together just to make sure I'm in charge of filtering out "undesirables" lol.
---
&gt; Because ~~we don't know if it's like it was in vanilla~~*it's not like that on the pservers I played on* and people think it might be bugged. It's a valid concern. Why do we keep posting why do we... threads? Let them discuss what they want to discuss
---
FTFY
---
Thanks!  Our core group is from opposite sides of the country but we’ve managed to stay close friends via other games and even met up in in the past.
---
The thing I’d consider is - wait for people to judge it until they get to 40.  That’s where you get the mount and max a talent tree and the class identity REALLY kicks in and that’s the point where people will know if they’re going to quit or not.  The 25-40 trudge can be disheartening, but it gets so much better.
---
My dad was into quake and the original Warcraft games so he had a PC working by then with okay internet. If you did your chores your allowance would cover the sub haha!
---
I think STV is the prettiest zone. I remember quite clearly as a level 23 running through Duskwood when I tried to see where the southbound road led. Seeing STV for the first time was amazing and I still love leveling there.
---
I’ve seen that guy around Springfield too.
---
One of the only zones I literally never went to during Vanilla.
---
MoBs ArE dEaD FoReVEr!!! 
---
In all seriousness I think blizzard will have dynamic respawns in the beginning, no?
---
Meh depends on why you and you intend to play Classic. Personally I will be playing with my real life friends and work friends. 
---
When I originally played vanilla as a 13 year old none of my real life friends played. As much as I enjoyed playin with guild mates etc. I wished my rl mates had an interest in it. Now a lot of my rl friends and work mates are ex-wow players. 
---
As such I am looking forward immensely to playing the game with them and even the people who will be playing it for the first time. I want adventure at a pace that is in line with my busy real life.  Being able to catch up and stay social with my friends while playing WoW is a no brainer to me.
---
If anything I see myself probably beig in more contact with my mates who live further away than I am now!
---
Orgrimmar looks amazing with the new shadows and lighting. I’m loving seeing the original city with the modern graphic options. So friggin pumped.
---
Holy Paladins are the best healers in the game.
---
PvE, they never run OOM and Blessings are absurdly powerful. they can just spam heals until the end of time.
---
PvP, they're insanely hard to kill and again, things like Cleanse, BoP, BoF, etc. make them a huge asset on any team.
---
that said, healing as one, in PvE, is a snoozefest because it's one button.
---
It is really just the principle of it.  Why roll a Pally in the first place to play melee dps?  Everyone knows what they do best in vanilla, heal and buff.  If you want to play melee dps, just roll warrior or rogue.  At least the hunters will be getting hunter loot, and they rolled their class to dps, no one is going to want to give the ret pally loot that is better off going to a dps warrior.  I don't know how "elite" my guild is going to be in classic, but I would hope it isn't going to have more than one ret pally (who is hopefully being brought for a missing pally buff).  I like to be in an environment where people are putting in their best effort for each other, basically like a common courtesy.  With all the knowledge we have about vanilla now, planning to roll a pally to raid as ret for classic is almost like just telling your raid to fuck off lol.
---
God damn... learn to be upfront with people, in a more tolerable people. Q:"Want to party? / want to help me play together?" A: "No, sorry I'm doing my thing, I usually play solo in this game", "sorry man, I have to grind stuff for raid, I can't help level with you." Responding to simple questions aka "what do you think is best, etc" just fking tell them. Learn to communicate and set your boundaries with people.

---
Tl;DR: mix of ap and spellpower - but instead of a big, slow 2 hander like AP ret that people think about, the build prioritizes fast 1 handers (or manual crowd pummerler cause it's fast as fuck) with procs.
---
- Spell Power buffs seals and judgments, so fast is good
---
- seals should proc shit, so faster is better
---
- stack procs - dragonbreath chili, shadow oil, both should scale with spell power, Ironfoe might be forever BiS cause everything procs it, and it procs everything
---
It's not just a time thing.
---
You can have the best players in the world, if your entire DPS team, as you said, is Ret/Booms/Enha, you won't go past BWL.
---
A beautiful symbiotic relationship.
---
Casual
---
You could work from home, then. My job lets me work from home and I do it all the time, so if I call in sick it pretty much means "I can't functionally do my job today" rather than "I'm a health liability to everyone else." 
---
I know different people use it differently but the culture at my job is pretty intense and I think if I called in sick and then was on a video game the CEO and COO would be legitimately pissed.
---
I looove vanilla best game ever.  But they did struggle to give some specs a reason to be included in raid, dungeon, or bg over similar specs/classes.
---
But i think not everything being viable everywhere is incredibly healthy.  Just wish the underappreciated specs felt like they fulfilled a niche in the 3 places i specified.
---
you can get decent gear through the pvp system. full pvp blues + Arc reaper or TUF can make you pretty strong.
---
I didnt fully clarify, coordinated guilds will allow the tank to get low enough to fully utilize the max % (25% I think?). Not only will this provide more attacks, but those attacks will also provide more rage, which in turn provides more threat. It compounds on itself. It's not a game changing amount, but it is better than you think.
---
How cool will you look?
---
1. Sorry, we’re full on whatever class you’re playing.  
---
2. My wife/kid/brother/etc shares an account with me.
---
3. I’m not obligated to be anyone’s friend. If they get butthurt about it, that’s not my fault. What are they gonna do, report me to HR for not healing for them in Strat?
---
Orc/Human axe/sword/mace skill is a pretty significant dps increase in raids. So it's not like none of the racials matter. 
---
But at the same time, having a small dps increase is pretty insignificant in vanilla raids. Where the racials actually make a difference is in PvP, where gnomes or dwarfs certainly has the best racials out of the alliance races for most (all?) classes. And probably Orc or Undead for Hordies.
---
Winter spring
---
Ah ok I misunderstood. So when you’re being attacked and garnering these reck stacks you would simply just not autoattack and then unleash a reckbomb on someone?
---
Hahaha, I think this is the right approach actually. That or pretending you're a big Wildstar fan.
---
Ooo yes!  Farming the blue drakes for the whelpling... spent so much time there.
---
Still looking for attention? Be butthurt I guess.
---
You're the best. Thanks for linking.
---
They are the strongest single target healers and bring awesome buffs.
---
Personally I main'ed a holy priest and really enjoyed having different tools available to me. Paladins really just spam holy light until the fight is over (a slight oversimplification, but still pretty accurate).
---
I like your red mammoth tank.
---
Stranglethorn Vale, because it feels like the most complete zone. 
---
We have forests, hills, rivers and lakes. And, of course, sea. STV is one of few zones with fully designed coastline. Some of the content is really far into the sea, like islands in the south or murlocs on the west. Booty Bay is absolutely beatiful and the most important neutral city. Importantly, the level range of the zone is huge - for significant part of leveling there are both gray and skull mobs in STV (counting ZulGurub elites). Gurubashi Arena event is also one of more memorable elements of vanilla
---
Trust me man. Long time player of both games. It’s easy to fall into the mindset of what you know about game and what you think want out of a game. Sometimes a different experience is rewarding. In this case I think it is.
---
Classic WoW is everything I want in a game. Keeping in mind that I thought 2007 rs was pretty perfect in its own way.
---
Having a main that is one class in WoW is actually a gift. It’s going to force you to learn the idiosyncrasies of your class and make you adapt to environments. Take doing dungeons or raiding in WoW compared to OSRS. In OSRS there are few instances where one setup for everyone is not going to be the most suited for the challenge. Inferno, TOB, etc. all players strive towards getting the best gear which is pretty much the same across the board. Tbow, arma, ancestral, etc 
---
In WoW, your character is unique as you are bringing different skills and abilities to the table. Your class is NEEDED in a party. Maybe you choose to heal, control mobs, tank, do massive amounts of damage, etc... without you there, some good parts of the game would not be possible. Group dynamics vs. doing everything by yourself (solo raids) 
---
The takeaway is this. If you’re looking for another game to fully invest into or just play casually, this game has everything under the sun. It’s also cool to know that the developers are thinking about keeping it going similar to the OSRS model in which they add in content over time that fits within the community model.
---
This guy has lived this mistake. Many of us have. Learn from this guy.
---
Haven’t been following but have they fixed any of the jump glitches in WSG? Like being able to jump behind the flag room? I haven’t really been keeping up with the bug fixes lately. 
---
Also just because you like pvp doesn’t mean it’s integrity needs to be top priority for everyone lol.

When you are sick the main reason for staying home usually isn't that you are to sick to work but that you will get everyone ells in the office sick if you come in to work sick, and that is very bad for productivity.
---
Not sure about damage mitigation, but you will resist a lot. As holy paladin in full T2, active shadow resistance and +10shadow resistance cloak enchant, you can pretty much AFK near shadowpriests and affli / demonology warlocks

Not every workplace has the ability to work from home.

I wonder how many people using this realize they’re using a My Little Pony themed addon.
---
Can someone explain how getting attacks per scond from 0.89 is better than 1.0 or 1.37??
---
Dude, nice! I didn't realize that existed.
---
There are actually more reasons to go to Azshara than you realize. For one, it's the highest tier zone for fishing, specifically the Bay of Storms. Second, it's one of the best zones to farm Felcloth in, specifically the Legashi Satyr encampments in the northern half of the zone. They also can drop the Mongoose Potion recipe and the Wicked Leather Bracers recipe. And of course, they also drop Demonic Runes.
---
that is such a wholesome website, love it
---
Should be a warrior/priest (or paladin) duo and you’ll be able to put groups together like it’s nothing, tank and healer already filled...
---
I don't think I thought anything about it for the longest time. Just thought it was a regular night elf.
---
Both were awesome. 80 was the first max level I ever hit. When I finally got to northrend to complete my last 10 levels after grinding all the way to 70, it truly felt epic questions in those zones from the landscape to the music.
---
I have a feeling that druids are going to be FAR more popular this time than in vanilla.
---
Yeah, but the Mrs loves Warlocks, gotta make her happy, ya know?
---
Phil's transition from warrior to hunter was not the smoothest one, but he was determined to show those uppity arrow shooters how a real orc wields a weapon.
---
Even if you effectively coordinately to allow your tank get low enough (I'll be honest, I dont know what the threshold for 'badly hurt' is) to get the full 30%, your attack speed only drops to 1.33 which will net you 2-3 extra attacks. Is that *something*? Sure. But 2 extra white hits and a little bit of rage will only allow your dps to attack two white hits faster than any other race -- or about 3.8 seconds.
---
If they cover a missing pally buff...fine.  If your pally buffs are covered by enough holy pallys, then there is objectively better nightfall wielders.  With what we know now about vanilla, and everyone knowing what they are getting into as we are about to roll fresh in August, I just see people planning to raid as ret as selfish, there is really no reason for it.
---
I'll be playing 30 hours straight, I'll at least be out of shadowglen by then
---
xD
---
If you put in the work and hit def cap you can do everything up to BWL at least as an off tank. Def cap can be hit with blues and easy to grab epics.
---
Well, I'm new to the forum, so I haven't seen the "circle jerk". I don't doubt you, but it is not accurate in my context. I haven't really played since Vanilla and am just rejoining the community.
---
But I remember a bunch of shitty tanks who just stood in one spot then blamed the healer when they died. The never used line of sight or consumables and their rotations were questionable at best.
---
I think they often take on new names or surnames when they become Forsaken. (There may be lore supporting that his name has always been Blightcaller, though, I don’t know)
---
rhok delar which is the second best bow at 60 (which youll realistically get) is a bow and the best is a crossbow called ashrethul. 
---
Rhokdelar is from molten core and ashjrethul is from blackwing lair. There are 1 maybe 2 better weps but youll never get the 1 from aq as other has prio and the best is from kaelthuzad
---
Druids were fine after 1.9 but the problem was that was pretty far into vanilla, by then people's perceptions were set. Since classic is starting from 1.12 they will be fine
---
&gt;  It turns out private servers had to guess at numbers that made fights much easier 
---
Not only that, Private servers can use Ony head for Rallying Cry buff whenever they want. If they wipe, they just go back and pop another Rallying Cry. In Classic, there will be a 6 hr CD for the Rallying Cry buff. So, one wipe in Classic, and almost 40% of your DPS and 30% of your healing with Rallying Cry is gone for 6 hours.
---
Than there is the flasks. Private servers abundance of flasks is because Black Lotus have a respawn rate like any other herb. In Classic, it will be 4 hrs. respawn time.
---
Classic raids will be at least twice as hard to complete vs private server, especially because Fury tanks are out of the question now.
---
20 hours later and you finally get to op's content? How much of a whale of a human do you have to be? How can someone be *this* slow? So sad...
---
I dont' see this as too much of an issue. If you think the guy/gal can't handle being told "hey your skill level isn't high enough to do this yet, keep practicing and you'll get it." or any number of "putting it lightly's" then don't add him. Only an ass would get mad and not understand why he isn't allowed to raid high-end when he doesn't have the gear or isn't as good as the other players (after all, chances are low you have final say so you can default on that).
---
You know what is actually a corruption of gaming media? [Paying people for positive reviews.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/01/22/report-ea-paying-youtube-content-creators-for-positive-video-game-coverage/#42a6115e503e) (This was in 2014, a few months prior to GG exploding)
---
[EA is still doing it.](https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/22/paid-review-anthem-youtuber/)
---
This is an actual, major systemic problem in gaming journalism. And yet on the GG wiki that you provided, all the coverage EA gets is [a tiny page](https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=EA_Games) on a couple of random people getting bans in 2011. Zoe Quinn's [modeling history](https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=Zoe_Quinn#Locke_Valentine) is more than twice the size. It's obvious where the actual motivation for GG exists.
---
Ended up just respeccing to Marksmanship because of this and playing without the pet, too much anxiety especially in waycrest manor timed mythics
---
Because it's not even remotely how it was in Vanilla. Spell batching currently applies to things that have absolutely nothing to do with its original intent and functionality.
---
Marwynn, Alexandretta, Linessa, Sandraudiga. One of those.
---
And don't fret, i wouldnt want to run with you either.
---
Hello, thanks for the feedback. 
---
My perspective is from a guild that will need to do minimal recruiting because they've been raiding together for years on private servers and already have more than 40 players that are hyped about Classic. On top of that, even if we did need multiple new recruits, everyone has to put in time before they're given loot, and no trial would ever be given loot over a raider because that's ridiculous.
---
Number of raids attended doesn't make a difference unless you're missing raids, in which case you would find it hard to get loot, as it should be.
---
Trials would be moved into the officer/raider group upon promotion, at the bottom of the group. If this were at the start of a tier then yes, they would have to wait multiple raids before getting loot, but that's the case based on the join date prioritization system regardless. If it were part-way through the tier, then it's likely that certain items would already have been distributed to the other members of their class and the wait would be short if there was any wait at all. What new promotion expects to get top-tier items immediately in the first place?
---
If they complain, the response is, "attend raids and you will get loot guaranteed". I fail to see how that's an issue.
---
The system is transparent. The lists exist on Google docs with open reading ability and limited writing ability. If someone has a problem, all they need to do is look at the history of the alterations and if there is something fishy going on, it would be immediately obvious.
---
If an officer makes people pass, the person receiving the item won't receive loot again for an extended period of time. I fail to see the problem here.
---
If an officer passes, another player gets an item that's best-in-slot for them. I fail to see the problem there.
---
This could easily blow up a guild full of shitters that have no interest in attending raids, sure, but that kind of guild would blow up on its own quickly regardless of loot system.
---
An additional as in 2 extra? I have a legion ptr option but I thought that one was just for my stress test invite still
---
I hope not!
---
We'll certainly find out.
---
Some people don't live on reddit? Holy shit kid, get a life.
---
Yes because guilds do any socializing in retail.
---
Been a part of a wpvp guild, and we hung around the longest while pve guilds this patch fell apart left and right.
---
lol DKP
---
It really won’t. The mitigation you lose out on and not having shield slam (one of highest threat generation skills in game) and shield bash. It definitely sounds like a gimmick.
---
Im not your guy, friend.
---
And then youd complain about that lacking instead.
---
Druid is best flag carrier in WSG.  A really fune role to play 
---
Druids are also a great support healer to have in raids.  They don't pure heal as well as priests but innervate can clutch save a priest or mage's mana.  And combat rez is highly desired.  You usually get 2 druids per raid maybe 3.
---
Boomkin is considered weak however it wasn't introduced till late in Vanilla.  I think we may find sone early progression niches that weren't previously discovered.
---
All hybrid classes just aren't better at dps, tanking, healing then the pure classes.  But these bring interesting utility and variety in their kit to make up for it.
---
In Vanilla they had spell pushback if you took damage while casting. A faster hitting pet would cause the most pushback and delay in the eventual cast.
---
Tooth was the best in the game at that time for PvP and causing a lot of grief with pushback.
---
That’s fine, but for me having 1 gazillion polygon models and 1 polygon armor breaks the immersion completely.
---
http://twitch.tv/staysafetv is the most popular
---
It's still weird to me that Blizzard uses an [actual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Samedi), [practiced religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou) as their "inspiration" for Troll religion. I put inspiration in quotes because its more like copying.
---
Druid is alright. You'll spend a lot of your time spamming various ranks of healing touch and rejuvenate. Rebirth and innervate require raid awareness, and are extremely valuable in certain contexts. If your guild doesn't have a feral or a moonkin you'll be expected to keep up fearie fire up on the boss for that juicy armor debuff.
---
In PvP druids are probably the hardest class to kill, because of how hard they can be to lock down.
---
Having batching in classic wow in 2019 just to recreate "no changes" vanilla experience is like buying a 19 years old fat computer with 8 bit resolution, 64mb ram and windows XP, just because thats how it was back them
---
Yes, but a troll will therefore be that much ahead of a tauren for threat for the rest of the fight. Meaning the dps can theoretically do that much more damage over the rest of the fight. They have their place in guilds that have very strong dps. The benefit of a troll is essentially wasted if you don't have dps who really know what they're doing.
---
**Baron Samedi**
---
Baron Samedi (English: Baron Saturday) also written Baron Samdi, Bawon Samedi, or Bawon Sanmdi, is one of the loa of Haitian Vodou. Samedi is a loa of the dead, along with Baron's numerous other incarnations Baron Cimetière, Baron La Croix, and Baron Kriminel. He is syncretized with Saint Martin de Porres.He is the head of the Guédé family of loa. His wife is the loa Maman Brigitte.
---
**Haitian Vodou**
---
Haitian Vodou (, French: [vodu], also written as Vaudou ; known commonly as Voodoo , sometimes as Vodun , Vodoun , Vodu , or Vaudoux ) is a syncretic religion practiced chiefly in Haiti and the Haitian diaspora. Practitioners are called "vodouists" (French: vodouisants [voduizɑ̃]) or "servants of the spirits" (Haitian Creole: sèvitè).Vodouists believe in a distant and unknowable Supreme Creator, Bondye (derived from the French term Bon Dieu, meaning "good God"). According to Vodouists, Bondye does not intercede in human affairs, and thus they direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called loa. Every loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life, with the dynamic and changing personalities of each loa reflecting the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside.
---
The Chinese can't have bones visible in their video games.
---
Staysafe is on alliance side, Snutz is on Horde side. Probably the two best on either side
---
Strictly PvE? Troll
---
My boss was asking if I would play. He used to play back in vanilla too. I've been telling him that I probably won't for this reason.
---
Why isn't this stickied.
---
I guess you haven't spent much time on the official Classic forum.
---
LOL, no. Private servers are MUCH easier. 5.6% parry vs 14% parry on Bosses, which is a 250% decrease in parry chance. God knows by how much private servers are on resists.
---
Fury tanks on private servers work, in Classic they won't exists. And Druids are almost as fucked as Fury tanks. There will only be Prot Warrior tanks, that will deal less threat and receive more damage.
---
That changes the entire dynamic of Classic raids. Fights will last much longer, mana will be a major issues, along tank's threat.
---
I estimate Classic raid to be twice as hard than on private servers...adding flasks and world buff CD in Classic, vs no CD on private.
---
Removed as low effort.
---
You’ll be fine going shadow, just make sure you tell her to let you get last hit for Spirit Tap
---
Hi, /u/KentuckyFriedAnivia
---
Spell batching itself is not lag, that's true. But changing the tick rate can definitely be interpreted as making the game laggier, it's just consistent and built into the system instead of being caused by poor performance. 
---
I'm pretty sure retail works in a fairly similar way, it's still working on some kind of tick system, it's just retroactively making sure things don't overlap that shouldn't (like killing each other). And I'm pretty sure it has a much better tick rate.
---
Tauren Warriors have awesome 2h animations. I really like orc rogue/warrior dual wielding and hunter bow shooting animations.
---
I mean, if this is the level of butthurt people are being about having competition for tanking gear 3 months before the game is even released, i might as well just do it myself. I didn't really want to before i had some equipment for it, but i guess that's probably going to be a better option than dealing with people like these. Of course, raiding as prot isn't an option, so it'll be the healers butthurt instead as I'm still going to need that gear too. Guess I'm just not going to make anybody happy.
---
Best wsg flag carrier in the game.  Also best aoe healing and combat rez.
---
People want hybrid classes to be tied for best dps, healing, and tanking lol... This ain't retail.  But being a jack of all trades is viable and makes you best at your niche.
---
What do you want Engineering for? Most items can be used even if you dont have the profession.
---
If it's just for the flavor of crafting gadgets, an alt should be perfect
---
I remember using them in a MC run without telling anyone and the reactions were priceless.
---
Yeah, that would be cool. And Grim Batol. And Kharazan Crypts. Could also make some of it horizontal to TBC. Though, personally, I'd like to see Hyjal as a leveling zone.
---
Azshara could use more content, too.
---
Winterspring is my favorite. I love snow.

Ahh, I see. Thanks!!

OG Brill best town

Ppfffrt I don't share with lolladins
---
Really appreciate your helpful reply. Thank you :)
---
There is a pserver that has batching
---
It's just because he's so jarring, it's hard to look away. It's not a good thing.
---
&gt;Yes. But you had to level it up to your level, which in Vanilla was a very long process especially if the level difference was so large you couldnt take it into dungeons because the pet would pull everything in sight
---
Ah that makes sense. Thanks for the insight.
---
BC soundtrack is literally a masterpiece in atmospheric music.
---
Depends what you're farming. I personally think the best bet is to find a dps buddy and go farm elites in endgame if you're looking to do just generic farming. If you're just wanting gold, gathering professions are generally going to be the best route. Farming rep is usually best done in a group, and will also be the best bet for farming cloth or de fodder (especially if you can get the others to funnel it to you).
---
You know you can just appear offline right? It's what I do. Just appear offline and message the people I wanna play with.
---
Honestly, we were the first ones in this sub. It's starting to fill up with BFA players who know absolutely nothing about vanilla and get upset when we explain the game to them.
---
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with thinking ahead. If anything, it’s out of concern to preserve the experience. BC was well received but many of us don’t want to move forward into that on classic servers. So starting a discussion now is helpful because we can shape the decision process in advance
---
Thank you bighand1, looks like I will be raiding lol!
---
Madseasonshow is also leveling a warlock
---
Can you play PVP and PVE with the same holy raid spec?
---
&gt;  But I'm a simple man, and don't have the same amount of free time i had back then.
---
They are trying to justify wasting other peoples time, by ninja looting, because they don't have enough time to form their own group or find one that is ok with them having a tank gear priority.
---
They are a hypocrite of the highest order and refuse to acknowledge it because, apparently, their time is more important than anyone else's.  I have given up at this point.
---
From the way your writing, you must have made it yourself. Story time?
---
It isnt a matter of whether or not you should roll on it.  Its a matter if courtesy.  If you want the gear, let your group know ahead of time so they can decide if they want to accept your conditions for being there.
---
fuck that. i hate the vanilla dwarf models and their casting animations. i'd much rather play a race that has animations/models i enjoy.
---
Then the guy who farms flasks for the guild loses out on a bis item because joe schmo who raidlogs is next in line.  Half the guild quits.  It happens all the time.
---
Druid 10-20 is fucking brutal i love druids but man is that phase with only best form just super dry and slow. Don't rlly do any dmg unless you pump spells which dries your Mana and then you're stuck drinking . Once u get to 20 I feel it takes off cuz then at 30 you get travel but idk I couldn't get past like 16 on my druid before I wanted to pull my hair out cuz every mob took so long to kill and so much mana
---
It's a 250% OFF on private servers.The resistances are also probably off by A LOT on private servers.
---
World buffs have no CD on private vs 6 hrs in Classic. Black Lotus have no CD on private vs 4 hrs in Classic.
---
Raiding on private servers is a joke.
---
You’re right on Forsaken taking new names as it’s just the case. Nathanos real last name is Marris.

Not if you're ***appearing offline***.

&gt; Benediction/Anathema
---
tbh, T2 + Benediction looks so fucking good, it's my entire reason for rolling a Priest in Classic WoW.
---
Staysafe, Snutzy, Maldiva, Madseason
---
Thanks for clarifying! How is world pvp as priest? Can they win a 1v1 as healer?
---
[wowinterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/index.php) and [townlong-yak](https://www.townlong-yak.com/) also has a lot of helpful resources.
---
Upvoting for having the "coming to Jesus moment". You're taking your first steps to becoming a top tier player.
---
Unfortunately, no. But as an Orc I will /salute the Brotherhood before combat out of respect of the manliest alliance race.
---
You need to make friends for end game farming, simple.
---
Read the last blue post before saying stupid things.
---
Overall (parry chance, dodge chance, resists, no world buff CD, no Black Lotus CD) Classic raids will be at least twice as hard vs private servers.
---
Classic WoW ain't gonna do that for me, still in the same guild as I was in classic pretty much just me logging in. I wish it did, hell I don't even care if it did it in classic or BFA.
---
God the music is horrible.
---
Actually how I met one of my best friends at work.  Was browsing wow forums back in classic at work and he saw and said up you play wow?  I was actually only working with him temporarily our job was a traveling position.  He ended up transferring to my server and we played all the way up to BFA in same guild.  Most of the others stopped around wotlk though.  We don’t play wow as much anymore but play other games still.
---
Ive played wow since I was very young. I'm an adult now so not as much of a problem, but I have a funny story. When the battle net thing first came out, my mom added me on it (she got me into wow). I realized too late one night that she could see me playing when I was supposed to be asleep, as she was playing and it gave her the notification haha

I can't argue with the fact that they provide *some* increase in threat as compared to a Taurens none at all. But I still can't see how two extra auto attacks will put you ahead enough for it to matter -- especially if you have to do a janky pull and allow your MT to drop below (I'm assuming) 25% hp for it to be feasible. You'll always be two hits ahead, but that it. You'll have essentially one HS threat lead. That's it. The effect isn't enduring like say an Orc (using an axe) who will consistently hit more often for the course of the entire fight.
---
I believe that was also part of Big Brother at some point.
---
Surely having 1.37 attacks a second is better than 0.89 though?
---
it's always both.
---
saying it wasn't server capacity shows you have no clue how client/server architecture works.
---
Maybe it was a streamer / content creator so he mighty have gotten his  money back already
---
Defending TM only seeing every 4th spell cast.  Hilarious and fun.  I'd sometimes split off to the back of alliance group and kill so many players before they even realized they were being hit.
---
You're dumb mate...
---
Because tanks have to be in the front? DUH.

‘Occasionally’ is different from 100% of the time

You can read their post about spell batching in vanilla to see how it currently works in retail.

Oof, I'm not comparing this to pservers. I've never played on a vanilla pserver, I did play a little on a TBC one (for a short time) and a lot on WotLK pservers.

So the API is exactly the same as retail?

Same.. Still there for me and I can login to an offline stress test realm
---
The other thing is, Classic WoW won't support /sit to generate Blood Craze and Enrage procs, which is the entire point of leveling 2H Fury on private servers.
---
I'll definitely be leveling Arms on Classic too.
---
Haha jesus. I didn't think you could be funnier, but the armchair psychology schtick has put me over the edge. It's all very "200 IQ" meme.
---
I doubt very much you've ever had an honest conversation about this subject, and I don't see the point in trying. In fact, I think it's counter productive, because I'd prefer it if your type just avoided Classic in general.
---
As hilarious as I find your inability to comprehend a different perspective than your own, separating the playerbase is ther obvious solution. Rather than design a version of the game that makes no one happy... you can have your version and we'll have ours. 
---
It's a bit spergy for you to come to the 'others' sub to argue about your 'intellectual superiority' on the subject, but considering popular opinion on BFA, I can't say I'm surprised you find arguing about Classic more fulfilling than actually playing the said "superior in every way" version, lol.
---
They won't all use the guide, the guide just tells you which quests to do, in what order and when to turn them in.
---
The point was that if you can't do those quests (which is what you're suggesting by everyone using the guide) your next best option is to grind mobs. If you can't because its too crowded your next best option is to get explore xp.
---
Its a priority system. Questing &gt; grinding &gt; exploring.
---
&gt; we start complaining about how it apparently doesn't have enough content to keep us satisfied in the long run
---
Literally no one is complaining about a lack of content. Starting a discussion about what ifs of the future is not complaining about lack of content. That’s a strawman.
---
Since they lack movement skills, not that great. They can be hard to kill, being a healer, but they have trouble escaping ganks. And once people get their trinkets, their aoe fear is pretty much nullified with means you have no CC.
---
Engineering can help a lot in PvP if you're interested in going that route. And if you have a warrior partner in PvP than nothing short of a army can kill either of you so long as the warrior knows how to protect you.
---
Really good.
---
You asked for a general comment on your System, not a comment on a system in a specific environment.
---
&gt;My perspective is from a guild that will need to do minimal recruiting because they've been raiding together for years on private servers and already have more than 40 players that are hyped about Classic. 
---
If that is the case, why the fuck do you need a loot system at all? People who raided for years together, understand that Loot is a means to an end.
---
&gt;Number of raids attended doesn't make a difference unless you're missing raids, in which case you would find it hard to get loot, as it should be.
---
Self contradictory sentence right there.  
---
Besides, so in your system if someone cannot attend for, say personal reasons for two weeks he doesn't get anything anymore? Sounds like a really shitty environment.
---
&gt;If this were at the start of a tier then yes, they would have to wait multiple raids before getting loot
---
Idiotic system. It scares people off your guild, feeding into exactly the fantasies of trials getting screwed over by guilds. All good raiding guilds I have ever been in, grant Trials the same right to loot as everyone else. The ones that didn't, were the ones that fell apart quickly.
---
&gt;The system is transparent.
---
Not even remotely. Within what you described, officers (aka. your PServer buddies) can influence the loot decision on every single level, starting with peoples priority lists, up to and including forcing passes.
---
&gt;I fail to see the problem here.
---
Of course you don't, because you are an officer / GM of course, as are your PServer buddies. I don't see a problem with Tyranny as a political system...provided I am a good friend of the Tyrant.
---
&gt;This could easily blow up a guild full of shitters that have no interest in attending raids, sure, but that kind of guild would blow up on its own quickly regardless of loot system.
---
Your system will blow up every single guild eventually, unless it's a bunch of people who know and trust each other. There will be Officer abuse, and as soon as that happens, it's game over, and your reputation on the realm is ruined.
---
Sure but they could say the same about Nathanos. They didn’t have to justify it with a story.
---
Supply and demand at its finest.
---
If people are dumb enough to pay for it, well good for them I hope they have a blast. I won’t get into the beta but I’ll see you on launch.

Planning to play 2h fury (horde) and while reading up on gearing for dps I found people mentioning agility as an important stat for fury. Is this the case? And specifically is this the case for 2h fury? I assumed I mainly would be looking for strength but the internet seems to be in two minds about it.
---
It's basically the same as the retardins because you're rolling need to make something else about your character that's not related to what you're doing more efficient or better. Instead of better healing, you get a better overworld experience.
---
Seeing this in action is legit the fastest way to get a bad rep on a server. Nobody likes the guy who does this without making their intentions mega clear, and few bring the honest guy doing it anyway
---
You're definitely in the minority, since most redditors would crumble at the first sign of actual human interaction.
---
Absolutely false.
---
Shadowpriests have incredibly poor mana efficiency. Mind Flay cannot crit, and due to 16 debuff slots being the limit you will never be allowed to use SW:P since Mind Flay and Shadow Weaving already takes up debuff slots. If your class need 3/16 debuff slots to be viable, then it's not viable.
---
That leaves you with Mindflay and Mindblast as your only damage dealing spells. Mindblast has a short cast time meaning poor spellpower coefficient and Mindflay also only scale with 15% of SP per tick.
---
As for Shaman. Dont get me started. The class literally only autoattack and cast Frost Shock. You cannot boost your damage with Shadow Oil like a Paladin can because it does not stack with weapon enhancements like Flametongue or Windfury, and you cannot use Stormstrike because it takes up a debuff slot. Shamans also have the same issue as priests which is their mana efficiency is horrible.
---
You see, unlike a Shadow Priest and Enhancement Shaman, a Paladin only need 1 debuff slot. Crusader. Because nearly everything in Naxxramas is undead there is no harm in having this debuff on the boss. Stratholme Holy Water, which is easily farmable by everyone scales with 100% of spellpower and everyone should be tossing these on cooldown meaning the debuff will actually benefit the raid as a whole greatly.
---
It's fine that you dont like Paladins but it would be great if people could at least not say things they know arent true ( Either you know, or you actually never looked at the math. In which case I really have to question your motives for stating Spriest and Enhance outperform ret )
---
I will link a log from Naxxramas the other day done by a Paladin playing this build. Overall damage is low, but you can see this in the logs from Patchwerk, Grobbulus and Gluth where he ran into issues with his computer that prevented him from participating which explains overall damage. The damage on Thaddius and the rest of the bosses are actually pretty amazing and I dare to you to find a log of a Shaman or Spriest doing more DPS than this.

Not if its working as intended to provide certain counter plays in pvp match ups without affecting other things.
---
Homogenization of the classes is a huge problem. If everyone can do everything the only difference is that number called DPS, and some class always has more of it.
---
Honestly I think female Dwarf Warrior has the best 2-hander animations, I just can't stand their walking animation and floppy tits. If I could, I probably wouldn't play other Warriors
---
Can anyone explain what the little resurrection icon is that is always on by default?  I turn it off because I saw no purpose to it.  When someone is dead, you rez them, I don't get what that feature is for.
---
I remember that picture making 12 year old me set my expectations of having matching armor way too early in the game.
---
PTO doesnt always work like that. I get mine on a per hour worked basis. I work 55+ hour weeks and literally never use my PTO. I am at 320 hours last I checked. My problem is that I can only use it for 40 hours a week, so I lose 1/3 of my pay for a week if I choose to take vacation.
---
Because people don't believe that it is working exactly how it was in Vanilla? It is an emulation of server batching that feels completely inauthentic. 
---
Not saying that it was completely correct, but the post that is the reason that we currently have spell batching said that healing/buff yourself should receive no delay. This is not working on the Beta. There was no mention of lag every single time you loot a mob or interact with a node (and old videos show that this was not a consistent lag like it is on the Beta). 
---
Anybody who is in favor of the current emulation of spell batching should try Mining for an hour or two. Artificially introducing server lag (which feels completely different than it did in Vanilla) just so two people can sheep each other a little more often is dumb.
---
It doesn't work like that. A 3.6sec weapon needs 3.6 second to hit.
---
A lower number is faster.
---
So...you think they will be able to kill Vael or Chromaggus? Because I don't see how they will be able to do it.
---
It's possible. At least I can keep it somewhat civil.
---
What? We can reserve names? When? How?
---
They made the game run at a “Blizzard quality” but the spell batching retracts from the high quality and actually makes the game feel like it’s lagging. It’s artificial and they can change it if enough people complain.
---
I believe that was due to the unscheduled second test getting scheduled. Probably because everyone immediately left the starting zones last time, a theory backed up by the zoning issues and hoggers in the second
---
I was working at 10.  Neighborhood lawns, pet sitting, and also caretaking the property of my family business (weeding, sweeping, removing trash etc).  Bought my own pc, paid my own sub, and then i made real money in WoW bought and sold accounts, currency, powerlvld professions.  I won't do any of that rule breaking this time.  But wow gave me motivation to make money and then eventually another avenue to play and make money when I got really good at the game.
---
I wish I had Screenshots from back when. I never kept any.
---
Batching was a result of hardware limitation
---
Not coding
---
Still they will imitate batching because they want to keep “the experience “
---
Bnet is the one showing him offline, the in games friends list is the villain in this scenario.

"Sorry man im just trying to do X right now, maybe another time" problem solved.
---
I am doing it because I was ready for classic summer (as a teacher) and didn’t get that from Blizzard so I am on private servers enjoying the game.
---
Thanks for this advice. I actually plan to play classic with co-worker and I have never played with him before nor I knew him before started working there. Never have thought about sharing battle net name could give me some unpleasant experiences, but this post reminds about that.
---
But Gallywix in the lore has literally always been morbidly obese. It's not some kind of retcon. They just didn't have the model to make him look right in Cataclysm.
---
What's worse is there's a chance blizzard might find out and you can say goodbye to beta access and your brand new 1500 dollar account
---
Advertising to new players and casual players isnt catering they aren't changing the game. the game is already casual friendly. If you have an hour a day to play classic you can have a great time leveling for months. Progressing your character and enjoy the game just as people who rush to 60 to min max. Classic is good because it's so versatile.
---
I dont know why blizzard trying to get more people playing the game is such a problem. You are overreacting.
---
On another note: Gorgrond. God that zone is hell to walk around in, and they didn't originally intend for flight to be available, so that's not why it's horrible. So many spaces that *looked* like I could fit through but couldn't.
---
No, I'm asking about all the threads that call it ridiculous and "unfun". I'm not sure where are we drawing the line between what is fine to be as it was and what isn't. I don't think those conversations contribute to anything because most of the upvoted comments are people bashing on batching, it's not discussion, it's a circlejerk.
---
As a horde player, this does not compute.
---
Ahh another private server baby who doesnt know how to play the game properly. Of course.
---
Non cross realm bgs were around for the majority of vanilla so I'm not advocating a change.
---
I know a streamer that bought an account. Made the money back within 2 days because of it.
---
imagine paying to beta test a game
---
I've seen that happen on streams, and it says like instance not found, aborting. Something along those lines. I'm assuming it might have to deal with layers or idk, it's weird.
---
I dunno, if it's a hunter or ret it's fine as long as you say "Taste Vengeance!"

---
If you have 1500bucks to just throw away then they don’t care if they get caught.

Main reason today I wait for Classic is to see all those private server players and retail players that think that Vanilla was easy, stumped.

I have one of my best childhood friends that does this so frequently. So incredibly frustrating.

Yeah what are you expected to do when you’re sick, stare into a corner and hope to get better?

Let people post what they want. They votes show what the community wants.

Yup, and guess what happens to overall workplace productivity if you bring a cold to work and give it to everyone. I guess if you're working one of those so called "bullshit jobs" where people don't actually need their hours to get their jobs done it doesn't actually matter if productivity is shot, but even then you're screwing everyone else's free time.
---
People are fucking stupid.  Just another example.
---
How Spell Batching is in the Beta is actually exactly what it is like on private servers when they emulate spell batching, but they all remove it after a day or two because they realize that it is a poor emulation of spell batching.
---
I'm a paladin main who played spell paladin for the memes. I dont hate them, I am being realistic.
---
Yes, that's my point exactly. I understand why it was introduced in the first place but that's the one thing that we actually *know* was there in Vanilla. We might not like it but we it looks to work exactly as it did. I don't understand why discuss it at all. Given devs' stance that they shared so far we can be sure they won't change it.
---
Nagrand is my favourite zone visually. Both nagrands for that matter.

Priests can farm easy in Phase 2 (expected for a couple months post launch)
---
- Step 1: Have Holy Nova
---
- Step 2: Have enough mana for 9-10 holy novas (6k or so)
---
- Farm DME lashers
---
One of the best raw gold farms in the game. Priests can manage this for leveling (if DME were available at launch) from level 54 or so - doing so at 60 a couple months with better Phase 1 gear? Super easy.
---
But that is exactly my point. I know those threads don't hold any power because the devs have said they will not change stuff that could in their own opinion change the meta and game's balance. Batching *definitely* falls under that category so those posts don't serve any purpose...
---
Ima have to give a big no on this one... Just because someone is talking fast and seems to be hyped up in the situation doesn't mean they'd be a good commentator.
---
You're saying 2H fury as in 1 2H right? Agility gives crit, attack power, and dodge in classic. That's at least how I remember it. So I'm guessing certain pieces may have both stats or one but a good swing speed/ effect. Someone else should probably clarify since I'm on mobile and not able to verify. Purely going off memory.
---
BWL was harder when it was initially released. First, there were only 8 debuff slots. Second, most classes had not been revamped at that point and sucked a lot more than in 1.12.
---
Ashenvale and Durotar have got warm places in my heart. I'd want to say Elwynn Forrest, Loch Modan, Duskwood and Redridge Mountains as well, but that'd be treason. I like Silithus a lot too (most probably can't see that, but to me it caters to a fantasy of being in a vast Arabian Desert, making it beautiful). I feel very at home at Ratchet. Tanaris is cool as well, with its serene atmosphere.
---

---
For leveling dungeons I'd say it's different. I plan on tanking any dungeon I need to while leveling, and a definitely plan on needing whatever two-handers will help me level. Leveling a warrior is punishing enough as is - it's unreasonable to expect them to also use a shield the whole way.
---
You make it sound like they’re sex trafficking.
---
Don't forget the pvp grind.  If OP is competitive and loves grinds.  High Warlord is the best goal in the game. ;)
---
This is true. It wont come as easily, but under 60, you can make anything work with enough effort.
---
Has it been confirmed that the full models will be present at launch? Or will they have the placeholders for the first phase?
---
No Classic raid is a joke.
---
They are on heavily undertunned private server.
---
But you plan to raid in Classic...which will be no joke.
---
Yup, 1 2H. Thnx for the info!
---
There were so many hidden dicks in classic, was always a funny sight finding one.
---
Bonus: if you can find the hidden pineapple in classic.
---
Please tell me you're going Horde. You're sort of childish mentality and defective reasoning is the sort I want to avoid when Classic launches.
---
Yes, I know - but the devs have said they will not do changes that affect balance. I understand frustration and arguments behind it but it's a thing that was already established by the devs not applicable for changes.
---
Private server content is mostly relevant content wise.  So a good suggestion.
---
Windfury would like a word with you

Essentially, yes. There are a few differences, but for most addons they don't matter.

I got a DM about buying beta access from some rando on Twitter. I get the hype, but wtf?

Makes perfect sense

This pretty much. I enjoyed wrath so much, but certain systems introduced lowered it for me.

This has always been a rule of mine.
---
Many people work under NDAs that prohibit working from anywhere except the office.
---
I remember my guild saw a single Ashjre’Thul in months of raiding BWL. I used Rhok'delar for a LONG time.
---
If there's only some things it's being applied to that it shouldn't be, then it's pretty close to vanilla though. Like things like WSG flag probably aren't right but we don't have any videos to disprove it until Blizzard makes a comment on it
---
Oh thank you for the link mate, I hope I find some old ppl from my server or they find me.
---
Still makes it more viable than a large majority of specs and it occupies weapons that would otherwise be wasted more or less.
---
You also ignored the part where any fight could be up in the air in terms who beats who.
---
I know the potential of the 2h fury :) clearly you don't
---
Jealousy mostly. I raided with a Moonkin on a private server who won Cloak of Consumption (one of the best caster cloaks in the game). The Mages and Warlocks lost their shit.
---
For Ret/Prot Paladin/Elemental/Enhancement in particular: they add no value that a healer couldn't bring. Moonkin and Feral Druids actually have unique utility and are worth bringing, but those specs do not.
---
I want to roll a Tauren in classic so much, but since hearing about going back to the larger hit box, I'm having second thoughts. I HATED getting stuck on every damn doorway in Vanilla. Seriously weighing the pros and cons... this beautiful starting zone is one of the big pros.
---
Fuck the normies. THIS is the time for you to cut them out of your life.  Add them. Let then see your tier 1 and know that you are a higher echelon of human (or orc) than they will ever be.
---
Guilds are dead in retail lol
---
I think the average person views a Classic reboot as being able to play a game from their childhood on modern hardware, nice fast servers, high resolution monitors, nice graphics, etc.
---
What most are pissed about is now we all artificially have 250+ ms and stright up aggravating interactions because of massive batches and huge amounts of leeway.
---
Leeway shouldn't be any more than it is on retail and batching should only be slightly more.  
---
Right now Mages can Poly+Frostnova to get guaranteed shatters and flags in WSG aren't being returned because they get batched back into existence.  All the melee are running around as sudo ranged characters when it should really only be Tauren on Tauren.  It's going to ruin the game for many many people.
---
In PvE? Salvation is still probably better because of threat, and it's going to be even better than it was on private servers because the parry chance is higher on classic
---
What if 1 million people follow the guide, how hard would it be to quest and grind, when everyone following the guide...
---
LUL get it?
---
Yeah everyone has their personal preference on what they like 
---
Gotta do what ya gotta do
---
So non linked were around for the majority of vanilla so that too would fall under the category of no changes.
---
Everything I heard about shield slam(mostly from preach) is that it's suppose to be horrible for threat. And if anyone did go into the prot tree it would for last stand and other related talents with CDs and stuff.
---
If you were ever allowed to play 2H fury on Alliance, you were in a hyper-casual guild. You know absolutely nothing.
---
Winterspring ( I would make all the excuses to go there), feralas randomly, ashenvale, shimmering flats because it's so vast and empty
---
Also get ready for: 
---
"WTF, where IS my pet"
---
"Well, did you remember to feed it?"
---
 "Wait, wut? I have to feed it? Waaaaait....IT CAN RUN AWAY?!?"
---
Yeah its great, sadly still not enough to push horde into being the favorites.
---
In the end content will be cleared the day it is open by both factions so it really doesn't matter outside of speed runs.
---
I also think the retail horde bias will work its way into classic despite their disadvantages, though historically most private servers end up around 47/53 horde to alliance ratio I don't think that will be indicative of what we see on classic.
---
Honestly, all the polls I keep seeing show it should be a pretty close split. The twitter ones from Devs I've seen favor horde, while the ones here fluctuate quickly on which side is in the lead. Beyond a server with a well known streamer throwing off the balance, it should be even enough that you don't notice while playing.
---
No what the data supports is that as many people as possible is the most efficient (with a 5 person cap), however it doesn't take mob density into account. If there's only enough mobs for 3 people, 3 is more efficient than 5.
---
When I'm sick, I am usually out. if I have the flu, I don't have the energy/what it takes to play WoW.

if I have a cold, I probably could have worked. You just sneeze into your arm like you're supposed to, sanitize, etc. I'm shocked to hear people call in just for the sniffles. 
---
If I have to take Nyquil or something, hell no I'm not coming in. But if I have a headache so bad I cant work, the light off a screen only makes the pain worse, so no, I'm not playing WoW either if I call in for a headache.

---
Spelladin as a spec did not exist until a few months ago so I sincerely doubt that. You are mixing it with Shockadin, which is a gimmicky PvP spec with good burst damage every 30 seconds.
---
It's a completely different build and it's pretty obvious you did not even bother clicking the link in the original post.
---
Lol maybe you should take a walk.
---
I know and I already said in another comment that I 100% understand the sentiment and reasoning behind the negative comments but I'm just saying they serve no purpose because the devs said they will not do changes to stuff they believe could affect game's balance and meta and batching is one of these things.
---
Wait, are you talking about me, or the guy responding to me? Because he's being a lot more combative and toxic than I am. I merely told you that the mob was in the game in Vanilla and therefore will be in Classic.
---
Every class is a support role for the party. Nothing stands alone. You cannot do it all, so don't try to. Always find a group and try to be the best at your role. 
---
I think the biggest difference between vanilla and live is focus. You can't really re-spec all the time. It's costly and money is scarce, so your spec is your experience.  If you like to take on multiple roles, you might need two toons (even two of the same class is not unheard of). That's vanilla.
---
2h fury is quite viable if you're really good

Orc. Always.
---
Here are the main reasons :
---
1. Orcs farm gold faster than Taurens (tanks need gold for consumables).
---
2. Orcs have a better chance of surviving WPvP (farming is done in the open world).
---
3. Orcs do more damage if offtanking or respecc DPS if needed (at some point, you might want to respecc, or you are going for speed runs, and damage is more important).
---
On paper, 5% more HP is better. But looking at the big picture, Orcs are better.
---
Hello, thanks for your feedback!

1. I forgot to make it clear that officers are moved down spots when they miss raids at the same rate, including on their preferred item. If they choose to pass, they still have to wait until they're at the top of the list for their preferred item when it drops. So if an officer misses a raid or two, well, they're going to have to wait a drop or two of their preferred item until they can get it. The preferred item system is borne of the fact that officers have higher expectations and responsibilities within a guild than regular raiders, and that should be rewarded. It also serves as encouragement for raiders to chase officer positions when they become available.
---
2. This isn't comparable to DKP gaps because it isn't cumulative. A player receives an item, then they don't receive an item again until a bunch of other players have received an item as well (unless the other players don't attend raids). They don't have built up attendance that they can spend on items. People have to be filled into lists in some sort of order, and incentivizing commitment to the guild as a solid raider seems like a good idea to me.
---
3. Sitting players is separate from this system. This system only cares who shows up to the raids. If 50 people attend the raid, then all 50 of those players are not moved down because they 'missed' a raid.
---
4. Again, this system is conceived from the perspective of loot being beneficial to the guild first. Individual desires for specific pieces of loot don't factor into this system. It's designed to give any and all loot to the most consistently-available players. If someone misses an item because they received a lesser one earlier on, that's the same as not receiving an item because they had to roll against someone and lost. Loot dropping is, after all, based purely on chance.
---
Issue responses:
---
1. The gear lists have to be approved by officers, so that would be an officer team decision. If someone wants to put three items on their gear list, then yes they would get those three items before someone else with 8 items on their list gets them, but they wouldn't get anything else and they're basing their entire gear setup on being bad until one of those items drop, which could take a very long time. They would also have to have 100% attendance between the tier start and the items dropping to receive them before everyone else, which doesn't seem like a negative thing to me. If I were deciding on the gear lists, everyone would have to fill in all slots that were BiS upgrades for the tier in 40-man raids.
---
2. Again, this isn't an issue when approaching loot as something beneficial to the guild first and raiders second. The more purples in the guild for people that show up to raids consistently, the better.
---
3. Basically answered by 2.
---
4. This is covered by there being sub-groups inside of the officer/raider and trial groups. If something is a much better upgrade for rogues and warriors but is still bis for hunters, then hunters are inside a separate group that is below rogues/warriors. This still reflects the idea that loot is beneficial to the guild because the classes that can use it most effectively receive it first.
---
5. Point 10 in my original post covers this. If an item is considered strictly-PvP then it can be rolled for, but this system isn't built to consider PvP whatsoever.
---
6. Covered by point 10 in my original post as well.
---
7. Yes. They're at the top of the list for multiple items because they continuously attended raids.
---
8. Any guild worth their salt has a minimum attendance requirement. If someone decides to not show up to raids because they're not due to receive an item, they should quickly find themselves not welcome in the raids anymore.
---
Thanks again for the feedback, lots of food for thought!
---
Hopefully they can tweak it because it's not quie vanilla atm.  Just slightly off.
---
To be fair I never new it was a think til people complained about it on this sub. It's really not important and better off fixed.
---
The main difference is that while orc and troll racial both increase TPS, TPS is more important at the beginning of a fight. What matters more, an orc hitting two more white attacks minutes into a fight, or a troll hitting two more white attacks 20 seconds into a fight? This is some seriously minute details. A troll racial essentially frontloads their threat gen, whereas the orc racial will always have them catching up to the troll threat, if that makes sense.
---
WSG Flag happened back then aswell, same thing with fall damage.
---
&gt; I dont know why blizzard trying to get more people playing the game is such a problem. You are overreacting.
---
Its the manner in which they are doing this. Lets be real, classic WoW mainly appeals to the Original WoW players + the dedicated players who came on a while after. This is supposed to be Blizzards "thank you" (so to speak) to these players. The fact that they arent charging separate to play it, kinda reinforces that belief as well right? Then you factor in the aspect where they specifically stated there will be "criteria" to who gets into the beta. The criteria is mainly based around being an older player. So if thats the case, why on earth would someone whos never played WoW, let alone Classic, be selected for the beta? Then you add in the fact that we are talking about a streamer who probably touched the beta for a total of 5 hours, and you should see why its a problem. Albeit not a major problem, but indeed a problem. The fact is, Blizzard shouldnt be trying to get more people to play the game because it was already proven there is a large group of people who have been asking for this for a long time. Evident by the fact that asmongold got 100k viewers running the DEADMINES! Evident by the fact there are certain realms in Private servers that have a larger population then some WoW realms.How about Blizzard worries about THOSE people, the ones that made this even possible... Its a slap in the face to every dedicated player who has been begging/waiting for classic to make a return, for Blizzard to just hand out betas to dickriding streamers who dont know shit about the game. I get it, they want publicity and thats fine. But they achieved the max amount of streamer publicity when you have Asmongold and Soda garnering the numbers they are on a daily basis to this day.
---
Nope, they removed it a long time ago, same with nights actually being dark, now night time is the exact same lighting but with a slightly darker sky.

You'd love it. It's the single most overpowered class that's ever existed in wow. Best healers, best tanks, good dps. Could do no wrong with a druid

Ah, I honestly couldn't remember so I based it off of what people were saying, at least for the wsg thing

Can a mod please make this a sticky.
---
Nope! Because the one I was taming never disappeared. I watched it continue to patrol before I released.
---
I didn’t realize it was a bug until I called my pet and it was the rare.
---
Streamers are celebrities. Wherever there are celebrities, there are toxic fans.
---
Gank a streamer? Get prepared for 1000 level 1 alts to whisper you death threats.
---
Don't pass on loot to a streamer? Get prepared for the same.
---
There's a bigger concern of what having so many fans will do to the economy balance of the game. In Beta, we're seeing streamers being handed everything from gold to consumables just by yelling that they need it.
---
In Vanilla, you sphere of influence was mostly limited to your guild and friends and not 30,000+ viewers.
---
Credit was only recently given on the main page, to which it does suffice and is no longer an issue. I have never criticized the work sage has put into the layout or transcription, though i did find his " i learnt x programming languages rheeeee" rather funny however the guide is simply at this stage unfinished. 
---
I am currently compiling a list of suggestions and errors to help improve the guide although I am quite confident even if the suggestions are valid they will be ignored. 
---
The entire problem with the guide lies in the fact there is little innovation,  if it is not in Varraks play through it is just listed as *add more content here* or grind here 16 bars short. Furthermore he adds in dungeons, dungeon quests, quests that require profession items that will be scarce at launch or very costly if you are slow and they are actually available. The swamp of sorrows is a good add  but a obvious one.
---
To be honest, you should just roll horde and use Navak's upcoming guide,  if you want a pretty guide  ally guide that uses borderline inefficient routing by all means have fun with sages guide. 
---
Hopefully by the time classic releases its issues with be addressed because they can be.
---
Nah, Blessings I'd probably say were better in PvE. But PvP is hordes domain hands down.
---
I mean to be fair, this is quite common in procrastination. I do it all the time where you refuse to one thing because it might be considered a waste of time, just to continue putting off what I actually need to do and waste more time. I actually have this with gaming. I avidly play CSGO with other people. So when I used to have exams I would tell them "no I can't play CSGO, I have exams", only to go watch movies and smoke weed, to put off studying. In my mind it works "I can quit this movie at any point and go back to studying, yet I can't bail out in the middle of a game". See what I mean?
---
Morally bankrupt is morally bankrupt. Take that comment of yours for instance, the only defense you can mount is to grossly oversell. I can do that too, for one thing you remind me of that amerimoron who said ''the confederacy is maybe not the greatest idea anyone ever had'', in response to being confronted about how his granddaddy sold people as property.
---
In the long run you have thunderfury which makes axe spec useless ...
---
They removed it for Stress Testers, yes.
---
Stress test option, yes, for now. They didn't want to confuse people who thought they still had access. Will come back in June and July.
---
Westfall, Ashenvale?

If you're looking for a casual horde pvp guild, lmk!
---
Silverpine forest! It is my favorite old zone. I spent so much time there.
---
Everything looks iconic on a female dwarf tbh
---
It's not a slap in the face you are being melodramatic. There is a criteria to get onto the beta.  Pokimane meets the have thousands of people who watch you play games part of that criteria. Shes one person. One spot in the beta. Get over it. It's not a big deal at all. 
---
And the idea of more streamers is to attract different audiences. Her audience probably has a lot of viewers that dotn watch asmongold or sodapoppin.
---
As a college professor the rules are a bit different.
---
So you're calling in to work if you have the sniffles? That seems.. A bit much.
---
If I have a runny nose aka cold, I'm not calling in to work.
---
I keep sanitizer at my desk regardless. 
---
I'm just shocked that the biggest light to me in this thread is that people will call in if they're not feeling 100%.
---
I was going to mention tanaris. Gadgetzan is also fun. We used to climb up on the top of the building and dps people
---
See, everything really is a hunter weapon!
---
How is this even a question? Horde being favored in vanilla was so widely known it was one of the first memes...
---
Stonetalon mountains
---
Can't they type in 100ms somewhere and test it?
---
It's a pretty good way to craft a few pieces of armor if you appreciate looking for patterns and such. I play as a hunter and do it for the rp factor.
---
Humans are really bad at remembering things. I remember the WSG Flag thing because I broke a keyboard because of rage &amp; fall damage because I played tons of Paladin back then.

Dude I'd love it if I could get 1000 streamer fans banned for death threats
---
I wish game developers would realize they have a problem, when we stop talking to each other. Even when we don't talk, we watch. Some of my fonder memories from vanilla were accidentally running into mobs or off a cliff because I was fascinated by a chat log discussion and wasn't watching where my character was going.
---
With this spec you are able to push more dps without pulling aggro, making fights a bit faster. A few healers can just spam heal the main tank, making the mitigation not as important. The fight should end fast enough for the healers to not go oom. I'll add tha this spec is for decently geared raid groups.
---
It's because your browser is still loading the awful bloated custom CSS even if your RES extension is hiding it.
---
Are you rolling alliance or horde?
---
Or just don’t be a beta and tell them they’re shit at the game if they’re bad.
---
I'm so fucking sorry I'm not shitting on hunters like everyone else without explaning why.
---
Are you sure you want that in your pocket? I certainly hope there are no unfortunate trips to the hospital.  A little bit too stabby for the nether-regions.
---
So how come people know them? Were they popular streamers in the past years? I never heard of them, just found out now in this thread that some of their members are streaming Classic.
---
I've played both sides through out the years, the experience is the same as far as the player base goes. The racials are only a big deal for min/maxers. IMO, it's the visuals that matter the most as you'll be looking at your choice for as long as you play. I'm going Alliance this time because I love the cat mounts, want easy access to cuter small pets, and want to be able to get the Winterspring Frostsaber. Pure visual choices on my part. I love Orcs and Trolls, but I love the kitty mounts more.   
---
 If you don't like the visuals of the Horde, go Alliance. It's as simple as that. There will be plenty of awesome Guilds on both sides.
---
But you are advocating for change, the patch deemed most complete by blizz contains that change. By preventing cross realm bgs you CHANGE vanilla at that form. It’s a slippery slope and a bad idea
---
Faction balance will be a huge issue, more so than in retail. Why? Because being the dominant faction actually matters. Spawns are limited, and you're going to be fighting the opposite faction for them, pve or pvp.
---
For all our big talk, most people who go into classic want an easy right. If server X is the alliance server, and server Y is the horde server, people will roll with the dominant faction to get that advantage.
---
As far as I'm aware, there is never, ever, a benefit to being a part of the smaller faction on a server.
---
We don't call out because we are lazy or can't work... We call out so we don't get others sick. My boss doesn't want me getting my co-workers sick.

It’s for people in naxx gear who are doing aq20/zg/bwl. Not people trying to keep bosses from going after a massive ignite tick mage

Awesome man! Been using Luna for years on all the private servers. Thousand times better than xpearl.

Lmao it's not new. It's an old meme spec that was trash and nobody played it because it was trash.
---
Shockadin was for pvp
---
The batching itself has so big window that it feels like you playing with 150+ ms, even if it's 0 ms. 
---
Every mage have been complaining about that, you can't properly land your nova/cone of cold at the moment, there is leeway issues that causes you to miss half of your targets. 
---
To counterplay that, you have to do stupid things, stop moving completely before you press the button, minimising melee range leeway and actions per minute. 
---
Lets hope that 3 months we have will not be in vain, and devs hopefully consider something they can do about it.
---

No you wouldn't. Having a mob directed at you is never fun. It could take days for a GM to get back to you. And if they don't use language that gets them banned, there's no stopping them.
---
That's what I'm leaning towards.  Imp fort, imp shield, sounds good to me
---
Ignoring the whoosh, Photoshop was a professional program that cost quite a lot back then, if I remember right. You weren't able to download a hack of it online or alternative problems that do the same thing like you can now.
---
Darkshore is one of my favorite zones but the moment you step into the colorful ashenvale after questing in that gray silent zone is truly magical.
---
They streamed and a few of them make amazing pvp videos.
---
What are you talking about, the MAJORITY of vanilla didnt have it yet everyone is accusing me of trying to change vanilla because I want it back?
---
If going on PvP server, they can't make Alliance/Horde on the same server. Can always make it on another, but that's not as fun :P
---
Got you beat. Wife’s due on the 25th.. took 6 weeks to “help”

---
&gt;Just get comfortable enough and be able to get ahead of the rush
---
This is it for me. I'm going ballllls deep on this game when it comes out. I'll have a main and an alt. My alt I'll spend time. Go slow, fish, cook etc as I level and take my time. My main? I want to get to 30 as quick as possible. That's when people start to peeter out. That's when the rush will subside. That's when I'll actually be able to play WoW instead of...what the launch will be.
---
Works for all social media imo.

I really miss his content, especially WTF. I don't trust any other Youtuber's opinion on games the way I trusted John Bain's.

He was the only reviewer I knew who did exactly what every competitive gamer does when installing new games, exploring the settings menus.

Oh, didn't realize this was a circle jerk post about who wastes more time, you or people you don't agree with.

Simple answer is you should stop worrying about how other people spend their time.  Moron.

bfa isnt garbage
---
Oh right. Thanks for the information
---
One of my most favorite memories is summoning an infernal and not realizing it becomes unbound from you. I was in Brill showing my low level buddy how cool my pets were. I couldn't get it back under control before it killed me. Then proceeded to rampage for a solid 20min killing all of the nearby players and npcs. It took multiple people to kill it. My internet was crap at the time so I had dc'd already and my buddy called me to relay the carnage that was going on.
---
Crappy shack because he was saving up for his fancy armor and weapon for WotLK. That man knew how to save and spend wisely. Also his crappy shack was in a place that's the opposite of the Bahamas, so that any females wouldn't be inclined to stay, which helps saving even more money. Double smart. Paladins these days have lost that. Now it's get into debt and live large, and save later.
---
I play Rogue, I can just vanish after doing my backstab and sinister strikes!
---
Ah, well my OP is stupid then lol. Thanks.
---
It has built-in healing prediction and out of the box click-casting with modifier support. It has druid shapeshift mana bar, reckoning stack tracker, energy pulse ticker and combo point tracker built in. It lets you display cast bars for party members, pets, yourself and target/target of target. Completely modular, so you can set up cast bars however you like.
---
The raid frames are pretty feature rich. You can set up debuff/crowd control trackers which is handy for PvP, there's healing prediction for the raid frames so you can see who's getting healed for how much and when they're getting healed. There's also an incoming damage prediction feature so you know ahead of time who's about to get hit with burst damage, which is extremely useful in 40 man raids or PvP.
---
Pretty good addon. There's a reason why it's basically mandatory for all raiders and every PvP healer uses it (on private servers).
---
&gt;Lol, what the hell. I remember it was a pretty big thing in the patch notes when it was released :\\

Why insult me? I'm not aggressive. You're contradicting yourself right now because you're giving me an advice you're obviously not following yourself.
---
What faction?
---
To each their own. I'm personally very unsatisfied with the expansion but if you do, there's more power to you!
---
First of all the majority of vanilla had non linked realms so please stop pretending like I'm trying to change things. They are releasing FM, mc, bwl, etc in phases so why wouldnt this be released according to their release schedule as well? This isnt a change, locking cross realm bgs into the entirety of classic is the change.
---
The thumbnail is the tank from Red Alert!
---
&gt; If that is the case, why the fuck do you need a loot system at all?  People who raided for years together, understand that Loot is a means to  an end.   
---
&gt; Of course you don't, because you are an officer / GM of course, as are your PServer buddies. 
---
My guild uses loot council. I'm a raider and not in the business of telling officers/GMs to switch systems or even suggesting it. This was just something I came up with and wanted to share with the community because it makes sense to me.
---
&gt; Self contradictory sentence right there.  
---
Besides, so in your system  if someone cannot attend for, say personal reasons for two weeks he  doesn't get anything anymore? Sounds like a really shitty environment. 
---
I get the feeling you have very low reading comprehension, and my condolences go out to you. If someone can't attend raids for two weeks, then they will have to continuously attend raids afterwards before they receive loot again. I don't know how this could be any more obvious.
---
&gt; Idiotic system. It scares people off your guild, feeding into exactly  the fantasies of trials getting screwed over by guilds. All good raiding  guilds I have ever been in, grant Trials the same right to loot as  everyone else. The ones that didn't, were the ones that fell apart  quickly. 
---
Any guild that prioritizes loot to members that aren't even full members and they're just trying out over members that have put in their time and proven their worth is objectively a garbage guild. I'm sorry that you had to endure that. When I joined my guild, I never received a BiS item over a full member until I was a full member, and I couldn't have been happier to be in such a well-run guild.
---
&gt; Not even remotely. Within what you described, officers (aka. your  PServer buddies) can influence the loot decision on every single level,  starting with peoples priority lists, up to and including forcing  passes. 
---
Sure, if they wanted people to leave. If the loot sheets are public, then all information is exposed to everyone and people can make decisions for themselves about how they feel about what's going on and stay or leave accordingly.
---
&gt;Your  system will blow up every single guild eventually, unless it's a bunch  of people who know and trust each other. There will be Officer abuse,  and as soon as that happens, it's game over, and your reputation on the  realm is ruined.
---
Shit guilds blow up all the time, regardless of loot system. The loot system is automated and all information is public. I fail to see where trust and abuse factors into this. But again, not the best reading comprehension apparently.
---
PS I love the salt about me playing on private servers. Please keep it flowing. I'm sorry you weren't privileged enough to play during the golden age of WoW and think that anything after WotLK was even halfway decent. Keep us updated on which pre-60 level you get to before you quit because it's too hard.
---
Haha so true

Incredible watch. Glad he took the time to do this.

Good riddance.

Phat purplez are more than enough of a carrot for pretty much any raider.

Teldrassil no doubt!
---
My first 60 was a druid, and it sucked not being able to see your own gear. I loved my lvl19 gnome rogue twink more..
---
Ok well this kinda sucks because now I have the beta client installed but no way to uninstall it now. If you try to uninstall from the control panel it tells you to uninstall from the Battle.net launcher. But you can’t uninstall it from the launcher because it was removed from the launcher.
---
Oh I know, I just figured it wouldn't matter, since they'd be playing with brand new people on the Aliiance anyway. Unless they were dead set on targeting their buddies 😋
---
\^ mad because they can't consistently attend a raid schedule
---
Archeage also did it by launching new servers with older versions of the game but more to re-monetize the game with micro transactions.
---
Yes, cause inconvenient locations of things were a problem exclusive to horde...
---
Hey there i just found this discussion. I am thinking to roll a rogue and after reading your post and this blog post i think that maybe it is worth to sacrifice Lethality for MoD?? my pvp build would look like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/As4BA_MgMATzrMwc
---
What do you think?
---
The only thing you’ll miss is the Grand Exchange
---
Cool story bro.
---
Yes I think that’s a great idea... heh heh heh
---
I'm not advocating changes I want the big schedule to be released according to their content schedule, which would mean cross realm after naxx. Why are people framing me as an anti #nochanges advocate. Im not,  and ive been very passionate about vanilla for a long time.
---
I'm really sorry to hear about all of your family members passing away. You should take a break from the guild to recover emotionally. A permanent break.
---
Panda land for sure
---
There and back again
---
&gt; I doubt very much you've ever had an honest conversation about this subject, and I don't see the point in trying. In fact, I think it's counter productive, because I'd prefer it if your type just avoided Classic in general.
---
I would like to! Most of the people I have talked with cannot articulate what they are looking for in this game, often contradict themselves, and otherwise do not know what they want. 
---
Which is going to lead to a lot of people being disappointed with the game. Developers will not know what to add or remove from the game since the players have a difficult time explaining what they like and don't like. 
---
&gt; As hilarious as I find your inability to comprehend a different perspective than your own,
---
I think you're the one that's having difficulties. 
---
&gt; Rather than design a version of the game that makes no one happy... you can have your version and we'll have ours.
---
I am not sure what this is in relation to. 
---
&gt; It's a bit spergy for you to come to the 'others' sub
---
You're throwing out a lot of projection and intellectual superiority with this statement. This isn't an exclusive sub. I have the beta and I've been playing Classic. I've been playing since Vanilla. You don't have a monopoly on the topic simply because you feel like you're in the right. Honestly, based on this statement and what you've been saying so far, you're the one that is projecting like crazy!
---
&gt; but considering popular opinion on BFA, I can't say I'm surprised you find arguing about Classic more fulfilling than actually playing the said "superior in every way" version, lol.
---
More projection and strawman. I never said BfA was the pentacle of WoW. I said every expansion that follows Vanilla has been a better iteration of the game in almost all categories. To the point where suggesting that Classic is better is objectively false. 
---
And when objectivity is removed from the discussion, only subjective criticism remains. 
---
But clearly this has gotten you terribly upset. Perhaps you should steer clear of discussions that force you to confront different viewpoints if the most you're going to do is project and use ad hominem.
---
How does it work in Classic - cause I remember that I had to add each friend into the friendlist of each character. If that still works, then there shouldn't be a problem to make an alt you can use to play with your co worker. I know I did that in the past, I had a "social" toon in one guild and then an alt who practically nobody of the social guild knew in a raid guild.
---
Warlock Priest is way better duo than warrior paladin or warrior priest.
---
I plan to play a healing Pala, but I'm so gonna fucking get a corrupted Ashbringer the second I see it
---
Hey, look, another moron who has no idea what layering is.
---
"Don't do something different even though it has absolutely nothing to do with WoW Classic as a game"
---
Nobody knows how long phase 1 is. In interviews Ion said “A few weeks” a lot. You likely won’t be 60 after a few weeks
---
In addition they are releasing content according to a schedule, wouldnt the most #nochanges be to have the cross realm technology follow that content release schedule as well?
---
I always lovely elwyn Forrest. The color pallet, the warm and friendly music, it's just so peaceful and has a sense of serenity to it for me
---
You must be great fun at parties.
---
Huh.  Never would have noticed if you hadn't said something.
---
They bulge in the middle due to failed silicone injections.
---
In a top 5 guild until 2007 and only had tier 2? Interesting
---
Yeah I started playing WoW on dial up. I feel your pain
---
Im building a 2080ti sli setup... best believe im still running the game on classic settings
---
Retail mods are not compatible with classic. It's a different game with a completely different api
---
What guild has one person farming flasks for the rest of the players? If people are expected to show up with consumables, then that's the expectation on an individual level to be in the guild. Raid loggers typically have a hard time keeping up with those kinds of requirements.
---
What was it in 1.12?
---
I had a lot of Tier 3 but that was purely a healing set and never looked as nice.
---
Don't forget Kargoz
---
Same thing was also in the Blizzcon demo - melee with long range. Is it an actual vanilla thing?
---
EQ was just as inspired by D&amp;D art for their cover.
---
All of the raids were complete in 1.12 yet they are releasing those according to a content schedule that mimicked vanilla. Why should this be different? This is literally #nochanges
---
Watch out OP, you angered the blizzard circlejerk mafia by criticizing layering
---
what? Dragon Stalker is one of the best sets in game
---
I agree. But that is a blanket statement that applies equally to tanks, healers, dps, and healers specd for dps. By default, if all I can look at is your talent tree, I'm going to assume the person with the cookie cutter spec will be a better addition than the meme spec.
---
Gay
---
Yeah I’m not being clear. That’s what I mean by I don’t get it.
---
Only if you get invites again. It is not guranteed
---
I get the etiquette argument, I was replying directly to your statement that it was strictly better for a feral Druid and was arguing against that statement.
---
All these people getting burned out 30-40 when that's when it just starts getting good smh
---
That's the best part, screwing over your friends :)
---
They really are, it doesn't help if you have things that fog your memory. Like private servers, nothing against them but it definitely doesn't help with remembering how specific things in vanilla might've been
---
Oh you will definitely get counter played, not even by the player but the npcs as well. Imagine you are a paladin healer in dungeon and warrior tank get hit by fatal damage. You will make godlike reflexive play and use Lay On Hands on him. But the spell batching decides to counters you and he will die anyway and your lay on hands will be on cooldown. You all will wipe. What a fun. Or better one - it will happen on Ragnaros with remaining 4% of hp. It brings much more negative things than positive ones (cant name one)
---
Most people that want to play classic.. never played classic. 
---
This was implemented because well.. UO already existed and it's not like blizzard rammed their head into the sand and didn't look at the problems with people killing shit.
---
I did this but I gave myself monday 26th free as well to do shopping and prepare for launch.
---
**WE WILL BE PREPARED**
---
Is the helmet the human is wearing even available? I love those green wings on the side ;-;
---
It sounds like you're going to treat offspec and mainspec gear as equal, ie you are going to roll for both as if they are your first priority set. 
---
No, that wont make anybody happy. In fact it will get you blacklisted by some.
---
Ah yeah, PvP I think would be super hit or miss. I think it'd depend on if you look at pure pugs or premades and so on. Definitely think horde has a decent argument for them being better for pvp though
---
Re-read the last four words of my post.
---
Good to know thanks. I had to ask, since visually they look identical.
---
*semen*
---
Hi, /u/Danieboy
---
AH dam that sucks i was just thinking of going rogue now but this made me thing xD
---
The only rl friend I'll team up with in Classic is my brother, but other than that: most of my real life friends would probably hold me back.
---
So what you are saying is 1 you do t have balls and your co worker is an immature prick Who would not understand you are not on same skill level?
---
Second Who The hell calls in sick from work to play? You take a vacation. You dont call sick that just makes you an ass and not co worker. And btw IF you Can move out of bed you Can bloddy well work. Im an avid hc gamer but i condone all of this..  Immature be responsable.
---
Yep they do nothing wrong there xD
---
Holy Cow ftw!
---
Hit boxes for all races have been confirmed to be correct.
---
Appear offline?
---
Here's a tip: Don't surround yourself with people who shame you for doing things you like. They are not your friends or people you want to work with.
---
Criticism requires coherence to be worth something. His "criticism" literally makes no sense. Layering is not sharding, and it's also not long-term. It would not, under any conceivable circumstance, prevent a "server photo".
---
You deal decent dmg and you get the healer que for LFG. All around its a fun spec to play too. In pvp if you get interrupted in one school of magic, you just use a heal from the opposite school. I love it
---
Yea i figured that now from what i am being told
---
Duskwood
---
Eu or Na?
---
If you want to have an older or worser grafic, if i remember correctly there is an option in the beta at the moment?
---
Yea but it getting rag and stuff you know?
---
They're not awesome, but you'll get to experience *Barrens Chat.* Unlike the Alliance side, the Horde quests keep you in the Barrens for a while so the chat is always active and you'll get to know the people on your server better. Skeleton horses, worgs, and raptors are all cool mounts. Travel is easier with the goblin zeppelins. You can get to Booty Bay sooner to put up horde only pets on the AH. Saying "FOR THE HORDE" is way more fun than "For The Alliance!".
---
Its important to keep making threats on official blizzard forums to wake up blizzard devs. We still have 3 more months to change their mind
---
props.this
---
no mad because imagine having 5 rogues in raid and you are the 5th rogue you would have to raid for 1 month (best case scenario) without getting any upgrades what so ever not even having miniscule chance to get it because there are 4 rogue in queue before you because "show up to more raids"
---
no sane player is gonna continue to play for that guild 
---
the OP lives in some perfect communist world of his own if he thinks random players (hardcore or nay) will play for the "greater good of the guild" instead of getting themselves geared
---
Would these specs be possible to run classic wow/most other games?
---
What exactly did I not understand? Layering will surely make me miss tons of cool stuff happening on my server. With my luck I’ll always end up on the boring layer.
---
Eh, it's ok but the premiere tanks in Classic is Prot Warrior. The problem with Prot Pally is a lack of taunt but the pro is AoE.
---
If they're gradually adding stuff is easier to test like this, i mean you might be right that they won't test 30-60 content but just rely on how rigid the previous systems work.
---
&gt; coming into work when you know you're unwell is incredibly selfish
---
Kind of the opposite.  You're doing harm to yourself in order to just be at the office to make sure work doesn't get behind.
---
That's the main reason I'll work unless I'm seriously sick (which includes being contagious... but then I can work from home).  I don't want work to get behind just because I'm sick.  A lot of the people I work with are like that.
---
It's not just because we're American, and it's not something our job pushes us to do.  Rather the opposite.  Our boss will tell us not to work if we're not feeling well, and doesn't like us doing any work (even replying to emails) if we're on vacation because, well, we're supposed to be on vacation.
---
I once worked from home for a few days because I needed to wait for new glasses and going to the office (even using the bus) wasn't really safe (nearsightedness and astigmatism in both eyes makes walking kind of rough without glasses).
---
Heck, the office becomes a ghost town some days during the winter because people get sick and they're told to go home until they're not sick.
---
Absolutely, if you can afford it. I was writing from a fresh server speed levelling perspective, where you probably won’t have 3 gold to spare at 26.
---
Please make more this is fucking great
---
Bruhh i think that seems to be the main thing like there will be tones of rogues with just tunnelled gear in to them by the guild and then no one wants me :(
---
ITT: People who think this is Nagrand.
---
I added someone to my bnet to play overwatch a long time ago and every single time I'd log in I would instantly get invited or be in the middle of a game when he did it.  I can't stand that shit.  If I want to play with you, I will ask you to play but I hate blind invites.
---
Homie you're gonna Get beat if you don't follow through on that help
---
Hi! Never played vanilla before (except a little bit on private servers), but I'm just hyped about the launch after I experienced how the leveling and the endgame was on pservers. I enjoyed every minute of it, but for the launch, I want to get prepared and get lvl60 fast as possible without falling behind to the pack, whos leveling normally (hope you understand what I'm trying to say)
---
I'm planning on playing a warrior, since I really enjoyed tanking, and overall I feel like warrior is a great class, even if they not that viable solo (pvp/leveling).
---
For the race, I really want to pick tauren, I feel like the plus 5% hitpoints, and the AOE interrupt/stun is just fantastic as a prot warrior, and, I just like how taurens look.
---
Sooo...I look for a partner who willing to play a druid (or shaman, but I prefer druids), and whos just as nolife as me (at least at the launch).
---
I'm from Hungary, so the timezone is GMT+1, I don't know how much it matters really, I don't want that big of a gap in terms of timezones. I have a 2 and a half week off at the launch, so I'm planning to do at least \~30h at the start, then 16-18 hours the following days until 60. I want to work out a route at least to lvl30-40, and after that we can use a simple leveling guide, but still, it depends how many people going to level on the same area, etc-etc.
---
Thats...basically it. If u interested in this concept contact me on discord (polygon#5662) and we can talk more about the leveling route and such.
---
(Sorry for my horrible english, I hope the majority of the post is understandable)
---
Fuuuuuck this. It's an addon to improve the UI, and it is completely optional. You can accomplish the same functionality with the base UI and macros, but it will never look as sleek, pretty, and customizable.
---
I currently play WoW while smithing in OSRS. Just use windowed mode and it's fine.
---
Such an overkill for wow classic but yeah it would run games well
---
Most modern religions are up for grabs, be it copying them completely or outright making fun of them. The only ones off limits are Christianity because a large portion of Americans would be upset, and Islam, because a large portion of Muslims would be upset. A small portion of said Muslims might even kill people over it.... I would say they would be used more in fantasy settings if this wasn't the case, but truthfully speaking, both religions are pretty boring compared to the gods of... well, everyone else. So they still wouldn't see much more use. I doubt Jesus would be running around throwing Wine in SMITE, for example.
---
What a pathetic excuse for a Christian. Read your bible and see that our savior was about love and acceptance. You are the opposite of what you should be.
---
Illidan would/will be proud
---
Also need to bring mana pots to raids
---
And i said there are more than one sword worth using over an axe, can you read?
---
I’m such a noob about PC parts because I’ve always just played on my laptops for school but finally graduated so trying to find a good desktop

Like fuck I’m not staying home with a cold lol
---
500 skip minus? Did this guy pull whelps like 10 times? I thought it was a 50 dkp minus....
---
Literally can't decide between ne female druid or Hunter.    Both so good
---
The specs are kinda lackluster. What type of ram? Why is it a beast? What's the PSU and mobo? 
---
But yes it can run most games. I'd upgrade the CPU to the next gen Ryzen that comes out the 8th July or something like that, and it'll be good to go for another couple years.
---
good that i dont have a job in the first place
---
On a BC private server, that was how I got into Moonglade. Swam north from Darkshore until zone read Moonglade, drowned, rezzed in Moonglade graveyard. Not sure about running there while already dead.
---
No worries but you may be able to build a pc for cheaper and learn how online just as an fyi.
---
Bless you if you think you’ll only be waiting 1 minute for contested quests
---
First started playing as a kid, never hit max level or anything just fucked around on trial accounts and was amazed by the scale of the world. Around 14 or so in Wrath was when I first leveled to 80 and started raiding. Played a little more in college for WoD and Legion, haven't re-subbed since. Looking forward to coming home after work, booting up classic and getting back into the first game that stole my imagination and heart. While working a full time job and going to grad school at night I doubt I'll have enough time to raid and stuff, but it'll be nice to be able to join a fun guild and run some dungeons, do some BG's and level.
---
If your goal is to feel wanted, rogue isn’t the class I’d pick first.  All that being said, good players putting in the effort really stand out regardless of class.  Rogues are a helluva lot of fun, to keep our guild raid healers around, a lot of our DPS would roll alt Paladins/Priests (and a druid or two) to help equip our healing staff’s rogue/hunter/fury warrior alts get a little ZG/AQ20/MC gear, it meant a lot to them that they might be playing a raid-level priest/pally/druid with awesome gear,  and still get to have a “little red sports car” DPS/PvP alt “in the garage” that had semi-awesome gear.
---
They already stated that layering will be used only for the launch of classic with the worst possible case being layering staying up until phase 2. Im not sure what exactly you are going to miss out in that timespan and even if they is some interesting event you will most likely hear of it if its noteworthly and can be invited to that layer anyway.
---
53?
---
Dude! No need to roll alone if you don't want to. My guild that some friends and I formed at the launch of BFA will be rolling Alliance on a PvP server. We'll be fairly casual, but gearing toward BiS for raiding &amp; move from there. Of course, PvP will be a frequent activity. 
---
If you (or anyone else) want in, send me a message!
---
I added some people from work to play overwatch with and all it did was make me furious because they are so bad at the game.
---
We have 3 kids already. Newborns ain’t bad.
---
Also my oldest will be playing. Huntard of course
---
From my experience wow players and OSRS players didn't like the other game. Had a roommate who played RS while I played WoW back in like 2006. We always tried to get the other into our game, and after trying it, we never lasted longer than a week on the other game.
---
If you're looking for videos I'd just suggest looking up class picking guides (plz pick which class just speaks to you the most, you'll have 100x more fun). One guy I've been liking lately is ClassicWinds on youtube...he has a nice little channel with some helpful vids.
---
Yes but so was naxx, dm, mc, etc and we arent launching with those.
---
If we m burning a sick day, I’ll use it however the fuck I want, but I also have a really good job as a software engineer and don’t have to deal with that kind of BS.
---
Unfortunately, ytmnd are having some pretty serious server problems right now.
---
Its called pre-casting for a reason. cast a big heal on a tank before they have even taken any damage and stop your cast if they havent taken damage before you finish the cast.
---
Most of the time they do take damage within your cast time and then you can just finish the cast happily.
---
Regardless of healing spell, this is a common healer tactic on tanks.
---
Of all three tiers, the most well made models are definitely the T2. 
---
T1 was great. 
---
T2 was stunning. 
---
T3 was just plain rubbish.
---
Eh, idk man.  The fun for a release is also the huge amount of people.   It's a. Experience in itself
---
Just because it can be done doesn't mean you will be wanted.
---
Guilds are not built around scraping past the bar. They take the best composition they can.
---
My retail guild of 10 years ago is getting back together
---
No one cares, get your anti streamer jerk circle pack of white knights and stop crying so much.
---
im with this person
---
Take some time on the weekends to enjoy your family and real life. WoW will be waiting for whenever you want it, but you'll blink and your kid will be off to school, college, working on his own in no time.
---
I believe this or like 54. I want to say there's a 6 level spread but I could be wrong. This sounds about right.
---
I don't see a problem here.
---
??????????
---
The point is, that just because something was reasonably available on the auction house on a private server, doesnt mean that will be the case on live servers. Also, just because an item had a proc rate assessed on private servers, we wont know the actual proc rate till servers are live.
---
Yes! I love LUF. Can't wait to use it again.
---
Real vanilla literally always had dynamic respawn timers. In every single location of the game. This has been confirmed by Blizzard.
---
I'd rather be able to swap between two specs, too as then I'd be more inclined to roll a Tank or Healer and swap to DPS when farming. It's a QOL change that made things easier for anyone not playing a pure DPS class, which would benefit the community as that would mean more tanks/healers. The #NoChanges crowd won't have that.
---
Tier 2 Pally armor will never not be the coolest shit to me
---
HANDLE IT

Highmountain is the best zone post wrath.
---
No one ever comes back to answer this when asked.
---
I finish my EMT course on the 31st, and I put in my two weeks that week as well, and I don't start school until the spring time. I'll see you there.
---
It’s yucky to min max going into MC when it’s wholly unnecessary and takes away from the fun and discovery in gearing up more organically, yes absolutely.
---
Look I get you want it a specific way but for better or worse 1.12 is what was agreed and they've been very clear. Change it to how it was in a previous patch just means  everything else has to change either that or it's now wide open to interpretation what is "classic" wow. If we are going to ask for stuff can we go up to the last burning crusade patch? That way I get my blood elf Paladin again and Ret was fun before the whole need to the ground crap!
---
I understand, but this feature either is or is not in the game and I dont think its possible to limit it to certain pvp plays
---
1. Layering kicks in to simulate normal maximum server thresholds, so for all intents and purposes, you will have a full server's population of people around you regardless of your layer.
---
2. It's simple to move to a new layer with your guild mates if you want to take a photo like these people did.
---
3. The whole system is going to be in the game for a couple of weeks. There won't be "tons of cool stuff" happening. Hell, the vast majority of the playerbase won't even be level 60 by the time they remove it. It's literally there to create a buffer for retail tourists who won't likely stick around but will still cause population issues in the launch period during Phase 1.
---
4. The system is preventing them from relying on two very, very bad alternatives: 4-hour queue times, or servers that die after a month. In both of those cases, you'll sure as shit be missing out on more "cool stuff" (if we accept the premise that server-wide cool things will be happening in the very early game) by either not being able to log into the game *at all*, or being stuck on a server with an anemic, dwindling population.
---
If your concern is to avoid missing out on cool stuff, then you should be in favor of the technology, since it will give you a consistently large population beyond the launch period and smooth out pop decreases that most assuredly will occur before Phase 2 hits.
---
At any length, if you dislike layering, you should dislike it for at least minimally coherent reasons, such as people exploiting the tech to hop across layers for extra level 60 mat farming. Layering would never prevent people from taking a picture like the one you linked. It literally just doesn't work that way. It's not sharding.
---
For me it's deadwind pass for sure
---
thanks, it's definitely not garbage.
---
Ashenvale is the prettiest IMO
---
I can't tell from this angle but did the size of the bear change once you tamed it? That shouldn't happen in vanilla, I remember pets didn't change size probably until Cataclysm. Might have to submit a bug report on that.
---
Man. I absolutely think streamers can have an affect in the game, and I’m cautious. However, we were doing stupid shit in original, all it takes is an idea to take hold in city chats and suddenly you have 100 level 1 gnomes going after Hogger.
---
Thank you for your post.
---
Credit has only recently been applied to the main page, but its there now and that's a good thing, its no longer an issue.
---
I will agree the guide is well put together and transcribed, the problem comes in that at the end of the day that is 90% Varraks route which has the wrong XP values. Adding in "add more content" or " 16 xp bars short short, grind" does not really assist the player it just shows a lack of creativity and ability to reroute and just rely's further on Varraks run. Yes I am aware of all the dungeon quests/ if you are a mage section / attunement quests and quests that require profession items that are costly at launch. Swamp of Sorrows is a good addition credit is due there.
---
Hopefully this can be addressed before classic, but you would probably just be better off using Navak's up and coming guide. He was a pserver admin and first horde level 30 on beta. He actually has the ability to come up with his own guide/route from scratch, playtest it and not rely on a mostly irrelevant run.
---
I mean no disrespect to you but go test the guide from start to finish before judging, man ;)
---
Time is something you cannot get back, so when a player trusts a guide creator he should get the best possible information to save him frustration and time. Lets not go around giving effort trophies and fix the problem. Again credit has been expanded upon its a step in the right direction.
---
“He shit his britches!”
---
48.
---
&gt; Instead of copies of individual zones, they're going to run multiple copies of the entire world (single cohesive Eastern Kingdoms).*** Each copy will have a similar capacity to a Vanilla server back then.***
---
Man this is such a sad way of thinking. I've met some of my closest friends and even previous flatmates from previous places I've worked. Working in IT has been one of the best ways for me to meet other people who are interested in gaming

Counterpoint: Streamers have the means to organize mass scale cooperative experiences, the likes of which would be far more difficult, if not impossible, without their audience.
---
Dont play with them then
---
Oh...I read the D as a 0. Oops.
---
Well done.
---
But did you take blessing of light into calculations? how does that affect the hps considering rank 4 holy light basically heals as much as rank 6 flash of light (not a huge difference) and is more mana efficient according to HtOOM-chart.
---
Blessing of light = 400 more healing for holy light and 100 more for flash of light. (something like that)
---
Naturally the less gear players do the more powerful blessing of light is due to its static boost in healing power.
---
waaaaah
---
There's still at least 1 more coming.
---
You could also not be a self consciousness creton and just tell this nerd to fuck off if he sucks, and to keep on rolling if he doesn’t. Why avoid the possibility of making a new friend? Because you’re scared you might end up hurting his feelings? Fuckin what?
---
Also why do you keep saying "12 hours of WoW?"
---
You know you can play it for an hour or two and then stop?
---
Well I suppose that's out of our expertise to say. I'm sure there's something they can do to improve upon the current implementation especially due to the amount of feedback they are getting.
---
Ok, but the previous one ended.
---
I saw someone from my old guild! Oh this is awesome thanks for the link.
---
I used Blink **a lot** in Classic. It was a real skill to time it right, but when you had a lot of practice, you could pull it off 90-95% of the time, depending on the ground you're falling on though.
---
MOAR DOTS
---
I'm looking forward to adventuring with people who have not yet experienced WoW. Sorry but sound like you might have some social issues OP.
---
Aw I love generations in wow. Can't wait for his first ubrs pet pull
---
You still don’t have a tank for groups, the VW can help tank in leveling though.
---
&gt; People will complain when its supposedly a no complain system when  officers can tell others they cant have certain gear for whatever the  reason. Its basically loot council but theres no incentive to perform  well in raids. When a player questions a loot council decision on why an  officer got a piece of loot over them and the only response they get is  "show up to raids" you can bet on drama breaking out. 
---
If officers want to be idiots then sure, their guild will fall apart. That happens regardless of loot system. Forcing passes would only be considered when set bonuses are due to be completed. This also means the player receiving the item doesn't receive another item for an extended period of time. There is no "loot council" decision to be questioned.
---
&gt; Your idea of only showing up to raids is not good at having players take  the raid seriously for the most part. When a player is constantly  causing wipes and doing stupid things and another player is always  performing at the top of the meters but is losing loot to the idiot  raider because its his turn for simply being present.. then that good  player is going to leave.  So your guild will constantly be bleeding good players while retaining  the slackers and attract more slackers as your guild reputation  deteriorates into a place no good players want to be. 
---
You seem to think the guild wouldn't just kick the shit player for being shit. Not sure which guild would carry someone that can't keep up in raids but they definitely shouldn't use this system.
---
&gt; This system is also a massive amount of work because the lists of what  loot each player wants needs to be adjusted if anyone misses a raid and  the loot distribution gets messed up. 
---
The work comes in creating the lists initially. After that, it's very simple post-raid upkeep. Move players to the bottom of their lists that received loot, then move the people that missed the raids down. It becomes less and less work as the guild gears up.
---
&gt; Youre also going to run into problems where certain loot wont drop in  the order that pleases the lists you create. Loot is random and if  theres lists then someone could be getting 2-3 pieces before an unlucky  player gets nothing. You will have arguments over the lists themselves  as no one wants to feel they like have got the short end of the stick.  Foor example how would you determine whos the last melee dps players in  line for a weapon? Compensate them with priority for a couple good gear  upgrades? What if no weps drop and the 2 pieces of gear drop, will you  have an officer step in to force the second drop to not go to that  person? If thats the case then whats the point of the lists if its  basically attendance based loot council aexcept the officers get extra  benefits and the lists that are told to be made by the player arent  followed? What will you say to a player comllaining about such type of  situations? Show up to more raidz? My advice is to just use dkp and put  in the guild rules for loot scenarios so people know exactly what theyre  getting into because that sounds awful as is. 
---
That's a pretty solid hypothesis for being completely baseless. Which player would get 2-3 pieces before an 'unlucky' player of the same class doesn't get one, provided they don't already have those 2-3 pieces? Initial order is determined by join date and then it's automatic from there. Again, officers don't 'step in' unless there is a set bonus to be completed. So yes, if someone complains, "show up to more raidz" and they will get all of their loot eventually.
---
Prot paladin is the only non viable raid spec
---
Awesome man
---
Fury warriors were seen as a joke throughout most of vanilla, even as DPS. Now it seems like everyone and their mother are looking to roll 2H Fury in Classic. Are we just further along now in theorycrafting that it's become a viable spec, or is it still going to be mostly a meme spec?
---
For the record, I played an Arms Warrior on PvP servers for most of vanilla and TBC.

is this like a rip of bar mitzvah for christians?
---
RIP i hope the next blue post is not only about this, but i expect it

ohh, Legion is retail wow. Right. Oh wait, no, that's Battle for Azeroth. I don't even play anymore because its dogshit but people arent doing more than 50k dps in current raids. No one is hitting 100 million. No, you didn't exaggerate a little bit. Even if people were critting for 1 million (they aren't) and you multiply that by 10 **Thousand** you wouldn't even come close to 100 billion, a tenth of that to be exact. To be more specific, you would have to multiply that by one **million** to begin to reach those numbers.
---
What I don't get is all the emote slang. I'm not quite 30 yet and I feel like I can't relate lol.
---
For me half the game is the other people I play with.
---
Do it baby!
---
Agreed I really didn't like Gorgrond
---
There’s no creature comforts or “easy streets” to speak of, except the sound of a good friend’s laughter if you use voice chat in a dungeon.
---
No clue. It's a ceremony for confirming your beliefs at an appropriate age (13-14). If that's similar then sure :p
---
so your upset that a bunch of people decided to do some random thing and that random thing is what gives life to the server. let people do what they want. that's what makes the game fun. just like you find what they are doing stupid no one cares about your bg cue. 
---
people are quick to shit on streamers but you know what they help bring community's together and people have fun doing things outside of the norm. 
---
you wanna be the rat that keeps running in the wheel , others dont.
---
Are visual assets stored client side or server side?
---
Hopefully everything you've said is true.

[This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bts82v/this_is_sharding_at_its_peak/) from retail shows that there are still major sharding issues a decade after it was implemented. Blizzard does not have a good history of getting these kinds of systems to function properly.
---
You could run WoW on a decent machine from 5-8 years ago, no need to break the bank for it.
---
1) I play a pally :P
---
2) It's really not that bad if you know a few tricks.  DOnt' buy every spell just b/c it's available.  Grind a few levels in certain spots like swamp of sorrows.   Vendor or AH everything.  Use a bank alt and clear your bags every time you're near a mailbox so you have to get rid of as little as possible.  Mail all your excess gold over say 10 or 20g to your bank alt so it's out of sight out of mind.   It's really not that hard.
---
Computer will easily run wow on ultra but what is the price? What speed is the ram as well?
---
I only noticed it just now, after reading your comment O.o
---
the difference is when you spam city chats, you don't take a significant % of a faction's playerbase. When you spam a stream of 30k viewers....
---
Yes only layering for phase 1. That could be up to three months. Are you telling me nothing interesting is going to happen during that period?
---
Sure I’ll just use a third party program to figure out of something is happening in any other layer in my current location. Sounds fun, and very vanilla-like.
---
Playing or Eu or Na?
---
Figure out which class I really want to main
---
OG JEFFY! Holy shit I love this guy. Such an entertaining streamer and best shout caster for wow out there.
---
Easy communication between people rezzing, so we aren’t all rezzing the same person
---
They are better due to blessing of salv
---
When I spammed city chat, that game was super populated. And it will be again at release.
---
I very much hope so :) Im little concerned about all these people thinking its a good idea to have it in game. I feel like, if not removing it, it definitely needs to get changed at the very least
---
Only $1000 which I’m fine to spend on a desktop. Plus I plan on moving from console gaming to PC so I’ll be playing a lot different games
---
This can easily run wow lol I still rock a gyx970 and get 100 fps
---
I have to disagree. I used blink and charge to stop calling A LOT back in vanilla. I would only die maybe 1/10th of the time. Half the time it's because I realized I didn't have feathers and had to blink at the last second. On warrior I would die because something would be out of range at the very end haha
---
Commenting to known what region and faction as well!
---
If they built a WoW theme park, this should be the entrance... of course they’d have ticket booths off frame, charging $95 for admission...
---
It needs to be a mob that gives or would give XP of Honor. So 48.
---
I think what bothers me most about the new Orgrimmar is not the city itself but everyone flying around on these giant flying Pokémon looking mounts. How am I supposed to appreciate Orgrimmar when I see sparkles and ooodles is cutsey colors everywhere in my face.
---
It’s pretty awful for Shadow Priest as it doesn’t proc off of DoT ticks or Mindflay ticks.
---
Arathi Highlands, Badlands, Silithis
---
People are doing stuff but it's not the stuff I want them to do grrrr..
---
You can tank 5-mans, I guess. And maybe a guild will want one as an OT for weird fights like Twin Emps. It's not great in PvP; Reck builds do exist, but Holy Reckoning Paladins are more consistently potent, and Ret is better for controlled burst. Prot Paladins don't have Taunts, gap closers, their single target generation is somewhat mediocre, they don't have infinite sustain because they're Mana users, their lategame gearing options are limited because they have no set gear to work with, and they aren't reliably able to become uncrushable like Prot Warriors can. With a lot of work, you can plausibly be an OT in a mid-tier raiding guild that doesn't care so much about min-maxing, but forego any expectation of ever being a MT or being in a progression guild.
---
Remember stubling across this dude in classic leveling my druid 50 something, grinding mobs while queueing Alterac Valley, only npc I bothered looking up to get a back story on.
---
I'll mention krol blade dropped for me and funded my epic mount, good times. Head on a swivel ganking was mad in eastern plaguelands :)
---
If you are the 5th rogue, then you get the 5th rogue item that drops if you show up to the raids. That could happen the first time the guild raids BWL. That item could be a DFT or CTS. Which rogue would complain about that?
---
I live in a world where loot isn't the be-all end-all aspect of raiding and is a tool to progress the guild towards killing KT. I also really, really hate communists :&gt;
---
I've seen this argument a couple times in this thread. If a guild is carrying shitters, then that guild is doomed to fail regardless of which loot system they use.
---
wotlk had quite a few very comfy zones
---
The PvP gear has some pretty solid stats, and MC runs (which will become painfully easy before even Phase 2) can help those hunting PvP gear to fill in the blanks.
---
Now, this won't last forever for course, the Blue PvP gear gets noticably outscaled when AQ arrives, so there will be at least a few months where there is *some* progression outside of raids.
---
What he means by being on the boring layer is ending up on the low pop version. Maybe I'm misunderstanding layering, but I'm seeing it like this:
---
Each layer holds 1000 players. Not accurate numbers, just for the sake of argument. Let's say one server has 4 active layers and 3150 players total. 3 of those 4 layers are full pop with the remaining 150 extra ending up on layer 4. Layer 4 is now a "dead" layer.
---
Am I misunderstanding the concept because that's what people see when they think layering is bad.
---
*Achievements*, I want an alternative carrot on a stick to work on. I wouldn't mind working for The Seeker title again.
---
*Account bound pets/mounts*, I want my classic RAF Zhevra and at least the store bought pets/mounts or collector's edition ones I have. They're all cosmetic anyway, so why not let players have them? Blizz will want to make money with new mount/pets in the store, so barring Classic from buying them would be a loss for Blizz. Any mount/pet that you can get in Classic and the store bought stuff should be available in Classic, imo. All flying mounts would simply be grounded.  
---
*Barber shop*, it's cosmetic and harmless. Put in the old barber shop that let's people change their hairstyles, horns, marking, and jewelry. Honestly, I'd just like access to more than the default hairstyles.
---
Yeah Hunter is probably the only class that can do that, but it needs to be tested before relying on it.
---
Usually they spec the pet in arcane resist to counter sheep and shadow to counter fear, the rest of the points go in stamina.
---
I’m the boss, so lol. See me in, fuck you.
---
Paladin tanking in Classic is pretty awful, you certainly won’t be doing it in raids.
---
Play a mage then you arent locked into the worst faction.
---
You have to love the look of your toon, especially their back.
---
I know they get a lot of hate, but I love my gnome mage, and to properly show armor and weapons nicely in proportion, my human rogue alt.
---
I think if you’re looking to tank on a paladin it’ll be difficult, I’m not saying impossible but I’d assume people are gonna be looking mostly for prot warriors to be tanking in Vanilla. I’m the same with Shadow Priest and Resto shaman haha!
---
You're not going to be able to compete with people in MC/BWL plate gear and weapons with mostly blues. The gear difference is just too great. You'll do fine against most randoms and world fights but organized BGs will be difficult.
---
EVEN SIDE!!
---
that guy doesnt make the addon...
---
I think you should go back and reconsider what your primary objectives should be. It sounds like you're making some decisions and assumptions that aren't going to play out nicely.
---
&gt; 1. [Players] that show up to every raid [shall be] decked out in gear first
---
&gt; 2. The more purples in the guild for people that show up to raids consistently, the better.
---
&gt; 3. Individual desires for specific pieces of loot don't factor into this system.
---
&gt; 4. [O]fficers have higher expectations and responsibilities within a guild than regular raiders, and that should be rewarded [with preference on loot].
---
Let me know if this accurately summarizes your position, and then I'll describe what I believe is the problem with this.
---
Is it just a hitbox thing that you can get hit from so far away without even being a Tauren?
---
The guild leader of the guild I was in for the majority of Vanilla was the guild's main-main tank. We had a DKP system, which he basically abused to get his l33t damage gear, because he had so much DKP to spend, as his tank gear went for cheap because the guild obviously required him to have priority on it. He snatched a lot of DPS gear and weapons from my brother that was an actual DPS warrior. Not surprising that once that guild leader had a fit with a guild officer that was also his rl friend, he threw a tantrum and taking half of the members with him to form a new guild (which was a complete failure), causing his former guild to be in the server top 2 of downing Chromaggus, to barely being able to pass Razor and Vael again for months. In hindsight the once very successful guild was basically ruined throughout the rest of Vanilla, all thanks to an extremely greedy and petty prot warrior at the top. I swear, warriors can sometimes be one of the pettiest players when it comes to loot. The guild I'll be in in Classic must have a no-bullshit approach to loot distribution, and a zero-tolerance policy against lootwhiners.
---
Dual wield fury is one of the better dps specs in the game. 2H fury can have similar results with some slam specs, at least until AQ.
---
I forgot you were talking about football by the end

Who googles for Vagina?

Dude, stop being that asshole who goes in to the office sick. All you end up doing is getting the rest of the office sick and spending half your time blowing your nose annoying the people who you dont get sick.
---
It might just be a day or two of sniffles for you, but if you infect someone whose immune system isn't as strong it could effect them much more significantly.
---
I get it, I rarely get sick and when I do I still feel guilty for taking a sick day, but I still do it because sick days are not only for you. Their real purpose is to keep the rest of the company healthy. That's more important to the company than one person who is more worried about people thinking they're taking than they are about everyone else's health.
---
It’s a lot easier to manage then this spreadsheet you need to do for everyone.
---
But is it? even a lower ranked holy light heals more than max ranked flash of light.
---
It has longer cast time true but it also has less mana cost due to being lower ranked. 
---
Holy light has one big thing going for it: it benefits alot more from blessing of light than flash of light does.
---
So rank 4 holy light: 190 mana and heals for 310 to 357
---
max rank flash of light: 175 mana and heals for 343 to 384
---
But when you take blessing of light into calculation...
---
all of a sudden holy light rank  4 heals for 710 to 757
---
and max flash of light heals for 449 to 499.
---
The difference in healing is huge and theres only 20 mana difference.

On another episode of Streamers Rant - "Streamers stoll my bike and infected me with malaria!"
---
Common, it's a beta.  I don't care for them and as an European I'm lucky enough to most likely play on a server without one of them. At least they attract a huge crowd to stress test the server. What is your contribution?
---
It procs off the initial casts though right? Mind blast + 2 mindflays would be 3 chances to proc per rotation. That should still be enough spellcasts to proc it once per minute on average.
---
Paladin tank is pretty useful in aq40
---
Yea it's really hard choosing also because you know how alt unfriendly vanilla is xD, I'm leaning towards mage more! but I love tanking though, and we won't see paladin tanks be #usefull in raids till TBC if that ever gets released.
---
Live to win !
---
As I noted in the OP, I distinctly remember my nightsaber I tamed in Shadowglen being significantly larger than the other mobs there when I took my hunter back to retire the character.
---
It's possible my memory is faulty there, of course, but I'm reasonably sure it was a thing in Vanilla.
---
Haha, but alliance has always been my faction xD was debating on starting a shaman but then again! Nostalgia.
---
This is one thing I made sure to implement at my company. We combined sick days and vacation days into a single category and I trust my guys. If they need a day off for whatever reason, take it. I’d rather you be feeling so-so and miss a single day than come in, be unproductive for a day, miss a second day recovering and infect other workers. Besides, sometimes you just need a mental health day.
---
Sharding isn't layering. It actually *is* working as intended in that video, and the intention is to say "Fuck any immersion whatsoever; just make sure cross-realm pops are stable". If they were implementing sharding, I'd be having a hissy fit.
---
Layering is not the same thing. You don't get shunted to a different layer while in a game session unless you explicitly attempt to do so by joining a party not on your layer. Resources won't disappear before your eyes. It has an entirely separate design philosophy than sharding.
---
And to be clear, I'd still be very angry if it were permanent. But it's not, and they've been exceedingly clear on this point in particular. It's there to alleviate server strains in the early few weeks while still maintaining a cohesive, internally continuous gameplay experience, but without the negative externalities of the alternatives (either adding huge queue times or launching an abundance of inevitably-dead-soon servers).
---
That's not entirely true. You just have to opt into it by flagging yourself. I started in 05 on a pve realm. Horde and alliance wpvp typically started when someone killed npcs in barrens or tauren mill.
---
I mained a holy paladin from 2004-2007.  During BC I re-rolled as a mage because I was dying for some proper DPS... and my want was so bad I even have a rogue alt.  Paladins are great, but as far as vanilla/classic goes, they’re not raid tanks, and they’re not raid DPS (in most guilds)... now, you can tank Strat/Scholo pretty well and you’re the best MT healer there is, but if you want to do damage, by all means roll mage.
---
Yea i remember, but in TBC they become quite good.
---
Wow
---
I just can't get it to work. I get Errors Non-Stop. Same with Dominos.
---
I don’t really think this is true, those are streamer fans normal servers won’t be full of them
---
It doesn’t matter what they send you, they’ll be so many incoming PMs you won’t be able to read them.
---
Agreed 100%. Once the shift to Alli/horde shaman/paly debacle is done they’ll become prevalent in tanking lol. Ret is fun in live currently but other than that my paladin doesn’t get touched.
---
Yeah love hearing about Trump in WoW. Totally not why Trade Chat is unbearable in retail.
---
Ty for the reminder! Haha
---
It's not do 2 people can sheep each other it's so you can kick at the end of warstomp to interrupt the root cast after, gouge a blink, fear a kidney,  vanish a blind, tremor a scream etc etc.
---
Yea, im leaning a lot towards mage because of how crazy their damage is. And i know all about being #not choosen as a pala tank in vanilla. I might create him as a tank on the off side if i dont need shit done on my mage. Thanks bro
---
Rolling for loot is a lot easier to manage than this DKP system you need to do for everyone.
---
This is dumb as hell. First of all, classic bg will be cross realm. Second of all beta has a miniscule population. They've been doing bgs for almost a week of course they want to do something fun now...
---
I felt that MoP was good about having open space, but maybe that’s just me. I felt like an explorer again leveling through Pandaria rather than a “Champion,” even if that did have its moments in the questing.
---
The bop going off and him still dieing is fine given he was pretty much already touching the ground when he finally targeted him self and casted it.   
---
This shadow bolt seduce thing however is obviously not fine. This almost seems like it's something else other than spell batching but this is just broken lol.
---
I say... flip a coin. Play as that character and see how things go. If you hit a point where you get bored, make the alt. Maybe you'll like them better, or maybe it'll reinvigorate you to play as the first one.
---
I only say this because if you're this divided, then it doesn't really matter which one you pick. There will be no shortage of guilds looking for new members, even if you're slightly behind because you preferred the alt.
---
As for my ACTUAL opinion, whenever I'm torn, I go with the new one. Gives me a fresher experience overall, encourages me to try different professions, and it's always fun to see what I can and can't do with a new class.
---
Yep, would love to run a shaman! BUUUT they're horde and im not gonna main that for classic! I wanna run through my old memories again! Duskwood / Stranglethorn / Westfall, you name it. &gt;P
---
Redneck receding mullet on UD male is best look imo.
---
Duskwood gives me the best feels. IMO a completely immersive zone.
---
Not beautiful tho. Id say ashenvale is altho im not big on night elf.
---
Classic runs fine even on Ryzen 3 2200G integrated graphics :)  Although for more modern and demanding games you will need some good GPU.
---
Did some WoW retail/classic beta not so long ago too: [https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/](https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/)
---
Since Classic is based on 1.12 and they were lonnnng gone by then... you see why it was a pretty easy decision for them.  That being said, I don’t disagree with you, I think it’d be a nice touch or option, but Classic’s never been about creature comforts or “oh it’s nice they added that to make it better.”
---
I've always just been middle pic. I enjoy being a solo player, tho I do wish I'd have people to play with once classic drops
---
I have the exact same feeling about horde haha, I originally leveled alliance then switched to horde about half way through and finished my vanilla time on that, switched back to Alli in MoP and now I’m back on horde haha
---
Beats me. I've asked for it earlier, and he response was iirc that it is already being mentioned frequently, which I don't agree with.
---
I love that you can see duskwood while doing your first quests. But you mustnt dare travel there yet.
---
Why would you choose your class based on an expansion that certainly won’t be released in 2-3 years if ever?
---
I would say that pretty much is correct. 4. needs to be clarified slightly, their preference only matters for one item and they only get that item if they don't miss any raids before it drops.
---
The nice thing about classic is there is no expansion or urge to grind cap and take in as much before next xpansion. Played since beta myself was an eq player before have played every expansion except MOP can’t wait to play an mmorpg again and not what ever you want to call what wow has become now.
---
They're not agressive on the classic beta
---
Awesome keep up the great work!
---
Both plaguelands IMO
---
Seriously great stuff this made my day man
---
You're right, i havent always been the one to be TORN between class picking, but i know how much time vanilla requires in 1 character! So i wanna be 100% - I think what im gonna do though is going for mage, have fun on him, make him a tailor and just go around and have fun! Maybe pick up herbalism as well, and then for my alt i'll create a paladin on the off side if someone needs a tank once in a while.
---
Like the other guy said building a PC is pretty easy and /r/buildapc is great for new builders
---
The mount restrictions won't apply to this right ? Does anyone know for sure ? I started playing in late vanilla and never encountered restrictions.
---
&gt; anything that came in after an arbitrary patch release.
---
Vanilla launched on November 23, 2004, and TBC came out January 16, 2007.  This is a difference of 784 days.  For something to be considered a "majority" of vanilla, it would have had to been released on or before December 20, 2005 (which is 392 days after vanilla launch. 
---
Patch 1.9 (Ahn'Qiraj) was released on January 3, 2006, so that's right out.  Patch 1.8.4 was released December 5, 2005, and was the last patch before the halfway point.  In order for the OP to be ideologically consistent, he must be against all changes introduced from 1.9 onward.
---
Think you missed the whole point I was trying to say. Those events happening more often (but still rarely) with a poorly recreated version of spell batching is not worth having to deal with a poorly recreated version of spell batching.
---
1. Cool - but I can imagine always ending up on the 'wrong' layer. I'll look forward to spamming /world for invites to the 'cool' layer. Just like in vanilla.
---
2. My friends in \[insert guild\] is on the other layer though. Damn.
---
3. Ion said a few weeks, another guy said maybe entire phase 1. That could be a long time.
---
I have a lot of concerns, not just the tongue-in-cheek one from the picture. Layering will ruin a whole lot of aspects that make WoW vanilla what it is.
---
Hm?
---
I doubt that's how they'll implement it because it would be clunky and create perverse incentives to try to "fight for the uncrowded layers". Rather, if I were a game designer with a half-functioning brain, I'd make it so that there's a trigger threshold (both in terms of number and speed of increase) that will begin loading new players into other layers once the first layer reaches some percentage of maximum capacity, and it would keep those layers as close to each other as possible without forcing logouts.
---
So if the maximum layer population is 2500, then once the server population hits, say, either 1000 in two minutes or 1500 in five minutes, then a new layer will start up, anticipating how many players are likely to log in within the next hour based on some "simple" population growth algorithms. That way a server would maintain somewhat even numbers across the board, as opposed to creating three full layers and a fourth consisting of twenty people.
---
True, it's just a thought, i think im gonna run mage and make paladin alt! See how we progress in vanilla and what content gets released. Etc
---
You're wrong. 
---
Stop.
---
If you’re about damage, don’t roll a paladin, it’ll become an exercise in frustration.  A mage never has much to prove beyond freezing or lighting shit on fire, just bring a lot of food/water.
---
haha xD damn, you around

um why the dwarf exclusion??  racist.

https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1700-vs-AMD-FX-9590/3917vs1812
---
That's the processor I have compared to the one you're looking at, I run 8gb 2100mhz RAM and I have the gtx 970 (generation lower than what youre looking at CPU) 
---
I had over 100fps on the stress test jump on a fence with a couple of hundred other people so you'll be fine for classic by a long shot. 
---
For other games I easily get 30fps running high/ultra with AA (Obviously some unoptimised games dip lower) but that's getting harder and harder to maintain as newer games release. So the gtx 1080 will still be a solid card for the near future.
---
you making me wanna play mage man &gt;P / safest bet is prolly to roll a rolling ball of fire! and insta pyro all over the place! &gt;p
---
I think overall the PvP sets in Classic are much more awesome. For every class, both factions. With the exception of the Alliance plate helmet (but if you hide that, the rest of the set is cool).
---
I'll be playing a Shadow Priest and I'll be trying to make that Rank 10 set last as long as I possibly can. In raids, I will be going for necks/cloaks/bracers/belts/rings/trinkets before anything else. I might just get away with it, as Shadow Priest cloth armor is pretty scarce.

[GM Weapon. Called glaive, item type - sword.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=18582/the-twin-blades-of-azzinoth)
---
Shield Slam had a checkered history on its usefullness in threat generation through the Original game.
---
IT basically boils down to a simple equation though in that yes it technically is more threat than any other ability that does signifigant threat.
---
However it is 20Rage per use and on a 6second CD, Wheras if you put talent points into Sunder Armor that is a 12Rage ability with no Cooldown whatsoever that provides an near equal amount of threat on one application and even more with 2 which is juts simply more threat in the long run.
---

---
Shouldn't you be off complaining about something on twitter?
---
They said it wasn't an easy decision, and that they are open to alternatives, but were looking for feedback to do so.
---
I don't mean post-Naxx gear. I mean gear with item levels equivalent to or lower than Naxx. So there might be a dungeon set for paladin tanks in a new dungeon that's on the same level with Blackrock Spire, or a balance druid set for BWL. That sort of stuff, which encourages people to run content even if their guild has already progressed past that tier.
---
GW2 Mastery is a problematic system to convert to WoW because GW2 is a fundamentally different game. The system is basically a means to navigate the world. So mount features, like high jumps and etc, are tied to it. Some other example would be the ability to utilize shortcuts, use a glider (with various scaling benefits), benefit from some zone-specific consumables, etc. I bring it up because it's also used for the raid system in a small capacity, like needing a Mastery perk to do a mechanic in the raid. Same with the Agony Resistance stat for the dungeon gear. Needing magic resistances or reputations are the closest equivalents in Vanilla.
---
One thing that could be done would be the libram/spell system you mentioned. Basically, add a new raid of pre-Naxx difficulty since I don't think anyone actually wants post-Naxx power scaling. The raid drops spell tomes which require BoP materials from other raids to empower like how the WotLK/Cataclysm legendary quests worked. Once you've got that done, the spell tome grants a new spell like a Paladin taunt.
---
I'm not sure how to avoid powercreep with this system, unless the spell tome is literally a libram you equip, but at that point it fills a little over-engineered for just a single item.
---
want to add onto this by saying i found quite a few houses in val'sharah that weren't used for any quests ect... and still packed with npcs, can't even let a random house in the world be empty anymore
---
That was false advertisement. Should've lead to a class action lawsuit. The compensation should've been 1 free reroll instant lvl 60 char, 6 months of free game time, a tour through Blizz HQ, and a Horde or Alliance mug signed by Chris Metzen (dishwasher proof signature of course).

Wait a minute... i think you cheated. ಠ\_ಠ

This reminds about the Pitbull Unit Frames! I loved those! Much better than that space X-Pearl Unit Frames! Thank you!

---
They were removed in 1.4
---
Aggro resets and post cc aggro are problematic. 5 mans are doable but gear checks are much steeper since you'll likely be tanking every mob in the pack. Caster mobs are not as risky to cc but still hit healers very hard in melee if interrupted
---
That's why he's asking what is the lowest level. 48 is definitely gray to a 60.
---
Silverpine Forest. 
---
I love the Sons of Arugal backstory, and how the forests are basically haunted by werewolves.
---
Your last sentence makes it sound like you're opposed to it in general and for the wrong reason.  If youre only opposed to bad implementation then I agree but if the game doesn't let me do the things I just said I'm not gonna play because that's where all the fun and cool plays come from in pvp.
---
It scales of having lots of spirit, you don't have that as a dps.
---
it was stickied for like a year. it’s seen enough time stickied on this sub imo
---
First time I've seen it. Mods of this sub are fucking shit. Crap clean up bots being used too.
---
My husband and I will play classic wow together. Technically it WILL be a “family thing.”
---
You're just plain wrong.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. For the last 8ish years my work computer has been a laptop that I'm expected to take home with me each night. If I'm sick and contagious, I work from home unless I'm too sick to get out of bed. Being at home and on WoW while home sick would not look good.
---
Not Ano'ther Do'Urden is what we called the Drizzt clones.
---
i was never a huge fan of that zone tbh, its quite nice but not that interesting
---
for fantasy, the night elf zones are the prettiest.  for atmosphere and general preference i've always liked the undead zones the most.  for 'interest' i like crazy places like un'goro crater where you constantly feel like you're being watched and some devilsaur is going to emerge from the gloom and eat you
---
tanaris has a special place in my heart.  i'm not sure why but i have a very vivid memory of arriving there and hearing the music and getting a sense of atmosphere
---
I think the z axis was a bit wonky in Vanilla. Casters would cast spells from higher then they should have been able to iirc. Would make sense if that applies to melee too - it just doesnt happen that often to notice.   
---
Just my thoughts though, correct me if im wrong.
---
Can't have pet responsiveness issues if you sacrifice your pet.
---
The last patch update to warriors was 1.12 which is what made Fury viable for raid dps.
---
Have at it! I've found guilds over the years that are totally fine with anything, as long as you're up front. "Hey, I'm kind of an altoholic, so I'm going to be a druid for the next week." I've never once found a guild that got pissed or kicked me out. (I've never joined a crazy hardcore guild, though.)
---
And I never would have discovered my love of warlocks if I hadn't said, "Screw it, that sounds different."
---
Wait so you think i should just go shaman healer for raids learn it and everything but isnt that hard to get in to dont you have to be a really good and well known healer to get to a raid? and then go rogue as a alt? its just quite annyoing i rlly like the look of rogue and really like the look of DPS shaman xD so annoying atm, i might have a look for a guild that needs a rogue getting ready for it to drop
---
Agility is a good stat for fury warriors and its relative value compared to strength is about the same regardless of whether they dual wield or 2h. Point for point strength is more valuable, but generally speaking getting 3 points of agility is slightly better than getting 2 points of strength.
---
No, only on the first damage tick.
---
As someone who has played both Vanilla and OSRS, two things I miss way too much in OSRS are the social aspect and sense of linear story progression.
---
In Vanilla WoW, you're gonna need to talk with people, group with them, compete with some of them, it is an extremely social game, and one in which you might not go very far on your own.
---
Also, quests give you a sense of where to go next. It is mostly "Nice job grinding that spot for a while, now grind that other spot" and so on, but you never get lost. They are, however, very simple and straightforward, even without a Quest Helper Add-on.
---
One important notion, I believe, that particularly differentiates OSRS and WoW is that, while OSRS revolves A LOT around every different skill, WoW is all about combat. First Aid is there to heal you in combat, cooking is here to give you buffs in combat, blacksmithing is here to forge yourself better combat armor... You can still trade all of it in the Grand Exchange / Auction House, but you won't really need any of your skills outside of combat.
---
Still, you will have to explore the world, you will have to grind mobs and complete quests, you will have to grind professions by cooking meat, by making cloth into bandages, by fishing, by mining ore and smelting it, by picking herbs and grinding them, by skinning animals and make it into leather, by disenchanting magic items to empower others, you will have to grind dungeons and raids to gear up and get through the higher level content, and you will have to grind quite a lot of gold and equipment throughout the long and amazing journey that is Vanilla WoW.

&gt; It would not, under any conceivable circumstance, prevent a "server photo".
---
How is this meme an incoherent criticism?
---
 As long as Layering is active, there will be multiple versions of Ironforge with completely different people in them. There could be 2, 3, 4  or more different layers active at the same time, we have no idea. We also have no idea how long layering is going to last, if the game is very popular, some servers could have it for months. The people in this photo would have to spam "/1 invite to the group photo layer!!" until someone invited them, just like we see on the stress tests.
---
I'm gonna miss the pservers chats, nobody knows why but they became a safeplace for alt right and school shooters. I wonder where will they go after release
---
Everything has positive and negative effects. Same with streamers. This sub has a biased vendetta because of “muh classic”, you’re not going to get many reasonable answers. I saw some dude saying you’re going to get death threats for not passing on an item, that’s just a gross over exaggeration.
---
Streamers bring publicity to the game and honestly a lot of them are fun to watch play the game.
---
They bring positives and they bring negatives, but 90% of the streamers will not be queuing with fandoms. They’ll be with players from their own guild and raid teams, people are really blowing it out of proportion in these responses.
---
aw man. its almost as if saying it makes it true. (ಥ﹏ಥ)
---
Quite honestly check out recent budget gaming PC builds from some YouTubers like Bitwit.
---
There's a lot of ways you can go with 1k. Either buy one outright from a reputable vendor and take the hit or research parts on your own.
---
I'd advise researching anyhow so you know what vendors to avoid and have a better understanding of what to look for. it's quite easy to get completely hosed with an underperforming build even if it boasts big numbers and uses words like "extreme". 
---
Spend some time learning a bit more at your own pace. I build all of mine and while I know my stuff and can just yap parts - it's definitely better to have a basic level of knowledge on the subject, especially when it comes to performance like gaming or editing PCs.
---
/u/jay273 Agility does not give warriors Attack power. As far as I know, you want roughly equal parts strength and agility, at least until you reach the crit cap. This is because Flurry depends on you critting, and provides you with a large DPS increase. Attack Power is also quite important, so don’t skip the strength either.
---
You need to buy as much accounts as there are layers on your server so you can check in real time which layer is best.
---
Blizzard likes that !
---
It's not that much of a hassle. Just think of each rank as a different spell. Some of them cast faster, some slower, some heal more, some heal less. It wont be as stressful as you think.
---
Did you even Morpheus/Kazaa/Limewire, my friend?
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dansgame
---
Is your question about using the proper downranked spell to heal the exact amount of health?.... if it is.... do not rely on addons, just practice a lot. Class doesn't matter.
---
The reason the fights are easy is because we know the mechanics and they’re all very basic. 
---
I would agree the fights might take a little longer, but they won’t be harder. 
---
MC will be a cake walk, but some fights in BWL might be tough. Specially Vael and broodlord I think because of the delicate threat issues on those fights.
---
dude just go play on a private server for the time being. yikes. it’s only a couple months until release, you can survive until then without beta...
---
"I don't even play anymore because its dogshit but people arent doing more than 50k dps in current raids" Its literally the first time in years. Sorry for not knowing about a trash expansion i dont play, people were hitting 100million in legion, that multiplied by 1000 is literally a billion, stop fuckin whining, holy shhit what a cry baby, ranting on about a technicality. They finally fixed the retardedly over inflated numbers? Woopdy doo.
---
If you’re comfortable building your own, you can get into it for about 750 (without windows) something like this would do great with wow and most other games out there for a while:

Blizz have indicated that it is configurable
---
This is a classic server, this isn’t vanilla. We’ll never be able to emulate that exact experience, it just will never happen. Majority of streamers will group with their friends, guild, and raid team. I don’t see soda and Asmon grouping with randoms a lot. 
---
You sure as hell won’t have 1K death threats, that’s just a massive over exaggeration.
---
What no 0 or .5!
---
Ha. Im down!
---
It's been confirmed that they're not going to be in the game. Your whining is not going to change that.
---
Oh no I quite understand it, but I'm essentially wondering how much extra hotkeying that takes.  I would be fine with getting used to understanding the situational need for each.
---
This is sad but also mega hmmm
---
Nah screw those people
---
back in the days there was an addon called "healbot" that made exactly every decision for you, you just needed to klick and it chose the right rank of the spell, but lucky its not allowed anymore and wont be in classic  
---
but its not a big struggle, just get used to it, you maybe have 5-10 healing spells
---
All of these reasons are shallow and unimportant. If any or all of these happened it would be complete by fine - because we are all understanding adults and not children
---
This. Even in the early game of raiding you only really need like 3 flash heals and 3 greater heals
---
But i you could also just ya know cast max rank flash heal and still do fine even if your chugging potions
---
Oh no I quite understand it, but I'm essentially wondering how much extra hotkeying that takes.  I would be fine with getting used to understanding the situational need for each.  
---
In other words, is there a frames healing addon that a lot of people use to have modifiers for easy click down ranked spells, or much extra hotkey usage?
---
That sob...

I like to experience the whole game lol

Monitor suggestions will have to come from someone else. You could build something slightly cheaper than this but this is the best prebuilt deal I can find on newegg.
---
Cool to think that the players in the first and third screenshot were probably the heroes/champions of their server.
---
Window is 400 ms, not 50 ms.
---
No, they were made unavailable. The mounts are very much still there in the 1.12 database. It’s just a matter of adjusting vendor tables.
---
All healers in vanilla downrank, you even downrank when you are low level and still leveling. Its beeing mana conservative/efficient.
---
They were removed in 1.4. The game is based on 1.12. Why is that so hard for you to understand?
---
I don't know that is would be worth swapping out your dps trinket for that, unless you had something terrible in the slot, even then you could get a few hundred gold for the Beasts deck on the AH.
---
As stated already, it doesn't proc off of ticks to hots + dots. /shrug
---
Test it out and let us know.
---
You really only need max rank (say rank 7) and like, rank 4 or so. A mid range heal and a full heal. You could have rank 1 as well for lowbies.
---
You could run the game off of a $400 laptop from 5 years ago.
---
If you're really wanting to make your own PC then [here's](https://www.hardware-revolution.com/best-low-cost-budget-gaming-pc-april-2019/) the resource I usually go to for sourcing different parts.

Oof you're right, my current pserver experience is totally invalid against your 15-year old memory. You're not wrong though, you definitely can go boss fights without proccing it on the shorter encounters. Same goes for crusader.

---
Patch 1.4 is 2005/04/19 -&gt; lol didn't remember it was so close of the european release. I was a real nolike back then -\_-. But at least a clever one because i didn't change my white tiger.
---
It's been confirmed by Blizzard that you think you want Classic but you don't.  Your whining is not going to change that.
---
It sounds worse than it really is. You can do fine with just 2 ranks of each healing cast, one downranked one max rank. The downrank should be the lowest or second lowest version of your slow cast. Your early healing abilities are faster than slower, you don't want those as they have very bad scaling. Usually around rank 4 it's maximum casting speed which is what you want.
---
I will answer this in lieu of OP: Yes.
---
Blessing of light is included, without it Holy Light becomes really bad. So there is some incentive to use it, the problem is that with everyone using fast heals it's just not feasible unfortunately. Maybe if you could force the entire raid to only use slower heals it would work.
---
Did you ask for a GM joke in the end?
---
And he drives a beamer. Love to see it
---
Idk about addons( I've literally never used one in my 13 years playing the game)... but it could be solved by using 1, shift-1, ctrl-1, alt-1... all it would take is getting used to the binds and predicting health.
---
Just invite blizzard on your boat then they have to give you a beta key because of the implication.
---
yeah, rebooted launcher and pc. stress/beta still showing up. logging in just shows the offline stress server
---
Then you dont understand the build at all. The idea is you stack Shadow Oil, Dragonsbreath Chili, Wrath of Cenarius (ring) with Manual Crowd Pummeler and spellpower gear to maximize the number of procs you get and the damage done by those procs.
---
I would very VERY surprised if anyone used this build in Vanilla because it would A) Not have worked prior to patch 1.9, and B) It rely on some rather obscure consumables and items.
---
&gt; It only came out recently to you because private servers are coded wrong and give it a dps boost. In vanilla it is trash 
---
No, it came out recently because we only started experimenting with the build a few months ago. We know the private servers arent coded entirely accurate. We already accounted for this based on the Beta where we actually can confirm how the Paladin mechanics are supposed to work. The result is a roughly 7% ( I believe ) DPS loss over private servers where the build already perform very well.
---
If you feel like this build will not perform as well as advertised then I invite you to come over to our discord, look over our math, look at the Spreadsheet made by Despotus and go over our data from the Beta to point out what you feel is incorrect.
---
[https://discord.gg/ZfwNmmC](https://discord.gg/ZfwNmmC)
---
Based on your comments so far I do strongly suspect you never spent a second looking at the actual math behind the build though so I would advice you tone down the arrogance a few notches and instead point out what you feel is incorrect in our current theorycrafting. Everything is available in the discord I just linked.
---
The point being..?
---
There are many who would say the same about other various features of classic wow. Such as the quest tracking and display improvements in retail over classic, or Rogue energy regen, or any other of a myriad of system changes, improvements and alterations that retail has made over the years. Note here i am not talking about new systems, such as LFG or Achievements. Just refinements made to the systems that were present in vanilla, such as spell batching.
---
Once you start picking and choosing you aren't recreating classic, you are branching development. It is no longer classic, but a new and different game at that point.
---
Now, i am not against that. I think classic has many design decisions that are desperately needed for WoW that have been lost, overlooked, or mishandled over the years. I would 100% get behind a branched development along the lines of old school runescape.
---
However, that is not what classic is.
---
Classic is a recreation of vanilla WoW. That is what people said they wanted. That is what blizzard said they would deliver. That is what people are getting.
---
The problem is many people don't actually want Classic as it was. They want branched development and "some things" changed. What those "some things" are is different depending on who you talk to, and none of them can all agree. 
---
As was said, and laughed at, You think you do, but you don't.
---
You thought you wanted classic wow. But, if the spell batching is changed. It isn't classic. So ... Do you want Classic WoW? Do did you just think you wanted it?
---
I know how you feel and I dident even get in 
---
ever since I watched a few videos im hooked
---
The game is based on the 1.12 version of items. Whether or not the item was available is something they have specifically stated they want to match as it was originally. 
---
https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=30
---
This makes no sense?
---
Ill stick with mulgore
---
There are better, but I mean total overhauls. like if you see how smite looks on modern vs classic for example. So spell visuals and everything.
---
You're reaching.
---
That’s quite a stretch.
---
My current guild friends who won't play in classic, besides that, maybe the graphics but nothing more.
---
I think it partly has to do with the number of sick days companies typically give employees. The lower the number of sick days the more likely it is that people will show up to work sick. They might be sick now, but they might be afraid of running out of sick days to use later and then be forced to take a day off without pay.
---
It's an awful culture that capitalism has pushed onto America. It's all about the companies rather than the employees.
---
You could still get them on the AH as they were Bind on Use.
---
On beta currently, our Hunter pets aren't pathing around, instead they are doing that teleport down with us thing when we jump off ledges and stuff. So no aggro :(
---
We have reported it as a bug. But we aren't high level enough to test the Rend jump in UBRS yet. But in other places in the world the pet just ports. Heres hoping they fix it for authenticity.
---
managed to find an old thread that said its BiS for fights over 2 minutes, so I guess it's pretty good. Not sure how many fights will last that long outside of a handful like Nefarian/KT though so doubt it's worth dropping 300-500g's on.
---
There's nothing wrong with being fat, but you can't force us to be attracted to it. The 8.2 girl is objectively less attractive than Vanilla girl.
---
OP, are you upper class British? You were so polite and understanding.
---
Odd groups left, even groups right.
---
HANDLE IT!!
---
Actually the M+ dungeons concept but without the RNG stuff on the looting, but I have no idea on how to balance it for classic.
---
In my experience with vanilla prot paladins are like ugly-duckling unicorns. Simultaneously impossible to find and not very useful.
---
5 man content is doable and with a good gear set you can clear stuff crazy fast, especially in the undead heavy instances like Strat and Scholo. For raid content there's maybe a handful of fights that are useful for prot pallies, and two of them are in ZG if I remember correctly. 
---
Other than that, enjoy being a healer who isn't heal specced.
---
Don't make claims about shit you don't know anything about then dickwad. People like you are what is wrong with the internet. Just spouting random bullshit as fact.
---
Thanks for testing. RIP no 10%+ wand speed from quivers.
---
I have an i7-920 and a Radeon HD4890 from 2009/2010 and it runs retail (and probably classic, I don't have beta) just fine at medium settings and 60 FPS.
---
Pre 1.12 yes, but in the patch blizzard is using they are BoP
---
Because this photo (I'm not entirely sure about the context, but I'd suspect it's not the latter of the three) is either showcasing (1) a party of friends; (2) a subsection of a guild; or (3) a completely random cropping of 14 people who happened to be in front of Ironforge at the time. If it's 1, then layering won't stop such a photo because friends can pull other friends to their layer. If it's 2, then layering won't stop such a photo because guildies are automatically pulled onto the "guild layer", whatever it happens to be at the time. If it's 3, then you'll always have a small group of random people in front of Ironforge at any hour of the day regardless of how many layers there are, so complaining that you didn't get "the right" random people in front of Ironforge is like complaining that you can't take a photo of Ironforge characters consisting of people currently in Silithus. There will never, ever, *ever* be an entire server faction's population in one zone at one time to take a big screenshot (and thus it's mooted), so the complaint that layering would prevent you from taking a screenshot of a group of randos is incoherent.
---
And no, we know precisely how long it will last at maximum, and that is "the end of Phase 1". They've been remarkably, emphatically consistent that there must only ever be one Lord Kazzak or Azuregos per server at a time. They've been saying that since *before they even announced layering*, back in the 2018 Blizzcon panel. Servers will not be having individualized Phases, either; it's a function of how fast the entire game population is progressing, not how a particular server is progressing. If the game is very popular (that is, far more than Blizzard's metrics predict), then Blizz will obviously just launch new servers to compensate for the unexpected popularity before they ever decide to do something as jackasinine as server-specific extra-long Phase 1+layering.
---
Stress tests are not an accurate representation of what the game will be like. They're publicized, notorious, filmed events where Blizzard deliberately overinvites people specifically for the purpose of testing server capacity. The behavior witnessed on stress tests will never occur in game, because the catalysts that cause that behavior won't exist. There will be no GMs spawning raid bosses in Elwynn Forest, or streamers leading five hundred level 1 Humans into Stranglethorn, or whatever.
---
This is a post about classic, no heals from different schools and no lfg queues.
---
No just shaming the ugly bathing suit.  Is that floral or glyphic??? Both!?  And what is that color palette.  For shame.
---
Its a bear butt. It wouldnt be a proper Dun Morogh screen without it.
---
Dude, stuff happens during leveling. Leveling is a huge part of the game, and random stuff happens all the time. Even so, I checked my warcraftrealms.com census for my 3 level 60 characters in vanilla. For all 3 characters, I reached 60 in less than a few months. If phase 1 lasts for two-three months your argument doesn't hold up, for me at least (and probably many others).
---
In what world do you not imagine "maybe entire phase 1" as something that is probably going to happen?  You're saying stuff as if you know it to be true. "Phase 1 probably won't be for a long time." - it's stuff like this that you really have no clue about. Please tell me why you're so adamant in defending this terrible solution? If this is to compensate for the tourists, then shard the first 20-30 levels or something, but why the entire continent?
---
I remember this from Nost. Great stuff! Does it still have you-know-who's mark in the options menu?
---
Ok I should have worded my post better than. Their spell batching emulation is successfully recreating these fun plays that unbeatably exist in Vanilla and that is a good thing, but their emulation at the same time is introducing artificial lag to nearly every facet of the game which I do not believe was a thing in Vanilla. I believe that the cons of their current emulation of spell batching vastly outweigh the pros.
---
If they figured out a way to have the plays still possible without the lag on everything I would be all for it, but their current solution is not working and should be removed.
---
If you don't like memes then that's fine. Lots of people like memes.
---
Same but its 5 for me. Rogue, Priest, Hunter, Druid, Shaman.
---
So it turns out, on long fights it's BiS and better than DPS trinkets. No idea how many fights will be lasting 2+ minutes in Classic though.
---
Is is all about this achievement?

That's true. Hey, anyone seen Rexxar?

This is my biggest gripe with the current implementation of spell batching in Classic.
---
Getting a heal off, and tank dying, was a thing even in cataclysm. Also your healing being 100% overheal just after tank took dmg. And that was with cataclysm having smaller spell batches I guess.

Hi, /u/ChiefDaddyJ
---
The 2012 picture, the armor does look dope.
---
Rogue T2 is mostly for PvP so they wear some off-set during BWL era, but otherwise all the sets are used in PvE.
---
You don't like a snowy monocolor blob with mediocre trees!  Yeah me either.
---
Hey any Hetero Alphas out there? Lets smash some Ally Gaybois.
---
Fuck Dallas
---
Ball so hard alliance wanna fine me
---
You can only raise with something better
---
Yep, this happened back then. Batching is working fine. It *always allowed* shit like this. This is why people should really research before asking for stuff.
---
I don't mind it, but I do mind folks campaigning for it, then complaining after we get it. We explained what spell batching does a thousand times, why are people surprised?
---
Few things scare me more than a well equipped and buffed ele shaman in a BG. As a warlock I prefer to deal with rogues and warriors over ele shamans. They are nasty! I have no idea how they are as healere though. But during MC and maybe BWL I can't imagine we need everyone to min-max their spec.
---
Preraid BIS is bad for pvp cause it’s a lot of cloth and no stam
---
You’ll want plate with Stam on it, healing is good too but secondary to stam. 
---
You can deal with less healing power by outlasting the other guys and being a tank, plus dispels and freedom are still powerful. 
---
Whitesoul helm, belt of the ordained, engineer shield from Mara, spell crit sword from mara or the hammer of grace from BRD are all great items. 
---
Imo you’ll wanna get into MC for lawbringer, which has both lots of stam and good healing. Aurastone hammer is also great, as well as the shield from Rag. 
---
I’ve pvpd a ton as a holy Paladin and pocket heal for warriors who go 20+ kills and zero deaths on the regular. Please let me know if you have any questions
---
I forgot about this. That's a good point.
---
Unpopular opinion here but lag is da poop.
---
Exactly. I'll be ahead of the curve
---
It's most likely not but even if it's 200 or 400 ms that's still only 0.2 or 0.4 of a second. The amount of time it took for that shadow bolt to hit multiple batches should of went off.
---
You're surprised that Introverts are the the biggest portion of a MMO playerbase? how is that surprising
---
Nope.
---
I think this picture really captures the quiet beauty of the zone: No other starting zone makes you feel as immersed in the world as Dun Morogh does. Just my opinion though :)
---
Ok, Ive heard that AoE proccing Clearcasting is for sure per-cast since each target hit would greatly increase the chance of it proccing. I remember seeing somewhere that each Arcane Missile is seperate and the channel would give each a chance of proccing.
---
I'll never roll need unless everyone's greeding but goddamn...some people...  
---
You take so much shit as a ret paladin. Half the time when reply to the lfm about dps they just fucking ignore you completely. Like you're wearing greens and still lvl 35... don't even ask you, "healing? tanking set?".  
---
How the fuck am I supposed to get tank gear if I can't even get a reply.  
---
Then Wotlk happened...
---
But she takes up 7 slots in a 40 man raid.
---
The real tauren racial is looking badass in all armour.

squad up fellow hetero alpha male lets crush some squares bring it in bro
---
Thanks alot!
---
Pls mom safe space
---
That is literally the reasoning anyone who wanted Legacy servers was given for years.
---
Just because Blizzard says something doesn't mean it's the be-all end-all.
---
Thanks, that was a fun read.
---
Our raid leader is a prot pala, it works fine for offtanking and maintanking some stuff like Huhuran.
---
I think p servers were solid about this for the most part. Main spec only was advertised on most groups I saw. Was great as a hunter, although I would hate it as a rogue. Only have solid sword, but want to get a good dagger? Too fucking bad, you are a sword rogue. Use shit daggers if you want to be a dagger rogue.
---
TSA intensifies
---
Plz stop discriminating against vagina lovers, it's 2019 that's not ok.

Good to know, thanks!
---
Horde.  I will be troll hunter.  Have about 10 of my old guild and building from there.
---
I wish I could log in with a stealth mode when I want to be left tf alone, not by coworkers but even people in game.
---
it's not that big of a deal. it's just one or two extra keybinds. you don't need to down-rank every single heal or keybind every single rank of your heal.
---
like, for Priest, you down-rank Heal (Rank 4) and then Greater Heal (Rank 1) when you get better gear. Druid's pretty much spend their entire raiding life spamming Healing Touch (Rank 4). i'm not sure what the "ideal" down ranks for Shaman/Paladin are, but it's probably pretty similar to those.
---
i mean, you could keybind every down-ranked spell if you want, but, as long as you have one or two, you'll be good.
---
Horde, NA
---
Well if that is how you understand my post It might be better that you let someone else lead the guild.
---
Na Horde
---
Yeah of course bro, its totally the same thing. Fucking idiot.
---

What the hell are you talking about....

"Don't pass on loot to a streamer? Get prepared for the same."

Man, you really have no clue...

The AQ40 belt is sadly better than the T3 belt for Rogues :(

Ironic

I’d kill to get back in that zone

Your message is good, but how **dare** you besmirch the name of dwarves like that. Be bad, keep your feet in the air, and do NOT wash yer back.
---
Gay and after your brother? Damn, dawg.
---
My brain tries to auto fill that when I zoom out. Weird.
---
Alliance, NA
---
Funny enough, the first time I ran it on a p server, we had forgotten how hard that dude hit and our shaman tank got shitcanned. We ended up kiting him down.
---
I think he got a bit too much shit for that wipe, although reporting it as a bug definitely warranted people ragging on him a bit.
---
Watched some stream clips on YT and all of the lock's dots definitely dropped off after the duel finished.
---
Could be!  But a lot of people think this is their destined Vanilla experience and it doesn't have to be!  I lone wolfed to 60 first char then someone reached out to me and all of a sudden i was raiding, i got Warlord, I did everything but clear naxx in this wonderful game.
---
I might not have even kept playing after 60 if that person hadn't expanded my World.
---
Na Alliance
---
Well, you cant change Philadelphia
---
That's where most my thoughts go, and what I expected. At this point I think I'm deciding between the class I want to play and the class I have more a chance to excel with less gear. Thanks for the input.
---
I played stress and I’m cooler than a cat on a scooter rocket through saturns asshole.

Your president's staff has to hide ships from him or he'll get sad :(

Yea, the max is high, doesn't mean that you won't be unlucky and get put in a layer with 100 people on it.

Yeah I’d like to join up for sure.
---
Nobody did fantasy art like him. His pieces are so distinct and full of life.
---
It doesn't even matter if it's shaming.  Others will form an opinion of you whether or positive or negative based on their observations.  For example if I see a coworker playing WoW at 3am on a Sunday and coming into work Monday morning with sleep deprivation affecting them, I'll look less highly upon them.  Not because they are sleep deprived, but because I know why and it's a poor excuse.
---
You could extend these scenarios many ways in include offending a coworker with chat or preferring not to group with them.  For that reason I keep my gaming life separate from work.  Obviously this will vary based on the individual and their work environment, but sometimes it's better to keep your personal life personal.
---
Well yeah, they hired the same artist
---
I'm pretty amazed I had to go down this far to find Hinterlands. It's beautiful for all the reasons Mulgore is.
---
If you don't down rank you'll have very few useful buttons.  Classic has a ton of janky spells but especially in pve you won't really use most of them.  If you get into pvp though you can end up with a ton of buttons with downranking like lower level buffs for dispel fodder rank 1 aoes for rogues rank 2 slows etc.
---
Because Blizz only decided yesterday to remove the stress test from the [b.net](https://b.net) list, before yesterday it was there all this time. Additionally, Blizz didn't even bother to announce they'll remove it, yet, they've announced when they renamed it from beta to 'beta &amp; stress test'. So yeah, obviously people are going to be really confused when all of a sudden the game dissapeared from their list. Some reinstalled [b.net](https://b.net), some reinstalled wow and so on, thinking it's something wrong from their side.
---
tbh I feel the same way, so many people are simply out to get karma (not saying that's the case here). How hard can it be to go on a private server and take a bunch of screenshots and say "just found my old vanilla screenshots, what do you guys think??" and in come the upvotes.
---
Anyone that calls themselves an "adult" in an argument, isn't. You also have very poor reading comprehension, because all of your points are mute simply by my "regardless of whether it's necessary or not" i typed in the first comment you responded to. I'll ask again; are you retarded?
---
Hold up, this is a SS take in-game without any other processing? God damn this game has aged well.
---
Your username's irrelevant btw. Sad
---
Since we're doing this...

Any red-headed ladies out there who are into a bit of light BDSM, and have tidy, trimmed, but otherwise unshaven pubic areas?

My sister started playing EQOA one day and I laughed then she played FF11 and bounced off it before I did and went on to play every FF after, but then she got into 14 and it was bad and I laughed and she was angry, but then she kept playing all the Final Fantasy games.   
---
Then she wants me to play the new 14 and she knows I will like it and I can play black mage and buy a house ride a chocobo and whatever, I join her guild she shows up I know she has been playing this for ages so she has magitek armor summons crazy shit and now she is gonna come punch things with me, this goes along fine till eventually I have the a discussion with an alternate dimension version of my sister and her guild mates while fighting Ifirit, I was somewhere between laughing and being sick then my phone rang and I didn't know to wind my watch or piss honestly.   
---
To this day I still wont sign into steam friends, dont play MMOs with sibilings people.

wahhhhhhh wah make it stop i hate it stop talking about him wahhhhhh
---
Most popular wow streamers are rank 1 glads and will most certainly stick to playing with themselves, just like they always have. This sub has no fucking clue...
---
Non-rank 1s, like Asmon will raid with a pserver player guild with esfand. Soda will raid with the rank 1s or with friends from pservers. 
---
This sub has no fuckin clue. Plus half of Sodas viewers dont even play wow anymore and are just consistent viewers of his stream out of habit.
---
Streamers have always done stuff like this on their own with other streamers or hardcore players. No one has ever gotten preferential treatment, generally the opposite, when soda has raided, they troll him instead of worshipping him. 
---
Dont listen to Twitch chat, you fools....
---
You, your party, your raid will all be on the same layer....ALWAYS.
---
I hope this get fixed. There is nothing better than accidently pulling half of the Azeroths monsters for your group to enjoy while Feign Deathing. All the happiness noises coming through voice comms makes you feel nice and warm.
---
Stop. Posting. This. Garbage.
---
&gt; If the game is very popular (that is, far more than Blizzard's metrics predict), then Blizz will obviously just launch new servers to compensate for the unexpected popularity before they ever decide to do something as jackasinine as server-specific extra-long Phase 1+layering
---
How does adding more servers after the game is popular inform their initial decision on server cap size? The server cap size and player retention rate will determine how long layering will last on big servers.
---
And interpreting this meme hyper literally and arguing the merits of when and where people are going to ask for server pictures is simply strange and deliberately missing the point.
---
 Layering will absolutely have people asking for layer hops in /1 chat, and it will have visible world transitions similar to sharding whenever you receive an invite from someone outside your layer. 
---
It's a working solution, but it's still going to have ugly side effects. You don't have to pretend they don't exist to defend the use of the system.
---
Awesome thank you
---
It’s pretty cool when you do see Nathanos mount up in bfa he rides a plague hound. Nice nod to classic and his pets.
---
The obvious answer to your dilemma is simple, quit your job, I mean jobs are tedious and get in the way of your fun time anyway.
---
On a more serious note , just do what u want, if you don't wanna play with the guy from work just don't play with him, if he ever asks why you aren't etc, just tell him you're playing with long time friends or some shit. If that's not enough just say you've planned to play with them for a while , so it's kinda hard to break the promise.
---
Unless of course you dont have a guild/group of friends you're planning to play with, in that case I'd suggest you play with your work friend and teach him how to play instead of ditching.
---
You don't get half pay... You get 80% along with the changes to karensdag where you only get paid for 6 hours instead of 8. Instead of having an entire days salary disappear.
---
In every world where Blizzard isn't bad at business, that's what world(s). Layering is contingent upon long-term stable populations approaching theoretical server maximums. If they have more long-term players than they initially anticipated, *then they'll launch new servers*. They're not going to simply keep the same small number of servers and hold out hope that the players they thought would jump back to retail after three weeks instead do it after three months. If there are players sticking around for three months, that's cash money for them, and they'll do what they can to make sure those players stay around as long as possible, which means new servers and possibly free transfers from ones that are overpopulated "for too long".
---
Why do you think they would *want* to keep layering around? It causes problems for them in terms of server management and incites the wrath of a million screaming monkeys every day it exists. They're doing it because it's a necessary evil, better than the greater evils of either exorbitant queues, dead servers, or retail sharding.
---
&gt;Please tell me why you're so adamant in defending this terrible solution? If this is to compensate for the tourists, then shard the first 20-30 levels or something, but why the entire continent?
---
Because it's not terrible. It's about the most elegant thing I can personally think of for combating obvious server launch issues that doesn't at the same time break game session immersion, and it's temporary. And when people come up with bizarre, sometimes laughable criticisms of it, I defend it because *God forbid they actually do what you suggested*. Sharding every sub-20/30 zone is so much unimaginably worse for immersion than layering, I honestly find it difficult to take you seriously right now. They suggested that at first, and the community sentiment was so (that time justifiably) vicious that they made a new server tech to ameliorate both the problems of launch *and* avoid the problems of sharding. Sharding is heinous; it's leaps and bounds worse than layering ever could be even if they only limited it to the 1-10 zones, let alone sub-30. For you to say with a straight face that you think it's a better solution to make people blink in and out of existence from multiple separate servers and simultaneously scare away anyone who was trying to play Classic to *avoid* that retail issue... I'm simply flabbergasted. No. Layering an entire continent is much, much, *much* better than sharding even a single zone.
---
Don't mistake me for someone who's somehow enthusiastic about it. I'm not saying it's a magic solution. It clearly has its own issues that I hope they manage to mitigate, and in the best of all possible worlds, I would have appreciated a scenario where they could launch forty servers instead of ten, and then every player equally spreads across each server in perfect faction balances, and none of these players ever leave, and nobody ever has to deal with the slow death of their server, and everything is magic and hunky-dory and there are no queues because server populations are stable at precisely the right numbers 24 hours a day. But that's not going to happen. It won't, it can't, it never could. The alternatives to layering are much worse for both short-term and long-term game enjoyment. I'd much rather deal with a server that has layering for a month than one that has a dead population five months in after I've already invested time into my character. I've personally experienced both dead Vanilla servers *and* multi-hour queues, and I'd take temporarily parallel launch month crowds any day of the week.
---
If you want the true Vanilla experience of getting home from work at 5 and waiting until 9 to be able to log in, then sorry, I guess you aren't going to get what you want.
---
Its funny you should say that... you have yet to mention a single axe yourself.
---
So until then every sword i mentioned is a better tanking weapon. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
They're useful why?
---
What are tier sets anyways? Always heard this talked about
---
If it encourages you actively think about your strengths and weaknesses, and conduct your life accordingly, than its a good thing. The problem is most people are not able to be that honest with themselves
---
This is the first time I've seen this link so I can add to that
---
In another world. I want to do a Human only Scarlet Crusade themed guild. Only issue is wanting to be a hunter so I am forced to play Nelf and just hide behind my mail gear
---
They have a number of challenges. Taunt is not that useful in raids anyways because most bosses can't be taunted. Obviously bosses like Ebonroc where a taunt rotation is necessary it won't work. I'd worry more about mana and single target target threat. Our raid leader is a prot paladin and it works pretty good. He mainly tanks trash, especially AoE trash and sometimes ads on bosses. He pretty much has to initiate because holy shield is a huge part of his threat. I can't even imagine going through the suppression room or the tunnel to Fankriss without a prot pala. We just run through it and we're not really overgearing it. 
---
That's another point I guess. We're sorta a mid-tier guild, in a really dedicated and hardcore guild I suspect there are other ways of going through that we simply are not skilled enough as a guild to do. So I think maybe the prot paladin doesn't shine as much in hardcore guilds, while still requiring a pretty hardcore player. Same with the ret I suppose.
---
Haha you are either a troll or really stupid.
---
I guess some people prefer grassy monocolor blobs.
---
I would totally be down for an option that replaces old character models with the new ones. Even if there is a stark difference between the world and the players. The new models and animations are just so much better.
---
This is literally you being entitled, lmao. Instead of putting the effort into a group that will let you roll, you'd rather say nothing and ninja the item from someone who has filled that roll all run.
---
And I don't believe for a second anyone is kicking the damn healer right before the last boss of an instance. If you got kicked late in the instance, it is for other reasons.
---
Sounds fun, might be interested!
---
Hetero green orc reporting in.
---
okay. but i dont think others using fast heals matters too much atleast when healing tanks specifically... in those youll always be pre-casting a heal so that when the tank takes a hit your healing spell goes off as quickly as possible.
---
Either way... ill use this flash of light-knowledge in classic when the time comes. :P
---
Yesss
---
What if you give it to to them and you're the n00b?
---
No, a bad headache means you can't operate in an office environment where there are coworkers and other stuff making constant noise.
---
It is very different compared to a calm home environment.
---
ROFL
---
Really? I've honestly not followed it up very closely ever... That's good to know.
---
Either way, the point was more the good faith system and less the exact pay.
---
I've always thought that humans should be able to be hunters
---
and make it it so trolls could be warlocks or undead be hunters to balance it out
---
its grey for xp but thats the lowest a 60 can kill for hk
---
How is that rational? No one was able to play classic a year ago.
---
I remember guilds getting in trouble for changing models of doors so that they could walk through them. There  were also people who would change their character model to what ever race they wanted to be. So in the past they were stored client side. Not sure if that is still true today.
---
Except dodge chance does and that is higher in vanilla and because bosses parry more often they deal significantly more damage as well.
---
Wait, so for the first week I only get 20% of my pay, and then anything past that I get 80%?
---
When was this changed, that's a huuuuge difference!
---
Except I mentioned 2, and didn't bother with Doom's Edge.
---
Makes sense, thanks. I quit initially when AQ came out and didn't start up again until TBC. What sorts of changes made them viable?
---
Kalimdor is better to quest in then EK. Debate me. 
---
On a serious note whenever I made a character it would always go to kalimdor to do that route barrens . Dustwarrow Marsh . Thousand needles. Tanaris. Un' goro crator. BEST leveling route in my opinion. Loved all of those zones
---
"Old" theorycrafting has not aged well for the most part
---
Prot paladin is the worst spec in the game for every kind of content. Which is really unfortunate, as that was the first character I made back in 2004.
---
They are the slowest and most boring levelers. They are completely useless in PvP. They are by far the worst tanks in the game for PvE, and completely unviable in anything above five mans. Even in 5 mans, they are pretty bad, and just BARELY able to tank the content both in terms of mitigation and threat building.
---
They are tied with Boomkins for worst mana problems in Vanilla. Their itemization is a nightmare, because they need both tanky plate stats AND mana.
---
In PvP, literally the only useful thing they have is a stun. Literally. For example, if you were actively trying to design the most useless possible class for vanilla pvp, you would design the prot paladin, minus HoJ.
---
They are completely awful and playing one will significantly dampen your enjoyment of the game. Don't do it.
---
&gt;Dude you’ve got issues. You need to learn to Set boundaries with people - they will respect you that way. 
---
I guess you never had a real job? Or you just got really lucky with coworkers?
---
I have had the exact scenario OP describes happen. A coworker started playing private servers with me, but it turned out he was completely atrocious at the game. WIth me having a guild and responsibilities ingame I simply did not have time to sit and carry that guy through a 4 hour Deadmines when it become clear he had no intention of trying to improve at the game, and yes, it did sour the work relationship when I told him I just had other things I needed to spend my time on ingame.
---
For someone new to the game, they cannot possibly understand the kind of social committments that occur within the game and in their mind, no matter what you tell them, they will percieve it as if you are deliberately avoiding them.
---
I suppose there were several dispersed tribes bust most might have lift in desolace before it became the waste land it is now. 
---
Because the origin of the centaur is in desolace, right?
---
Nog That cool as the Tauren but wel done haha
---
Yea, life must be so hard trying to find a quest mob...I suppose that is what you complain about when favored so hard.
---
That’s how I remember it in classic. It was useless because the actual drain soul damage had to get the killing blow.
---
One great reason to play a cow - Mulgore is a lovely starting zone.
---
Let's assume you're the cookie-cutter 16/0/34 with 3 points in Improved Mind Blast and 3 points in Meditation.
---
You need 50 spells to "guarantee" a Blue Dragon proc.
---
Your 3 spell rotation is 7.5 seconds long. So it takes you 125 seconds to reach 50 spells.
---
You have ~125 base Spirit (varies slightly depending on race)
---
Your Dire Maul pre-BIS gear (with enchants) gives +19 spirit (and your BIS lists after that don't give much more).
---
But let's assume you're Human and have Blessing of Kings and Divine Spirit and Gizzard Gum and Spirit of Zandalar and Spirit of Zanza and Songflower Serenade and Cozy Fire and Monster Omelet buffs.
---
That puts you right around 300 spirit. That gives you 88 mp5 when allowed regen, which equates to ~264 mana per Blue Dragon proc. We'll call it 265.
---
That means, with nearly every buff imaginable and no interrupts to your casting at all, the Blue Dragon card is equivalent to 10.6 mp5.
---
In comparison, the Mindtap Talisman from Dire Maul is 11 mp5.
---
Dodge was a 1% difference, hardly significant. And yes the melee timer reseting because of parry will lead to more damage, but not so much as to offset the increase pservers had.
---
When bfa first came out I wanted to level all my alts to 120 fast but my cousin saw I was on and wanted to level with me .-. it was fun but it was very slow for sure . Having friends is great but when it slows down your leveling and route you take it gets in the way ;-;
---
&gt;Sharding is heinous; it's leaps and bounds worse than layering ever could be even if they only limited it to the 1-10 zones, let alone sub-30.
---
I assume you're misinterpreting me on purpose here? Sharding = layering in this context. Instead of layering the entire continent, layer the low level tourist zones. This is still a shitty solution, but it's still better than having the ENTIRE continent layered. How is layering the ENTIRE continent better than layering a third of the continent? You've lost me there. And with layering people are still going to experience people phasing in and out before their eyes with the layer-switching party invites.
---
Aye, I think the same. I get though how overloaded Humans would be though. And they would have needed to have a Hunter Trainer in the Human starting zones. But i'd gladly take that trade and run to Stormwind every time.
---
Also follow your heals with a dot, and try to heal the whole party at once so you can regen some mana in battle.
---
Its a damn bad WoW expansion. Not as bad as WoD, because there is still content to do, but the content itself never has been that rejected by the community. Who actually has fun with Warfronts, Incursions or Island Expeditions? The game isnt that bad because its carried by long standing principles. So in my opinion one should look at BfA as current WoW and BfA the expansion seperatly. The first is still the best MMO out there, the latter is a failure overall.
---
Feralas is my favorite
---
I've used Luna for a long time and its absolutely fantastic.  I remember helping you test a lot of the druid functionality when you were adding features.  Looking forward to having the opportunity to use it again in Classic.  Thanks for all your hard work!
---
I know that there was a really popular chat add-on back in the day that allowed you to click links that were in chat.
---
I don't see why you couldn't just throw out a Discord Link macro to invite randos to your Discord for a group run.
---
Hi, /u/Vojta_nadruhou
---
Yeah that pic caused me to almost roll a dwarf hunter but I rolled on a server with way too many alliance players so I went with an orc instead. Definitely went into the game assuming hunters would be as necessary for groups as warriors or mages because I played all the warcraft rts games where archers were really important. I was a skilled hunter but still had to beg my way into most endgame content back then.
---
I'm fully aware, but you're not pre casting the tank unless you're assigned to him.
---
Any healer in the raid will of course try to save the tank, and doing a 2, 5sec cast heal when you see him at 20% isn't fast enough.
---
Man Op you're just getting roasted for asking a simple question... Theres no way to tell yet. I imagine if there is a blue post before launch about server names etc people might make posts about having the hardcore raiders or pvpers on certain ones. But if they dont its almost impossible to tell
---
wod was pretty good. bfa is very good.
---
Blizz should bring this back :p
---
If you genuinely believe people trolling and saying offensive shit in chat are alt right you really don't know how the internet works.
---
Take this advice. I was work friends with this guy, added him to my Steam and invited him into my discord. He couldn't take the pressure and people started joking with him, eventually soured our work friendship. Made work 10x difficult just to worry about this dudes feefees.
---
Yep, especially when you can predict the damage like on Ragnaros and the dragons in BWL. You see the boss starting to cast his spell and you line up a Holy Light to when it hits. Currently I'm the only one in the entire guild (shocking I know) who does this and as such my healing is way above everyone else on those fights. As in 20-30% above. It's a huge deal.
---
Recently I've changed my mind about the whole keep your pets taunt off. Let's say the tank pulls a shit ton I will put my pet in one spot and taunt with it so it's a bit off the tank. I don't see how this is a bad thing :)
---
my co-worker is the one ill be playing with when we both take a week off for classic lol
---
I was a fury warrior who had these. The rogues in my guild were sad
---
NA
---
Yeah I've figured out the name/race/class combos I want to try and get when the game is released.  Took far longer than is reasonable.
---
There is one; faster pvp queues.
---
agree to disagree I guess
---
Have you tried getting good?
---
Orc is better bc of axe skill.
---
Do not do bad posts like this
---
No? I enjoyed XQC when he was strictly OW streaming. I’ve never liked Soda. Twitch chat in general is cringe 99% of the time.
---
Theres just a certain type of people that are cynical and live their life that way.
---
Was searching for exactly this. Thank you [koltrastentv](https://www.reddit.com/user/koltrastentv/)!
---
It's literally happened, so... you're wrong.
---
No. 
---
An example, if you work 8 hours normally, you will only get 80% sick pay for 6 hours (1/5th). So if you are sick a whole week, it's the same as before, you lose a days salary. But if you're only sick for two days, it's only 40%.
---
It changed this year, and it is a pretty nice change.
---
Poor pallys with the banana shoulders
---
Fake, it doesn't have enough grass.
---
&gt;How does adding more servers after the game is popular inform their initial decision on server cap size? The server cap size and player retention rate will determine how long layering will last on big servers.
---
Layering is there to allow for temporary overflow. If they think the temporary overflow is neither temporary nor over, then they will make new servers. If they think the oldest servers aren't "losing players fast enough", they'll provide free server transfers to the newer servers like they always did in Vanilla.
---
&gt;And interpreting this meme hyper literally and arguing the merits of when and where people are going to ask for server pictures is simply strange and deliberately missing the point.
---
The clear and overt point he was making, before he started adding in random and entirely new caveats about "missing out on the fun" or "having to advertise for a layer", was "Layering will prevent me from taking screenshots of me and my friends," which is just false. It won't. That's not how it works.
---
&gt;Layering will absolutely have people asking for layer hops in /1 chat, and it will have visible world transitions similar to sharding whenever you receive an invite from someone outside your layer. 
---
The second thing is definitely true. No doubt. But why would the first be? Players won't conceivably have any understanding of what layer they're on or how many people are currently in there with them, and about 99% of them will still be sub-40 by the time the technology is phased out. Any "incentive" to jump layers will mostly occur in the endgame zones for things like Thorium Veins or, more obviously, Black Lotus or Devilsaur Leather, and the number of people in those zones will already be so small that they would hardly be competing for resources to begin with, let alone asking for help from their "rivals" in general chat. Whether that actually comes to pass is another matter, largely contingent on whether Blizzard adds "layering cooldowns" and on how many people even manage to get to 60 before the feature is removed. But asking for layer hops in a place like The Barrens is just silly. Like, *why* would you ever need to do that in a lower-level zone? Maybe to look for rare-yet-unpopular Beasts for the sake of taming them, but that's about the only thing I can think of.
---
&gt;It's a working solution, but it's still going to have ugly side effects. You don't have to pretend they don't exist to defend the use of the system.
---
I'm not. That's what I was saying from the outset. There are coherent criticisms to layering as we currently understand it, even if those criticisms can be rebutted one way or another. But "If layering exists, then I can't take Ironforge screenshots and I'll be the only person there" is so obviously not a coherent criticism that I can't believe I'm still having this conversation. It's like arguing that layering will prevent you from using the Auction House properly, or that layering will mean you can't see your friend if you're in the same zone, or that layering will make populated zones cross-server. These things are patently, 100% untrue, as is the original "I can't take screenshots with people" argument being presented in this post.
---
How'd you get there?
---
In which case, you’d roll Troll. Tauren’s just a terrible race all-around.
---
Yeah the more I look into it, I think the lore is referring to Desolace. It also makes sense geographically that they'd end up in Mulgore.
---
I plot out my keybinds first and then add my abilities as I level to wherever seems to make sense.
---
Try raiding without a single hunter and then ask again you fucking idiot.
---
There is nothing wrong with that. Also remember to need all the weapons so those are off the tank too. Appreciation earned 100%.
---
Found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
"Invite to full layer"
---
Ouch.

Back in the day FD combined with my Gnomish Army Knife could "save" a corpse run for the entire group.

this, it's any mob that gives XP and at 60, 48's are green and 47's are grey.

Are you talking about  "Dude where's my mount?"
---
I wanted these on my hunter
---
hunter weapons.. home
---
/punt
---
Apparently you don't have to worry about this anymore. Blizzard decided not to have unarmored mounts in the game. The shittiest decision they've made so far.
---
A mix of persistence and death.
---
Haha gotcha. Don't think I'll be playing Hunter come classic.. I played Hunter when I first started vanilla but I'm having so much fun between mage/shaman/priest and I don't know what to pick :(
---
Damn man, you're really offended by this aren't you?
---
Beautiful zone.
---
The are pros and cons..
---
Pros: I show up an hour late to work and the first person I see is my boss.. instead of asking why I was late he said the blue axe I gave him last night was awesome for his warrior.
---
They had like 3+ raids and Weavils aoe attack wiped them all after he used it like 4 times.
---
A two month old comment, and you don't even include proof of your claims? Seems lazy, come back with proof.
---
I guess one part was chased away from Desolace, through the Stonetalon Mountains and the Barrens, ending up in Mulgore. While another part was pushed south to Feralas and Thousand Needles
---
48 is green to 60. 47 is gray.
---
I'll skip the few problematic ones. Losing a couple quests per level is not the end of the world.
---
I understand your point. Funny enough, I personally would love to see improved classic wow. Vanilla had many many flaws that if it was up to me, would improve them by making the world feel a bit more alive (as an example, by putting more houses to goldshire, making new NPCs, new interactions and behavior between them) while keeping the game play and content the same obviously. But this is highly subjective and I know, there are too many people striving for classic wow as it was and my voice is nothing here. Classic wow is unique game, but there is a room for improvements. Back to the point, I dont necessarily think, that following #nochanges formula blindly is a good thing to do and every aspect and feature of the game should be discussed based on their original importance and value the brought to the game and reason, why they were there. We know the real reason of spell batching and the consequences it brings within. Therefore we can clearly ask ourselves, is it really necessary to put such feature into game now, with great internet connection and strong servers for the sake of classic wow experience, even though it totally ruins the spell interactions? In conclusion, I believe, its absolutely normal to discuss some changes for a greater good. After all, they have already made some minor and even major changes. This one would be just one out of few, that have already been made. (non-progressive itemization, updated pvp equip, a little different content release, no unarmored 100% mounts, option to have retail graphic of water, improved macro making and I could go on.) This all stacks up to the point, that no, we are not getting original WoW as it was. And there is nothing wrong with it. So lets make this classic better than the previous one. And first step would be to remove spell batching.
---
for trash?
---
What? Players and pve mobs have the same level ranges. 48 is an HK, and 48 pve mobs are green and “give xp”.
---
We shall see.  Personally I have my doubts that we will see any raid tanks running around without a shield.  I know they do on PS, but the fact that that happens is to me a further sign that PS are not very accurate.
---
I just don't think Vanilla players were dumb enough to continue to throw out full prot specced Warrior tanks if those tanks were taking so little damage that they didn't even need a shield.
---
https://youtu.be/8YPg_-FAUoo check the boss fights and general trash DPS and eat crow 
---
I was raid leader and consistent top DPS in a top 20 guild on recent pserver
---
You do realize that BRE, Ashkandi and Corrupted Ashbringer are all swords right ?
---
Who the fuck are you kiddo
---
alright
---
Well shaman can be poor mans mage or priest if needed so that might be good compromise!
---
Do it after Classic launches on a PvP server.
---
I am amused that druids and paladins have some of the best tier sets, but they will be barely seen in them. Druid cuz of their forms, paladin cuz of their dresses.
---
im offended 😭😭😩😫
---
Did you run through furbolg hold?
---
&gt; This is why people should really research before asking for stuff.
---
The onus is on you to disprove a claim if you are disputing it.
---
Too much shit? I think not enough, Though Soda deserves just as much shit.
---
Soda was off sucking dick at the boss doing god knows what.
---
Tips didn't even look at his mana or position to see that he had 2/3 Mana and not nearly close enough.
---
He charges in then turns his back to the boss instead of strafing.
---
Soda then proceeds to DPS instead of healing after noticing that he has pulled.
---
Gets 2 shot due to being under levelled and broken gear.
---
Puts in ticket complaining that the boss is "over tuned "
---
To echo what the other guy said, you suffer from mana issues if you want to be competitive on threat. The consumable requirement is huge
---
That is what I am saying. People say it would ruin the classic experience, which I can understand, but for people that played back then (like myself) Having the same game play experience with a revamped visual experience would be a breath of fresh air. So why not have both so you can pick which one you want?
---
It was a 4 man but yeah, they did it more than once
---
Same scene would have been used if the one in the blue was not fat. The fact that you saw a fat woman and not a joke is more telling about you than about us. We are not the fat shamers you are.
---
Yep, that’s the only passage through Winterspring afaik
---
Depends on what your character looks like. I had a purple haired troll and ran with the purple cat.
---
&gt;If this is to compensate for the tourists, *then shard the first 20-30 levels or something*, but why the entire continent?
---
I'm not misinterpreting you. You *literally* called it sharding, and layering is *not* sharding. They're totally different things. Sharding makes players from different servers fluctuate in and out of particular sub-areas of zones to create a poor illusion of steady population.
---
&gt;This is still a shitty solution, but it's still better than having the ENTIRE continent layered. How is layering the ENTIRE continent better than layering a third of the continent?
---
Once again, you seem to be conflating these two technologies. This is not how layering works. It creates an internally seamless continent that can only be "left" by logging out or being invited to a party. In order to do what you're asking, they'd need to actually break apart each individual starting zone+adjacent zones up to whatever level into *separate realms* complete with load screens and everything. And they'd need to do that for each individual zone. It would basically be like the Blood Elf and Draenei starting zones in TBC, except for every starting area in the game, complete with zone-in borders or invisible walls at any "creative" way of entering a different zone (such as swimming from Ashenvale to Desolace, or more commonly from the Wetlands to Westfall).
---
You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you want sharding in starting zones, that means sharding in starting zones. If you want layering in starting zones, that means invisible walls and load screens into "Real Kalimdor" and "Real EK". It means load screens for every connected flight path, too. They'd need to literally remap the game, and then remap it a second time once they phased the layering out.
---
&gt;And with layering people are still going to experience people phasing in and out before their eyes with the layer-switching party invites.
---
Oh, no. That's so much worse than people not being able to group up with their friends. Clearly this means we should remove layering altogether and reimplement four-hour queue times after all. That way people will *definitely* be able to play with their friends, and nobody could ever be mad.
---
You don't know how the internet works if you haven't learned that that's where teenagers come to get radicalized.
---
I get it and I lold
---
Yeah that was a real cringe one there.  
---
Look; in vanilla no one went “disc”.   If your healing- you were holy/disc roughly the same amount of points in each.  Neither 31 point skill is worth jack shit.   
---
If you want to be a hybrid; go shadow - you can still heal fairly well.  Or go offensive holy/disc.   
---
Never go pure disc.
---
lol they're the same thing
---
Spouse aggro lol
---
I've heard this before honestly and I don't necessarily disagree if you were certain classes, but I had really bad experiences playing vs. Hunters especially during MoP, I was playing DK/Rogue and for me TBC/Wrath were way more fun for those classes.
---
But it doesn't just scale with spirit, it scales with MP5 too?
---
I heard you can swim up past azhara and die east of winterspring
---
My money’s on me I bet y’all are some scrawny schmucks ;)  
---
Bring it on you pale pasty virgins !!
---
I have always started all my characters with the same first two letters and I will do that again.
---
I haven't decided if I want to use my main character's name on classic because I am changing class and it almost feels disrespectful to my memory of my original/main character that I've had for ~15 years.
---
I might use my second favorite character name instead.
---
Probably reserve my old main name though.
---
2020*
---
T3 gear won’t be out until 2020.
---
Oh, alright! The more you know.
---
I googled it, it was definitely 3 manned at 60 once tbc talents came out.  Not sure if it was before.
---
And the radicals get even more sensational when they're censored.
---
It started In BC, Wrath kind of kept it at the same level, and then Cataclysm took that idea and just inflated it 500%. I think questing was great in BC and Wrath. There was 1-2, sometimes 3 main leveling hubs, and a smattering of side quests around, but the worlds weren’t designed like the modern game. 
---
Then you do Hyjal in Cata, and it’s like every 300 feet there’s a brand new mini hub. That’s when world design really started to suck IMO, in Cata. Don’t even get me started on Uldum. :/
---
This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.
---
He does 2k+ right clicks, which will one shot any player.
---
He mind controls a target--which often will be the tank.
---
Both of these mean he's not tankable in one position. This means his AoE cannot be LoS'd.
---
The AoE happens every ~8 seconds, which will 1 shot the vast majority of the raid.
---
100, 1000, 10000 level 30s, it's. Not. Possible.
---
Oh, I think you edited your first comment, it's much clearer now. That is a good change indeed
---
That's another 50 DKP minus!
---
I get that, I just view the PvP as some of the best WoW has ever had because I really enjoyed the arena balance during this period, and really enjoyed the raids and dungeons in TBC. I actually liked the zones a lot too.
---
They're stupid teenagers and edgelords, they have their viewpoint simply because it pisses people off. Most don't even believe what they're saying or understand it.
---
khajiit has fist weapons, if you have coin.
---
&gt; allow 100% of your Mana regeneration to continue while casting
---
MP5 always happens 100% while casting, so no, it doesn't do anything with MP5.
---
Undead Warrior is probably only slightly better than Night Elf. It’s a terrible choice overall.
---
It'd be interesting if we got some post Naxx content that included the Demon Hunter. Not modern ones of course. A Vanilla representation. Fuck if I knew how they'd have a horde variant though.
---
Glad you know more than me. It's been a long time and I was a warlock main back then anyway. I knew both stats give attack power but I didn't know if warriors could double dip. At least I was right about the crit part lol.
---
And the advantage that you have is dps is a dime a dozen whereas tanks not so much. The only time I would tank an instance with a ret Pally was if he was a guildie. FAR too many people who play ret are terrible.
---
Its shit like this thats making me roll warlock or mage.  I just don't want the hassle.
---
PvP prot is a fun spec decent against bad rogues killing themselves on your thorns/holy shield damage. But don't expect them to fall for the same trap twice. 
---
For PvE there is nothing much to say. It is feasible to do 5mans, maybe 10mans, but players will constantly have to play around the fact that their tank is a paladin and they have to adjust accordingly. Also you will have drink, and you will drink a lot. And it is a time loss which adds up to big numbers. Barely any proper tank gear (Besides blue Deathbone set which is quite hard to get), no way to replenish mana quickly, no taunt, flawed mitigation mechanics (you have to receive crits to get mitigation), no means of ranged pull unless the target is an undead. Another overlooked issue is the way how your AoE threat works, Consecration can mess up crowd control easily.
---
TBC did a great job at fixing all these issues and we have absolutely viable tank in there, but not in classic. And people will not want to play with you outside 5/10mans.
---
At the time point when you're able to go fairly quickly through Stratholme/Scholo without drinking a lot everyone is already decked in epics and you can do this run with 4 DPS/1 Healer setup. Same goes for raids - you might be able to tank adds, but at this point warlocks, shamans and even spriests can tank adds for lulz too, since they are overgeared for this content.
---
[Haven't heard it in ages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5rZEpb3nwY)
---
Jesus that sounds sweet.
---
Armchair gynecologists basically
---
You are the only one that pretends that it happened back then and you bring nothing to proove it.
---
There's probably some hints in the quest/npc text in desolace that no one remembers.
---
Haha you assume I have a life or friends or responsibilities. I will be 60 within 2 weeks.
---
IMHO it's a bit overrated
---
I watched some of the theory behind this build.... It might be a horde vs. alliance thing too. Horde has WF for our tanks, Alliance has BoK/Devotion aura.
---
That is how it worked in vanilla.  I did it with mage blink rather than bubble, but it should be the same thing: you always have to use it early or risk dying.
---
As a healer main this was one of the first things that you learned: if you heal to late then you will spend the mana but the target will still die after the heal lands, you must heal earlier.
---
Now, I have the unpopular opinion that there should not be spell batching in classic wow, as I don't think that they should be going out of their way to add a feature that detracts from the game.  However, if their aim is to make it authentic then they seem to have done a reasonable job.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_point
---
i dont have a 60 on paerver anymore or i would log in to double check, according to this websites chart a lvl 51 is greyed out to a lvl 60. wish i could hop on to confirm this but i cant.
---
Right... we wanted spell hatching. It does exist in retail, but the window is like mouse sized. We want Vanilla sized windows, not something much larger. IDK how far off it really is, and I’m sure only Blizzard does. But the window certainly feels like it’s 50-100% too big.
---
Looks like dip where the raid leader manage the loot list... not optimal at all
---
Well, I think 1000 would be possible as long as they coordinate waves of death and literally zerg him constantly for several hours without him ever falling out of combat. As long as enough are alive that the previously dead ones can run back to their corpses and resurrect before the final living wave dies, then they can create an unbroken chain of mob-tagging.
---
Good luck accomplishing that, though.
---
&gt;Going to assume this is a 180 second duration fight.
---
Assuming 250 spirit (roughly how much spirit my priest has), the spirit regen per tick is 250/4 + 12.5 which is 75 mana every 2 seconds. (Spirit regen is calc'd by Spirit/4 + 12.5 for Priests)
---
Therefore a single Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon proc roughly provides 75 * 7.5 which is 562.5 mana. This is taking the 15 second duration and making spirit tick every 2 seconds.
---
Ignoring SW:P applications and assuming we repeat Mind Blast -&gt; Mind Flay x 2 every 7.5 seconds, we have 3 chances to proc the effect every 7.5 seconds, or 24 chances per minute, or 72 chances in a 180 second fight.
---
Therefore, DMF will give us 72*2%*562.5 = 810 mana (2% chance to proc, 72 chances to proc)
---
This 810 mana is over 180 seconds, which is 4.5 mana per second, or 22.5 MP5."
---
Thats what I found on the Nost forums.
---
TIL Wanting Vanilla gameplay features is bandwagoning.
---
lasher farm will be nerfed a bit -- dungeon reset /camp macro doesn't work so you gotta either die and run back to the instance portal or try to run back to the entrance (this will be difficult if not impossible since the farm requires you to jump down a level)
---
She's kind of an end boss, of her own raid so her ilvl is inflated
---
She is meant to be weaker than ragnaros tho since Ragna has 2 more ilvl
---
It will be interesting to find out. And generally I agree that fast is better then slow
---
1. They're finagling with it right now so it feels authentic. They'll likely make the window slightly smaller by release.
---
2. There's no way they're removing it.
---
My absolute FAVORITE classic zone!  I still go back there just to hang out.
---
Ah, you're right, Spirit ticks are every 2 seconds. Lemme change my math.
---
Nobody's gonna argue with that.  We've all dealt with explosive diarrhea.
---
Huh?
---
I'm surprised you're anywhere near a hunters numbers I felt like druids were the slowest leveling class by far in classic.   Am I wrong?  What spec?
---

took a pic for a friend a week ago when I was getting this account back on my battle tag. I wonder if I had this account on my battle tag when first wave of invites went out if I would have gotten in instead of my account registered in TBC
---
The majority of Vanilla classes worked a certain way yet we are still playing classes as if they were on the final patch.
---
Not debating dual-wield Warriors here. I'm talking about Druids and simply making the comparison to private server Warriors. You're changing the argument to something completely unrelated.
---
I have no plans of playing a hunter so calm yourself lol and don't run off doing ad hominem attacks like a child.  
---
It is a Bug from Vanilla, it existed.  We were told bugs and all would be included I would like to see an official statement against this rather then just accepting that certain bugs actually aren't okay.
---
Power shifting for feral druid being one of the unintended gameplay mechanics, spell batching, stop casting macro's. 
---
All of those are explicitly very powerful in their own right when used correctly, and were not intended mechanics.
---
Actually ironically my retinas and optic nerve are fine :/ there's something between eyes and visual cortex that's not sparking properly they think
---
One of the original wow dev's (Kevin Jordan possibly?) said on his twitch stream that there was a version of dynamic respawning back in the day so I wouldn't be surprised if spawn rates were sped up a bit based on zone population but nothing like BfA spawn rates.
---
If you don’t like classic, play retail
---
Well, in case of the Blizzcon demo I was running away on a flat surface and still getting hit way further away. As I'm likely going mage as main tha't kind of important when trying AoE farming.
---
Am i supposed to find an overweight woman attractive for your sake?
---
I'm a little sad because I recognized the picture right away, I was really hoping it was a new shot of those guys in the beta or something. :( Hope it happens.
---
The graveyard is way too far away and players will hit their Resurrect timers, being unable to ress for several minutes. He's not possible.
---
Warriors got their talent revamp when BWL came out, over 12 months before 1.12 was released. By the time BWL had been cleared it was well known on forums that warriors were one of the best dps in the game.
---
Hey buddy, I didn’t post or upvote the pic that shames the fat chick
---
They won't. Everyone is doing the same quests anyway, the guide just orders them in the most efficient manner. I don't understand how you don't get what I'm saying. 
---
Even if everyone was always doing the quests you were doing and its impossible, then you just grind mobs. I've said this three times now.
---
Nochanges means nochanges my dude. Spell batching is how it worked back in retail vanilla so I'm glad they implemented it in classic
---
Good, speed it up until we can make precision perfect plays like we do on BfA.
---
Batching is lowering my DPS, the tanks are doing less threat because of it, and the healers are having a harder time. That's crap. Raids shouldn't wipe because of an out dated mechanic.
---
lmfao since when is Trump alt right?
---
You know K3 means you were insanely hyper-casual, right? But, sure, BRE is totally better than Vis’kag/Brutality Blade, LMFAO. Being top anything on K3 is considered utmost embarrassment.
---
They are actually really efficient once they hit 20. They have 30% movement at 21 and dont have any downtime. Only had to drink maybe 10 times 20-30. 
---
Like I said though 1-20 was pretty brutal. Terribly slow.
---
inb4 its company policy to add the HR manager to your friends list so they can keep tabs on you
---
Good point, didn’t think about that.
---
Yea i suppose but theres alot of people saying that rogues take ages to wait in queues and stuff like that idk its just a hard decision to make
---
So you think i should just stay Rogue?
---
Has blizzard announced that? Because that gear was in by patch 1.12 which is what classic is based on
---
UHHHHHN
---
I think they're also really good cause they're not as dependent on weapon drops / gear because of cat form/bear form
---
The music in Elwynn forest, its not a long piece, 3 minutes long, but it never seems repetitive or dull even though I've spent hours in the zone and go back often. I heard someone online who knows so much more about music than I do, explain that the music in Elwynn forest is comprised of many musical starts but never any finishes. Like the music ramps up but doesn't complete. It's just starts. Like the start of the game, like the starter zone. Intentional? I would think so. 
---
I think the music of wow is straight up amazing and award worthy. Master piece.
---
Go play retail where you can get all your welfare epics

#NOCHANGES

What exactly is the objective measure for attractiveness?
---
WHO REMEMBERS THIS LE GEM? UPVOTES TO THE LEFT!
---
I know there's not much to talk about until release, but come the fuck on. This is such a low effort post.
---
Insinuating I’m going to have a job when classic releases
---
Druids are fast levelers when you know what you're doing. By abusing your multiple resource bars and using hots you basically have 0 downtime along with good movespeed with cat and eventually travel form
---
Yes! Please! I would love them to drop it early but they won’t.
---
Alli is the best pve faction tho with paladins and weapon skill racials and fear ward.
---
For sure. A naked feral druid could still easily kill things no problem.
---
There is no way that this isnt intentional. God Damn. I cant believe I missed that.
---
Okay, maybe I can believe I missed that. I was, what, 14?
---
Okay maybe I should have caught that.
---
Do explain how batching lowers your DPS and reduces the amount of threat that can be produced lol.
---
Your the one that pointed out she is fat. Thats the fat shaming part

I think this is retail though?
---
Or pick up a 2600/2700 since they will drop in price and maybe spend that on a better GPU.
---
I only remembered the old video of a group 4 manning it in 06. I still prefer the Dives video. 
---
**MANY WHELPS! HANDLE IT!**
---
You're talking as though you're actually in a raid right now. lol
---
Batching barely ever affected raids in Vanilla. It was mostly a PvP thing. If your raid tank was ever in a position where he could die because of a heal batching with boss damage, then your healers suck.
---
Those perverts at Blizzard were sneaky about adding secret dicks to the terrain.  They did it in the Barrens too.
---
Lol. Are you crying about mechanics already?
---
I am on the same boat :(
---
All the raids are easy to someone who's guild is going far into Naxx, that doesnt mean they are actually easy for the vast majority of players
---
Well you have to keep in mind that private servers don't really know the actual proc rates for many (most?) things, so whatever proc rate you're used to on pservers could be straight up incorrect.
---
As someone who never played classic, seeing those T3 sets kinda makes me miss Wotlk
---
Weird, because you made it sound like it was a big fucking deal to you the first time around but now it doesnt matter
---
You think it's worth upgrading a 1080 anytime soon? I think not. Price to performance ain't worth it
---
How could I not keep that in mind? It's like half of what we talk about on this subreddit
---
My argument really is that PS are just not accurate.  The fact that healers can keep up a Fury Warrior is irrelevant as it pertains to Druids because Fury Warriors likely shouldn't be tanking in the first place.
---
I hope Druids can tank, I just wouldn't base my belief that they can on anything from a PS.
---
That makes sense I was legit only thinking about the abysmal damage because that's all I remember from leveling my druid in classic.  So you do it as feral?
---
But will fury really be as good without the /sit macro?
---
lol, rtx2080ti here dude.
---
damn right

THAT'S A FUCKING 50 DE KAY PEEEE MINUS

No, I never meant that the content of PM spam matters, just that the PM spam exists at all.

Probably just talking from some magical make-believe world instead of reality, as is standard even though you shouldn't be getting in those situations in the first place
---
I have very high doubts that batching we have now and batching during original game are the same.
---
Iirc they did not touch it until MoP, but the game did not feel so sluggish during WoTLK and other previous expansions the way it feels on beta.
---
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME WHAT I WANT OR I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO HURT PEOPLE YOU LOVE
---
growl is situationally useful but it's not good (actually really really bad) to leave it on autogrowl in dungeons.

Ok I tried facts if you can't be convinced with facts then live blissfully in ignorance. Sometimes people just need that.

Find a good Warrior buddy and do DM:E jump runs. Here is a video about it.

---
Also once you get some gear, have your Warrior friend tank Strat Living and you guys can reserve the Righteous orbs/Truefaith/Flask recipes.
---
If Blizzard can layer entire continents, surely they can shard/layer/whatever a third of the continent instead of the entire continent for each server. Do you honestly expect me to believe that Blizzard doesn't have the capability of implementing server-local sharding in just the sub-30 zones?
---
Glad it I could help!
---
Spell batching still exists now, its just much quicker batches.  They don't need to get rid of the slower batching in the beta, they need to just tune it right.  Its slower right now than it was in Vanilla.
---
But see that is exactly the problem. You don't want classic. You want a forked development. Which isn't classic.
---
&gt;I dont necessarily think, that following #nochanges formula blindly is a good thing to do and every aspect and feature of the game should be discussed based on their original importance and value the brought to the game and reason, why they were there.
---
I'm 100% sure that blizzard did this internally, and with focused groups of players. I'm possitive they have been discussing these things since before they had nostalrius out to talk with them.
---
The problem is there is no way to have those conversations with several million people.
---
In addition there is the existence of emergent gameplay from the way the systems interact, technical limitations and all. In that instance spellbatching might not have been used by the general population, it might not even have been known to the general population. But it did have large implications across the game as a whole.
---
I mean ... why don't we just add meeting stones in, becuase they were an improvement. Or the TBC changes that make druids and paladins viable tanks? How about adding in area-loot? Surely everyone can agree that was an improvement right?
---
It's a slipperly slope, and honestly i really hope they choose for a forked development. But as of currently that isn't the design goals of Classic. People just don't understand that.
---
The design goals are not to improve classic.
---
The design goals are to recreat, as faithfully as possible, the vanilla wow experience. Flaws and all.
---
Jesus it took me the same amount of time to get to level 20 on my Druid during my practice route.
---
In other words I suck
---
I saw a few, but a lot of them were female characters.
---
The "CLASSIC" looks out of place, and even covers a few blocks of the mosaic.
---
Don't the reputation rank go like this: friendly &gt; honored &gt; revered &gt; exalted?
---
And the discount will come at exalted?
---
I think you’re seriously wrong about power infusion being “worth jack shit”
---
Absolutely no chance on planet earth most of those Naxx bosses are harder than C’thun (or Emps for quite a few).
---
Careful, the post-police has arrived. Just downvote the post if you don't like it...
---
I half wonder if part of the reason the put in old batching is because thats what the content was tuned around.
---
If it really bothers you play paladin you will use top rank flash heal and 2 different ranks of slow heal for a total of 3 kebinds and an extra oshit button lay in hands that's it.
---
Nefarian and KT are pretty long fights that go over 2 minutes, but i'm not sure how many others will. Most likely C'thun and some of the naxxramas fights fall into that category. I've seen guilds steamrolling bosses in MC, BWL &amp; ZG in like 60 seconds though, so it's better to just wear spell damage trinkets there, but they were all using every single consume possible along with all the world buffs which I can't see the bulk of classic guilds doing, least not the types i'll be planning on joining.
---
It's broken.
---
&gt; Batching barely ever affected raids in Vanilla
---
Wrong. 
---
Look at this video from Esfand: 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulExpensiveSharkHoneyBadger
---
Imagine you're in a raid. A paladin tries to get off a clutch BoP to save a healer, but it doesn't, the healer dies and that could potentially wipe the raid.
---
That's stupid.
---
The game should be able to keep up with how fast we are.
---
And imp drain soul.  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVM
---
I'd just not fuss about who gets the last hit since you're in a group anyway and downtime is less of an issue.
---
I also did not like needing a druid for the Anzu. Even after TBC had like 300+ runs around wotlk just to see him giving me random gems/purps again and again.
---
"true heroes" that were playing Vanilla and had no idea what sets in the future looked like?
---
Christ fuck private server zoomers are more unbearable by the day
---
Go shadow. Excellent dmg and mana efficient when needed. Top notch healing and fear bombs if it goes south. You two will be unstoppable.
---
Pretty sure it's this. [Link](https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs). 09:25ish onwards is the bit you described i think
---
Don't you hear how silly that sounds?
---
My guild started aq40 around October 06 and got stuck at huhuran, then the preBC patch dropped and killed our momentum :(
---
&gt; But also vanilla isn't around some fast paced bam bam bam spam things click buttons
---
Too bad because they're re-tuning spell batching to be fast paced.
---
Stay in the past with your dial up.
---
They added it because the community ASKED FOR IT, no way they're going to remove it.
---
What does that matter though? As soon as he got home from work, he'd get the scarab too, and the Scarab Lord title later on.
---
I do get that it's kinda scummy to ring the gong before everyone are there to see the gates finally open and the event start.

You're gonna end up dead real quick after that charge too

With people happily rerolling in classic losing everything they "worked for"over 15 years. Wow2 ahould have been what they released not wow classic
---
precise perfect plays? BfA example of perfect? yikes.
---
BfA sucks balls my guy, A correct batching is what allows "precision perfect plays" the skill cap in vanilla is only as extreme as it is because of batching. No batching no vanishing cc/spells. no gougeing blink/kidneys ect. no stoping gouge restealth, the list continues.
---
Let them adjust it, its beta ffs implementing something like this too much and slowly lessening it to the sweet spot is easier than doing it the flip way.
---
/return punt
---
I think that China has an actual Blizzard (or WoW only) themed park, idk if it still functions.
---
What did you not like about hunter? Also there is a huge difference of playstyle from lvling up to 30 and playing at lvl 60.
---
I live in Minnesota. No ty. Fuck winter shit.

knew it was gonna be OG Jeffrey before i clicked. This guy has been hosting/commentating Vanilla duel tournaments for a while, he's one of my favorite classic streamers, if not my favorite.
---
LF1M off wank for BDSM.
---
The seduce clip is almost certainly not a spell batching issue, and is probably more related to the modern wow mechanic of CCs not breaking from spells that were already mid-air when the CC was cast.
---
Winterspring and Hinterlands.

Source?
---
Yes, it's in the content plan.

This attitude is so selfish. Think about everyone playing the game this way, how fun does that sound?

At least for the first 20 levels, you'd be best off going for 5/5 wand mastery in disc, then 5/5 spirit tap in shadow. Buy a lesser magic wand at level 5 and a greater magic wand at 13. Do the Blackfathom Villany quest in the early 20s for the wand from that. Mind Blast + SW:P and auto wanding will outdps any spells you could spam for a good 30 levels, and spirit tap will keep you from having to drink like ever. This is how I levelled to 30 on the beta.
---
I went deeper into shadow (reduced resistances, mind flay etc.) but you could invest further into disc instead. The wand damage will keep you afloat for many levels. I'd respec shadow form at 40 personally though, and assist lock with shadow weaving.
---
Yeah, but in none of those fights are you straight casting. You're lucky to get 70% straight casting time, which brings the trinket down to 15 MP5, which is less than Shard of the Scale's straight 16 MP5.
---
The trinket is good for those spamming 1.5s casts, it's not so good for Shadow Priests. Then again, a Shadow Priests job is really just to keep Shadow Weaving up, so they should never be running out of mana anyway.
---
nostalgia post made by someone just circlejerking about Vanilla while shitting on this nebulous form of WoW called "retail" to get easy upvotes
---
Tell me again in which version of the game racials were so good that the entire population of the game MIGRATED from one race/faction to another to gain these bonuses?
---
EMFH for PvP, Goblin racial on KilJaeden or just now rerolling to Trolls for the debuff of Jaina
---
There are no drawbacks on being an Alliance Dwarf Priest.
---
You are either one, or you're a worse Priest.
---
You know, this is an interesting question. Been doing some research lately and came across the vid of Nihilum doing KT. Their tanks were tauren, but they also had some "off" choices. I believe their main fury warrior was an undead for instance, shamans were tauren, rogues were undead. I guess it might not matter too much.
---
Yeah, that Wand+Spirit tap combo is amazing for solo, but my concern is it might not be best for duo
---
As a druid I used to have 5 versions of HT and 2 of Regrowth on my bar. Main reasons for HT was faster cast time and/or lower mana cost (mana management is important in vanilla).
---
It's going too be tought to be r14 for people that have never even heared of it(or maybe just heared of it but never done anything with it), people that have experience with it will simply crep all over the others
---
Has anyone tried to Priest Dispel Magic themselves before a Polymorph or similar effect hit them? (Paladins could do it too with Cleanse but that's 40+ IIRC). 
---
I don't recall every seeing someone save themselves from CC in vanilla with that, granted I never played Priests or Paladins myself (only two classes I really couldn't get into) so it's possible all the ones I encountered just weren't "good" enough for it but with such a big Spell Batching window that seems a very easy and massively powerful trick to abuse.
---
I love this zone so much, way better than Mulbore.
---
Just do the normal leveling build with wand spec --&gt; shadow.
---

---
That's because.... he's the one casting and playing. A shoutcaster generally does a play by play of what is happening, it's just from a third person perspective. He's casting himself, so it's a first person perspective. 
---
If he was casting someone else, it would still have his humor and flavor, but it would be more inline with what you see from other shoutcasters. It's just the consequence of first person vs third person doing the casting.
---
They said that with bc and wotlk. However, I agree. What do we do from there? What about people that just want vanilla? They get abandoned because everyone moves on to bc?
---
I don't think the kind of addons that would do this for you are going to work in classic. 
---
To me, healing is about pushing the right spell for each situation, so having an addon doing it for me defeats the purpose. 
---
I generally use modifiers for most of my different ranks. So my 3 key could be healing touch rank 4, shift+3 would be HT rank 3, and ctrl+3 could be rank 7. To me that makes it more of a "I know that this is the spell I want, and the tank is missing X HP, so I better hold down shift when casting."-situation. 
---
It's really not a lot, your won't need every rank bound to a key, but just the more useful ones. Generally there is a rank somewhere in the middle that has the best healing per mana. This will then eventually change to a lower rank as you get better gear. So you'll have one main heal, and then the other ones are situational
---
&gt;Its why people didn't try to use blink to save themselves from falling back then, it almost never worked.
---
I blinked myself out of fall damage all the time, my man.
---
Our mt was really good at the game, but he was a med student so spotting him pots/flasks/ even repair costs were very common.  Incidentally, he comped 2X forors to the guild (he gave me one directly) so being a good reliable  dude is way more important then any of this bullshit the min max crowd is talking about.
---
&gt;says I'm wrong about raid situations
---
&gt;shows a clip of a guy in a non-raid situation lagging with a 1-second delay
---
Spell batching, if/when properly implemented, will allow for simultaneous behaviors within a .2 second window. Esfand's clip is either not properly implemented spell batching (again, it's a beta), or not spell batching at all but rather lag (because I've had the same thing happen to me before on my TBC Paladin; the cooldown goes off, but I die because I hit the ground before the server registered my cast due to a lag spike).
---
At any length, I'm going to just say what I normally say now: *NO CHANGES*. Spell batching was in Vanilla, people heavily lobbied for it to be reimplemented, and Blizzard has reverse engineered a mostly consistent facsimile of it. It should be there. If you're as fast as you think you are, then you'll obviously be fast enough to acclimate to what players on the original Vanilla servers operated with. I legitimately don't remember a single raid fight *ever* where our guild wiped because of batching. It was, again, something that typically happened in PvP scenarios, with Mages double Polying each other, or Priests double fearing, or a Warrior charging right as a Mage blinks, and they swap positions. And I want that metagame again, because it was hilarious.
---
Again, you're making up insane hypotheticals. He dies in less than like 0.4 seconds, no one is going to be reacting that quickly by A) finding the person to save and B) clicking your key for the ability in that time. By then you already missed the boat of being able to save the person
---
Can't wait. I hope the photo does get recreated if the original players come back. Would be funny if in the last photo they all changed to Horde.
---
ok .!.
---
You are objectively wrong. Basically anyone who is familiar enough with the game to understand how it affects combat wants it.
---
I can't believe I forgot to do that! 😭
---
I actually agree with you - I think WoW Classic would be more fun if they straight up withdrew all addon support.
---
That said, I'd still want DPS meter, threat meter and good, retail-like cast bars.
---
I also think Luna Unit Frames are amazing and used them on Nostalrius. 
---
But I think the game would just be more fun if everyone was on an even footing without all this hassle.
---
&gt; Spell batching is how it worked back in retail vanilla
---
[This](https://clips.twitch.tv/LitigiousFrigidOrcaRalpherZ) seems fairly beyond the confines of what happened in vanilla, however. 
---
But that's what betas are for.
---
They do, in fact, have the capability of implementing server-local *sharding*. Because *sharding is not layering*. Stop treating them as synonyms. They work differently, and the devs have explained this in more than sufficient detail for someone to understand that. Sharding is a technology that can be localized without load screens. Layering is not.
---
I really wouldnt care. I've had enough hunters roll need on equipment they couldn't even use in my day that losing gear to offspec people is a breath of fresh air.
---
Hell, I already know that if I'm healing that I'm competing with other casters as crit is the best stat for holy paladins, and i know if i tank as a protection paladin im 5s, as i plan to eventually, I'm going to have warriors rolling for tank gear for their own sets. As it was in Vanilla.
---
And here i was thinking this sub was all NoChanges.
---
How dare you
---
Lol if I am home sick playing WoW and someone snitches to my employer, and my employer has enough audacity to try say something's in some veiled attempt to dictate what I do with my earned time off, well it's time for a new boss. :) My sick time is still my time.
---
People arnt rerolling in classic and losing everything they’ve worked for... their retail characters will still be there.
---
Haha no, but I take that as a compliment!
---
In Legion every M+ key I had that I wanted to push and had to pug one last DPS I had this issue.
---
Every other class that could link a relevant achievement and had solid gear - solid, ret paladins or literally any hunter? Dogshit boosted animals that would fucking bodypull, die to basic mechanics EVERY encounter and never used any class utility.
---
I no longer invite hunter or ret paladins in retail, wont begin to do so in vanilla considering how tight loot is.
---
Do they need substantially more healing than DPS warriors? I'm choosing between warrior and rogue, which one would you consider more usable in raid as DPS?
---
Yeah what the fuck does this apply if you work at Starbucks or some shit? Tell people to fuck off and mind their own business.
---
Fucken ay mam i shit my bed
---
So I love Tauren and I love druids. However, I started in BC, the later half of it. I keep reading how druids basically suck at everything. Cant heal, deal good dps, or tank, etc unless its like 5 mans. And that they're just good for carrying flags in PVP, which I dont want to do. How true is this?
---
Appear offline. Duh.
---
The contents going to be steamrolled either way. I think some other people brought up the benefits of it in PvP, or at least the skill cap being raised because of it
---
&gt;And generally I agree that fast is better then slow
---
My ex-wife strongly disagree with this statement ! :D
---
You can have hunter or warlock pets tank everything up to like end of mauradon.
---
i rly dont understand how anyone can like this guy \^\^  
---
but im can call myself lucky that i play on EU
---
SO important! Thank you! Love your addon, and couldn't imagine playing classic without it!
---
Nope, cross server PvP battlegrounds.
---
My main was a hunter, so enchanting was good. I could farm Maura or DM tribute, for great gold. Also getting the +15 agi from the timbermaws is good as always in demand.
---
Also herbing and alchemy are good as folk need pots for pvp and PVE.
---
I hope they will release the chart for what mob/boss kill the most player once it's launch.
---
Vael got like 1 millions kill iirc.
---
Brother I played Ret in actual vanilla.  I did fine trust me.  I was in server first guild and alliance 2nd Hand of Rag.  Even back then guildies cared a lot about meters and though I was never on top, I definitely justified my spot.  That was when we were really competing to first clear everything.  Nowadays people don't really give a shit about that so Ret will be even more welcome.
---
Holy fucking shit that’s a demon hunter
---
Can't punt a Tauren lol
---
I cant imagine any employer would care if your playing a game sick, you're not incapable of moving your fingers because you have a cold.
---
Guess it depends on where you live. For us in Sweden there are barely any 1080 availble from retailers, you gotta get them used. Currently you can get a 2080 rtx for basicly the same price as a new gtx 1080 or a Vega 64/RTX 2070 for 100-150$ less.
---
Damn you really got him man
---
Agree but remember, the game isn’t even “out” yet, so the good content is naturally reliant on streamer VoD’s. These low effort posts will eventually pass as the game is released
---
Lol exactly  Also one of the perks of being a mechanic. Don't want me here anymore ? My tool box has wheels for a reason.
---
just pray you don't play on the same server as &lt;APES&gt;. &lt;APES&gt; is worse then Asmongold will ever be.
---
Just because you were a 1% exception doesn’t mean Rey is anywhere near viable. Back in vanilla people VERY rarely invited them or even if they were I guilds they were forced to heal or be buff slaves. Stop misleading people just because you were a very rare exception.
---
If anything people care more about meters nowadays so I don’t know where you get that thought from.
---
I thinked like that 5 years ago, but now that I know how games are made and have looked at or done graphics for thousands of hours I appreciate how classic wow looks and the gameplay even more.
---
what if.... and hear me out on this
---
someone was *reliable* and *adequately prepared*
---
Im not saying people need to farm to enjoy the game. Im saying people should be allowed to min/max
---
Classic was actually a much simpler time, someone with a low skill level could be the hero of the guild/ raid if they invested in farming. It would be a very rewarding experience if you can supply benefit to the guild/ raid plus do a bit more damage than people with better skill than you merely because you put in the extra effort where you could.
---
Gotta keep in mind that Shard of the Scale is gonna be pretty hotly contested by healers though, and it has to drop in the first place, so SP wouldn't be likely to get prio on it for quite a while. 
---
Thats making the blue dragon card seem quite a bit more attractive, especially if you can get it by yourself outside of a raid setting. I want to be doing as much damage as possible, otherwise why not just bring a healer priest thats spec'd in to weaving? Overcoming the mana issue allows for much higher DPS and at least allows them to somewhat pull their weight.
---
This is the correct answer I believe
---
&gt; Don't the reputation rank go like this: friendly &gt; honored &gt; revered &gt; exalted?
---
Correct  
---
&gt; And the discount will come at exalted?  
---
Incorrect
---
This is a loss. Mulgore, is far superior.
---
Find the black lotus!
---
I can see bear tanks being more popular at lower levels of gear (at least with horde where salvation isn't present and grace of air is iffy, and then fury coming ahead as people become more geared.
---
“Put your pet on follow “
---
Imo that was not representing horde well at all lol.
---
Such pserver baby &lt;3
---
You don't use every rank. In many cases, you only need one or two downranked spells on your bars. There'll be some rank that heals enough to be your economic heal and that's what you use for everyday healing.
---
Surprised at the faction balance to be honest. Maybe I'll go Ally afterall lol. Guess everyone likes how easy Paladin's make the game.
---
Classic wow guild master starter pack: main tank, takes all the loot from other players because he earned it, girlfriend or wife is a healer in the guild but isn’t really good, her character gets all the loot too.
---
Damn, I forgot you had to feed your pet to keep it happy
---
The best guild I was a part of in Vanilla was a big group of guys all from work. We worked at a call center and in between calls or on breaks we would all talk WoW. Made our whole team closer. If someone was bad we talked about things they could do to get better and genuinely help them because we knew if they got better we all got better. Don’t be so socially awkward and none of these things will be an issue. 
---
Shit if we saw someone on while they were out we would just think they’re grinding professions, farming mats, etc and no one gave a damn. No one ever thought to snitch or that it would even matter. 
---
We were all 20-30 year olds, even had a couple of older guys. Even some of the wives got involved.
---
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US
---
there are no paladin mobs in AQ40
---
Still. Thats what he meant with "aged well" i guess. Its still the same engine as 2004.
---
yikes
---
I have disliked all of the Sylvanas models. The faction leader should look like the player race. They should have made her look much more corpse-ey and decomposed (and given forsaken a dead elf option) instead of a blue/pink Elf.
---
well, there is complete list refered to as retail i believe, doesn't quite work out though turns out
---
Never tell your co-workers ever that you play. Whenever they talk about it, just ask questions but never tell them you play aswell.
---
I know. I leveld those classes up to around 40ish so i would get most spells at a steady pace to get familiar with it, and after that i also played around with them on a instant 60 servers. As for the hunter, i dont know really, i dont hate it or anything but i just felt like i would prefer to play something else. Probably a combination of multipla small things. Im still considering a hunter as an alt but its just not the character i want to commit most of my time to.
---
Lol ya you are right, wow &gt;&gt; Med school and stats in an mMo &gt;&gt; camaraderie
---
Gtfo here you cringe neckbeard fuck.
---
You keep trying to sound superior by alluding to some divine understanding of the game, but al of does is illustrate a lack of social acumen that is vastly more important in an mMo (notice the second m is capitalized to emphasize that the game is MULTIplayer )
---
Go back to retail if vanilla is too “simple” for you.
---
Unholy DK'S pets are fine though.
---
It's weird, they feel as if they've been coded entirely differently. All through Legion when i was fairly competitive as an Unholy DK I didn't have to dismiss my pet once in a M+, but would often see hunters body pull with their pets in similar conditions my pet was in.
---
Dude can you go be wrong somewhere else please.
---
It is not an issue in the slightest. Every healing class has a nice "break even" healing spell that will line up roughly with your in-combat mana regeneration.
---
You just spam that shit.
---
If you play a Priest or Druid, you **NEVER** downrank HoTs (or Power Word: Shield.) Only one buff of each type can be applied to a friendly target (so, 1 renew, or 1 rejuv) and which one takes the slot is determined by duration, not effective healing. A rank 1 Renew will overwrite a rank 8 Renew.
---
Healing in Classic required very little co-ordination on the part of healers, but deciding who had the most spell power to HoT the tank was actually pretty important.
---
Staysafe is entertaining, he’s a decent player but not anything spectacular, I don’t think any of the legitimately great warlocks have gotten in yet though
---
In my opinion. No. Plenty of guides to show you which ranks are BIS. Makes it more fun adding another layer of complexity. Actually LESS of a hassle because the down ranked spells can be spammed. The higher rank stuff you need to be careful that you're using it effectively.
---
No, the increased chance to parry should not really make weapon skill more important than it was with parry being at 5.6%.
---
So not like Vanilla then? People who research and get addons (often leveraging social connections) should be rewarded over lazy players who can’t be bothered
---
Still have them in the bank.
---
noh
---

Nah, youll be fine. Theres always spots for dps, dont stress about that
---
Improved drain soul only procs off drain soul ticks, it’s likely not going to be picked up by the majority of players that realize that.
---
That seems more of a bug considering he's cc'd before shadowbolt finishes casting. Which means seduction would've (or I assume should've) been a different batch than the shadowbolt.
---
You're thinking in the wrong mindset.
---
You want classic wow, if you didn't you wouldn't be browsing and posting on this sub. The buyer wants it more than you the seller wants it less. 
---
It's as simple as wanting steak and lobster dinner. Do people want it? Yes, so they buy it. Can some people not afford it, also yes. Is it temporary, yes. So why do they buy it? 
---
Because they will enjoy it for the price they paid and that is worth it to them. Nothing insane at all.
---
Shadow Weaving is pulling your weight. With 4 Warlocks in the raid, their extra 15% is going to beat the DPS you do yourself. But even if you count that as your own, you’re still not going to be near a Rogue or Warrior. That’s why most guilds didn’t bother.
---
Yeah, those definitely do sound like ideas for a game that isn't Classic WoW. Thanks for sharing.
---
I think Hogger and Defias whatever were the biggest killers iirc \^\^
---
Nah, just a rogue REALLY committed to the rp
---
Honestly if you have a group, you could be leveling from 56-60 through dungeons alone couldn't you? I know it may be slower, but if you're going to farm that stuff anyways at 60 for pre raid bis, why not get it ahead of time while getting some xp.
---
True. Shamans will be propably even more popular than rogue.
---
Right, let’s get that instead then.
---
I always had a thing for Feralas
---
You don’t need to get the last hit to get a soul shard. Not that it would matter anyway though because you don’t need many soul shards while leveling
---
It was in the closed Beta server (although as Jaboi said it should be the same)
---
IMO there is absolutely nothing wrong with a tank rolling on dps gear as long as it's not a raid. Tanking is hard work and a lot of responsiblity. If you disagree then that's your prerogative, but be prepared to wait hours for a group because you don't want your tank to get leveling gear.
---
If I work at 12pm and call in sick at 11am I am still able to use a paid sick day for it. I'm confused on what you mean.
---
Classic not so EZ huh?
---
It's a sub that hated the private server community, but mostly needed those people to breathe any life into it.
---
Not even x drive. Must be some alliance pleb
---
iill defently look on  a reddit post where every famous streamer is going \^\^ want to avoide them at all cost
---
I love seeing these kind of posts because it means I can down vote something :\]
---
No thanks. Layering is better.
---
If kill speed is the same then yes. If you can kill mobs more than twice as fast in a party of two then both party members are earning more experience over time than they would alone.
---
More like LH but alright

And if it's the 1.12 iteration of BRE it actually is lol

Armor penetration is a stupidly powerful stat but I don't expect a keyboard warrior with no actual gameplay experience to realize that ;(

No explanation for the broodlord fight? That's so convenient how about that. It's not like you made it out like 2h fury is completely unviable which is just literally untrue.

---
Need to come back when they got level 60 an full t2 gear raid group like back in the day to have a chance
---
&gt; it's quite clear Druids are the least used class for raiding
---
I think Hunters are more useless. 
---
&gt; HoTs is mostly useless if you run multiple druids 
---
There's at least space for like 2 Druids healing. 
---
&gt; Innervate is cool at entry level raiding and dungeons. But fights are so fast now, most people don't run out of mana 
---
When I played Vanilla I used Mana Pots basically on CD on my Priest when we did BWL. I wouldn't have minded Innervate.
---
To be fair Shamans have great TPS/threat generation but yes poor survivability against big hitters. My friend is going shaman tank, just because he wants to have fun and he always talked about how cool it would be if shamans could tank.
---
If the window is 400ms as I've been seeing on this subreddit, it seems fairly inline with what spell batching currently allows I'd think?
---
Which then raises the question of whether a priest can be completely immune to magical crowd control (Poly, Freezing Trap etc) if they just Dispel Magic beforehand.
---
you miss my point entirely. these comments and posts telling people how to play are far to abundant. IF someone CAN and WANTS to min/max and farm all day then what is the problem?
---
idk why you are emphasizing that this is a multiplayer game, for it seems you seem to not understand what that word means. It means you're re gonna come across people who play different and have different views, and thats entirely fine.
---
What implication?
---
Name is Alpharavage with his friend Ashtray. This is definitely a vanilla screenshot, it all checks out.
---
I think they actually came out and gave a "lore" reason for why humans could not be hunters and it was something like they cannot connect to animals or nature or some shit like that.
---
I actually like them capping the number of classes a race could be, made each race more special.
---
Completely unviable? It’s just worse than DW, spergo. Do some basic elementary math. Check out top 5 guilds and see 100% of them DW.

Oh my this was a guild made up of people from my old guild. I can tell you every....single....raid night was like this. I miss this shit and cant wait to go back. Most fun ive ever had (blood fang raiders and Bane some of the most raunchy fucks ive met)
---
No, clearcasting is on a per cast basis for all spells.
---
That word legit awakened memories I didn't know still existed
---
I wasn't I was keeping the Gnome airborne following your punt, get a good volley going.
---
I don't listen to TipsOut. Hes a joke of a player. The difference for raids isn't just tank threat. The dps are doing less damage because dodge chance was off too. Am i making up the dodge chance or are you just wrong. Your just wrong you can even look up the information yourself. Of course speed runs won't change much, they are overgeared for the content!
---
higher weapon skill lowers chance to parry massively 
---
Let’s say you increase your weapon skill by 4.
---
&gt;Against a mob 3 levels higher than you, you get: 0.8% lower chance to miss, 0,4% lower chance to get dodged, 2,4% to be parried, and a 0,8% higher chance to crit. That means a 4,8% net increase.

For example will give you the items with sword skill. **has:defense** for def etc. You can select for slot, type, even the beta phase where the item will be introduced if you want to only look for P1 stuff for starting raid.

So many people got caught up with my differing opinion that you don't call out if you only feel 97% that day that they lost the point, which is the same one you made which I did mention.

It's best to keep your work and home life separate. Whether you claim to be blunt or not, feelings and opinions will form. This isn't "being anxious" or "special snowflakes" or anything like that. It's the same as if you unfollow an IRL friend on social media. You can say it isn't a big deal, but they'll wonder why you are friends IRL but you decided they are no longer worth following.

Really? its just im hearing alot of like if you want a raid spot go shaman and stuff haha
---
I dont understand. youre gonna need more of it.

Why would they have to take away the unarmored mounts if they added them? Why not just have both unarmored and armored versions of the mounts available at launch?  Both versions are classic.
---
What I was going to say.

Graphic sliders still exist though so you don’t get that control? I am not for modern graphics but that argument makes no sense,

Better that than a retail baby &lt;3 look forward to you quitting 3 months after Classic release

Play a pserver and test out some classes and stuff for classic

I was playing boomie in MoP and boomie/spriest in WoD, best times for pvp for me personally. But I haven't stopped playing since I started in January 2005

Yeah, but youll get a raid spot as a rogue aswell. People like to talk about it as it was always a huge competition, but its not. Usually guilds have the people they need and who they can trust, and those will be accepted in raids.
---
Ah gnome volleyball, the sport of kings

My point was that a good economy is relative for every individual. A "good" overall economy is not good for every individual, it just means wealth is being created for someone, specifically the 1% at the moment. If you're a student or a worker lower on the rung things are not good.
---
sounds really good actually.

Those are not enough, need turn based combat too and multiple dialogue choices with completely different outcomes to get a different game ending.

Doesn't work on Classic. In-game friends list can see you. Then you made it even more awkward once they realize why you're appearing offline.

---
So add your coworkers on battle.net because you are an adult and you can handle it.
---
&gt; I think Hunters are more useless. 
---
My point still stands. Change it to one of the least used, paired with hunters. 
---
&gt; There's at least space for like 2 Druids healing. 
---
Hence why I said 1-2 druids.
---
&gt; When I played Vanilla I used Mana Pots basically on CD on my Priest when we did BWL. I wouldn't have minded Innervate. 
---
That's 15\~ years ago, when basically nobody knew their class/itemization good enough to be able to do close to double the DPS people do now or stacking mages/warriors to the point where they make up for almost half the raid. Many kills/clears are 1/3rd the time of what they used to be. 
---
My point is that to some extent, even the average player will go for BiS lists and what not, which is going to make him perform better than back then. Innervate sure as hell isn't as 'godlike' as people make it out to be. Especially not after the initial start of raiding. It still has its uses, just like CR, but rarely anything more than convenience.
---
Yeah, undisclosed loot expectations can do that. If a protection warrior and a holy paladin are in a group with no plate or mDPS, if they haven't agreed on something before hand, they have equal priority on off-spec gear.
---
I’m sorry for being offended by some neckbeard trying to sound condescending and superior in a fucking video game.
---
I will make sure to patronize anyone who tries to sound like an expert while doing my best to make sure their stupid ass opinions are validated.
---
Ok? Another reminder that BfA is totally a thing for people who want a “challenge” since vanilla is a game from a “simpler time”
---
I don't think you can say that it is the same engine, obviously there have been a lot of upgrades and changes in the past 15 years.
---
But regardless I agree that the old zones look pretty great considering how old the game is!
---
!RemindME 70 days
---
Hopefully Blizzard is retarded and shrinks the batches and leeway mechanics.  Stay tuned!
---
Locks are doing around 600 DPS each on average there in MC. Assuming they have a Shadow Priest already, reducing that figure by 15% puts them at 510 DPS each. If we take the 4 warlocks, that's 360 extra DPS on top of the Priests DPS which is an average of 300 DPS from the same site in the same raid (though it varies heavily, with some priests pulling 500+ DPS) so if we take the lowball figure of 300 and add it to the 360, it actually put the priest at higher effective DPS than just bringing another Warlock.
---
Well vanilla is pre-flood. So yeah. But it really does shimmer. Hurts my eyes in a good way.
---
Curious on peoples experience tanking  higher end content as a tauren vs. other races? With the larger hitbox I've noticed leveling as a tauren to be a lot easier to position mobs who run away. For people unaware, taurens have a 7 yard effective hitbox, meaning when a mob runs to you, they still go the default 5 yard distance (regardless of race), but as a tauren you have 2 yards now to move, before the mob follows / repositions. This can make it better/worse depending on the situation, but overall I feel like it'll be a lot more forgiving for new players, as slight movements wont cause mobs to slingshot around your hitbox nearly as bad as they do with other races. (I believe males are 2-2.5 yards, and females are 1 extra yard, I'm unsure the exact size increase on tauren bears / if it's the same as unformed)
---
This person is obviously trolling to make the people who want spell batching removed sound ridiculous. 
---
If you think there is nothing wrong with how spell batching is working in the Beta, go mine for an hour or two and see if you still think that. Their emulation of spell batching is not accurate, and should be removed unless they are properly able to recreate vanilla spell batching.
---
In other hand, I will never team up again with a tank rolling a need on damage dealer gear when there is someone in the team who can benefit from it (even I am not playing a plate wearer/damage dealer), even if it's a leveling dungeons. Nobody should never waste their time with those tanks. It's like "Oh, it's just leveling gear" to "I need it for my off-Arms for PvP/off-Fury for anything else."
---
OP. did you just flat out speed run?
---
did you bother with professions at all?
---
Damn. Pservers were the driving force for this to happen, yet people love to shit on them now that classic is actually coming. Get over yourself.
---
it's from MOP but lol
---
I actually tried this setup (exact talents and with pre-raid BiS gear/enchants) on my bropack personal server.  It actually works pretty well in my very basic testing so far (no dungeons or raids because it's a personal server, no one else to play with).  I was mostly testing it out on EPL undead and demon mobs, and while very crit dependent, I was taking down things very quickly.  I also find it pretty fun.  
---
If anyone has any suggestions to further test this, I'd be happy to report results.  I can also create equivalently geared 60s from other classes to test against as a standard.
---
What? That comment doesnt make sense. He said that people shouldnt have asked for OG spell batching without knowing what that actually means. And he is right, because a lot of the stuff people complain about was like that in Vanilla. Whether or not spell batching is working 100% like it should.
---
Not an issue, you can reset while inside dungeons and the game will place you back at the start of the dungeon. You just can't do it the exact way its done on private servers because they got it wrong.
---
This is not 0.2 seconds (200ms). This is between 0.6-0.8 seconds (600-800ms) I also never said this was a bug, which you clearly think I stated. I said that the batching window is too big, which is not a bug, its designed poorly.
---
Yeah 1-20 go balance for natural weapons. That 2-10% makes a huge difference IMO. Respec to to feral at 20 for movement speed talent.
---
Learning 2h axes requires 10s and a trip to Orgrimmar, and I'm pretty sure in Vanilla that you needed to be lvl 10 to learn anything from another race's weapon master. Seems like a lot to ask of someone to use a reward from a lvl 4 quest.
---
"And let's go back to the action in the Swamp of Sorrows..."
---
"Uh, yeah Bob I'm out here in the Swamp of Sorrows and we are on hour 3 of Nofear the Undead Warrior farming jaguars. He is really just going to town out here today. He's been making a good loop and his average time to kill is, by my estimation, a solid 2.9 seconds per jaguar. The man is a machine, I think in the next half hour or so we could see him head back to Stonard to sell his greys, and then he'll be faced with the tough decision of either going back to Org to auction his greens or trying to run some more with his limited bag space. I'll keep you updated."
---
"Thanks, Bob"
---
As long as you know what your most mana efficient heal is (mana conversion into health healed) you're fine. That is the groundwork being laid and you can build off that from there.
---
For Druids its Rank 4 Healing Touch. Thats mostly all you're going to cast. There are times when you want a bigger heal or a NS heal or something. But as long as you know what your most efficient heal is you'll learn on your own when that heal is not enough or too much healing.
---
I recommend not playing Priest if you're hyper concerned about too many ranks of healing spells on your bars. They have the widest healing tool kit in the game. The other healers are more limited in their options.
---
I had these on my Hunter in vanilla. Was really good actually, plus the proc was amazing turning into a giant tiger. 
---
Then my account got hacked when I was on hiatus and they deleted or vendored them :(
---
Still have mine on retail. On the rare occations i log in and play for a little, its great fun to get the procc and then using the Mirror from MoP-Dread Wastes to stick the appearance for 10 minutes.
---
how am i trying to sound like an expert? I keep saying let people play how they want to play....

If you are in Naxx I would hope the group is running ML, loot council, or DKP. If you are running the master loot for years just waiting until the corrupted Ashbringer drops, I would be seriously impressed by the audacity (as long as I wasn't raiding with you).
---
Yeah its a little uncomfortable at times honestly. A lot of the non-human races sometimes feel like stereotyped magical minority groups which is not great. I really hate that they doubled down on the Native American stereotypes when they redesigned Baines model.

wasn't lfg gear reward added after wrath? anyway you didn't mentiom flying which should be extremely limited or non existent imo

Warriors actually have similar mechanics in the arms tree regarding two-handed melee weapons. 
---
Sword Spec gives a 5% chance to get a second swing, Mace spec is a 6% chance to trigger a 3-second stun, Axe spec is +5% crit, and polearm spec is also a +5% crit.
---
It's apparently not official. https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/16/chinas-massively-illegal-world-of-warcraft-theme-park
---
Interesting thought, I honestly never downranked in Vanilla and onward.
---
When I was playing a private server and healing Deadmines I was going oom in like 10 Holy Lights on my Paladin. I got told to downrank which I had forgotten about. Afterward I did some testing and the highest rank I had was the most Health per mana. Guess it makes more of a difference at higher levels or maybe the private server was off a little?
---
Anyway at least there are less spells I think in Vanilla so I can make use of my empty hot keys.
---
how does asmon have 11k hp?
---
Whenever a staff member tells me that I assume they are faking a sick day.

Pretty easy guess it's by far the most aesthetically pleasing. I also play blood elf except my female goblin I made as a joke with some friends

For some fucking reason I read 2011 :'(
---
A couple trying it out of raiders, and a few socials will. I’ve been a bit disappointed with the uptake. Lots of vanilla vets in there not interested at all.
---
There's definitely better things to bring, but filling 40 people relatively fast is better than getting an optimized group with the added time it takes to form it.
---
In my experience, getting a pug raid spot as a nightfall bot/spriest/feral druid isn't very difficult. Definitely more rejection than some other classes/specs, but not really tough at all.
---
Maybe, I'm not used to what exist now, is there a good one to test classes while waiting for august ?
---
I almost did this. Thank you fornthe advice.
---
IIRC, if you had the money, you could learn the skills at any level. You will run into many leveling quests that will give rewards you can't use or have need to use (like mail gloves for a clothie)
---
Truly the greatest of pastimes, before it was watered down and made pedestrian with the introduction of Goblin ball's, twas a dark era for the short of kings.
---
His ass.
---
True, if every healer sends a quick heal on a tank they will be full health faster than a holy light cast everytime.
---
12k tanks  will only appear in naxx tho. ive only seen people have 8k or something along those lines in earlier content. Feel free to post a screenshot, to prove me wrong, id like to see.
---
On my original server one of the highest geared tanks was able to  get 20k hp when he popped last stand and BWL trinket. Cool times. :3
---
Pretty much. No professions - I knew exactly where I wanted to be at any given time. I'll be changing a lot in the next run though.

Fair enough. I'd just like to offer an alternative opinion, which is that for people like myself who aren't familiar with mage gameplay, his commentary of which spells he's using etc is actually quite informative and useful. But I can totally see how it wouldn't be too amazing for someone who knows the class/game really well and can follow exactly what's going on.
---
I’m currently levelling every vanilla class to 20 on retail to see how they all play. The gameplay is great from a class design standpoint, but everything is so face roll and easy it’s not got much substance!
---
Oh that seems really dark though
---
Genuine question here. I'm planning on playing a Paladin primarily as a healer, but building and maintaining a tank set for 5-mans and AoE grinding. How should I go about discussing with/arranging groups to have a shot at tank gear without stepping on toes?
---
It doesnt matter that much ofc. But you shouldnt think that nihilum minmaxed like todays guilds. Most of those character were made day one, no one knew shit about any raid or just not much about the game in general, and in vanilla you didnt just reroll, today maybe you would regardless of how long it takes but back in the day there werent even enough quests to get to 60, very few people would be willing to reroll, i guess pretty much anyone on nihilum made their character based on looks or MAYBE some did based on what racials sounded good to them, so if you wanted to tank tauren seemed like the obvious choice.
---
Haha yaaaaa mon’

But you can't ignore everything that was wrong with private servers, we know what they did wrong and what was innacurate, we got to point these things out. For a better classic release, so keep shitting on private servers! But in a good way lol
---
You need people like me to kill
---
You can make a macro and have it only take up one action bar slot instead of 3 if you need space and just have the macro function depending on if you are holding shift or control or neither.  And set the base button press to do let’s say the max rank  and if you are holding shift it will cast whichever down ranked version of that spell and if you want a third you can do it if you are holding control.       However if space isn’t a issue you can do the same thing but with just keybind instead of a macro

5% parry is really strong at early levels imo. You take less damage, and get more sped attacks which = more rage and damage.

Congrats, you're level 5.

I'd be surprised if they invented this new technology and stopped using it after two weeks. Especially if there are overpopulation issues. I expect that there will be servers where layering is persistent until at least Phase 2 if not indefinitely, for one reason or another. 
---
Have you ever seen these kinds of things work in accordance with the initial intentions and promises? 
---
We always have this phase where everything sounds good. Too often I've seen a batch of unintended consequences crop up later that really never get addressed because Company X has moved on and considers it good enough.
---
It reduces 0,04% chance to dodge/parry/miss per weapon skill and anyway your only piece of gear that increases sword skill is lvl50 mail gloves.
---
I like Swifty, his fanbase can be irritating but he doesn't seem like a dick like Soda or Asmongold. Though to be fair I very rarely watch any streamers.

Yeah I've never really speed ran on alliance so I dont know how the times compare.
---
&gt; You will run into many leveling quests that will give rewards you can't use or have need to use (like mail gloves for a clothie)
---
This is true, but this quest is a little different - it offers a selection of 5 weapons, so it's sort of an "everyone gets something useful" quest. It's just that one of the options isn't super useful without a lot of extra work one way or another, and I'm just wondering if that is deliberate or a bug or what.

---
This is correct.  I took an auction mule over to learn how to sword at level 5 I think it was.
---
Where did you pull the 2x as hard figure from? How do you know how under/overtuned the bosses are?
---
Guess we dont live on the same planet.
---
Right, thats why druids are by far the best tanks amirite?
---
I have never played before, so tempting to pick it up.
---
There propably was a lot wrong, but they did still have the most accurate info that was available. If a guy says that ”private servers had this and this”, its still not any less relevant info than saying ”I remember it being like this and this”, quite the opposite actually. They were very close on almost everything, and used all possible resources to get the experience to be as close to the authentic one, even though they would fail in some things. But yeah. Not trying to argue actually, just came to say that private servers were important to start this! Cheers
---
You are ignoring trolls which are better than both.
---
I’ve seen so many people post about how they have already booked time off work. An early release or a delay (please no) would cause utter chaos
---
Wasn't a hassle.  Just happens naturally.  If you run out of mana in raids, then you down rank until it works.  As you get better gear (also depends on fight), you raise the rank if the fight and your team allows for it to work.  
---
Much easier than most think.  Basically a trial and error thing.
---
That's kinda what I was figuring
---
&gt; I get the feeling you have very low reading comprehension
---
&gt; But again, not the best reading comprehension apparently.
---
I get the feeling you are not capable of arguing your point, that's why you resort to petty insults. I almost feel sorry for you. Your points get debunked, your system destroyed, and instead of picking up whats left of your grace and leave, you stand here, basically insulting yourself.
---
&gt;is objectively a garbage guild
---
From what I read here, the only guilds you ever joined are the typical wannabe-hardcore guilds with "aspirations of greatness" that fell apart 3 weeks later. No good guild functions the way you describe. Progressive casual guilds are not asocial, and actual pro guilds don't use such absurd loot systems.
---
&gt;. I'm sorry you weren't privileged enough to play during the golden age of WoW and think that anything after WotLK was even halfway decent.
---
Sorry, I just had to laugh :D
---
The only Vanilla you ever experienced was from an ice cream vending machine. You played on pirated servers, with shitty data and judging from your behaviours shittier admins. You quite obviously never played Vanilla, because the insults you use are the typical Pserver nonsense, the assumptions you have about guilds and loot are contrary to the social system on Vanilla.
---
I played the real deal sunshine, all the way from my first steps in Tirisfal to the clear of Naxxramas. All you have, are fake memories, from fake servers.
---
Good bye, I will not be hearing from you again.
---
The Hyjal wall-walk jump definitely works still. We haven’t tested other zones.
---
You should still be able to get value from it, as a lock/priest combo you'll very rarely be pulling single mobs, rather 2-4 to take advantage of multidotting, there'll definitely be opportunities to score some spirit tap procs.
---
Of the reasons for feeling shame, being glutonous and unattractive is one of the most valid ones.
---
How is a warrior when everyone has crappy gear? I plan on hitting 60 within 2-3 weeks so nobody is going to have good gear and I imagine being able to tank means I can get my t0 set quicker. Are warriors good even when everyone has crappy gear or do they just do scale well with gear?
---
It was Drek'thar.
---
I keep getting excited about classic. And I keep having to remind myself it won’t be the same as before. I was 18 then with nothing else to do but play and wait to start college. 
---
I’ll be lucky if I can get 5-10 hours in a week playing. But I still really want to play and I’m still so excited for August.
---
That's the thing. E-sports and sports in general.. most people watching aren't pros, aren't top-level contenders, so having play-by-play, while a more casual viewing experience, is what the majority of people watching can relate with. I totally get it, I just miss the old days I guess.
---
That is true also. The hardest thing was actually to find 40 people to get in a raid.
---
Same lol
---
You Sir, knows exactly how it works! 👍🏼
---
Also remember that manual use to say Dwarfs could be mages
---
This image speaks volumes of how I have perceived wow for the past decade.  I still love the game, and have great hopes that the community comes back as it was in the beginning!
---
Classic raids will be a LOT easier due to the fact that bosses on private servers have way too much HP &amp; armor, they hit harder than they are supposed to and use their abilities far too often. 
---
If Blizzard truly sticks to nochanges then Classic raiding will be a complete joke.
---
I think its greater than 0.04 for parry since the blue post confirming 14% chance to parry, the reductions on chance to parry would be larger.
---
Also while you could get the +7 mail gloves, hungering cold from kelthuzad is +6, while BWL has a +4 
---
a human with the gloves and hungering cold could get up to 318, putting them 3 above the bosses defense skill. This would greatly increase threat and mitigation (due to less parry haste)
---
Nah the entrance should be the Dark Portal.
---
I'm from Denmark (; 
---
But what I mean is that the price for an upgrade isn't worth it for what you get. The 1080 is a solid high tier card - I still have the 1070 and will skip this gen of GPUs as everything still runs 144 fps in 1080p ultra settings ^^ 
---
Hos CPU tho could use a hefty bump as WoW is CPU intensive more so than GPU
---
That's a 500 KP minus!
---
Right but the principle of your argument falls apart.
---
[**Patch 1.6.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.6.0) **(12-Jul-2005):** Design changed. **Bloodthirst** is now an instant melee attack that causes damage equal to 30% of the warrior's attack power. In addition, the next 5 successful melee attacks will restore health. 
---
[**Patch 1.6.1**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.6.1) **(02-Aug-2005):** Damage bonus increased to 40% of attack power.
---
Totally agree man, yeah not trying to argue as well. Private servers are why we are all here and they were pretty damn accurate. They had some things that were innacurate and I think it's good we point that out so we can help make create a better classic release. But I see where you're coming from, let's all enjoy some classic this summer. Have a good one, man!
---
he has 1.9k on his stream right now. The MC increases his health
---
By describing vanilla as a “simpler time” or however you put it, you are putting a negative connotation to vanilla players.
---
By putting this negative connotation on vanilla players in such a way, you are alluding to players of other iterations of the game somehow being more “complex” and therefore superior somehow.
---
This conclusion requires the assumption that there is somehow a “proper way” to play that was lost on the “simple” vanilla players.
---
Now, you are agreeing that there is NOT a proper way to play an MMO, but you have not revoked your original negative description of vanilla.
---
Trying to compare the “simplistic” vanilla to any other iteration of the game leads me to believe you are a retail shill, trying to validate yourself as a superior player because the game is not “simple” anymore.
---
If you somehow meant no negative connotation by using the word “simple” in the context that you did, then I assume you were referring to game mechanics in vanilla vs other iterations.
---
If THIS is what you meant, then you are just wrong, and imprecise with your language.
---
I will get all the aggro.
---
I've heard its each tick as well.
---
I know I remember this from old forum posts that are not related to private servers.
---
Congrats on level 5! ;)  
---
Well the guides is ment to show people in what order they should do the quests and what you have to do.
---
If you nearly maxed out on OSRS, then vanilla is going to be frickin easy for you lol
---
The only real difference at the end game is that if you want to become the best you can be (in regards to gear), then you need to schedule time slots for raiding.  
---
In OSRS, it is a massive grind, but you can do it at your own pace.  In WoW, if you want to raid, then you might need to join a guild that schedules 2-5 day raiding schedules (typically 2.5-5 hours each day) depending on how serious you want to be and how quickly you want to clear content.
---
I'm gonna duo with a friend. He's going Warrior-tank. I'm going healbot paladin all the way.     
---
Mages/Warlocks/Priests/Druids are probably not going to like me. If I'm healing dungeons you bet your ass I'm going to be rolling on any cloth/leather/mail gear that's going to improve my ability to heal.
---
Ew.
---
I don't know about you, but I don't add people ingame that I already have on bnet, seems pretty redundant. Seems like to figure out why they're appearing offline you have to already suspect they're appearing offline.
---
I hate talking to morons.
---
What if it were released in the same content patch that they release naxx in?
---
Like garmebin said, per point it is 0.04% less of a chance to dodge/parry/miss and 0.04% increased chance to crit. So only considering parry chance, the fact that parry chance is 14% and not 5.6% would only matter if you had more than 440 weapon skill.
---
Whether or not they've got weapon skills to level.
---
Holy shit, he came back.
---
Cross Realm BGs really damaged my PvP experience on my server. We were lucky enough to have a balanced population and so the queues weren't particularly bad. All it did for us was eradicate rivalries and relationships by replacing known allies and enemies with strangers who we'd never see again.
---
Me too! His insults were always amusing. 
---
Also, I think it’s kind of sweet how he cares for Sylvanas.
---
MC will get cleared within 1 week of Classic release. Much faster than on any private server.
---
Orcs coming over to Mulgore get a 2h axe is my guess.
---
Night Elf Priest, Decked in PvP rares, surrounded by Grand Marshalls because you were the best lumber mill defender in the game... I feel this screenshot.
---
Man, I am so sick of seeing people say this crap.  Not everyone has your mindset... a lot of people enjoy being efficient and getting past the early grind. 
---
I loved vanilla, but I hated the leveling process.  I enjoyed raiding, but grinding a second 60 was not something I ever wanted to even imagine doing.  I hated leveling up, but the end game goal is what kept me going and it was more than worth it.
---
I just want it how it was in vanilla.
---
I still dont understand the topic completly, feels like everyone says sth else and no one has an idea \^\^  
---
I just wanna know if the +5 weapon skills are so important to actually consider a human tank, or is just a nice touch?
---
i dont like humans so much :x
---
Fuck yes. And that music please.
---
level 25 in 82 minutes??
---
Mulgore is Colorado. I love it. It even has a Red Rocks reference
---
Hello Vandrel. You never provided me the source for the spell damage paladin working better. Did you miss my post, asking for the source?
---
It was. I remember saying it was shiet. And I remember that sometime in wotlk they made it like an execute and we locks were happy we could use the spell more than gaining shards.
---
I took off the 3 days after release day and I’m off work 2 hours before it goes live. I would be livid.
---
Holy Nostalgia.  This is basically the first image I associated with WoW.
---
Yea i get you thanks man, making it easier to pick now haha think ill just stick rogue
---
No, but OPs child may be, which would require extra financial contributions.
---
Why dont you ask yourself the real question: Am I an asshole? Why?
---
They’re offended by everything, ashamed of nothing.
---
Right, but once seduction is applied that should be a batch finishing shouldn't it? Because everything is processed in the single batch, then applied, so like if a mage finished casting sheep, the target wouldn't be sheeped until the batch with that sheep action or whatever you want to call it is processed.        
---
The way I thought it should work, or should? be unless I'm misunderstanding batches.  
---
Batch X [ Seduction ] (Nothing else finished during this batch) -&gt; Batch X processed and Seduction applied -&gt; Batch X+1 [ Shadowbolt ] (Shadowbolt finished casting after seduction was already applied on the shaman hence that should? mean the previous batch was done) -&gt; Batch X + 1 processed
---
cool ideas except weapon speeds should vary for all types just due to the nature of the game or maces would win out hugely, especially with splash.
---
Correct. There’s a pre-scourge version of him in Caverns of Time - Durnholde.
---
Priests actually can just spam smite on the mobs that drop the eye for the benediction quest.  I remember priests typically being one of the best classes to do this thanks to holy damage being so effective.  
---
Other than that, you might want to run live strat runs for righteous orbs, since getting/starting a group will be relatively quick for you.
---
&gt; You can only do so much without rewriting everything. 
---
No? You can do literally anything possible in software usually without rewriting *everything*. If you have an AMD or Intel CPU in your PC you are running code that was written 50+ years ago.
---
Spell Batching seems way off yes. The window is too big right now. Even if Blizzard were to confirm that this is how it was back in vanilla it is not a good design decision for todays internet speed and response. One reason why this was implemented was to make players on an uneven (slow) connections to be treated more on equal ground. Today this is not that important because the technology of our time is a lot better.
---
I don't want them to remove spell batching, but to reduce the window of it to display what you see on the screen as true to what is happening in the background. if what you see on your screen happen not to be true, it is not good for the players impression of the situation and the game.
---
Well it's supposed to counter what defense skill does, wowpedia etc list it as exactly that. You'd still likely want to use thunderfury so you'd cap at 314.
---
And the increased parry chance vs private servers still won't make dw tanking unviable, if anything it's better to go dw for the extra threat you're going to need.
---
&gt;Icy environments such as Winterspring grant a buff that increases your fire damage dealt by 10% and decreases frost damage dealt by 10%.  
---
&gt;Firey environments such as Burning Steppes grant a buff that increases your frost damage dealt by 10% and decreases fire damage dealt by 10%.
---
I think the frost mobs have lower fire resistance and higher frost resistance so it's kind of already in the game, same for fire.
---
I get off two hours after it goes live and I’m seriously considering taking the 3 days off. But if I do I won’t book it till the start of August as a precaution. 
---
Good luck and happy farming on launch!
---
I wouldn't. They said it's something they'd like to implement into retail to deal with player complaints about lack of cohesion, except there it would be permanent.
---
&gt;I expect that there will be servers where layering is persistent until at least Phase 2 if not indefinitely, for one reason or another. 
---
Literally never. Again, they have been utterly strenuous about never allowing multiple instances of world bosses. Layering will *never* go into Phase 2. They're well aware of the actually legitimate problems that would cause with Azuregos and Kazzak.
---
&gt;Have you ever seen these kinds of things work in accordance with the initial intentions and promises? 
---
Yes. In fact, despite this nonsense people peddle about Blizzard, they're very regularly true to their word when they in fact give their word. The problem with retail is not Blizzard breaking promises that the playerbase asked them to fulfill. The problem is that Blizzard *fulfilled* the promises the playerbase *asked for*, and the playerbase just so happens to be full of shortsighted, loudmouthed chucklefucks who slowly destroyed their own game by asking for QoL after QoL after QoL. They wanted easier and easier raids and groups with less reliance on guilds, faster gear, more mounts, every spec to be equally viable, no need to talk to others, no competition for resources or mobs, no item micromanagement, etc. And they screeched about this like the egotistical lunatics they were for years on end as Blizzard capitulated over and over to them. And surprise, it turns out that their collective desire to be lazy, minimally invested Skinner Box junkies turned retail WoW into a glorified mobile arpg.
---
But don't ever mistake that for Blizzard not keeping promises. Blizzard kept promises all the way through to a fault, chasing after the loudest consumers and providing exactly what they asked for. My mistrust of Blizzard stems from their *inability* to ignore the autistic cacophony, not from empty promises. When they make promises, I typically believe them, because they have a good track record of keeping promises even if those promises are devastating both to their company and to their consumer base.
---
Blizzard promised in no uncertain terms that layering can never be in the game past Phase 1. I believe them when they say this.
---
this is the law from now on
---
Fury tank will be more viable in Classic than it ever was on Pservers.
---
And that's what you're getting. World of Warcraft v1.12. A close as it can be recreated. One of the many sub-versions of the original world of Warcraft before any expansion.
---
You too brother!
---
1) "Will stun resist or HP be better for tanking?"
---
2) "HP will always be better for tanking" 
---
3) Dumbfuck remark taking a question response out of context of the question to construct their own superiority.
---
Hi, /u/MadCXP
---
&gt; So not like Vanilla then?
---
Yes and no.
---
Yes, there were addons in Vanilla. 
---
No, they weren't the same addons as today and people weren't as well-connected as they are today. 
---
Also, lol if you think getting addons requires social connections these days. 
---
In the grand scheme of things, I think forbidding all addons is closer to the actual WoW 15 years ago than not forbidding them is.
---
Yea well, we can't be a true noob again if we already experienced the ever living crap out of it back then.  If the game was truly new to me, then I wouldn't be looking at or into anything to begin with.  
---
There is no 'unknown' to me anymore, other than having to get use to certain mechanics again, but that isn't going to take too long.
---
you mean to be blizz-like? you're acting like it will be 1/10th of the 2004 batching, it won't be, so nice try using a comeback with fake facts?
---
Feralas, especially the part with the towering cliffs and the path near the sea
---
There were absolutely shittons of addons in vanilla, some of which are so powerful they are being banned in classic for making the game to easy. Not sure you raided in classic.
---
MANY WHELPS
---
The fact that we are brought up in a society which inherently deems fitness and normal body weight more desirable.
---
Case in point: how many "sex sells" ads are there with types girl 1 vs. girl 2 in that meme?
---
You are literally just doing the "its a prank bro" defense.
---
My partner is playing warlock as well and I was considering going priest but honestly it was so boring. Everyone kept telling me about the great synergy but I found way more joy playing the class I wanted than trying to complement her class. 
---
Just play whatever you wish to play the most because in classic every class will bring unique strengths to the party it doesn't matter in the end what you choose.
---
Of course it is
---
I’m against it as well because it’s not implemented correctly.
---
no lfg gear was implemented with the lfg feature... true, forgot flying...
---
WHAT
---
THE
---
FUCK
---
Only played the first 3. Seems about right.
---
It’s was only for the first round of stress tests. You will have to be invited back to get into the next one.
---
I never raided ZG back in classic but I can’t wait for a second chance at it. Especially the mount. The tiger is still the coolest mount in the game imo.
---
Well thanks to Blizzard's complete destruction of the current game.. there is no longer merit in any world firsts apart from mythic+ raiding.. and even then.. who really gives a flying crap anymore?
---
Yea, world firsts will have some merit again in classic.  Wont be as much as before, but this is a new start with new people reaching these goals.
---
up until a few months ago this sub was all about the private server community and mostly p server players. the hate is all recent with the influx of twitch fans.
---
...
---
Okay stop dots.
---
Wonder what he sounds like when he's screaming at traffic.
---
Imagine complaining about how a mechanic isn't fully tuned correctly during the "we know it's broken we are fixing it" phase of the game known as a "beta". But despite all that, making a post to complain about a time window that surely won't exist whether you posted or not... 2019 folks
---
&gt;It's already in the game, warrior talents
---
Sort of yeah
---
7 and 8 are whelp groups.
---
Answer the question, pretty please.
---
True. Always worth reaching out. That’s part of what makes this game great.
---
Well, the quest pathing and locations are all the same, so are node placements.  With that in mind, you can practice moving much faster and making more vendor gold.
---
I love priest, that's always been my class.  Just always leveled solo.  So that's why I'm playing it.  Sorry if I implied otherwise
---
https://challonge.com/j0t1yy2c There you go
---
Every private server player is saying that leveling is a joke because mobs have less armor/hp.
---
I remember the pic now because i remember thinking the same thing :-)
---
“StOP HaViNg FuN tHE WrONG WaY”
---
You left out the 2018 pic with no one in it at all and just s ton of npcs everywhere
---
This is the correct move. If you can't even flex on your normie co-workers, then why did you even bother grinding the rank 11 Black War Raptor?
---
&gt; If you somehow meant no negative connotation by using the word “simple” in the context that you did, then I assume you were referring to game mechanics in vanilla vs other iterations.
---
its impossible for vanilla not to be a simpler game, due to the time it came out and the limitations of technology of the time.
---
I am not a retail shill, i actually have enjoyed each expac less and less. But aside from pvp, the skill floor is much lower in vanilla. Vanilla can have a high skill ceiling, but again this can only be explored if someone were to min/max.
---
putting it another way, vanilla most absolutely requires less actions per minute than retail on average. In retail healers are expected to do much more for example, often rotations include some DPS.
---
When i say vanilla is simpler it doesnt mean it is easy, but with simpler mechanics it allows for the casual to shine through, which i would argue makes min/maxing much more desirable, there is nothing "hard" about farming for gear.
---
for example as a warrior who wants to tank, i am trying to get to 60 ahead of the curve so i can farm ironfoe, this will be fun for me, as i can most likely do many runs and allow me to socialize more and work on certaint tactics. I can also when not farming dungeons just farm materials and zombie out in a sense.
---
IMO this is the charm of wow classic, it rewards the less skilled players that just put in the effort. I have also never viewed RPGs as a game that require high skill. However classic will have that in the form of PVP. Retail has added pve content that requires more skill, such as mythic and mythic+ and that is fine.
---
but lets not sit hear and tell people how to play Classic will have its own challenges, such as the organization requirements and grindy nature of the game. Simple doesnt always mean bad, infact it almost never means bad... there are many games that at its core have very simplistic mechanics but still offer challenging and rewarding play.
---
It was supported when it was just an excel spreadsheet when it moved to a full on site it was moved to not being stickied.
---
The mod's of course have to be careful that nothing is seen or becomes favouritism towards certain members.
---
Like This?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRKfy\_lcxu0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRKfy_lcxu0)
---
because it's not. molten core is a beginner raid where rag is the only challenging boss fight. after mc you need everyone to pull their own weight when you're starting out. no room for joke specs on razorgore and vael, and that's just for bwl. the deeper you go in the raid tiers, the less wiggle room there is.
---
people that talk about classic raiding being easy are either talking about molten core trash or when they're overgeared for a raid. private servers aren't even worth considering. they aren't accurate at all.
---
Kansas City??
---
Looking that the thumb Nail for this i thought it was Esfand.
---
Nah, think Mulgore still wins this one!
---
the batching window's need to be reduced drastically, at least by half, sometimes it seems so inconsistent with its timing
---
Preach is one of the biggest wow content creators and is going to run a stream guild
---
Remove gear - equip gear, pop berserk while running in / getting heals seems like the simplest way to maximize berserk at the beginning of a fight.
---
Perhaps take a glance of the subreddit before posting? There's three of these threads in top 20.
---
Dun Morogh, always
---
How? Parry chance is going to be way higher on Classic. fury tank is already squishy as is. With parry haste they are gonna drop even quicker (im not saying fury tank is impossible, just more so rare)
---
So Humans are needed even more than NEs? Thank you for representing my opinion
---
Onyxia same as Vael xD
---
You are not making sense. Learn to read.
---
Azshara, or Feralas.  Close but Azshara's solitude made it more special, just to sit near the beach and listen to the ocean and get the sense you're deep in history.
---
Hi, /u/Qwertykeybaord
---
I can't say if it's right or wrong, but how is people going mining going to change their mind if it works correctly or not? Its been around 13 or so years. I sure wouldn't remember the exact nitty gritty parts, and I'm sure many don't either (see: people thinking dungeons were harder than they were, bosses doing incorrect damage).      
---
There's gotta be some proof that people can say hey THIS is a video from original vanilla with how batching worked, and this OTHER video (or clip) is from current beta and it's not working correctly.
---
Yea I definitely get that . It seems most are practicing now to get ahead of the rush which makes sense . I was super casual (like weekends only ) for Vanilla , didn’t even hit 60 until the first week or so of TBC . So I think or hope I can get some new feeling.
---
TBC healing wasn't too far off from vanilla.  You want mana pots, you need to focus almost entirely on mana management (spell downranking still the same) and it is a lot slower pace than wrath and beyond. 
---
As for druids... sadly they aren't quite the same level as a priest in vanilla in regards to healing, but they are wanted in raids due to innervate and battle rez either way.
---
That's the logical thing based on the evidence, is this confirmed tho?
---
Bobby B would kick ass in classic.
---
Definitely not my initial experience 1-20 as druid. I did 1-20 in nine hours easily on private servers. Took 10.45 hours on beta and I'm not sure what I can do to reduce that time. I did however find some mobs 20-30 range that seemed to have little to no armor which I will abuse to level quicker (I did however report this in the bug tracker in case it's not meant to be that way).
---
lmao same
---
Bosses won’t do nearly as much damage in Classic as they do on private servers.
---
Amazing project and Congrats!
---
Have you guys considered adding the option to register yourself as a player who didn't play back in the day? It would be nice for us players who started at a later expansion and are looking for a community to adopt them
---
It was sticked for a long time when it first came out. They took it down to make room for other posts, but I agree it’s been a long time coming back
---
Because you are pretending two seperate things are the same. 
---
Google conflating and come back.
---
It was never his responsibility to teach anyone why what they were begging for was a mixed bag.
---
They were already fairly popular in vanilla due to everyone and their mother being infatuated with night elves.  
---
I think the opposite will be true this time around, but there will still be a nice chunk of them.
---
Nonono
---
the one from northern darkshore. U had to pick up those cat figurines, it was a rare spawning cat with a transparent look. Lvl 19/20. Nice attack speed but no special abilities. I was so proud after 66 figurines.
---
&gt; Well it's supposed to counter what defense skill does, wowpedia etc list it as exactly that. You'd still likely want to use thunderfury so you'd cap at 314.
---
if you are dual wielding as a fury tank id say youd want hundering cold or maladath in your offhand. so without the gloves you would be at 309, or 311. with the gloves you can be at 318, but i am debating if mail gloves with no other stats would be worth it. however remember weapon skill raises your chance to crit as well
---
the original post never provided any evidence to back their claim. 
---
anything that can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
---
It’s just to link up returning players who have lost touch
---
I was gonna start with warrior while my friend starts with priest now I'm starting Hunter while he possibly starts mage just because it's so much easier to level and still fun to pvp with.  After we level these classes we plan on power levelling each other on warrior priest.  It's fun being warrior with a group but alone it's expensive and very slow.  It's really hard to tag enemies on high pop and with Hunter I can just keep going without bandaging and eating after every couple pulls.  Hamstring method is nice but right now I do much more damage with my 2 1h weapons compared to my 2h
---
My guild had me try to tank at level 60 with my Shaman. Yeah. Don't tank with a Shaman.
---
I’d love to join up too
---
Smart man!
---
meanwhile your renew caster needs spirit tap so you can lifetap with impunity
---
$15 a month to play this game, but damn the customer service is always great.
---
I'm not conflating anything?  (By the way, that's a word you use to SEEM smart, not because you ARE smart.)  
---
Reading comprehension would do you absolute wonders, the person I replied to said people should research, because the OP is wrong.  OP provided a scenario for his claim, second poster did not, yet disputed the claim.  It's really simple debate.
---
Im buying a new pc too but a $650 usd computer here in aus costs me $950 major downers man :(
---
Census data always had them as the least playing class (shaman were lower but they were faction specific)
---
&gt; Not a bug.
---
Do you think they should leave it as is?
---
the +5 skill adds 6% more damage on pvservers, and a fair bit more on classic since parry will be higher
---
We had a Rogue tank Onyxia for the last ~5% or so because the main tank died. That was our first kill, what a mess. I think he was hit twice and survived, with heals of course.
---
&gt; Batch X [ Seduction ] (Nothing else finished during this batch) -&gt; **Batch X processed and Seduction applied** -&gt; Batch X+1 [ Shadowbolt ] (Shadowbolt finished casting after seduction was already applied on the shaman hence that should? mean the previous batch was done) -&gt; Batch X + 1 processed
---
So then it should break seduce, yeah? Batch X (seduce) finishes processing, shaman is seduced, Batch X+1 (shadowbolt) is processed, shaman takes damage. The only way it wouldn't break seduce is if the seduce and second shadowbolt are processed at the same time, and there's quite a large window between seduce affecting him and him being damaged. 
---
As far as I understand as to how it used to work, is that everything cast within 200ms or so of one another could influence the others meaning they essentially always overlap and have a 200ms (or whatever) grace period. 
---
This would all require more technical knowledge given to us by Blizzard to really tell, but the window between seduce taking place and the shadowbolt damaging him seems rather large for it to be fine from a player's perspective.
---
I mean graphics are obviously better in retail.
---
&gt; Sure you might get 5% more Dps as human rogue with sword spec compared to NE. 
---
No you don't. This is an uncritical thing that people keep repeating because they heard someone else say it. 
---
The comparison is not between:
---
1) Nelf with 300 sword skill
---
2) Human with 310 sword skill
---
It is:
---
1) Nelf who had to spend 2 talent points and 1 slot of gear to get to 310 swords
---
2) Human who only had to spend 2 talent points to get to 310 swords
---
The difference in DPS between them is the combination of AP/crit/hit from 1 slot of gear where the Nelf had to forego more AP/crit/hit to take an item that gets him +3-5 more sword skill.
---
The advantage vanishes almost completely once you get your hands on The Hungering Cold which is arguably the BiS sword offhand, if not that then a very close #2.
---
How is receiving free stuff being toxic? Nobody forced his viewers to give him shit.
---
A scenario was provided, as an evidentiary claim.  Thus should be treated as such?
---
I can't continue this conversation. You all try and refute me through lack of knowledge instead of pressing to understand.  It's fine.
---
Ok, but if everyone in the raid also had all the consumables possible... how would this spec match up?
---
I have a hard time believing that this spec can have long term DPS to rival enh shaman or shadow priest on a raid boss that lasts 3+ minutes.
---
It's never like you need every rank, just certain key ranks that have the most efficiency for that cast time, maybe 3-5 extra keys depending on class.
---
its really not a hassle
---
&gt; Like garmebin said
---
i think he is speaking as if parry is the 5% everyone thought it was.
---
I think due to the way hit table works you actually reduce parry for more than the other stats.
---
Warrior priest is terrible as priest cant use shield due to absorb dmg killings the rage generation. If you are horde shaman (wf totem, str totem, grounding and earthbind) on ally naturally pala (elite farming, might blessing , cd spells) are way bigger help.
---
BFA babies belongs in retail!
---
50 Minus!
---
is this known?
---
You didn't even bring any facts you absolute plonker. You just regurgitated the same numbers everyone has at their disposal, while trying to convince everyone those numbers = more damage.
---
Show me how those numbers affect damage then with your so called facts.
---
High end vanilla dungeons comes down on execution. No matter your gear if you the group knows his shit you gonna advance. If u ding in first 3 weeks u'll most likely do dungs with the more hardcore part of the community so you shouldnt really worry about it.
---
Pservers overtune the bosses heavily. If Blizzard sticks to nochanges then raids will be too easy.
---
What are the weapon. ?
---
The reason its so high is because she was a legit end boss at first, objectivly harder than rag with regular instakilling of the whole raid in 1 conflag.
---
Then they removed her conflag mechanic and it was a joke after
---
Use Luna. Click the player portrait for an efficient down ranked heal. Right click for a big heal or alt click for a fast heal. You can customize it however you like, it works for raids and 5 mans and makes healing easy.
---
XP values on the other hand isn't.
---
Yup, its a bit rng dependant, and also, its an expensive class. You need consumables and engineering. Can you create other classes so they can give the buffs that I listed in the doc? Also, I'd like to see a DPS test on a dummy, if you can do that (full video)?
---
There are no dynamic respawns.
---
It has been the standard go-to spec for lots of years now Oo
---
The only reason "old" theorycrafting hasn't aged well is because private servers played by different rules.
---
Hey congrats! 8 was wondering if you will implement a language/country criteria as well
---
Which do you recommend?
---
Our UD T2 geared MT had close to 11k fully world buffed and flasked, and our tauren OT had nearly 12k.
---
Don't have any screenshots, so you'll just have to take my word for it.
---
Not yet but it will be a week after Classic gets released and MC gets cleared faster than it ever did on a Pserver.

---
Agility is way better than str due to maths. You simply can't stack enough str to make it worth while the +agi with crits puts up your dps waaaaaay higher in the long run. Your stat prio on warri looks like that of (if you level solo) agi - spir -stam -str.
---
It's interesting how ok you seem going against the status quo.  You should change your ways, but you probably wont.  I'll give people less of a benefit of the doubt thanks to you.
---
I like you and we mostly agree. I can not, however, have any faith in their claim that this might last for a few weeks. It's until Phase 2 at least and, despite promises, I expect that they won't ever really turn it off and envy your faith that it will. I could make a list of systems introduced to games and the problems that they came with that nobody anticipated but I hope it's sufficient just to say that I've had enough bad experiences with unintended consequences to expect more.  
---
Hopefully you're right. On paper - if it works correctly and only for a few weeks - this sounds like a good solution.
---
Such a beautiful set. Doesn’t get old.
---
I remember attack ranges being a bit wonky back then, and perhaps time has clouded my memory... but they were hitting him from so far away it just seems illogical lol
---
Yes they are working like they should. It's what we wanted so it's a great victory for #nochanges.
---
Sorry I didn’t state that I meant for PvP. I should have been more clear
---
that's gonna be the only thing i miss from current WoW: barber shop.
---
I don't understand why so many people post clips of him on here.
---
Check link.
---
A brutally honest answer is: you most likely won't tank. Tanking in vanilla is super demanding so that usually goes for GMs or high ranked officers. Tanks on raids basically have to no life the game and since they auto-get EVERYTHING they need in first progressions guilds tend to let REALLY trustworthy peeps to tank.
---
Yeah, I'm not to sure. That's why the seduce not breaking part kind of confused me, unless there's some bug that's related to it.       
---
Definitely needs more knowledge to understand, but I feel like this would be a solid thing for them to test out as they did with other things as it's pretty easy to reproduce.        
---
I didn't look at the time between seduce and the damage taken though, didn't think about that. Just for when the casts are finished and seduction being applied
---
why the surprised face..
---
I dont get it either. If you dont watch twitch, it's as if they dont exist.
---
It’s a perfect class fantasy design.
---
No, it's assumed.
---
Not gonne lie, I kinda like the idea of having a barber shop. I pretty much never use it, but it's nice to know the option exists. Of course, it wouldn't be classic with QoL features like that.
---
I just had a look and there were peoples email addresses exposed without me even having to log in. I guess if they are ok with that its fine but Its not something i would be all that happy about.
---
Your clip doesn't load, but I know what stream it's from and it was posted here already like a week ago.
---
Sylvannas the leader and mascot for the forsaken has "pretty" since BC, idk why blizzard decided her outfit should be a sports bra, black yoga pants, and thin boots
---
Clicking frames will never be as good as mouse over healing
---
Ye mb I thought you added both of the swords+gloves for that 318.
---
The gloves add up to ~0,9% more chance to hit and 0,3% crit and going to be very expensive, because they're bis for fury. You could pick up the mail gloves from LBRS quest for 2% hit which is going to be better for threat since you won't be capped for hit early on as prot.
---
Well first of all.. no. And second of all there is no ingame calender anyway
---
There's been a few threads on this if you looked =/
---
There are some rumours that IF and some other % weps having way bigger proc chance in priv servers so there might be some change in top priority weps for warriors and rogues.
---
Search bar?
---
This is how it was back in 2005. Healing a target wouldn't guarantee that you healed the target. I got multiple lay on hands cooldown in 2005 and the tank still died.
---
Thank you for making this. I haven’t found anyone from back in the day yet but with this it feels like now there is at least a chance of reconnecting with some old friends
---
fury tanks will be more necessary as melee is gonna do more dps with less hit cap and armor values. they are just gonna be more squishy now but it's mandatory for threat regen.
---

On your Inn idea, what's good for an MMORPG is less instances, not more.

If you level while fresh you can get really good green weps for silvers from other peeps. Just keep an open eye for chat.
---
It's mostly nostbabies complaining because it's not like it is on whatever shitty private server they're playing now.
---
Pvping with warrior in anything below aq20 gear is a pain in the ass. Other classes straight mop-up the floor with warriors in low gear.

"Oh yeah I play on Rexxar server, we are raiding Serpentshrine eight now."

Nope just you. Terrible luck you must have.

na just you
---
Agree. Uldum was the one cata zone I loved. I love Silithus too tho, I'm a sucker for the Egyptian/deserty zones.
---
Mark says that there is supposed to be overspawn code in starting zones of vanilla wow.
---
How many morons does it take to make the exact same post over and over?
---
Lol ewww gross not a pathetic casual XD. It doesn't really matter for druid anyway since you're faction choice will determine race. I wonder if eating some model changing consumables will change tauren hitbox too.
---
Mark says a lot of things. It doesn't make it gospel.
---
stripping and dying won't take much longer, /camp sends you to a separate entrance. Should still be viable.
---
How do you  even  know what he sounds like?
---
What? Alliance has an advantage in AV. I literally never heard someone else say the opposite till now. Seen countless people say that alliance has the advantage.
---
But wouldn’t immersion mean music muted and environmental sounds up?
---
I would rather them release it with an "as it was" baseline, see how it does as a whole, not just for the beta testers, then take community feedback for something like classic+ style changes, including adjusting the spell batching window.
---
I also wonder if the current design of having all abilities be processed as fast as possible is what causes the ability lag out in the world in retail. (unless they've finally fixed that bug, I haven't played for a bit)
---
That sinking feeling when everyone is standing around discussing the next boss and you 
---
1: realize that your pet is nowhere to be seen and 
---
2: see that you're in combat
---
"I have made a terrible mistake..."
---
Man, he was such a great man. Very passionate, very fun, very funny.  I hope hes doing as well as possible in whatever place he is in, he deserves it.
---
Sadly, it was always quite bad in vanilla for people who had good connections and could actually function.  
---
I don't know if the current beta mechanics are working as intended or not, but you were always able to pull weird crap like this off.
---
In group PvP: Warriors are always worthwhile as long as they can maintain Mortal Strike on the kill target. You don't need to global people to be useful when you have MS. You won't have issues finding groups for PvP.
---
In solo PvP: you're going to be at the bottom of the food chain. Granted, that doesn't change much when you get great gear. Warriors are just not a great class for 1v1 / open world PvP.
---
If there wasn't the obvious problem of world bosses and the obvious solution of new servers, I could possibly be more worried. [But I trust the guy who was the GM of Elitist Jerks when he says he understands why there can never be long-term layering \(or in the case of this video, sharding, since it was from Blizzcon 2018\).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w&amp;t=1m29s)
---
Anyway, if we assume that at the top end, Phase 1 will be about 3 months, then I'll be back around in December to see if I should eat my shoe. !RemindMe 5 Months
---
Isn't it only BIS if you would have run out of mana?

What? I'm making fun of him for being a sjw and that he should go back to the sjw HQ which is Twitter. Weew lad lol, Has nothing to do with his post format.
---
Asmon wouldn't be received so negatively by a lot of people if the lower age bracket of his followers didn't dick ride so hard.

Anyway, if we assume that at the top end, Phase 1 will be about 3 months, then I'll be back around in December to see if I should eat my shoe. RemindMe! 5 Months
---
Probably so. The frothing fanboys *are* a massive turn off to watching his stream.
---
I did Naxx until 4Hmen in actual Vanilla and played on Nostalrius in one of the best guilds.
---
Yes, there were addons that healed by themselves etc. 
---
No, not everyone had boss mods and diminishing returns trackers.
---
Most people barely knew their own fucking rotation.
---
I played Vanilla as well as private servers. For example, Princess Theredras (51) was \*never\* gray to a 60. It was 48.
---
Nope he is correct. Once again reduced chance to parry per weapon skill is a constant no matter what. A mob 3 levels above you has a 14% chance to parry, you have 305 weapon skill the mob now has 13.8% chance to parry. A mob is your level with a 5% to parry, you have 305 weapon skill the mob now has 4.8% chance to parry.
---
The formula you posted was from a Dev talking about TBC where they replace +weapon skill with expertise.
---

Hey I am 15 now, great time to experience classic for the first time, already rolled on private servers but only to get used to the leveling and talents etc.
---
Last post about that is literally 4 posts before you, if you are unable for some reason to use the search option, you might as well check out the other posts for the same issue...
---
If anyone watches his streams with chat on you're a far braver man than I.
---
The next moron took only 20 minutes after this post to ask the same thing
---
That's the only thing that's keeping me going rn
---
If a lot of people are going to take 2weeks vacation for playing ClassicWow at launch, questing/leveling which require to kill mobs will be pain. Will it be better to wait on the 3rd week to take vacation to play nolife-mode more effectively?
---
&gt;on long fights
---
You go oom on longer fights even with mana pots &amp; runes on cooldown, or you resort to cutting mind blast from your rotation in an attempt to keep shadow weaving up. So more MP5 allows you to keep DPS'ing at full effectiveness.
---
My b meant to comment on his post
---
I'm not just talking about power level addons, how many people did you raid with in vanilla who had the default UI. Remember those ridiculous healthbar things that went either side of your toon vertically? Addons were everywhere for raiders in Vanilla. I'm not saying it made players good or anything.
---
Not sure if serious...
---
Love my tank pally, but I'd never roll if the tank needed it and I was healing.
---
I tried to stop by a few times since the beta started, but I just couldn't handle the fanbase. Even if you were turn off the chat, they flock to him in game.
---
Can Tauren interact with npcs from slightly farther away as well? If so ill make my bank alt one lol.
---
I’m so confused by this, what’s the issue?
---
No worries bro =)
---
Always loved redridge myself and I dont know why..
---
In their defense, casual Joe rolled a paladin because the class art was a guy in plate with a 2H hammer. Paladins in WC3 and lore were melee combatants.
---
There was no way to know that ret or prot were "off spec" unless you had done out-of-game research. Even then, ret/prot paladins were massively nerfed in the last two weeks of beta, so a lot of people rolled a paladin at launch without knowing what to expect.
---
Yo I used to be greymane too! Horde tho
---
Wow ok I probably won’t do warrior then. I’m not 100% sure I’ll be able to be able to get aq gear. Thanks for helping me decide my class!
---
Wait you didn't understand that when a boss dodges more they take less damage from melee? Well consider yourself informed.
---
That’s unfortunate...
---
Remeber remeber, the fifth of Noveber
---
Yeah. I guess you're right.
---
Ya, chat is always bad.
---
Hunter T1 was only good until 3 pieces, T2 and up was solid though.
---
No shame , I had no idea how to play mmo's in 2006
---
It actually took me quite a while to un learn this even after i knew the correct way to play
---
It's OK we get it, you're slightly overweight and you're self-conscious about it. Instead of starting e-arguments, why don't you just lose some weight? Nobody likes a keyboard warrior.
---
No. But elites have been confirmed to have much lower damage than on private servers, so it seems likely that this would hold for raids as well.
---
I do get your point in theory though, just I'd like my old ui the way it was then so i am bias
---
Good stuff! I clicked all through Vanilla and still do. I’m not hardcore and have no desire to be. Loved the video
---
Damn, no monkeynews?
---
Lol check female dwarf then
---
Like, is this serious? I vividly remember there being a uproar back when a Gummy posted a thread about the importance of spell batching in classic wow on the official forums, and it got deleted. That was before Blizzard confirmed they would implement spell batching in classic wow.
---
His card game idea is pretty close to what old classic dev, mark kern, said he wanted to implement into the game. I'm sure it would have been functionally different to hearthstone. 
---

Good for pvp but lackluster for pve.
---
This sounds soooo 2006
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
No...just no. No fucking emotes in world of Warcraft....
---
i dont think the speed at which MC is cleared would mean the bosses hit harder, unless you are saying at that point we will have data on boss damage
---
In order for that line of thinking to make sense, you would have to believe that the game is going to be completely different from private servers than it will be on Classic, because Druids on private servers are absolutely and clearly ahead of Warriors in multiple respects.
---
You would also have to discredit all of the evidence from actual Vanilla and TBC as well. Everyone agrees that TBC Feral tanks were insane - TBC Feral tanks and 1.12 Feral tanks are actually extremely similar.
---
Being serious, I'd love to make a videogame with major inspiration from vanilla wow. 
---
If I knew how to make games, and where to start..
---
OP would you be into making a game? Or this is just thoughts and feelings?
---
It’s horde only? Or is the alliance one separate?
---
this is a joke right?
---
Pretty sure u just need a subscription to wow
---
Yea, it can happen.  RNG is RNG at the end of the day and it can swing both ways.  It is just that the odds of something like that happening are extremely low.  
---
We didn't see an eye of sulfuras drop for over a year, but then we saw a second on drop just a month later; after the second, we never saw another drop pre TBC.
---
Who are them?
---
Horde only, so nope.
---
As a programmer, most of the computer literate people I know can't drive a truck.  Some can't even drive a car.
---
Yep, they roamed the plains and florests of Kalimdor and they were good friends with Cenarius. One special area was sacred: the region that's now Desolace (originally known as **Mashan'she**) because of it's elemental proprieties that they linked with their Earth Mother (it was in fact Theradras).
---
This led to her awakening, then the Keeper of the Grove Zaetar went there, he and the elemental princess had their ugly Centaur offspring, and then the Centaur started their war with the Tauren.
---
I wanted to see how good was the Warlock in PVP and Snutz was great for that, the guy is a beast.
---
After listening to someone talk about how he would like to be a dark ranger. I thought would be cool to be a drawf forsaken
---
YAH THINK YAH WANNIT BUTCHA DUHNT
---
Looked like 500 to me too until I zoomed in on my phone
---
ahh okay, thanks for clarifying.
---
I still feel weaponskill is going to be very important for fury tanking, considering dual wield reduced hit chance as well
---
Yes, Dustwallow and Felwood are charming. I always liked the Cursed Land tracks that play while in Felwood (and AV). Dustwallow reminds me of marshland that I've passed through in Louisiana.
---
I just tried on a pserver. 
---
Doesn't work even if I swim near the border between Winterspring and Moonglade.
---
It sends me back to Azshara. But I don't know if it's a pserver bug or the right thing.
---
Moonkin.
---
It's not on by default, it just shows when you're in config mode. When you're out of config mode it only displays when you or another player is rezzing someone.
---
I'm actually well aware of that. But the fact is that it wasn't implemented, and therefore it's not Vanilla (and the other stuff is... Well, they're all certainly ideas).
---
The bridge to Dun Baldar is such a hurdle for Horde that their only real way through is either a massively coordinated attack, most likely with Lokholar, or they take the backdoor entrance. The entrance to Frostwolf Keep is not nearly as defended, hence you can just run right through it and capture the graveyard down south. This means that in a situation where both sides are pugs, the Alliance will never be able to mount a big enough offensive to break through Iceblood Graveyard while the Horde can just trickle in by the backdoor until they have enough people to siege down Dun Baldar. The backdoor is easily defended of course, but pugs don't care about that. If you have an Alliance premade though, 5-6 people is enough to completely shut down the backdoor, essentially making it impossible for the Horde to win even with a premade, and the rest just mow their way past Iceblood Graveyards and the towers down to Frostwolf Keep. Whoever dies will just ghost walk down and ress by the Relief Hut. Back on Nost I logged my wins and loses and I shit you not, Alliance NEVER won as a pug while the Horde did pick a few games if both were premades, but still it was heavily in favour of the Alliance. 
---
Important thing though is that the AV used in Classic might be different. IIRC the backdoor was patched out in around TBC or Wrath so it might not work on Classic either. Also the trick of ressing at other graveyards might not work either which really screws over the Alliance. AV can be really fun, but damn can it be boring as well. When both sides are turtling and you're trying your best to get any kind of strategy going but half your team is chasing herbs or AFKing in the mines.
---
Holy Shit. That suggests 0.6% parry reduction per point of weapon skill, that's insane. 
---
Night elves and cows and trolls can suck it, orcs and humans will reign supreme for tanking if those numbers are correct.
---
As a healer on ND I LOVE Luna, so pleased it will be in Classic.
---
Because there are actual plate pieces available, so taking leather from from a rogue when that is their only option is simply asinine.
---
Really ? Every time I was looking for him he was nowhere to be found !
---
Maybe he was too busy killing some allies \^\^
---
Idk, i feel like making Inns instanced sounds nice and would add a feeling of stepping into another environment entirely.
---
Would also serve as a sort of refuge out in the world. Could have more negative effects than positive but it's not  obvious to me, just sounds kinda cool to have a protected hub where it actually makes sense to hang out.
---
mvp
---
It's just the way things were, i think undeads get a sweet 2h mace aswell, but need to go to to learn it in thunderbluff, although that quest's in brill, not deathkneel.
---
Suggesting a change on this subreddit hahahah

I figured it would have a negative impact on Fury tanking. DW means more white hits and with boss parrying nearly three times as much, there would be more parry haste attacks, right? So fury tanks would get hit even harder, or rather, more quickly.
---
I absolutely love redridge for some reason. It feels more "outposty" and the variance in mobs / their own outposts adds a lot of flavour. Swamp of sorrows as #2, I feel like thematically it's unique and I love the temple.
---
&gt;ste in every r
---
and the e46? hey, we think we are better!
---
Easily my favorite starting zones for horde &amp; alliance respectively
---
Sounds illegal
---
I wan, that’s kind of a dick move.
---
If it’s BiS for Fury they should get a shot
---
Usually if there is a prot warrior tank, he has first dibs on tank drops. Then offspecs have second priority for drops, so a holy paladin and arms warrior might be competing for it.
---
The easiest way would be to pair up with a bear druid for 5-mans. Otherwise grab the tank drops that the prot warrior doesn't need.
---
If you raid, Zul Gurub and AQ20 are nice for collecting offspec sets. When most of your group is in BWL gear, a large portion of the drops are going toward offspecs.
---
Overall, I'm neutral in regards to Asmon.  But like with most people, every once in a while they do/say something meaningful.
---
In the alliance quest chain that lead to blight caller Spy Shaw reveals the name marris and in the book "before the storm" it's said that forsaken usually choose new names to avoid thinking about thier past lives
---
The ambiance is magnificent. Have you been there at night, to see the wind kicking up a sandstorm while the stars twinkle above?
---
Druid might be for you. Still a tank class that also happens to be excellent in solo PvP.
---
yeah imgaypwnd but I knew u boomers would know what I was looking for
---
Yeah there are an awful lot of people like him that are living in that fantasy. I’d love to see a single example of these thousands of death threats from not passing on a piece of gear. It’s too bad that nothing like that actually ever happens lol.

Thanks! I'd recommend you to join this Discord to find new friends :)

Lol I once found out my college teacher played wow. I added him and we played together, I quickly learned that he was super casual player, played very little and didn’t care much about the game. He did not give me better grades either 😂
---
Oh the back pedaling and keyboard turning. It warms the soul.
---
So salty warglaives were only usable by npcs
---
Humans will reign supreme, as they are the only class capable of properly handling *Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker*
---
Multiboxing is not against the rules
---
I'm not sure. I dont see any paladins so it might be horde
---
I get what you're saying, but one of the problems with the modern game is how instanced everything has gotten. You don't *want* the Inn to feel like another environment entirely. It should feel like an organic part of the world.
---
I always assume when people call in sick that they aren't ill, they're just sick of this shit.
---
The same people that keep spamming #nochanges are probably the same idiots that are in these threads crying over the input lag.
---
Sounds like we are both using anecdotal evidence and have drawn our own conclusions based off of them.  I was on a medium-high pop server and my experience differed in regards to what you mentioned.
---
I had been in 4 raiding guilds from start to finish of vanilla, and they all experienced the same quantity (give or take a couple) of warriors per raid.  
---
To be honest, I am not entirely sure what you are disagreeing with me on here.. that getting a guild as a warrior is harder than just about any other class?  Just from a logical stand point, this should make sense.  Warriors will be the most populated, you only need 2 actual tanks with an array of off tanks that can even be feral druids (at least in MC) and they are the most gear dependent.  Most people are also not going to have an arcanite reaper pre 60... even at 60.
---
Damn right
---
What game is he playing?
---
I love undead starting zone. Dark mystic woods with evil lurking around. Maybe not the best looking zone but is my favorite.
---
Those graphics definitely look different than vanilla!
---
I love 1k needles. I'm not sure why, I think it's just the way it's placed.
---
Whenever I go there in always struck by how weird and alien the world feels, it gives me this real sense that I'm a small player in a large and alien world.
---
Legit cried when I came back in legion and saw it got flooded.
---
I'm pretty sure this is tbc, as warlocks didn't have Unstable affliction in vanilla?
---
Damn. Looks like we're in the same boat. Best of luck my man
---
Should implement emojis as well. Often time's when people say lol in chat, I don't know if they are actually laughing or not. An emoji would fix that. 
---
More on topic, just drop the GO GO GO attitude of retail and you'll be fine.
---
If you're worried about getting the Scarab Lord mount then you'll want to avoid streamers like the plague.  Other than that I don't see too much of a problem with playing on a streamer server.
---
Not at all. Blizzard is clear with this so as long as I don't use any automated system. 1 instruction per client upon key press is acceptable as per Blizzard.
---
Yeah there is really no harm in going human if you want to tank as it does do the most threat. Just probably don't spend 1,000+ gold on Edgemaster's unless you are going to be Dps for a lot of raids. 
---
Also what a lot of tanks do as non-humans is they go Daggers with Aged Core Leather Gloves, as those give you a lot of other great stats for tanking unlike Edgemaster's which give literally nothing besides +weapon skill.
---
The same game a lot of people are playing, and yet *he* is the one almost constantly posted on here. Do we really need clips of him every few hours?
---
In terms of hitting someone with a poly and a frostnova and not having it break the poly with the damage, that is something that existed back in TBC so the batching might be working as intended. There was a bug back in TBC when they added flying mounts to the game that if you sheeped someone who was on a flying mount as a mage and hit them with a frost nova at the same time, they would remain a sheep in the nova and when they broke out they would be able to fly through the air without a mount.
---
I'm not 100% sure on if trying to BoP fall damage and failing was as common back in Vanilla, I never played a Paladin.
---
Im not too comfortable building my own at this point. Just not enough time and knowledge so i think im going to buy this one on Monday. I appreciate it
---
A lot of the Google searches and research point to Intel instead of AMD. Thoughts?
---
I think to emulate spell batching they added in a 1/4 second delay to everything thats an interaction and it does really seem... weird lol.
---
Which is ironic, since /r/wow is pretty hostile to the idea of classic wow now lmao
---
I played a Druid in vanilla and loved it. The most fun I’ve ever had. But I wanted to try something new this time
---
/Slap
---
Weren't mobs ignoring vertical distance back then? 
---
Basically they were above him and able to hit him
---
Rly wonder how casting works for this kind of thing. Are they like "hey were looking for 1 sort of gross chick for xxx scene" lmao.
---
Well, this is confusing because I still have the option on my launcher but no beta access. I was one of those people who had the 2nd PTR account automatically removed and replaced by the stress test.
---
Every damn time lol
---
even casual raiding guilds are "communist" for similar reasons.  
---
pvp guilds are hard to put into this analogy, but if you join a rank 14 factory guild, it will welcome casual players with open arms because being able to swap in a rank 6-10 with a competing rank 13s will be pretty normal.  
---
the only true selfish way to play is to be a gold maker... but even then you are invigorating your server economy with thunderfuries, resist gear, consumables, bag space and more.
---
Achievements and the titles that come with them. I'll miss being Salty.
---
This is my go-to
---
Could be tbc prepatch.
---
I think that's true for virtually every building, but Inns would be the exception in this scenario besides PvP rewards building.
---
You would literally get a loading screen (no phasing), if even artificial, to signal that you are inside a safe place where you can rest. I think it makes a lot of sense from an RPG perspective, not fully clear on the gameplay perspective though. It would be a meeting place where people go to to hang out and talk, trade, buy cool stuff from vendors and get rested XP while being online. You could take the idea further than I have for sure.
---
What this guy said is true and fairly easy. 
---
We get to use live macros now, which are fairly straight forward to write. 
---
An example would be:
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [mod:shift] flash heal rank 1; flash heal rank  7
---
I may have messed up spacing or something but basically this macro would cast flash heal rank 7 unless you hold shift, in which case it will cast flash heal rank 1. You could combine three spells I think to modifiers, like alt ctrl and shift and have 4 separate spells or ranks of spells in one macro.
---
Reported for spam. Do we really need people reposting the same thing multiple times?
---
You're correct.  Could have been the two weeks prior to TBC release.
---
Bullshit, blink worked reliably for avoiding fall damage consistently. It was the only time the spell actually was consistent. It was so reliable that I never even bothered getting tears on the hymnal archimonde fight because it was just easier to blink the air burst.
---
You're not filtering you're results correctly.
---
That page shows Warlocks doing about 900 DPS in MC and roughly 700 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
It shows Priests doing about 600 DPS in MC and roughly 400 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
It shows Warriors doing about 1900 DPS in MC and roughly 900 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
It shows Rogues doing about 1500 DPS in MC and roughly 800 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
It shows Mages doing about 1100 DPS in MC and roughly 900 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
You bring 2 Warlocks for Curse of Recklessness and Curse of Elements. You might bring a 3rd so the first two don't whine about not having Curse of Shadow, but you don't bring a 4th.
---
That means your average DPS (when counting the bonus from Warlocks) is ~1000 in MC and 715 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx. Which means bringing any Warrior, Rogue, or Mage is better and only slightly better than just bringing another Warlock, especially since they don't take up valuable Debuff slots.
---
I was using all the consumables I could reasonably think of.  No engineering though.
---
I can create any class I want, but logging in more than one at a time seemingly requires some tweaking to the bropack or the client that might be above my knowledge (if anyone knows how, please share).  I might be able to cast other class buffs on myself with some GM commands, I'd have to check the list of commands again.
---
In any case, I applaud your efforts.  This just "feels" right from an RPG perspective.  I also don't mind playing a more crit dependent class.  This is more common in other RPGs, less so in WoW (at least vanilla, never played the expansions).
---
Do you know how fucking silly you sound lmao. "Keyboard warrior" hahaha is it 2008

Definitely. I can still remember the names of the people with bad reputations as alliance on Crushridge. Can't wait for this again.

Every time I see estimates of the contribution of weapon skill, it's 1% higher than the last time I saw it mentioned.

My co-workers barely know how to use a phone let alone a pc so i think I’m safe on this one
---
Cheers bro, have fun on classic launch!
---
Lol that’s not viable at all, where did you get that from? The normal solo classes can solo them but it takes a long time, it’s Felguards and Succubus elites.
---
Not with that attitude
---
I built a low end one last year that handles BfA and the stress test no problemo. Has a ryzen 5 1600 and a GTX 1050. When i was building it RAM and video cards were dumb expensive. At any rate, youll get away with pretty low end builds
---
All rainbows and butterfly’s with dangerous Dave over here
---
This is 110% correct. I remember this exact way of dying multiple times in these towers. There seems to be no vertical limit at times for melee attacks from mobs at times in vanilla.

---
Okay making this comment tryint to press most of the questions which were frequently asked or just generally i noticed reading through comments:
---
1) "I want to tank"
---
 Thoose who want to be tanks, prepare yourselves. Tanking in vanilla is a SERIOUS thing . Tanks are the only position which literally has to no-life the game due to consumes rep bills and stuff (even with guild help). Thing is most of you won'T tank. Not because you can't learn it or can't do it already. You won't be able to tank because tanks get EVERY loot they need. And beacuse poaching is quite frequent in vanilla tanks will be either GMs or really close right hand officers who are trustworthy so tehy don't lose their geared tank. And you most likely once you realise how much commitment it is you 'Ll back out. I dont blame you. It's a real nag.
---
2) Tank or DPS? 
---
You'll do both. Unless you are the 1 VERY deep specced prot guy all the other warriors are required to dps AND OT at the SAME time in the raids. You'll need lots of different gears for different raids. This gets even bigger the later the patch goes (aq/naxx).
---
3) "leveling as what talent" 
---
Talent honestly doesn't really matter. Both fury and arms have their cons and pros (on priv servers fury are generally better but it seems /sit doesn't work in classic so there arms might be the way to go).
---
What matters are learning the small things with warrior. Warrior has many cool stuff they can (AND SHOULD!!!) do while fightning both in pve and pvp. Have a decent 2h wep, and learn what is hamstring kiting.
---
Planning out wep progression helps a lot. In general a few "justgoogleit" stuff for lvling a warrior: hamstring kiting, warrior stat prio, green questing, basics of tanking for 5mans.
---
4) PvP with warrior:
---
Until you get aq gear everything will beat your ass period. Warrior sucks so hard in low gear compared to other classes it's not even funny. The other classes will beat your ass hard.
---
5) "i  plan on warrior but so many ppl rolling"
---
Doesn't matter. Half of thoose never reach 60. Half of the 60 are incapable of playing the class. A 40 man raid requires 8 warriors at minimum. You can do the math. There can NEVER be enough warrior in vanilla servers.
---
6) "i plan on duo lvling what classes to take"
---
Warrior-Priest sucks. Priest can't bubble warrior as absorb kills rage generation on warrior so that's a big no. Also priests offer NOTHING to warriors offense wise.
---
If you are horde go with shaman. Shaman with STR totem, earthbind totem (look up earthbind kiting  - same thing as hamstring ) and post 34 windfury totem (GOD THE W-I-N-D-F-U-R-Y) will make your warrior a wrecking ball. Go deep fury with warrior , use imp cleave/whirlwind pull 4 mobs , cleave WW them down and the shaman just heals you.
---
If you are alliance tho, Pala takes the cake. Pala can take any gear warri doesn't need AND you can go either deep holy or prot stuff. Paladin offers dispels (REALLY IMPORTANT) freedom , heals, blessing of might ( BoM) auras and many other utility just like shaman. Paladinn is more defensive tho so while you cant go as ham as you do with shaman due to palas higher defensive line you can nicely farm elite mobs somewhere (thats' the thing you have over horde combo).
---
So horde: shaman-warri, warri goes deep fury with cleave/whirlwind shaman supports with heals and totems mainly windfury
---
Ally: get pala, put any loot on pala farm elites for btter xp and loot.
---
Rule #1 has been Rule #1 for as far back as I can remember.  There were some good players like MonkeyNews and Docken who tried to post content to this sub and were deleted because they used private server footage.  Some other people who had no Vanilla clout seemingly at all rose to fame because their videos did not explicitly feature private server footage.
---
They may have gotten drowned out after a period of time, but the haters were always here.
---
Omg illegal danish!!
---
Who gives a flying fuck you moron, they finally fixed an issue that was there for 8 years. Shut your fuckin mouth you whiny kid
---
You just have to educate her
---
As a Druid I would only keep 1 downranked spell on my bar so it wasn't a big deal.  There is no reason to keep every rank hotkeyed or something.
---
It didn't make sense to downrank rejuv or regrowth since multiple hots didn't stack.  So you would obviously always want your best hot on people.
---
Max rank Healing Touch I pretty much only used with Natures Swiftness.   It has a long cast time and cost a ton of mana.  By the time the cast went off the person would either die or not be needing to be healed for that much.
---
I kept the downrank spell that would heal for about 1k.  It might have changed as I got more +healing gear but I'm not sure.
---
All of them, excluding orgrimar lok’tar
---
Member since 2014 and only 400 karma, no wonder, moron.
---
sounds accurate but that is definitely not how spellbatching works
---
That was 6 years ago.  All the people who cared about having a community in their MMORPG are either gone or here in r/classicwow
---
For me personally it's more beating my own time reaching certain milestones. I know I'm not getting any speed run records, but I enjoy competing with myself.
---
Take that experience (soloing anything you want, filling different roles, endless control, mobility, and utility) and imagine the exact opposite. That's Warrior.
---
Paladin is the middle ground between those two. You're never a free kill as a Paladin and you can still tank dungeons well enough to make getting your pre-raid gear a breeze.
---
This is way less efficient than just leveling the two characters separately.
---
Get that stoneskin totem (rank 1)
---
Ashenvale. Too big, annoying to get around in, annoying mobs, annoying quests, annoying FPs.
---
Do you guys just say the same stuff over and over and over. It's been like 5 years of this shit. Everyone uses twitter lol
---
damn, with just epics you can get +14 daggers, at +14 the weapon skill diminishes so much that i dont think youd even need low level blues
---
That's your right I suppose. Most tanks pre 60 are arms/fury warriors that are doing everyone a service my playing the least desirable role. I personally love tanking, but there's a reason you see "LF1M Need tank" spammed over trade chat.
---
LOL, (I played for that team for a bit, no thanks :)
---
I would take that post with a grain of salt until we can confirm it ingame, don't forget the reason why private servers had 5% parry is because of incorrect blue posts.
---
All tank specs are affected by the buffed parry and it's a TPS nerf. If your raid actually needs the extra TPS you should still use a Fury-Prot tank. Sure you need more gear and skill to pull it off, but it's still the best TPS tank. The tank already needed to be awake and ready to equip a shield when the ride got hairy, now it will be just happening more often, but not to a level of pointlessness.
---
The problem with resistance sets is how shit most of the resistance gear is. For a hunter you’d definitely want to feign and swap trinkets to the reflector that counters whatever caster you’re facing but I really can’t think of too much resistance gear that doesn’t totally gimp your damage. 
---
The scepter questline gives a pair of mail pants with a good amount of agi, int, stam and +30 shadow resist which would be worth fuckin with, but other than those I can’t think of anything. 
---
Maybe I’m having minor case of Alzheimer’s and someone can correct me
---
I seriously doubt the Tauren hitbox on release is going to be what it is in the Beta. It really wasn't that big in Vanilla.
---
You can with a macro that switches between them.
---
If this is true vanilla it will get raided
---
To figure out what class you want to play?
---
Dumb ass question...if you enjoy the time spent it’s not time wasted
---
It's fucking moronic because the "raid leaders" are just dumbasses following guides and don't actually know how to play the game or they would know how easy the raid was or how stupid it is to take speed run comps in pugs.
---
Making the community shit by being a tunnel vision elitist kills the endgames of most MMO.
---
I can't really think of one I don't like but I do wish silithus was more finished, and I wish they did something with hyjal instead of leaving just a fat zone of unused potential in the center of kalimdor
---
I don't really think the hitbox thing is as much an issue as you think it is, but when you resist a rogue's cheap shot you'll thank me for telling you to roll orc. Their stun resist passive is just bonkers for pvp
---
If you want to decide on pvp class it is also important on where or how you want to pvp. While shadow priests are the kings of 1v1 duels mostly they aren't that great demand in organised group fightning. check out some pvp youtubers on how WSG premades are working they can give a lot of info what you didn't even consider.
---
If we were on the same RP-PvP server, I'd put my Dwarf alt in the guild.
---
They basically do. Actors are aware of how they look and use it to their advantage.
---
Now I'm no expert but in terms of PVP not so much because you have more HP and Warstomp + Engineering. In pve I think it's not as good as Trolls because of the Bow specialization and Beast Slaying racials. Overall it's not that bad imo
---
context: they glitched into caverns of time and were trying to get out without using hearth/ports
---
Yeah came with the CE
---
Even though it became a place later ofc
---
 Just download questie and go
---
Never used it but yeah it was a nice feature.
---
 It even makes sense to have a barber in mmorpgs.
---
I feel like it makes sense to change it but who knows
---
I was gonna link this too lol
---
Wetlands. Just kinda... meh. It's just gloomy and miserable to me.
---
Desolace, Azshara
---
&gt; If your raid actually needs the extra TPS you should still use a Fury-Prot tank. 
---
i would argue that all raids could benefit from increased tps, otherwise alliance wouldnt be vastly better for raiding, despite horde having bloodlust.
---
&gt;The tank already needed to be awake and ready to equip a shield when the ride got hairy, now it will be just happening more often, but not to a level of pointlessness.
---
is there any word on if classic will have a GCD for weapon swapping?
---
"A few weeks" was only an early estimate that was probably just a random number thrown out off the top of their head.  Depending on how quickly the server population stabilizes, it can be any where from "a few weeks" to months, depending on when Phase 2 kicks off; BUT NEVER PAST PHASE ONE.
---
This was a hard promise by Ion, who is plagued by having to talk in ambiguous "lawyer speak" since he has essentially become the face of WoW and anything he says, regardless of its concreteness is taken as immutable fact.  So Ion, in front of BlizzCon, and entire Blizzard fanbase, and the world, made a hard promise (knowing that it would effectively be career suicide if he ever reneged on said promise); I tend to believe him.
---
Are you offended or something?
---
Because there's a huge amount of disinformation on old blue posts / guides / wikis.  
---
What we know for sure:  
---
- Each additional level the target has over the player grants them 0.5% additional chance to dodge  
---
- Creatures that are 3 levels above the player have a 14% Parry chance.  
---
- Players have an 8% chance to miss a creature that is 3 levels above them.  
---
- Critical Strike chance is reduced by 1% per each additional level the target has over the player.  
---
Everything else is an unknown.
---
You don't really have a rotation in classic. You spam Sunder Armor and keep Shield Block and Demo Shout up at all times. That's the basics. 
---
For multiple mobs you apply Sunders to all mobs (tab target through them) and use Thunder Clap for the debuff and some aoe threat. Thunder Clap requires stance switching, so you try to only do this when you won't lose to much rage. 
---
The rule of thumb for dps in your party was: Wait for 2-3 Sunder Armor stacks and then start dpsing.
---
For paladin, you really only have two main heals. One for efficiency (low rank Flash of Light) and one for big healz (Holy Light).
---
Priest is similar. One spell for max efficiency, one huge-but-slow-heal, one oh-shit-quick-heal. You pick one spell to fill each role, and that is your bread and butter.
---
Ideally you are spamming your efficient heal a lot, with the oh-shit and huge heals only being used as needed. 
---
imo it isn't worth bothering with multiple ranks of your oh-shit buttons.
---
Then every class has situational tools (ex: renew, shield) and typically those are used at max rank.
---
When I raided in vanilla, my healer had roughly the same number of hotkeys as other classes. The big difference was that all healing options had a alt+key binding for self-healing.
---
You are worried about solo potential at 60 in a game that isnt really designed around solo 60 play. There arent dailies or anything in Classic. Sure there are some classes better at solo farming mobs but unless your goal is to solo farm earth elementals at 60 every day then I wouldnt worry about it. If that is your goal you should just go hunter. Also Warlock is actually the only class forced to solo mobs at 60 because you need soul shards. You will mostly be doing group content as a healer and if you want to focus on solo farming you could respec.  If you are interested in like solo farming and healing without having to respec you could look at Druid.
---
That's the biggest thing that's making me consider Orc
---
Sure?
---
Redridge is beautiful, reminds me a lot of the first fable game. And just beyond the border is a land of horror..
---
Agreed something feels off but I dont remember things 100% and it could be accurate.
---
Instead of trying to redefine biological based realities around how humans perceive attractiveness, you should just lose weight and join the rest of us on planet Earth.
---
This "progressive" nonsense is out or control.
---
You're not wrong. Thing about WoW bvefore private loot and class homogenization is that most people were playing at the whim of other people. Your guild or the tank or the 3 players grouped together.
---
on the one hand I like being able to roll for loot and share the spoils but on the other hand I really really appreciate being able to just get your own gear and not owrry about someone else kicking you or taking it from you. People can be shitheads and it used to be you couldn't do much about it.
---
I believe he is being over used. He is good in small doses
---
So does warrior though. 
---
"Lol I'm a dps warrior and don't have a shield or even know what defensive stance is"
---
That's at least a million times worse than someone in a "memespec" who actually tries.
---
They also have Blood Fury and Pet Damage.  Orc is hunter master race IMO.
---
He's not saying it didn't happen, he's implying it wasn't because of trying to take gear from you as much as not having you take gear from them. If you want off-spec gear you roll if no main-spec wants it, needing otherwise can best be described as a dick move.
---
Tauren hunters max range is a couple yards farther than any other hunter but your deadzone is that much farther out which sucks donkey dildos. 
---
In large scale pvp the couple extra yards would be super useful, but in almost every other situation you’ll be easier to fuck over by sitting in your deadzone. 
---
Imo it’s a big negative and you only really gain warstomp from being Tauren, while orc and troll have very powerful racials without having to deal with that.
---
If you no life it hardcore you will be 60 in 5 days. Average people about 2 weeks.. and casuals probably 4weeks+
---
While I love STV for the world PVP, it's just a pain to do anything else in it for me. So many hills, trees, paths, caves, clustered mobs. Up down up down, oops can't get up this way, etc.
---
I'm from the midwest,  and when wow first came out I remember Westfall looking amazingly accurate to the areas around me.  I loved it.
---
That’s stealing! Get that video demonetized!!!!!!!
---
Holy Field Marshal and Grand Marshal! Quite a few!
---
Also fps and server lag. Spell batching is less noticeable when you are rocking 6 fps. Server lag was common enough that it could be the scapegoat for a lot of odd behavior.
---
I fucking HATE people that are like literally dying on the floor and you're in a game/talking with them. "Sorry I gotta to work in a bit" Are you a fucking retard? This also goes double for managers/supervisors who want people to show up to their shift when they're ill.
---
Love it when someone to shows up to work coughing like they have tuberculosis and infect everyone just so they can make 90 bucks or whatever
---
For a quick moment on my phone, I thought the mage to the right had a Mohawk and ponytail.
---
That's basically my boss. Small company and the boss is a realistic human being.
---
Does that 1050 run the game at max settings? How's the frame rate?
---
If you ever go to work sick you're an asshole

Shield Block should not be on the GCD, so you should be able to swap shield on and use Shield Block making you immune to crits and crushing blows almost instantly.
---
Bloodlust is TBC, do you mean Windfury?
---
Bad: Badlands, Alterac Mountains, Deadwind Pass, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh, Wetlands, Azshara, Arathi Highlands, Silverpine Forest, Blasted Lands
---
Okay: Durotar, Hinterlands, Felwood, Dun Morogh, Searing Gorge, Winterspring, Stonetalon Mountains, Loch Modan, Silithus, Moonglade, Western Plaguelands
---
Good: Desolace, Un'Goro Crater, Redridge Mountains, Darkshore, Duskwood, Mulgore, Elwynn Forest, Tanaris, Burning Steppes
---
Great: Feralas, Ashenvale, Eastern Plaguelands, Tirisfal Glades, Westfall, Thousand Needles, Teldrassil, Hillsbrad Foothills, Stranglethorn Vale, The Barrens
---
The wetlands.
---
It's just... Not good.
---
It's so empty but the water and fen creepers make it a pain to navigate, the colour palet is bland, it feels so unlike the previous two dwarven zones.
---
I just think it's a little too generic and knocked out of the park by the other swamp zones.
---
Why do people who never played vanilla comment on batching. Did you completely miss when they said it would be like vanilla, like you could interrupt a mage but still get polymorphed????
---
Feralas. Almost entirely because of visuals and bad Dire Maul memories
---
Are you implying people are editing old information retroactively? Frankly, I trust the old data and theory-crafting more than pserver data. I also think it's pretty worthless to speculate, this should be easily testable in the beta. There's no reason we shouldn't have concrete numbers by now.
---
The other side of it though is that when you take something like a 2h from a hunter or even a paladin you screw them harder because you can quickly get into more dungeons as a tank than they could as a dps. so they have to quest more than you do and need to use those weapons more.
---
Not sure reading comprehension is your thing . I never stated nor implied it’s time wasted . I actually clearly said I was curious what the practice is for . I’d hope without asking they’re having fun while playing . I know I do
---
This.
---
Rank 4 or 5 was usually the best bet, as anything lower usually had a worse spell/healing power coefficient, so you were actually get worse healing per mana then if you used a rank or two higher.
---
Change tanking warrior with resti shaman and this is EXACTLY how i feel!!!
---
They originally planned on putting the demon Hunter in the game originally. I think they opted for druid instead
---
Not everyone is paying attention 100% of the time. They were just running a dungeon it makes sense that they weren’t totally serious and playing perfectly. So many elitists here just shitting on people. The only thing deserving of criticism is the ticket, who cares about every single minute mistake that was made.
---
/question
---
Just tank dungeons that you out level and work your way up.
---
Bringing a warrior or rogue is always going to be better for pure dps, but you can't have a raid full of warriors and rogues. Class stacking to that extent just isn't that viable in Classic where most of the bosses drop 3 pieces of gear from 9 possible classes that are meant to be shared among 40 people. If everyones already in max gear, sure, which is why it's dangerous to search by "best overall" on LegacyPlayers, as the best are often from the speed running guilds where everyone is fully decked out in their BiS and fury warriors aren't gated by threat due to them using dual wield fury tanks.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that melee dps figures of warriors and to a lesser extent rogues are massively inflated by the 10% lower parry chance and 1.5% lower dodge chance of bosses on private servers too, as the tanks have much more threat and less of the melee dps attacks are being dodged on top of that. Comparing melee to ranged is silly anyway as that's apples and oranges. The debuff slots won't be used by anything worthwhile, and warlocks are going to be in the raid no matter what even if they did 50% less dps than they currently do as they bring a lot of utility, so may as well buff them while you're at it.
---
I volunteered to work from home after having surgery. Stupidest thing I have ever done. I currently have strep throat and my boss expects me to get shit done this weekend. This is the first time I have been out of bed in 3 days - my head is ringing so bad I can't focus on work.
---
It'll be ok.
---
Aww but the quests were so fun and the story was good
---
wow op you've got issues.
---
Yes this is posted every other week....
---
it wasn't used as an insult though. stop begging the question.

&gt; Bloodlust is TBC, do you mean Windfury?
---
No i meant blood lust, as i never played horde back in classic and therefore i thought bloodlust was the Shamans response to Paladins BLessing of Salvation.... my bad
---
Really seemed that Alliance had all the pros for raiding
---
Ah ok. I appreciate the view points!
---
\&gt;walk into ashenvale
---
"eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
I wouldn't say it's a bug.  Like the original 8 debuff limit, it was more of a design choice due to technical limits at the time.
---
Its real. I play video games when im sick since it is really the only thing i can do besides lay in bed and be miserable. My old job was a drama fest. One day someone called out, a coworker was suspicious since it was the week of a call of duty launch. He checked his xbox live app on his phone and told the boss that the sick person was playing COD (probably expecting some knee pad points). We all unfriended the snitch after that and he was pretty salty.
---
You implied. Relax brother you got 3 upvotes going here.
---
It's always Christmas time in Dun Morogh :)
---
But how many hunters had tranq shot?
---
Or...you could have a conversation with them and tell them the truth.
---
1.  Politely tell them that you have other goals in game and you're working on different things.  (Note, this doesn't just apply to someone being a scrub.  They might be great, but want you to do other things than you had planned for the night.)
---
2.  Who cares if you're playing a video game while sick?  Actually a great way to get rest.  This is also a pretty limited segment in general.  (Someone you work with at the same time, was also off at the same time you had a sick day?  "So Bob...how could you tell they were playing WoW while you were at work?")
---
3.  WoW can be a conversation piece and occasional activity without it meaning you're married to each other.
---
Coworkers, including a boss, were who got me into WoW in the first place way back when.
---
I don't mind sharing with people that I play, or even adding them to my friend's list, but I also make it clear that I already have people that I game with and that sometimes I just want to chill and not talk to anyone.
---
Over a decade now of WoW (and longer in other games) and people have only tried to make it awkward a few times.  Even then, the point eventually got across, and an amicable relationship was still possible both inside and outside of WoW.
---
The brutally honest answer to this is :   
---
RETPALLY IN VANILLA LULULULULUL.
---
Mad respect for your network. Before it, I believe there wasn't really a good way to reconnect. There was stuff like YouTube, where say someone uploaded an old raid vid, and other guild members that one day searched for it reconnect with each other in the comments section of it. But that rarely happened. Similar for [warcraftmovies.com](https://warcraftmovies.com). But [vanillafriends.com](https://www.vanillafriends.com/) is just brilliant. Just put a beacon out of your details, and wait until someone you knew has done the same.
---
A few things worth changing though (imo):
---
* Many of us, perhaps even the majority, have been in multiple guilds throughout Vanilla. Are there any plans to be able to attach multiple guild names to a given entry? And perhaps even multiple servers as well, due to server migrations?
---
* To prevent scammers from impersonating other people, adding entries on their behalf, but with contact info leading to phishing: via what way are you intending to verify the ownership of the characters of those entries?
---
* And are you planning to add a feature to register an account, so users can manage their entries and change contact info and what have you by themselves?
---
[That title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZapOy3eH3yE)

This really needs to get out of this sub and onto the front page. Upvote!!
---
He’s referencing Dennis from its always sunny and how he hooks up with girls on boats. He’s the guy in the meme
---
Crazy how it be different for everyone
---
Classic WoW is *the* casual MMO. anyone that says otherwise is silly.
---
you can play Classic WoW being a casual just fine. you'll probably have to heal as a shaman in raids just 'cuz Enhancement and Elemental are, uh, not very good. you might be able to find a guild that'll take you as Enhancement as a Nightfall swinger if they don't have one already.
---
unless you're in a hardcore guild, i doubt anyone will care if you play an off-spec.
---
Possibly off topic but does anyone know how to turn off the animated background?  It lags the hell out of me.
---
the gameplay is completely different wtf. You won't have any idea of how a class plays on vanilla by playing it on retail
---
MERGE, LEFT SIDE!
---
SLOW LANE, RIGHT SIDE!
---
STOP SLOWING DOWN, IM GOING TO RAM YOU BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHATTHEFUCK TODO.
---
.... More cars ....
---
Ok stop cars. 
---
TOYOTA, I SAID STOP CARS, GO BACK!
---
If you’re going to roll a hybrid like a Shaman you are going to be asked to heal end game. Classic is very casual friendly though and you should be able to find a raid spot even if you’re not a part of the first wave of 60’s. What’s nice about classic is that even when the next raid tier comes out it doesn’t make MC completely useless. Meaning there will still be plenty of guilds doing MC later into the game and you should be able to find a spot.
---
I think the wonderful thing about WoW was that each zone was beautiful in its own right, especially when compared to other zones... I can maybe make a list of top 10 or top 5, but struggle to make a favorite, each had their pros.
---
I played obsessively from original vanilla, to cataclysm and have just stopped playing private servers in prep for Classic to stop burnout, I’m good dude haha
---
HP is irrelevant, War Stomp is neat but someone can melee you and be outside stomp range. Taurens get nothing for engineering. Biggest issues are 
---
* Bigger model = Further out deadzone
---
* Not having 30-35% stun resist like orcs
---
As for PVE, bow spec doesn’t do much since the only bow you’ll ever use in endgame is Rhok’Delar, and Beast Slaying is good for grinding while leveling more than anything. Main issue is that you’re missing out on Berserking, but the dps increase isn’t that high.
---
Yup and if you actually knew anything you would know mac responds by saying both of those things. 
---
Cheers bud /r/woosh is just around the corner. Have a good day
---
On the upside, there's no risk of getting Gnomeregan in the random dungeon finder! I mean, sure, it's because there's no LFG tool but it means I'll never have to set foot in there again.
---
But we can't have them on a shammy in classic, cause they can't dual wield, right?
---
Daldabs!
---
Sadly most people don’t see it that way. There is always that one guy who wants to look good for the boss by being a little trooper. He comes to work with a high fever and horrendous cough. Don’t worry though, he feels fine.
---
Well, (not counting people who are just bad people who want to steal and make everyone else miserable) before it was because nobody knew how to play. I think the problems that will arise now is that people are going to try to play Classic like they do Retail and it's going to end up in a lot of disappointed and abandoned characters.
---
I dunno, never bothered trying max. Whatever it defaulted to gives me smooth FPS, couldnt tell you the exact number. I dont care much about graphics, explains why i mostly play RCT2, AoE2, and Classic WoW lol.
---
“This isn’t to bash anyone’s play style “ so where exactly is the implication? I apologize you couldn’t comprehend the question like the others who actually responded with logical reasons . I’ll try to dumb things down even more next time for you friend .
---
I played obsessively from original vanilla, to cataclysm and have just stopped playing private servers in prep for Classic to stop burnout, I’m good dude haha, more just a reflection on how it’s changed over the years.
---
Elysium is pretty good, just got done levelling my 3rd char to 20 just to give them a test before classic

There isn't even room for the 3rd Warlock's Corruption, there's definitely no room for your Mindflay and Shadow Weaving, let alone anything else you cast.
---
What's happening here is when he's jumping down the stairs, here's what happens:
---
* He jumps off the higher stairs with mobs chasing him
---
* His feet leave the ground, server sees his position stop
---
* Mobs slap at the frozen position on the ground for his long fall
---
* He lands
---
* His server position updates and mobs start chasing him again
---
Photoshopping?  On MY internets?  It's more common than you think.
---
&gt; If the one hunter misses
---
Obviously just one.
---
Basically because I want to clear MC in 30 minutes instead of 2 hours.
---
Polearms require level 20 to learn.
---
When did they remove it, and how did it work?
---
Lmao that's great
---
Look at it this way: Classic is a game that's been "beaten". For a lot of people its not about the content because it's not new to them, they did it already. IT's about how fast and efficient and good they are at beating it again. Like playing Spuper Mario Bros. after you beat it already, you're trying to see how fast and good you can be at it.
---
WAS  
---
THAT  
---
SHIT?!
---
Why are the warlocks using corruption...? They don't use that on bosses.
---
&gt;The mounts are "Bind on Use," so it is still possible to get them even after armored mounts are introduced.
---
That sounds like a huge red flag for the economy. People hording something only because we now know it'll be removed.
---
I'm implying that the people back then didn't do any indepth research, they just parroted bits and pieces of information they heard from somebody else. The reason private servers are wrong is because they're based on that old information, even the blue posts from back then are wrong.
---
Soda is a butt munch, though.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
If you are horde go with shaman. Shaman with STR totem, earthbind totem (look up earthbind kiting - same thing as hamstring ) and post 34 windfury totem (GOD THE W-I-N-D-F-U-R-Y) will make your warrior a wrecking ball. Go deep fury with warrior , use imp cleave/whirlwind pull 4 mobs , cleave WW them down and the shaman just heals you.
---
Also : doing dungeons while dual boxing is only doable at very low levels. Like SFK are the last thing you'Ll probably can do. Thing is many things are super inconvenient for dual boxing like melee range taunt so doing dungs with both chars are night impossible after certain levels.
---
Ooooo heck yes. My personal favorite was climbing the ironforge mountain or up the southern cliffs of azshara to /taunt horde players from above
---
Then why, of the ~130 recorded Naxx clears before TBC dropped, was there not one Shadow Priest?
---
Wow really cool to see some of guys from ropetown on executus there
---
still vanilla but pre bc patch so we had access to the op bc talents
---
60 though
---
Not really.
---
Damn bro u hit gm on the priv server hella sikkk
---
If someone in my raid was playing a dps spec that does at best 50% the damage of one of the viable dps specs I’d expect them to put in way more effort than the other dps since they’re basically being carried. If you were a super try hard with full consumes and helping people with dungeons all the time then maybe, but as a casual? No way.
---
Wait, you were playing wow in the kitchen?
---
JK no hate rip man
---
My one alt warrior in vanilla was fury... because fury was dope af even back then.
---
I played casually my first time playing wow vanilla back in the days and it was so flippin fun even when I had no idea what I was doing. I spent so much time in Scarlet Monastery trying to get some gear for my pally.
---
In "dark mirror" it's explained that the intact bodies are much more durable then regular forsaken
---
I believe you, and at the same time I remember some wonky stuff happening in bgs a long time ago with flags and captures.
---
That video isn't a great proof to me though, or a great example.
---
Looks like he could have just missed it.
---
Thank you ❤
---
It's really not. It's less fun imo playing two characters badly instead of one well, but there's no doubt it is quicker to dual box if you want to level alts and don't mind paying for 2 accounts.
---
This is actually a really serious answer.
---
Any confirmed raid times?
---
you dont play sl/sl warlock in vanilla at all
---
Blood fury is melee attack power. Orc is still a good hunter race though
---
I’ve done this with quite a few people from work actually. I just help me out sometimes and lots of time if they ask to play I just tell them no. I don’t sacrifice my fun for someone else. You have to make it clear what the relationship is right away. You can play sometimes but it’s not expected to play all the time. More acquaintances than friends.
---
Mostly for social reasons. Human areas is where everyone wants to be at. Night elf zones are actually more optimal for leveling because they’re so deserted and the quests are less spread out.
---
The area has the first dungeon for life level alliance characters and there more players around to quest with. So it's generally a bit easier to get groups and level.
---
What? no.
---
Completely wrong, orc and troll are nowhere near to be "close in terms" for dps. Haste is practically useless from zerking while you have the allmighty +wep skill for axes which is HUUUUUGE and the extra ap from fury takes the cake by far. Endgame the wep skill can be problematic as most of the high end lategame weps are not axes but rather swords and maces but still orc &gt; troll on anything. Trolls are generally considered a "troll" (pun intended) for minmaxing gaming in vanilla. They are just terrible racials-wise
---
Everyone’s got their special zones. I loved darkshore for whatever reason. It’s all based on everyone’s unique experiences. That’s why wow is great
---
I known right.....
---
I played a Tauren and Orc hunter in vanilla. I loved warstomp in pvp. Where most hunters would scatter + ice trap I could simply stomp + ice trap. This meant I had scatter later. 
---
This was incredibly helpful vs warriors for kiting. Stomp + trap. Get max range aimed shot combo. Scatter after their intercept, and cheetah on my way out. Concussive shot and go back to aspect of hawk if they were good warriors (bad ones wouldn’t use their gun or bow on you but good ones would and daze you in cheetah). They would never catch me again. 
---
That being said. Orc was just so much easier. A rogue missing a kidney or cheap shot on you meant game over for them. Same with a lot of other stuns.
---
Go with your gut. You will be good either way.
---
Shut up virgin
---
Demon hunter was meant to be a prestige class that night elves could be once they hit max level? Or something like that. 
---
They also wanted to put it in Burning Crusade, too.
---
I'm in the beta and did a bunch a testing around clearcasting. it is 100% per arcane missile cast, not per tick. i killed 100 mobs using only arcane missiles and got 8 clearcasts with a 10% chance. a little low but within normal rng. if it were per missile i would have seen 4X the number of procs.
---
Auberdine.  I love its perpetually gray, gloomy skies.
---
NE starting area is fine.  I typically level up to about 15 or so and then head to Westfall to get DM quests.  Can’t play an alliance char without doing Deadmines 😁
---
Have a patchwork of gear is charming when you consider encumbrance. All that plate is heavy, so why not let other armor go to waste if you can equip it? I actually miss being able to mix and match armor types on pallies, shammies, and druids. It's my "class fantasy" to use modern WoW's buzzword. Of course, I used to RP as an eccentric paladin healer who wore a dress. Kind of like a Month Python character!
---
I would love to try and find my old vanilla friends but it's been so long ago I can barely remember any of their names
---
Your character is your achievement. The great it has will represent the level of neckbeardedness.
---
Thank you so much! Been using this for years on 1.12.1
---
I dont understand how you come to that conclusion. Melee range extends for Tauren, yes. That doesnt affect their Ranged Weapon AT ALL. Having a bigger melee range, means your enemy has to move further away from you to be in your deadzone MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DEADZONE YOU. Furtehr more, your deadzone is smaller, since your ranged minimum is the same, yet your melee maximum is larger. This means a tauren hunter has the smallest and most difficult to find deadzone of any hunter.
---
I’d be interested forsure if you guys are looking!
---
Shaman version of Blessing of Salvation is [Totem of Tranquil Air](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=25908), but it's pretty bad for melee as you want to use Windfury totem. Unless you are a pro shaman and totem twist, but even then you'd rather use [Grace of Air Totem](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25359).
---
Deadmines and stockades.
---
Also pictured: 3 rogues and a druid waiting to gank.
---
Racials don’t care about your feelings.
---
It might be a little long right now but I'm certain most of the issues here are just because people haven't played vanilla WoW in well over a decade and are used to the networking actually being good.
---
Great was to build a rep as trash and never get invited to shit ever again.
---
Oh wow I forgot about the idea of prestige classes totally. I remember being so hyped hoping BC would add them
---
have you looked into cloning?
---
SL/SL was before patch 3.0 then?. I get confused both builds.
---
I know the cooldown on tranq is 20 sec. It's been over a decade since i fought mag as a 40 man but whats the normal cycle for his enrage?
---
His first time under storm wind ever.  He’s a noob
---
Average will honestly be 2 months. 
---
8 days /played playing 3 hours a day = 64 days.
---
Ur stat prio is : Agi-Spirit-Str-Stam.
---
Thoose who say STR-Stam are wrong. Google is your friend.
---
Ah a man  of culture.
---
Back when they announced Hero Classes being an elite unlockable class similar to Allied Races, I thought they would be the first Hero Class. They then scrapped the idea and released DK.
---
Because that is during Vanilla when people hadn't figured the game out lmao. Why on earth are you looking at Vanilla data? There are a ton of things different now to then. Players have found ways to min max and tweak almost every class has since then. More advanced players and math have proven that shadow priests are statistically worthwhile to bring along to a raid. People weren't speed-running and clearing the entirety of Naxxramas in under an hour in Vanilla like they are now.
---
Plus, corruption isn't even a priority debuff, it gets overridden straight away and it's a statisticaly DPS loss even casting the thing as it triggers the 1.5s global cooldown... better off casting a shadowbolt. You've proven you don't know what you're talking about, so i'm done with this convo now.
---
How would they know if you're on classic wow if you miss work unless they are also missing work and on classic wow?
---
Can you give just one example of something that is easier to /emote instead of just typing normally?
---
Is this copy pasta because I have a feeling that the whole living room is about to stand up and start clapping
---
Well they were also broken at launch due to one bugged ability. I kid you not early vanilla paladins could dps and tank better than a warrior. One fix to one ability and they weren’t that OP anymore.
---
Shhhhh its a secret
---
The important thing to remember is you can do absolutely whatever you want with your own character.
---
After that, it's a social issue.
---
Nobody can tell you how to play your character, but you also can't demand that people accept your character and do whatever you want them to.
---
There should be plenty of other people playing casually as well, whether that means playing 'weird' specs or just not leveling the standard ones quickly.
---
As long as you look for like minded people to play with, you'll be fine.  Just don't demand that a 'hardcore' raid take you along.
---
Ya lol like whats the name of the fat B that they normally cast. Bernadette or something? She definetly knows her role lol
---
It’s 2.0 onwards as you don’t have enough points for both link AND siphon life until you hit 61 :)
---
Pepwige Fams Remebers
---
MOAR DOTS..., okay stop dots
---
Right.  Every time you attack, you use whatever reck stacks you've accumulated.  So if you just turn off autoattack you will build up stacks if you're being attacked
---
He missed it?  Did you watch the video where he was carrying the flag and it was removed from him?
---
Well.... we're waiting
---
You can totally play Classic casually. Most of the "work" you have to do is in the first couple of patches. Get to 60, get pre-raid gear, get consumables, get epic mount etc. Once you get setup properly you can make enough gold for consumables with lvl 35 alt(s) making Cured Rugged Hide, Arcanite Bars and Mooncloth whenever CD is off. Other ways of making gold vary depending on the class you play - there's lots of videos and discords/forums where you can ask more specifically about it.
---
I would imagine there will be lots of options for people that play sub-optimal specs. It's important to remember what that means though - your raids will be slower and less efficient, you will have to do much more work to compete with classes running optimal specs etc.
---
People won't call you out if you find the right environment and are upfront about what and how you intend to play.
---
The way I see it - overall - you will actually use less time playing in a guild with a more hardcore setting. They will clear all raids in 1 night, maybe 2 once AQ or Naxx comes out. This will give you more time to farm more gold, PvP, lvl alts, fooling around and doing whatever or just take care of IRL stuff.
---
Dun Morogh is my fav alliance zone, but Mulgore is my fav horde zone 💕
---
SL/SL requires 52 talent points (vanilla had 51), and became popular in BC due to resilience and the power of healers/sustain in arena
---
Multiple guilds and servers are critical.
---
Keep in mind if you’re a skilled player who manages to get a lot of gear and you have engineering, you’ll still roll the vast majority of the server. No fight is impossible for a warrior, good mages can lose duels to good warriors. Look up Tribe destroying North in a few duels.
---
Tried that and my ISP cut my internet without notice then sent like 5 copyright violation warnings and I had to get a lecture before they turned it back on. I wish I was joking.
---
Super weird feeling. Does anyone else feel like we are a bunch of online refugees looking for our families?
---
I never understood the whole clicking thing.  When I first played Vanilla and saw numbers on the actionbars, I just assumed you hit the number that related to that slot on the keyboard.
---
Now, don't remind me of the whole keyboard turning thing I did back then though :(
---
In additional to everyone else's answers, I'd also add Reputation. In Classic WoW you got a 5-20% vendor discount based on Rep'. At 60 you spent a lot of time in Stormwind and Ironforge based upon progression, that means significant vendor savings just for leveling in either area.     
---
This was less important after AV's repeatable quests were added (gave Rep' with all factions). But still helpful.
---
There are some names from the pserver scene lik goth and seuche that are insanely good at pvp, there are more but unfortunately most don’t even make videos, and they don’t really stream although seuche has a couple Vods up.
---
Hey, I would possibly be interested! I am still deciding on class, but I am likely going to go warrior and build my way up to tanking raids!
---
This guy
---
Hi, /u/-Teslacoils-
---
Not being an orc is a disadvantage if you're gonna PvP. Unless you really, really hate the look of orcs then always roll orc if you have the option.
---
