Whats your reason for going hunter with engineering?
---
---
---
It's definitely up there. I don't think anything could ever really top my anticipation for WOTLK. I started playing at 12; about 3 months before the launch of Wrath. I was so excited that I used to sneak the Warcraft 3 guide book into bed with a booklight. Every night I would read about Prince Arthas Menethil, his fall and his servants the death knights. I must have done it fifty times before November 13, 2008. I didn't even need to look that date up just now. 
---

---
But yeah, Classic is up there.
---
&gt;we lie
---
So is that the truth, or the lie?
---
As someone that played hunter on private servers in raids, it's really really easy and braindead. You just have to get an autoshot timer and read some theroycraft, then once you get the feel for it you could almost do it with your eyes closed. Proper pet management is overestimated about how hard it is.
---
I'm more concerned with what they consider the two brown properties.
---
Damn skippy! I want to look up and see the moon and stars when I'm running around after dark.
---
#hardo
---
How can it be downloaded?
---
I admire your no-life status on launch. Just a suggestion though...
---
You said you‚Äôre gonna go 30 hours straight then sleep 8, with only 5 hours sleep the following days. Since you‚Äôre treating this like a job it might increase your productivity and speed If say you did 18 hours first day and then slept for 7, and kept that up. 30 hours just seems so excessive that after around the 16 hour mark you would lose focus and move slower.
---
Good luck though!
---
I have a good Mike Morhaime story.  During the 2nd Blizzcon his band 'The Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftans' were the opening act for the Blizzcon concert and they needed someone to help move his bass to the stage, I got to be that honorary roady!  I got to carry the bass over, have a brief chat with him, he thanks me and then they kicked ass later that evening in for the concert.  10/10 would roady for Mike Morhaime again.
---
I didn't meet Sam Didier but I had several WoW:TCG cards signed by him from the first set that I had won hanging around the Dev building playing the WoW:TCG all the time.
---
YOU... are NOT PREPARED!
---
Every class is easy in pve. The thing rogues can do that is a bit harder than the basic rotation and proper layering/timing of cooldowns is using a swingtimer to gain more benefit from sword spec/HoJ/windfury procs by timing your abilities right, or energy pooling while fishing for crusader enchant procs.
---
Wrong, 10 is the last great one. It my second fav game of all time. 10 Is just incredible and has one of the best storys in ff ever. Also the gameplay was fun as hell and the remastered version has nice graphics. Perfect for me. everything after that sucked
---
Warlocks.
---
Mages flag carry and CC which warlocks cant do as well.  They have burst and the best peels. However, a full tier 3 warlock is legit a raid boss.
---

I posted the [Primary profession exclusive benefits - complete list](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bep2sl/primary_profession_exclusive_benefits_complete/) a few hours ago. I was looking for an overview like that, that just gave solid and to-the-point information. I couldn't find one, so I made on myself.
---
Oh, who cares. It's still funny.
---
You didnt present evidence.   You presented some random shit that has been generated ~3 months before the game is released.  Noone here is going to be able to convince you mara is in on launch.  So just stop replying lol.  You're obviously convinced it wont be... just wait and find out.
---
Tribute runs should net even more than that.
---
BRD pickpocket runs will get you around 50g per hour once you figure out an efficient route.
---
You've proven my point. You have no idea if they intend Phase 1 to be released all at once or if they consider phases as frameworks to be filled in. Use your head.
---
No
---
really just depends on your guild, you'd be an absolute monster with an anathema, zhc, and the rank10 set and that's all really easy to manage
---
There are so many, but I'll stick with a light hearted one.
---
I mained an Undead Warrior and I was on the zeppelin with a bunch of randoms coming into Tirisfal Glades.
---
A new-ish player was shocked and commented in /s that the zone was so dark and gloomy.
---
I responded to him by lamenting, "...yea that's how mom always liked it."
---
I got the entire zeppelin to start laughing.
---
It's hilariously awkward because it's so glaringly simple to pick out the discussion threads and ideas when they're coming from people who were part of the private server community.
---
Things are just different with blizzard classic. Kind of something you either get used to or you don't.
---
There is no way this is....*place beer down*...serious post? I mean I‚Äôm using 2 hands right now to type this. I‚Äôm outraged! :)
---
dude this is amazing thank you
---
oh yes that high res ultra hd model...can count the polygons.
---
While it looks like my guild will want a lot of people to have engineering, specifically I thought it would be practical to be able to make my own ammo and scopes. I also want to see if I can boost my DPS to not fall too far behind other classes in TAQ and Naxx. Guess I'll also see if Feign Death + either type of Jumper Cables is cool.
---
With the number of people in my guild who are going Engineering though, I kinda wish I was going for something else, though. I love being able to make and supply something rare or unique, and have a claim-to-fame on the server that way. That is not too likely to happen if I go Engineering.
---
good man
---
Thank you for your work on this. currently using it for my leveling plan :)))
---
It's always nice to know you're not alone &lt;3
---
this high quality
---
Assuming it works as intended, then you can't proc reck stacks by sitting.
---
Pservers had this bug but it wasn't supposed to be that way, so don't expect to see it in Classic.
---
warriors pay much more for their skills though it isn't a huge difference
---
Another note here; most people wont see edgemasters either. They will be very expensive on the AH.
---
Hey all. I just wrapped up another Memories of Vanilla video (this time about my adventures in Zul'Farrak for the first time) and wanted to see what other people experienced there? What kind of experience did you have your first time there?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For me, it wasn't too bad - other than a tank rushing forward too over-confidently at the beginning and the occasional facepull - but it was really long. How about you all? \^\_\^
---
Yeah, I finally gave it another shot two years ago and it's SO MUCH BETTER. They basically built an entire new game on top of the old game.
---
Well, I can see a lot of people thinking wands are going to be super important so they will craft loads to sell. But the market will be flooded with people doing the same thing so wands will probably be pretty cheap on the AH.
---
All of the attunement quests and key gathering quests. Really drove home the epicness and scope of the game. Traveling all around the world just to be able to fight Onyxia. The crazy quest to get the hammer needed to summon the Hydra in ZF. Running through 90% of BRD to attune for MC, doing all of UBRS to get into BWL and so many more. Not the mention of the perks of having all the keys to the lesser dungeons and being able to find groups easier or straight up selling access.
---
Can't wait for all of it.
---
.So you guys are just excited to play the game even though progress will be lost ?
---
Fuck yes!
---
If I spend 100 hours in beta to save 1 hour come live, that's time well spent.
---
C'mon beta, I got math to check and testing to do.
---
Damn this is an old joke. I remember browsing some WoW forum during BC and reading a guideline saying something like "no jokes about female armor--its been overdone"
---
It might have been the blizzard forums tbh
---
I was Alliance on Tichondrius for a little while. I transferred there for the PvP.
---
For most people respecing often will be too expensive. A lot of healers will be raid spec for progression, and some form of hybrid spec for farm. 
---
If you want to occasionally go feral, I would play the 0/30/21 spec for farm.
---
For a paladin i‚Äôm planning to eventually go holy reckoning during farm and most shamans will go 30/0/21 for farm as well.
---
From experience, min maxing on farm is pointless for non hardcore guilds. It will improve your guilds ranking for speed clears but so many guilds get used to destroying the raids that too much of the core can‚Äôt get into that progression mindset for naxx.
---
Egbert's Egg, Elekk Training Collar, and Sleepy Willy were all added for the Children's week event in Burning Crusade. The Truesilver Shafted Arrow can be used all year, not just around the Love is in the Air event. The Christmas pets need a snowball to summon, which might be useful to note. Also, the black PvP mounts required Rank 11 to purchase, which might also be useful to note.
---
Fair enough, I think I'll be able to distract myself with all the easter chocolate I'm not getting since I'm no kid no more
---
SC2 was my most anticipated game of all time, but Classic WoW is now a close second, and WC3 was up there as well.
---
You‚Äôve got Egbert etc which are TBC Children‚Äôs weeks rewards.
---
Yeah, I hear that. I was one of those trying to play on launch day. Brutal times. Then the game itself just sucked at first (it's an okay game these days!)
---
Honestly as a priest, I do not see a benefit of this off the bat.
---
leveling 1-20 is a breeze as a solo priest, so sharing XP would hindrance myself. Even after 20 - the main problem I may see is, 1 reduced XP because it is 2 of us and most importantly, the potential downtime because I may not be getting my last hit in to activate spirit tap and thus slow both of us down.
---
I used to think Justicar (Alliance) and Conqueror (Horde) were added towards the end of vanilla, but now I think it was added during TBC, which would make it ineligible for your list. Anyone else want to help shed some light on this?
---
I can't wait for Reforged!
---
it's up there with HL3
---
Just use your brains, people.
---
The same reason people play private servers...
---
Jeez, you know what I mean - it's like Black Lotus for Herbalists, or being able to Skin the Beast or Gyth.
---
&lt;2
---
Oh yes! Another Silvite upload! Been waiting for this one! Thank you! :D
---
That‚Äôs when I finally realized blizzards game model of ‚Äòall about the journey‚Äô crumbled.  I remember it being tough as hell back in the day to get through acts and then I jump into d3 and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm super sayen all over the place.  Then the end level is just horrid.
---
Fixed
---
No way
---
Tauren hunter is pretty good actually. War stomp is a nice get off me button in PVP and health bonus is ok. Orc may be better because of the stun resist and command but there are some fights a Tauren will win because of war stomp into grenade.
---
Back in ‚Äònilla he was no green Jesus yet my boy.  He was a fuckin WARLORD.  And I‚Äôm even ally.
---
Had been running with a group of 5 up to this point with no real tank (fury warrior, priest, 2 ret pallies, and a warlock). The tough pulls in here and our lack of CC showed up. Priest began taking aggro cause he was having to heal too much. We learned a lot on how to not be bad but died A Lot!
---
Imgur kills the image quality, could you upload it somewhere like Google Drive or Dropbox? That would be amazing!
---
what is ghost wolves? I dont think this ability is in vanilla
---
you may mean ghost wolf where you transform to run faster
---
It's a pretty big tie between WoW Classic and Warcraft 3 Remastered for me.
---
stopped reading at human
---
take this elixer and wake up in the sepulcher and maybe we can talk
---
None of the alliance racials are all that good for pvp, so just pick whatever looks nicer
---
This is the best reply ever.
---
Sorry, missed this first time, the chicken egg you listed says it summons a prairie chicken, it actually summons a westfall chicken. Also, while the quest itself can only be completed by an Alliance character, the egg that the chicken drops can be looted by anyone, so it isn't actually Alliance exclusive.
---
Never did play Vanilla, and my first memory of it in Wrath/Cata doesn't really matter. However, I am sure there will be some som amazing memories that have yet to be forged there! Can't wait for classic, and your videos is making me even more hyped! Thank you for your work, you are probably the most under appriciated Classic WoW content creator, you really do deserve more attention! These "memories of vanilla" videos are almost at like MadSeasonShow quality, and that's saying a lot! Have a good day! :)
---
I work as a security guarf at the entrance of a factory. I bought a used msi laptop just to play on my shifts. If we get a shortagr of eska bottles you know who to blame.
---
It will be better to just grind to 60 then respec to prot. Trust me I did something similar as priest and you get almost no xp doing dungeons at 58-60 and the grind takes forever without any gear.
---
You're the same guy from before, aren't you?  
---
Just pick human mage. You're absolutely DYING to play human mage so just do it.
---
2009 you was very rude.
---
I honestly expected the other picture.  Was expecting a laugh and was disappointed, lol.

---
So wheres your counter?  Do you have anything to add other than your disbelief of his work?
---
I agree that the color of the area and the terrain makes me immediately think Azshara when I look at the picture, but people are correct to point out the architecture looks more like something from Lordaeron or SM.
---
None of those things are on the list either.
---
Interesting that anyone can loot it although I suppose it makes sense. I'll fix that thank you for the input
---
Yes, can both be sold like rep turn ins and are also required for a legendary weapon.
---
Swtor, lol I know.
---
Same, and it was such a good payoff. The love they showed to the hybrid classes was amazing. I know some things they added to the game get heavily criticized now, but flying around for the first time was freaking amazing, and I loved all the dungeons, even the ‚Äúhallway‚Äù ones.
---
nah
---
Lmao that's fair.
---
Warpath or the transfer guild Macabre?
---
epic
---
For a complete list they ought to be.
---
Private servers are unique, filled with try hard no lifers (not that it's necessarily a bad thing) and very, VERY toxic players. They are worse than any other Blizzard server I've ever played on combined, and I've been on many.
---
I don't think the Classic community is going to be anything like the private server community. I highly suggest you don't base any of your decisions on experiences from private servers.
---
Let's not forget - private servers are free. A lot of the toxicity is young kids who cannot afford/do not have a credit card for an actual subscription.
---
Classic community is gonna be tits dude. Play what you like.
---
I‚Äôm more trying to grab some gear pieces I need.
---
Why would limited view distance be a good thing?
---
Warriors that arent going to quit and know what they are doing.
---
There will be alot of warriors.  Very few will know how to tank well.  Very few will know how to DPS well.  
---
If you can do both, and the constant grinding for money to pay for respecs and repair doesnt bother you.  You become a God amongst men.
---
How many total skills per class? Wonder what the gold cost difference is if you were to buy every single spell (which is a bad idea lol)
---
I don‚Äôt think he was there until TBC.
---
World PVP.
---
You're welcome! Glad you enjoy them! \^\_\^
---
If you don't spec into fire stuns, and you don't play a priest, you shouldn't care about WOTF or Orcs.
---
Gnomes have Escape Artist which is very useful in PVP, especially if you're a Warlock because they lack ways to escape roots and snares.

2 ret pallies, oh man.  But then again, leveling as anything else doesn't really work does it? ;)
---
I can second the "learned a lot on how not to be bad but died A Lot" bit. I think that's pretty much every dungeon experience in vanilla XD And especially as a priest who had to heal a lot of dungeons back in the day, I know all too well about healing aggro. It sucks, but it's awesome too :P
---
This is like the third time today this exact post was made.
---
Tell that to all the priests and pallies who won't have rez in deadmines or wailing caverns lol
---
That would be the exact reason why I'd think limited view distance would be a bad thing. How do you find anyone to PvP?

We don't allow people to sell a product on here, so this post was removed.

That being said, I've had a lot on my plate in recent weeks due to some less-than-positive events at work, so I had to sort of rush this one out. I'm sure the quality's not quite the same as previous videos, but I really wanted to keep content coming. 
---
I should have better footage in coming weeks though ;)
---
You managed to get, this one included, 5 comments out of me. Good job. Please continue to enjoy your day, wherever you are.
---
No problemo - I checked the rules and it didn't say that was an issue.
---
Cheers :)
---
&gt;1)The wording of the quiver - ranged attack speed. Implies it should work with wands, a ranged weapon.
---
Because wands use arrows?
---
when i got catfished by a "girl" i kept running through scarlett monestary for xp. cool part was i gave him my account info too, so all my stuff got vendored and i had to change my name, cause he deleted my character and someone else took my name in the meantime.
---
you can heal raids with heart of the wild spec, nobody looks at druids heal meters anyway, you're there to innervate and decurse
---

Let me know if this is better.

My hype for Halo 3 was unmatched.

But Classic WoW blows it out of the water.

Ugh

I wish they'd just make a KOTOR 3

I said almost ;)

And also, you don't need to rush content, if you need an extra day off, then by all means go ahead! No need to worry or fret about your viewers, they don't mind waiting another day or two. That said, I at least still very much like seeing your videos pop up on my recommended!

They did exist in TBC. My Druid got Exalted with the WSG, AB and AV factions during that expansion, and was rewarded with the Justicar title.

So because I enjoy this crazy conspiracy kind of stuff. I watched the video where the Osconty and July were shown and the july changes to a Gaskeldo. I googled it and found other guys who saw this as well which found a result on wowhead for gaskeldo. Look in the source code for that page and it will list a quote by a gnome warlock. Now go to the Wow armory and look up gaskeldo and the gnome warlock's gear. Add the gear score numbers up and today they equal 88, which is how many days there are until July 16th.... I am probably crazy but thought it was a fun exercise.
---
This is so fucking true, but I just like smacking mofos with big 2h swords and tanking so warrior it is. But if I wasn't so sure I know it would slowly be Hunter in the end just for the relaxing ease and higher skill cap rotation in raiding

---
You‚Äôre right. Wowhead says the title itself was added in BC.
---
Well, it's not for me but I don't blame anyone for whom it is. Probably my most hyped I ever got for a game release was Wind Waker.
---
I think my largest game hype ever was Warhammer Online. I was pretty pissed by the decisions Blizzard kept making to WoW, so naturally I tried to seek refuge there. We all know how that game turned out...
---
WoW Classic is a close second to that. I‚Äôm pretty hyped for Classic.
---
That game was so amazing while leveling up. Then you hit max level and....wtf.
---
Warhammer Online. I feel your pain, bro.
---
i was thinking about playing a druid since i've never played one before but now idk anymore
---
johnnyboy - epic gamer on a quest to victory. lookout !
---
I currently play a tauren hunter on ND and quite enjoy it. Warstomp has saved me from many a shatter combo.
---
Game was a solid leveling experience. I hate they didn‚Äôt do anything with endgame though.
---
Sprite darter, chicken egg pets too.
---
Yea. The devs are making pretty good progress. No dates have been announced,  but I think it will be at least 2 years before release. CohhCarnage will be streaming it next week if you want to check it out.
---
I'd agree with staying arms. You really don't need to be prot to tank 5 mans. Even UBRS being prot is kind of overkill. By doing a 31/5/15 arms spec you get access to the most important talents from prot and have a decent kit for farming/PvP/the odd time you may be a second warrior. I wouldn't go deep prot until you are actually expected to tank raid bosses.
---
That was pretty damn sweet. Elemental crits, natures swiftness and the ghostwolf talent, thanks for showing me this. Classic cant come soon enough
---
Why only Priest not Paladin ?
---
Why priest? Druid or pally makes more sense.
---
^_^ Thanks! I appreciate the support!
---
Our guild was called Onslaught.
---
We all started on the day the server opened up and for maybe the first 8 months of the server we had all the Horde side firsts through BWL and controlled the flow of Rank 14s.  
---
After it broke up me some of the leadership server transferred our Tich characters to the Alliance side and we joined up with them since we had built up a very competitive yet friendly rivalry with the Alliance sides top guild.  
---
I think this is a part a lot of people excited about classic want to tap into actually.  We had so many great epic battles with them, they became our friends out of respect since we had so many epic battles against them.  When our guild broke up they were the guys we wanted to play with.  Good times!
---
So you're telling me those guilds had Naxx on farm. Okay.
---
Is this Johnnyboy from VOID? It's Mehsiah =D
---
Omg the Tich PvP scene was amazing.  When my friends and I all got WoW I wanted to play on a PvE server and they convinced me to roll Tich and I am so glad I did lol.  That server taught you how to be a total bastard in PvP, in the best way possible!
---
I'd say Halo 2 was for me getting Xbox Live few weeks before release but Classic is up there.
---
&gt; Contest Winner's Tabard (Fansite Contest Giveaway
---
This was earned by getting the #1 amount of HKs when they introduced the PVP system
---
Would be cool if you just had a sliding scale of usability. Non engineers using a bomb might have a 25% chance of it blowingring up on them, whereas actual engineers could have just a 5%, or wtv. Weaponsmith get a bit more stats/dps out of crafted weapons, etc.
---
They came out 6 years apart. Unless you're taking about the remakes.
---
Stop offering your "I wonder, do you know? But I thought I knew?" answers. It's not a fucking belf in the pic and youre a retard for the conversation having come this far.
---
Won't happed. No way it would happen. There will be first to 60 races on all servers when it launches, if anyone were to keep anything there would be an outrage.
---
Yeah its really immersive only being able to see someone 20 yards away. haHAA
---
No, lol.
---
How? What?
---
Keep in mind a good chunk of Druid is shapeshifted abilities
---
1000¬£ is overkill for a classic machine, I would say. 
---
They are boosting it for higher resolutions but the only real change spec wise is the ability to be run on 64 bit processors. 
---
You can probably get away with a machine half your budget.
---
Oh people will find a way
---
Skyrim was pretty huge for me. Was a big morrowind and oblivion fan, so was counting the days to midnight release. Wow, I played in the US first while visiting friends and then grabbed it in the EU when it came out day 1. That was also right up there!
---
Couldnt care less. Bigger hills to die on
---
I'm sure about Copper and [Arcanite](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16243/formula-runed-arcanite-rod).  The others I am just assuming they are learned 15 levels before they turn yellow, like the Arcanite.
---
odd threat
---
Yeah I mean obviously it was fine in vanilla, but that was a time when FPS was harder to come by. I don't think it was a game play design choice.
---
That's all proven false.
---
Soloing tribute run with only tier 2.5....
---
There are much easier ways to solo tribute runs that don't require AQ40 to be on farm.
---
Rogues can just smell out other players.
---
Whether the rogue is good or not and whether their victim is geared or not is whole other issue entirely.
---
It was awesome this way.  By the time you saw someone there was only a couple of seconds to decide if you were going fight or flee.
---
Naw go get AOL dialup.
---
That's definitely not a boner in my pants.
---
I'll be on a PvE server, too. I'll have PvP enabled during long weekend sessions - and when I'm grinding/questing. But I like being able to turn PvP off when I'm trying to get to a dungeon or logging in to do some quick housekeeping stuff.
---
Blizzard put the beta client on the back end of their servers. People data mined it.
---
Yeah. Was I supposed to type back your post to you before I add my two cents?
---
I'm super hyped for this game, and I've never even played it. Everyone I know that has played the game has nothing but praise for it. Don't know what to expect but I imagine it's probably good! lol
---
I never thought about it from that perspective but you‚Äôre absolutely right lol
---
Nope. Made up.
---
Is that a roll of quarters or are you just happy for Classic WoW?
---
I've been playing Outward. I love it.
---
Classic but good
---
My memory of the actual distance is probably inaccurate, but I just think having increased view distance can only improve the experience.
---
Some zones it wouldn't matter because the relative terrain is always within the distance, but big open zones like barrens or arathi highlands, desolace, silithus could benefit from increased view distance so you don't accidentally walk past some action.
---
It actually is for me. Vanilla wow is easily my favorite game ever. I haven't been this hyped for a game since half life 2
---
My most hyped game releases: 
---
1. Classic wow 
---
2. Half life 2 
---
3. Battlefield 3 
---
4. Dark souls 2 
---
5. Battlefield bad company 2 
---
6. Swtor 
---
7. Oblivion 
---
8. Skyrim
---
If this were true, I would suggest you use the advantageous setting.
---
Jesus you made more in 2005-2008 than I do now. What the fuck is this world...
---
Orc if you want to minmax, if you don't like the visuals then UD is fine too
---
&gt;didn't even bother
---
Mate this was before 16:10 and waaaay before 16:9 monitors went to mass markets.
---
In 2001 people hadn't even heard of 720p
---
You‚Äôre not wrong but all of the rotations are brain dead at the end of the day.
---
Hunters are a dwarf along midgets.
---
Wotlk has no place in classic. My post was about patch progression servers.
---
Somebody gold this man
---
Does this image imply that there will be retail 2019 levels of graphics in vanilla? Or is this ‚Äúultra‚Äù in 2006 kind of ultra?
---
Then don‚Äôt
---
UD is classic for looks and A E S T H E T I C. But if you don't care about that, Orc for that stun resist. Oh lordy it's good for pvp. But Will of the Forsaken for undead is great too. They're both great choices for rogue. 
---
In the end play what youll be happiest staring at for hundreds of hours.
---
Yes. Hands down. Absolutely no question.
---
There is no game I've ever enjoyed more than vanilla WoW.
---
MVP
---
Damn, I got a boner looking at how smooth the warlock skill transition is.
---
I took a lunge at a GM once. It did no damage and he turned around and one shot me for like 50k. He insta rezzed me and restored all my gear to full dura, so I guess I came out on top?
---
Yes he did
---
Where do I pause my experience gain? I want to twink.
---
Kingdom Hearts 3 for me.
---
Haha!  I would say so!  You have a story to tell and you didn't even have to take a dura hit!
---
You're a blight on humanity.
---
If it means anything, I agree with your initial rational MrHackberry. There are hundreds of websites that list everything a profession can do which would meet NascentBehavior's needs. Your list is a very helpful compilation of what professions a character must train in order to ever use/access specific items.
---
I‚Äôd imagine priest would be pretty fun in a well coordinated duo that leaves every kill for you, you‚Äôd almost have 100% spirit tap uptime. If you played with a warrior executing everything than yeah it‚Äôd be pretty painful.
---
So i would say we get a update about it next week with dates of Start of the beta and release date
---
Also thanks for answering so much questions.
---
I started wow in middle school as a gnome mage which was my only character. I played him til level 85!
---
Anyway, yeah, I thought I was sooo good that I left Dunemaul for Tich and got my ass handed to me. I ended up getting Season 3 shoulders which you needed to be Arena Rank 2500 for, but after that I missed the people of Dunemaul too much and I went back.
---
1 day after making this post and OP responds within 1 minute to my comment.
---
Confirmed GM. This guy isn‚Äôt faking it.
---
We don‚Äôt deserve you.
---
I remember going to future shop and buy three of these for my sister, her bf and myself. God damn that was a fun time.
---
I had even quit playing wow for it. Like a month after I hit end game I cancelled my sub and I went back to wow.
---
VOID as in the guild Victims of Internal Decay VOID?
---
I wish the translated the leveling up content into endgame content. Much like Blizzard I think they didn‚Äôt realize people would blaze through their content so fast and were not ready for it.
---
&gt;Your active racial is pretty mediocre since you can already stealth.
---
Uhm, Shadowmeld actually passively increases your stealth level so you are harder to detect. It's not very well known but it says so right on the skill.
---
Did this till aq40 in vanilla days
---
Everyone will play for different reasons. I want to try it out for sure and hope that I will continue playing, but my life is just so different now than when I played at 16 that I feel like I won't be able to really play the endgame outside of dungeons since I can't commit to a 3-4 hour raid with a newborn baby. If they can get the raids down to like 1-1.5 hours long I could swing at least the odd ZG run. I wish I had more time to commit for the full experience though. The leveling is boring early on  until you get better skills and a mount so spending the whole beta just getting to level 35 and needing to start over again feels like a pain to me personally, that is when it starts to get really fun.
---
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds super unhealthy. Classic WoW isn‚Äôt going anywhere, take care of your body..
---
Ive been more outwardly excited about other games, but im really, really, really looking forwards to finally come home again.
---
Druid.
---
-A tier leveler. Very fast, low down time, can stealth and tank multiple mobs.
---
-Can perform any role while leveling. 
---
-Strong DPS/Tank/Healer at 60. However DPSing and Tanking do take some significant effort to perform well in.
---
I'm gonna be fucking broke at lvl 60
---
I was at the midnight release, and we managed to get home by 1:30 am. We couldnt get in until about 4am and I stopped playing after about 2 weeks.
---
No, probably Halo 3 or Mass Effect 2. Both of those were following-up literal masterpieces and I was young and more impressionable at the time. WoW Classic is something I've seen before, something I've experienced as recently as a few years ago. I'm excited AF, don't get me wrong, but it's missing the mystery/unknown factor that really builds the anticipation in other games.
---
That said, I fully plan to lose hundreds of hours of my life this year to Classic.
---
You don't deserve classic, wow.
---
You can still find people perfectly fine lmao but having a maximum distance adds another element to the game. It's not a tiny view range at all
---
Vanilla WoW is the best video game ever made imo
---
this is a game specific sub though, doesn't exactly give you a fair representation of the masses. I'd argue that most people bounce around to whatever's hot at the moment and it's probably harder to get them to stay on one game for an extended period of time. We're a very small sample size.
---
Yep, she's definitely a keeper if she's cool with being ignored for long periods of time.
---
Even while leveling up, the combat left a lot to be desired. The writing was on the wall with that game, it just covered it up well with great story.
---
lol
---
I‚Äôd also like to know this answer.
---
Thanks man. I was looking for this exact type of list myself, as another aid in helping me select professions for my main. Since I couldn't find it, I decided to try to make it.
---
I may try to rewrite the goal and conditions for the list though, in order to try and make it as clear as possible what the post is about and what things belong on the list. Not right now, though, too tired :)
---
Yup!  I think that is why server migrations ultimately are a good thing.  Your priorities as a player change over time and that allows you to find the pockets of the World that best fit your current play style.  Who you play with really makes a game I feel!
---
I was just contributing to the thread topic, not sure what you expected :/
---
Yes it is
---
Yup I never realized how much I miss that feeling until now. Playing Destiny on Xbox doesn't even come close. I look forward to playing classic!
---
We definitely tried! üòÇ
---
Keep note that a portion of those abilities are just upgraded forms of previous abilities
---
Haha thank you!  You are to kind!  I am just an excited fan like everyone else these days!  But I am glad everyone found so much interest in my experience!
---
I had a lot of fun reminiscing and reliving the vanilla WoW days with everyone and am really more than happy to answer questions and share in the excitement with everyone!  I am really looking forward to classic WoW!
---
Yea I wouldnt be surprised with beta start date announced next week since they'll prolly run beta in May.
---
piccolo of the flaming fire. drops from a rare in strathome. causes people around you to dance
---
Not sure if it counts as ‚Äòvanity‚Äô, but piccolo of the dancing flame is pretty cool. Drops from a rare spawn in strath
---
You can but you won't have priests trainers...
---
Lmfao exact same here. I remember mining enough copper bars to get my first 2g (seemed like a lot back then) and spent it on a fiery enchant for my axe. As a hunter. I thought it was just so damn cool.
---
Ah, dang.. That is a good point. Thank you. Totally forgot about that part :D
---
Industry standard for a completely new game, sure. It‚Äôs the same exact game we played 14 years ago.
---
It looks like you don't see what I am trying to do with this thread, what kind of information I am trying to distill. I thought it would be clear, but I guess not. I'll try to do a rewrite of the OP to try and make it clearer, later on.
---
Gotta love those intel integrated graphics
---
And you do coming into a thread just to flame? Have a wonderful day bud.
---
Works for me :)
---
Not to sound like a noob but what does ‚Äúminmax‚Äù mean
---
You could do level 1-6 with level 1 spells (it's not hard), run to Thunder Bluff, train up there, run back and continue. There is a quest in Thunder Bluff around that level that has you go back out into Mulgore, so you could train spells again during that time.
---
Fuck. Yeah it‚Äôs really obnoxious that they do that shit. Completely breaks my immersion when I log in and see what year it is :(
---
I always liked to run to my allies for starter quests so I could maybe get their level 40 mount, cause I'm a hipster wiener.
---
I'm hyped for Classic, STALKER 2, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, Cyberpunk 2077 and generally hyped for anything from Larian Studios, after giving me the best gaming experience in over a decade with D:OS2.
---
I'll keep an eye on Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima is like the Quentin Tarantino of videogames.
---
Other than that I'm always hoping for an MMO set in the StarCraft or Warhammer 40k universe.
---
Fair enough for TS. I think I've been convinced on Warr DPS needs that require leather armor. It's still unfair tho, not fault to the players but rather the loot balance.
---
Nope. Get rekt.
---
We're just having fun, yang dick. Go "REEEEEEE" Somewhere else.
---
Make 1 of each class and rotate with rest xp.
---
14year old self getting a cyber blow job in gold shire inn.
---
In retrospect it was probably with a 50 year old pedo on disability. 
---
Either way their txt was lit.
---
Personally I think people blow the utility of Hardiness way out of proportion. People act like orc is a no brainer choice but 75% of stuns will still ruin your day. Will of the Forsaken is legit, if you want to be undead go undead.
---
Good idea; or maybe at the bottom of each level to show those totals at least? But agreed, these are being made for free and they‚Äôre awesome.
---
I've been hyped for Cyberpunk 2077 for years, and that hype is real, but I'm definitely super excited for Classic, and it will take precedence over every other game for quite some time.
---
How will sharding level 1-12 zone severely hit the server community lol? You don‚Äôt interact with your entire server, in fact you don‚Äôt interact with more than a couple dozen people at once. There is literally no difference between playing with 250 vs 400 people in Elwynn. Are you afraid that one soulmate you might find will be sharded away until after you kill Hogger?
---
Coup is a really good card game. So under rated.
---
because I enjoy this crazy conspiracy kind of stuff. I watched the video where the Osconty and July were shown and the july changes to a Gaskeldo. I googled it and found other guys who saw this as well which found a result on wowhead for gaskeldo. Look in the source code for that page and it will list a quote by a gnome warlock. Now go to the Wow armory and look up gaskeldo and the gnome warlock's gear. Add the gear score numbers up and today they equal 88, which is how many days there are until July 16th.... I am probably crazy but thought it was a fun exercise.
---
 the wowhead entry is for the inn keepers daughter about making a deal with a gnome warlock and turned his daughter into a hearthstone... Fitting, you will return home in 88 days? God i need to stop
---
Great stuff. Will definitely be making good use of this. Thanks!
---
It's better to solo and meet at 60.
---
Geez that feels like a long time ago
---
I want to level a mage (never played before), to have enough gold at 40 for mount what would you cross out on the field guide personally?
---
Nope. Save your money.
---
Did you try logging with user ADMIN and password ADMIN?
---
This always frustrated the hell out of me.  It's more of an issue on Blizzards end than the players, but a plate wearing class should be wearing plate in every slot.  Not only does it look retarded, but if you're going to wear cloth you may as well roll a priest.
---
Unless fromsoft goes back on what they said and announce Dark Souls 4, yes.
---
Yep, I had mining too. Would sell a stack of 20 copper bars at time. Felt so good lol.
---
Winning every single loot roll in wailing caverns with my friends until they were all convinced I was hacking. 
---
Whats better is all my rolls were 98 or better, except for the last one where we rolled a 3, and only 2 of them had rolled...
---
I never had such luck again
---
Then I was in a similar situation (quit early Cata, around the time Heroics were nerfed) as you are now when Classic was announced, except I had never played through the post-Cata 1-60.
---
I had the exact same thought after Classic was announced. For years I had absolutely no desire to return to the retail game and heard only tangentially that the game was declining. I, too, wanted to play through what the game had to offer at that point to see for myself and draw my own conclusions. So I got a fresh account and played pretty casually for two months, from 1 to 110. This was still in Legion, before the whole leveling revamp. 
---
Looking back, I'm glad I did. I don't what to taint your opinion should you choose to do the same, but going through what modern WoW had to offer just gave me a deeper appreciation of what once was. I will say that I discovered personal, grievous aspects of modern WoW that I would not have fully grasped had I not experienced it myself, things that simply can't be described to you through someone else's eyes. This experience is what has kept me pretty hype for Classic all year.
---
WoTF is often covered by your trinket. And it‚Äôs 65%, I believe there is a basic stun resist of 10% for everyone. Not to mention stun is one of the most powerful CCs, as little as one resist can ruin a CC chain, and Hardiness is always active with no CD.
---
I believe you are missing Tabard of Flame, which was redeemable via a code from the wow TCG game
---
Yes. A full retail wow subscription. It's blizzard pay day. They will use classic players subs to say that bfa is successful.
---
Lights played. She even had her own guild.

---
They will if they release same time at 8.2 retail.
---
Horribly disappointed.
---
I was a backup casual raider in a hard core raiding guild and ingot mine pretty early. If you are with the right people they will sub you in to get it once main raiders get it.
---
I am really curious also about the new models...
---
The achievement system was added in TBC during wotlk pre-patch.
---
It's not, because It'd been avilable all the time, just not officialy, for me it's more of "Finally, it's high time they did it". My most hyped game was of course Vanilla wow back when I was a kid, I'd take a sick leave because of a runny nose just to play it, and every day after school I'd run straight to my cousin's to play with him. 
---
As for more recent one now that I'm an adult, hmmm... As a member of community, definitely DS3, I was really into DS speedrunning at that time(still am, just not as much) and I stayed up all night just to watch people do blind runs (didn't have PC to play it at that time so I could only watch).
---
As a player, it was Legion. The pre-expansion event got me so freaking hyped for it, I marathoned to 110 for a day straight from release. If it wasn't for the sucky state of the game until NH I'd rank is as number 1 expansion. Unfortunately, I quit for quite a while because of shitty leggos and boredom, since Xavius was so undertuned I got my curve week 2 and I couldn't raid Mythic so I ran out of content to do. I came back like 1,5-2 weeks before ToS release and I just felt endless regret for missing out a better part of expansion.
---
Trinket cooldown is 5 minutes so I would hardly call that often. Innate stun resist is 5%.
---
Plan for end of august. That way set real expectations. If it's a few days or weeks early it's a win win.
---
No. Play retail first learn how easy game is. Then play classic.. then quit classic and go back to retail wow.
---
I heard the nights were much darker. Is this not true?
---
Not sure what your point is here, just a clip from a youtube video showing what a tribute run is. Just their to add context to what I am talking about :)
---
PvP for me is the only thing that makes sense for vanilla. It's the World of WARcraft. We're at war. People are going to be assholes and gank you. You will hate them. You will have to ask your faction for help. Maybe get your own 60 to counter their 60. Get a full group of randoms to finish your quest in a contested zone. Stuff like that. For me faction identity never felt stronger than when you and some other faction members rush at the people that have been killing you for the past 15 min. Unified and determinated with fire in your eyes... for the Horde!
---
Swap to alt and start treadmill over
---
For me it was Half-Life 2 but Classic is a very close second
---
How are you this dumb, I don't understand. Mara phase 1. Regardless of what you think, it's happening at launch. End of discussion.
---
I'm replaying WC3 as well. I just finished the third level in the Night Elf campaign where you wake up Furion Stormrage. The campaign is no joke on hard!
---
Thank you, this will be helpful in my Gilgamesh run. I plan on being a massive collector.
---
Every release of Super Smash I get pretty hyped, that and wow expansions are the only games I take off work for.
---
Wasn't Azure Whelpling a thing back then? I remember farming for some in Azshara to make some gold.
---
Idk why undead warrior gets shit on so much. The zombie knight is pretty popular in fantasy.
---
Rich Purple Silk Shirt is a very valuable world drop tailoring pattern. Getting that pattern is pretty lucrative as the shirt is super popular. Probably worth putting on the list.
---
Mine was being able to stealth past something with improved stealth.
---
I'll 100% be going Undead, but wether I go Rogue or Priest will be a last minute decision based on the server. If I do go to a PvP server then definitely Rogue.
---
Pally: I HEAL MYSELF WHILE I SMASH. 
---
Warrior: HEAL ME SO I CAN KEEP SMASH, BUT BETTER. 
---
Bear: ROAR SWIPE OH HEALER OOM I SWAP AND HEAL MYSELF THEN ROAR SWIPE. 
---
Warlock: Welp the tank died guess its blueberry's turn... Demons are the only trustworthy companions these days.
---
there are several tauren-only chains, so you will have to make up for them with grinding. overall, i wouldn't recommend it.
---
You can. Note at least one of their quest chains (the well cleansing chain) is Tauren only.
---

Everyone just assumes you're talking about dueling so yeah for that it's warlock. In plenty of useful situations in bgs like getting a flag back, defending a base, holding a chokepoint mage can do things warlocks can't. Ice Block, blink, CoC, remove curse, are very powerful tools warlock really doesn't have anything comparable. Of course warlock does have its own powerful set of things mages can't do too, but the idea that T3 Locks are god tier and mages suck is ridiculous.
---
You‚Äôll either love it to death or find it slow and alienating. I‚Äôm excited to see what people who never played back in the day have to say when it launches!
---
TIL people hate Troll/anything.
---
I kinda hope they HD up all the old texture
---
All were good games. The remake and Classic both in 2019.
---
Did you play Rift? o:
---
Partially done means it's not done...
---
GIVE IT TO ME IN ENGLISH
---
Let's see. I don't really hype anymore as the payoff never is really that great. Diablo 3 was close and we all know how that turned out.
---
Probably best to write it down in a diary/journal
---
Are you serious with "cloth-gay"? Grow the fuck up.
---
[removed]
---
Knowing how great they were in the past I'm surprised at how good they are now. Still, they leave a lot to be desired. The graphics on low end Ryzen laptops are much better than anything Intel has to offer in the area.
---
god mulgore is so racist
---
Minimize maximize - basically ekeing every last drop of efficiency/power out of your character. Someone who min-maxes would take X race over Y because X offers 3% better dps, for example
---
Do you plan to play classic? Do you know of any GM‚Äôs from vanilla that might also be a GM for classic?
---
Halo 3 is the only one to have ever matched my hype.
---
I think "Beta announcement by the end of April" and "Beta sometime in May" are safe bets. 
---
It's a hard read figuring out why they have the build on the CDN (unencrypted). Could just be a SOP thing - to have the build up for a few weeks while they do testing on connectivity between the build and the bnet infrastructure at-large. 
---
I'd guess they do an announcement before anyone gets access.
---
I also guess they do a closed (invite only) beta for a week or so followed by a longer open (all subs) beta.
---
Legend! This is great, thank you :)
---
Not sure if news...
---
This isn't good for my F5 finger
---
Burden of proof's on you.  Use those formulas to find this number: https://youtu.be/Rjdsf9HUGtY?t=157
---
How much vacation time do you get? Lol
---
This is a level of stupid beyond my comprehension
---
For the 100th time.
---
The following things are private server bugs and weren't in vanilla WoW:
---
1. Front-stabbing
---
2. Sit-critting
---
3. Quiver-wand
---
Original Warcraft 3 might be mine. For this year, technically unconfirmed, DOOM Eternal is a strong contender.
---
BC &gt; Vanilla.
---
Don‚Äôt @ me.
---
Skarm...he puts out some good content.  If I wanted to tank I would be following him closely.
---
Keep it up Yine.  You are doing great!!!  Thank you so much.
---
I remember being reaaally hyped for BC, but I was like 9 then, so I think I can embrace the hype more now, knowing I can put more time into the game, and don't have to share the account with family :)
---
In a sea of *my post naxx idea*, *does classic require BFA*, and *do I need sub to get into beta* posts, this is definitely news.
---
And even then you can skip out on a lot of warrior skills, a lot of which come from different specialisations too so in reality it's far far less than pictured.
---
Been gaming since 1998, and yes. Most anticipated ever. 2nd place probably wrath of the lich King. 3rd place halo 3... or reach.
---
Does Thunderbluff have a mage trainer? I know that Darnassus doesn't have a mage trainer at all. Makes Darkshore a little tricky as a mage, especially since level 14 is a frostbolt rank up but optimally you want to land in darkshore at level 12.
---
Incorrect. The classic client stands alone with its own version number. Once the game is out, you will launch WoW Classic, not WoW.
---
I wasn't good when I played vanilla, but I still loved it. Finally got good towards the end of TBC. Looking forward to trying my best in vanilla now that I actually know what I'm doing.
---
Make up for it with heals &amp; sustain though, means you can farm a lot better.
---
After reading all of the shit you wrote on replies to this post, I think the exact same thing, bud. "Phase 1 doesn't mean on launch" HAHAHAHA.
---
they're both pretty great.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for shaman spell guides with all the totems, ty!
---
Thanks!
---
So what, the bug reporting system they're launching in retail is in classic alpha / beta and this is a screenshot somehow?
---
Just set your region to the Americas from the bent launcher and you are set
---
Region?
---
"I mean, I heard that aren't even any respawn points in RL."
---
Thanks. Would this not cause lag tho? Just wondering if anyone has prior experiences
---
I could be wrong but I believe that the Tabard of the Argent Dawn was from the Naxxramas invasion event and was not tied to rep.
---
Pretend like I care what some moron on reddit thinks who has no clue about the game
---
How does this question get asked for every beta  for every game still to this day?
---
same here.  huge buildup and then...
---
I play on NA realms from Japan. WoW is one of the more forgiving games for high latency - I don't have many issues.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll keep track of this guy. Never tanked before but will tank with some people who have never played mmos before and wondering which to use. Lower complexity is definitely tempting right now but I want to be able to carry new players as effectively as possible
---
As a general rule, if it is an upgrade for your current role in the group (i.e. tank, dps or healer), then rolling need should be no problem (regardless of the armor type).  There are tons of great leather pieces for fury warriors for instance.  You can't expect them to pass on the item because a rogue also needs it.  With that said, I promise that if you win a piece of loot that someone else wanted, eventually you will find someone that will be pissed regardless.  Now if you are rolling on gear that doesn't fit your current role (i.e. you're healing for the group but want to roll on dps gear) I would ask (or maybe not ask, just state that you will be rolling on said gear) before starting the dungeon as a courtesy but that has never really bothered me either.
---
if you go for a 6 month sub its $12 a month too add to the convo.
---
Find a class that looks fun to you, please don't worry about viability at end game as they are all viable in some ways.
---
Here's a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8a84qt/playing_wow_from_korea/) about someone in a similar situation on retail.
---
Warriors are the only real tanks in vanilla.  Bears and paladins can meme a bit in 5 mans, but neither are raid tanks.
---
Racials
---
You care enough to reply to nearly every comment. Btw Mara is coming out phase 1 which means at launch in case that was too hard to figure out. You're welcome.
---
I remember learning totally on my own/by accident (was too young and stupid to read about stuff like this online or watch YouTube videos about it) that you could zone into Deadmines on a Mage and then blink back out of the dungeon portal and it wouldn‚Äôt actually give you the load screen and take you out of the dungeon instance. It would actually put you in the outer preinstance but still technically be in the instance of that makes sense. Only was was visible from the inside of the portal would load though. So I blinked back through and went down the hall and turned left where I saw essentially a tunnel that just stopped into the blue sky/open air. I jumped down and spent hours swimming around (it was a giant ocean with a few randomly scattered islands). I eventually swam until I was underneath SW I believe. Thought I was a pretty big badass and assumed I was the only one in the world that knew about this ‚Äúhack‚Äù haha
---
I haven't been paying attention to classic wow much. I don't want to be too excited about it too early. However, have the announced an actually release date besides this summer?
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS!?
---
If caring is taking 10 seconds to click a notification I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I think you need to brush up on your reading comprehension skills though kid
---
Dood its fucking hilarious back then. And it's hilarious now. That's just your opinion va my opinion.
---
Although it's illegal to show up at a real funeral and world pvp a bunch. I would also find that hilarious because I lack empathy
---
So i am on the final part for the priest quest. Been on it for a week straight. This group of alliance rogues have been griefing anyone who attempts the quest. I spent every bit of gold I had which wasn't much because those were some poor fucking times. Had just enough for one more attempt. Haven't heard anything anyone trying that day about the rogues. So I go out and fire it up. I do it perfectly and actually finish. As quickly as it said completed, both rogues come out of stealth and start dancing with me. Really not sure why they let me finish but I became first in guild.
---
ME3 for me. I still do a trilogy run every year. 
---
Classic would be number 1 but it‚Äôs not all hype. It‚Äôs part dread for me. I know I‚Äôm going to end up sinking so much time into it again.
---
I don't have the courage for hard.
---
I‚Äôve ruled paladin out but feral druids at least have a role as off tank, my main concern is 1-59 atm to make it as fun and easy as possible for my newbie group members.
---
The only one I ever got in trouble for was Mt. Hyjal - I'd been running around in it for almost an hour when I got ported out =/
---
I Myself have always liked Rouge like classes so ill have a look at that
---
If you want quality get a mumble server. Avoid vent it's trash.
---
Your insults are adorable and meaningless if you honestly think phase 1 doesn't mean at launch. This thread is just comedic gold. Cannot believe how fucking stupid you are.
---
You have the game *running*? Can I follow you somewhere or should I just refresh /new/ every five minutes?
---
I \*do\* know everything.
---
In the cave in the Spirit rise.
---
The horde equivalent in the Venomhide Ravasaur from Un'Goro was added in...Wrath?
---
Yikes, some top tier projection of I‚Äôve ever seen it. Can‚Äôt imagine the kind of life you must live if this was enough to upset you this much LOL
---
I hate you, this is such a tease
---
Cant say for him but I get three weeks a year and I get an additional week if I make it to my 4 year mark.
---
Union jobs.
---
The point of this screenshot is to show we have ingame access.
---
Please just accept that you are wrong and move on.
---
\&gt; wanted to start off with classic wow to gain the experience that everyone did when it first released   
---
\&gt; want to know of any tips or anything I should learn about before release   
---
Well you have to pick one. If you want the experience that everyone had back then , dont read/watch anything and go full yolo
---
Great looks like i just gotta worry about 250 ping which apparently is playable. Thanks!
---
Yup, people are datamining the Classic client that was put up on the public Blizzard network yesterday. Presumably this is a SS from someone that pulled up the default tooltip functionality.
---
Thanks!! So im good to go! Cant wait
---
Vanilla WoW ruined gaming for me.
---
Nothing has come close to how good it was.
---
The day we did UBRS as a geared 4 man and my friend fell off the bridge and died.  He never lived it down all the way through TBC. Man I miss that screenshot.
---
Wrong about what? That I brought up that something MIGHT be the case? The fact that all of you neckbeards are getting this upset that I‚Äôm saying Mara MIGHT not be in at launch is actually fucking hilarious.
---
I thought you didn't care? *Continues to reply to every comment showing that he does infact care*
---
Kara is my absolute favorite raid of all time.
---
I‚Äôm not upset lol just count your L and move on with your life.
---
You would think they would make it after all this time.
---
I'm still holding out hope for Resident Evil Outbreak 3 or a remaster, but Vanilla WoW is close.
---
Bre is such a sexy weapon
---
If you could read you‚Äôd notice it only takes a moment to reply, and I find it amusing how upset you are. It‚Äôs pretty hilarious to me imaging you in a dark room, fat rolls all over the place, sweating and breathing heavy like ‚ÄúWHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS BRINGING UP DISCUSSION, WHAT A GOD DAMN MORON HE KEEPS TAKING 30 SECONDS TO REPLY TO PEOPLE‚Äù. It‚Äôs legitimately hilarious to me.
---
4 Weeks a year?
---
I‚Äôve said nothing wrong though? I only brought up discussion that something might be the case, if you want to cry about it it‚Äôs fine by me but I couldn‚Äôt care less tbh
---
Same. Well sc2 was my favorite game to watch pro tournaments so in all fav but to play it‚Äôs wow not even close.
---
What‚Äôs the video about? Don‚Äôt posts like this get locked?
---
Here comes the caps lock. Yep, you care a lot.
---
No, not even in my top 3. I think my most hyped was probably Final Fantasy 8, which I ended up hating. Classic will be fun, but I already know what I'm getting.
---
Rogues are extremely OP in classic, you won't have any issue with that.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm talking more BG and WPvP
---
I‚Äôm not sure to be honest. I listened to 30 seconds of rambling before I stopped.
---
Blizz plesse bring back weather effects!
---
Genuinely useful information, good work.
---
You don't need 2.5 you just need like 4k or 5k Mana or something. Also it's not a tribute run, it's a lasher farm. Tribute runs are when you run to the end and solo the final boss
---
The caps lock was literally used to show how I‚Äôm imagining you, but I‚Äôm done replying to this you‚Äôre either a level of stupid even past the level I‚Äôve seen elsewhere in this thread or you‚Äôre trolling, and either way it‚Äôs not even worth the moment it takes to reply to at this point.
---
Thank you very much! I didnt know about this.
---
Saw 3 out the first 4 or 5 drops on our server for the Quel Serrar quest thread. That included the first server drop on a guild run. We sold the first for 2500g. Still remember the warrior who bought it. Alliance human warrior, Warrien(Bloodhoof US).
---
Here‚Äôs a screenshot of a weapon.
---
Thank you!:)
---
4 weeks a year?
---
Idk if you realize this or not.... But I haven't been reading your paragraphs... I just find it amusing that you say you don't care, but continue to write hundreds of words explaining why you don't care. You're a dumbass.
---
If you're gonna noife it I think the standard among speedrunners like Joana is like 18-19 hours with Like 5-6 hours of sleep
---
I guess it's in the same drawer as the poop knife now.
---
Actually yeah that makes more sense if I truely want to experience what everyone had experienced back then
---
Bannerlord when?
---
It's a real pain. I've never seen an AI in a strategy game that is so hellbent on destroying your siege weapons. WC3 was definitely one of my most highly anticipated games of all time, too.
---
If your who I think you were I used to kill you in bgs
---
Thanks for spelling it out!
---
My fuckin body is reeeeady
---
Nice
---
39.99 what
---
Do you guys level hunter? If so nelf or dwarf/why? And if nelf do you live the owl meme dream?
---
I used to think that linen cloth being sold to a vendor was going to make us rich. We spent ages killing kobolds for linen cloth to vendor.  
---
It wasn't until some time later I learned about Stormwind and the auction house :)
---
During the early  days of twitch I‚Äôd skip classes just to watch SC2, but during vanilla I‚Äôd skip classes just to play
---
*appears behind you* nothing personal, earthmother
---
Omg tell us more!!
---
Yes we both Nelf hunter.
---
Nelf and Dwarf hunter are both really good - Dwarf has a tighter start area but Nelf has the better 1-20 in Darkshore, so Nelf just edges it out because you don't need to travel early on.
---
I've always used a cat but I'm actually doing an owl test run at the moment to check times and see if it's more efficient.
---
No, the tradeoff for less skills to buy is that what you do buy is WAAAAY more expensive.
---
Oh yeh, good idea
---
Do it bro you won't regret it. Depending on what you want to play they have one of the most engaging pve dps rotations.
---
I hope my blizzard bear code works. Also have a murloc costume linked to the acct I wonder...
---
Go fuk urself kek
---
U have no idea regard
---
How do we download the client and set up our own server? Please tell us so much more!!
---
If they don't have improved kick you could bait them with a mind blast
---
Your opinion on life is no surprise okau
---
I imagine most of the people here have probably leveled on private servers many times.
---
Umbra human warlock on feenix ?
---
Sweet, I'm not much of a speedrunner but I usually get like 5.5ish days played to 60 so Im generally interested in speedrunning. What's your pb and how many runs have you guys done?
---
\&gt; Strong DPS 
---
About that...
---
Going into the Deadmines by myself and trying to kill all of the elites. I had no idea why they were so strong. I recruited a friend to help and we must have done this for about 2 hours dying countless amounts of time.
---
Great information to have readily available, thank you for taking the time.
---
That's a solid time, great work :)  
---
My PB is around 4 days 9hrs. I've lost count of runs as we are forever chopping around and deleting toons, but my Livesplit says 82 at the moment.
---
Did you give up? Man that was easy.
---
I asked Umbra, he wasn't on feenix
---
It's meant for people whoa actually played Vanilla.

How many posts are you going to drag out of firing up sandbox for 10 minutes, my dude
---
Refresh
---
guys if you're going warlock just buy voidwalker spells until 60. when you buy the max rank you get all the other ones for free saving some cash.
---
Everyone I posted another sneak peek of ingame beta footage, pt.4 is up!
---
If you were killing level appropriate mobs, than your time was well spent grinding xp and you didn't even know it!
---
get a better job before dumping time into classic
---
Can keep monie?
---
ok but what about our items in the beta???
---
Probably playing end game wrath (I was a late BC baby) for almost 3 months before some kind soul inquired why the hell I was still in dungeon blues if I‚Äôd been playing end game that long... 
---
I didn‚Äôt know about the gear vendors.. 
---
Or raids.. 
---
Or google üòÖ
---
Many of them you'll basically never touch, or at least not need a keybind for.
---
Look into monster rehabs/rockstar recovery. 20 calories per can. 6g of sugar. Would be way better for you in the long run. They also taste amazing. Lemonade, pink lemonade, red tea, peach tea and orangeade for monsters. Regular lemonade, orangeade, and fruit punch for rockstars. 
---
My favorites are rockstars. Fruit punch tastes just like Hawaiian punch, and the orangeade is delicious as well. Lemonades taste great but I prefer the other 2
---
We Made It Boys! Pt.5! Night elf boobs are back!
---
I scrolled over the chest piece in the image to see what it was. FML
---
Which is strange cause troll hunter is the truth
---
Haha!  I was definitely in Battlegrounds a lot around that time!
---
yes
---
Its an old intro to a radio show done by Totalbiscuit. Something for those that have been around since the old days.
---
we made it boys! pt.5! I have no proof this is real and refuse to show other people how to do it!
---
Odd place for this. Also its really not relevant at all. Diremaul won't be in at launch and players certainly won't have AQ gear for a long while.
---
Says the guy who did not play vanilla since 2006... let's come back to this comment section when Classic comes out after we see the world firsts lvl 60 aight?
---
I will definitely be playing Classic.  Not sure, Most of the people I know who still work there aren't GMs anymore, but I imagine they will be giving classic a go!
---
Thanks man! Yeah I dont go all out but I do make sure I'm sticking to a guide and being efficient when I'm leveling. Yeah 82 is super good, I know Joanna recently got like 3 days 22 hours so it'll be interesting to see what the times will be when classic launches.
---
I have so many posts of pictures and stuff, nothing unbelievable about these pictures. They are all real. The stuff is unencrypted, if you know how to do certain things u can get in it.
---
You should just stream this
---
Warlock, Druid, Shaman are my top 3 favourite classes in that order. Huh, guess I like having a lot of skills.
---
Proof?
---
We made it boys! Pt. 2678
---
Made it to level 10 and the talent calculator does indeed have talents as well as bug report.
---
Or you could just post the whole album instead of milking this sub for some internet points...
---
I 100% support Joana and provide info for alli side guide he's working on atm, no problem.  
---
However it should be noted that times on pservers are going to be out of whack thanks to inaccuracies, and in Joana's run 3 days 22hours, the time improvement was partly improved route, rested XP (he played about 5 hours a day), and efficiency gains from high loot drop rates, higher mob densities.  
---
This is why we have records for individual servers and why nobody has recognised any other record than Joana's from original Vanilla, despite many fast times being posted.
---
But you guys would own beat us in premades more often than we beat you
---
Tell me more?!
---
Don't forget pizza pockets and nuggets. Bonus point for nuggetts. Mozzarella sticks. 
---
This is happening once. You don't want any regrets.
---
It's good to look at this guide and only go back to town for vital skills. Some classes can spend 6 or 8 levels without a meaningful spell purchase.
---
Yeah probably, the good old days of having no idea what we were doing &lt;3
---
Its gonna be vanilla style man.  Idk about you but I got my ass kicked plenty.  I certainly never felt like there was a dearth of action
---
During the initial surge when everyone is playing, let's say I wanted to go human. What is the optimal start for the first couple of levels given the fact there will be so many people playing?
---
I was 10 when vanilla came out and it was the best thing ever! But being french canadian and only speaking a tiny little english at that time i thought that mail armor meant that you had to receive it from the mailbox so i bought some mail armor from Razor Hill's vendor for my rogue and send it to him only to realise i wasted all my silvers... Feelsbadman
---
Post album or gtfo
---
yes  
---
They'll be unlocked after you level another class to 60.
---
‚ÄúI know you can‚Äôt be a death knight in vanilla‚Äù

There‚Äôs your answer

No.

---
whats the point of showing a tribute solo boss that requires tier 2.5.
---
Why not the method that you can do with reasonable gear around the period that DM is actually released.
---
I would get waay more hyped as a kid than I do as an adult.
---
For me it was Diablo 2, I would dream about that game at night for weeks up to it's release. I also had massive hype for Everquest and Ultima Online. 
---
WoW was just something that looked cool and I purchased on my way home from work on day.
---
The other horde factions should do some kind of equal opportunity lawsuit.
---
Just so nobody is confused, this is running on a sort of stripped down private server/sandbox, similar to what people had during the blizzcon demo. It doesn't mean people are actually in the beta.
---
Im getting some sleep, can we get album published for mornin. :D
---
Thats exactly what the video showed. Watch it. There is a tribute solo run with tier 2.5.
---
As someone who started playing WoW shortly after BC released, this feels like I will finally get some closure on seeing what the game was originally like.
---
Nice video. I‚Äôve had my mind set on a Tauren Druid for a while now and I love seeing it confirmed time and time again that I‚Äôm happy with my decision
---
BRE 1.12 in Phase 1 is gonna melt people like butter
---
Leveling is the game my friend.  It's all in the journey.
---
Yes I know that if you unencrypted it you could get in, what I‚Äôm asking for is a video or a tutorial. Anything that could act as proof for this not just being a private server with some plugins.
---
Master of Orion 3
---
That's when I learned to not buy a game until after it was released and reviewed. I still follow that rule 95% of the time
---
You mentioned writing and play-testing a guide; is it available to others in some form?
---
lmao i love how im the only person in the reddit posting anything remotely ingame for the beta, and you guys downvote me. I guess ill just stop posting.
---
It might be in the files but not actually implemented in the talent system.
---
Although, dual-wielding shammy would actually make the enhancement somewhat viable.
---
Also, its a rep grind in earlier expansions.  
---
You need to get to exalted with Wintersaber Trainers to be able to purchase the mount.
---
Any early datamining of this client should be taken with a grain of salt at the moment because this is a client that has tons of things bundled, left overs, etc, it needs context.  
---
  Also worth nothing that the beta is an ongoing process and is getting updates internally.    
---
  My guess is that this was probably from the tbc pre patch talent trees and it's a leftover, technically happened in vanilla, technically also didn't.
---
If you're talking about Classic launch, then the best avenue is to aggressively tag and kill everything you can get as you travel about working on your start area quests. If it's up, kill it. If it's not on your quest log, kill it.
---
Quests that become worth abandoning are going to be the ones where you are struggling to collect the materials, such as bandana quests.
---
Quests worth investing in are the chains. There's definitely a neater way to collect the quests around Goldshire to minimise travel, and knocking these out quickly, even grouping up, will grant you enough quest XP to keep up the top third easily.
---
If you have a plan you'll be pulling ahead by around level 12 and starting to see the herd thinning as you get towards the eastern part of Elwynn.
---
To keep ahead continue to murder everything in your path and don't panic and jump to a more advanced zone before you are ready.
---
Launch is always stressful and I can only say every launch I've playtested set me back an hour and a half on PB, but you get ahead easily so long as you stick to your plan.
---
Huh I didn't know that. Yeah the rested xp was probably pretty big especially if he maybe took breaks. 
---
Also I'm super curious what your findings are with the owl, I recently leveled a hunter to 60 with an owl on Voldemort server and I personally think they could be bis until 51 (when you get aimed shot) so long as you pull 2 mobs for multishot uptime. The only problems is you can't pull more than 1 if there's casters, or your questing significantly above your level/elites and you have to go decently out of your way to get rank 1 screech.
---
T3 Mage because TBC arena is around the corner and 5s is a thing
---
yeah pretty much for pvp. it remained okayish for as long as the free smite could still crit and therefor proc off itself(it wasnt very long in) but after that it died.
---
I mean, there are only two
---
lol it is real dude
---
Skipped part 5 completely. Smh
---
Gotta love ad hominem attacks. Perhaps you're projecting a bit? Feeling uncertain about your certainty? In any case, if all you have to offer is an ad hominem attack, then go away.
---
Most likely it was also from multiple offenses over a long period of time.  Definitely one that would get reviewed before closed though.  What you said may have determined the leniency a bit too
---
Just when it was getting good, too! My popcorn just finished, and now I have nothing to watch.
---
I've been looking for these. Thanks
---
have proof?
---
dont think you get flagged unless you actually attack them
---
I really agree with this. I don't see any reason why the nochanges crowd would get hung up on this - I'd love for the game to be modern beautiful with everything else the same, which it looks like we're getting. It's cool that there's a choice too.
---
This makes me wonder if this is legit...
---
I used to kill mobs to lvl up and not quest
---
Wait wtf, how can a druid even get through the doors without aggroing mobs lol. I'll have to check it out, yeah I didn't watch the video I just assumed it was the lasher farm
---
WOTLK was still good imo
---
How would it not be legit? Whats so unreal about this? Its just ingame of an unencrypted beta.
---

---
 warlock needs gear
---
Yah that's the issue with wow world pvp. it could be 20x better if the game was a bit different but instead you just get unfair fights 95% of the time, not really interesting/compelling for either side
---
Am also sad :((
---
It won‚Äôt play
---
The fact you somehow have it running? Private server imho
---
OP is a phagg0t for trying to milk this sub.

We both work so we turned rested XP off for testing to make sure we didn't affect the routing for launch.
---
I'll let you know how the owl goes once I have some data. I don't actually use aimed shot as I think it's not efficient if you don't have gear.
---
Bear 5 man tank is my favourite in classic and it only gets better if/when TBC comes out.
---
Why don‚Äôt you just stream it? Posting pictures instead, what is this 2004?
---
You'll be fine with dungeon gear and pvp blues
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJkaD3pmAs4 naked SL warlock pvp
---
I would skip these: Arcane Missiles, Dampen Magic, Slow Fall, Detect Magic, Amplify Magic, Remove Lesser Curse, Fire Ward, Frost Ward, Flamestrike, Blizzard (if going single target build), Teleports, only get Rank 1 of Polymorph &amp; Frost Nova. This saves you 20g by level 40. You can probably make more cuts than these if you really need to.
---
It's a Sandbox server that he's running on his computer, just like anyone else can to tinker with. I dunno how this is so hard to understand for people lmao
---
it's the beta client (which isn't encrypted in the first place) on a sandbox server

You can get a free alliance guide that is great for 80% of players here:

We do have a patreon for our guide and you are welcome to pm about that. I don't want to derail the info sesh :)
---
Oh huh, I'd be interested in your spec then if you wouldn't mind sharing and yeah feel free to dm me. I honestly am super curious about owl vs cat for leveling.
---
You are a fraud. Stop trying to act cool.
---
Stream it or GTFO. We‚Äôre not 13 years old anymore
---
I have nothing to add but just wanted to say thank you!
---
I couldn't find mankriks wife
---
Alenya say 2 speed runners level on a particular server, "Server A", and one speed runner hits level cap with a played time of (for example) 4d10h in 6 real life days.. and the second speed runner hits lv 60 in 4d8h played a few real life hours after the first speed runner. Who wins? does the faster /played count?
---
Thanks.
---
Again not sure what AQ gear has to do with anything. The gear I am wearing is entry level blues
---
Shut up, im posting pics because im the only person who has the balls to give ingame screenshots on this reddit. And secondly, im not allowed to stream it, its not on official blizzard servers and it isnt even released to the public. I'd get in serious trouble. Sounds like your the 13 year old one.
---
I don't play WoW to be part of the 80%. I had all the time when it was first out being in HS/College; but my time is limited now so I'd rather no-life it using the PTO I have from work and make the most of that time off.  
---
I've gotten a couple of NE rogues up to 60 on private servers giving myself a rough estimate of leveling path but I'd rather have something tried, tested, and optimized.  
---
Feel free to pass along that info and I will be happy to support quality work.
---
There's nothing special about the spec - I'm essentially kitted out in some very basic greens and whites and maybe the odd blue lucky drop, and vendor or quest bows, so its heavily undergeared.
---
On playtesting the use of serpent sting/arcane shot/autoshot with poor gear worked out to be better, thanks to being able to move about a bit more and have a little more flexibility.
---
I'll DM you about cat vs owl once I have some stats :)
---
I've tried. Many times. I gave up. So I figure I'll play classic for a couple years then off myself
---
I didn't have all the screenshots at once, so I made separate posts. And then people begged for an album, these are literally the only screenshots I have of the beta, there is nothing special on it. Stop crying.
---
Not sure what you watched. Its a rogue and druid stealth tribute run pulled straight from youtube to show people what a tribute run is. There is zero pvp matches in this video. There is a minute or two clip of running 1 flag in wsg.
---
Considering I was a massive fucking noob, pretty much everything.
---
Heh, I got teleported there for making fake item links (as a joke). Apparently some rule didn't allow that.
---
Picking a warrior as my first class in my first MMO at the ripe old age of 12.
---
Spoiler: I gave up on him around level 50.
---
Yeah druids are really underrated! Good choice on the class pick :)
---
Great work! There are a couple more spells when AQ opens.
---
Sorry thought someone said something about you wearing AQ gear. In either case pointless video and wrong subreddit.
---
If you were talking about a server launch, I would say the first would be Server first, and the second would be Server record. The second would continue to be beaten over time as played XP and less heavily populated starter areas come into effect.
---
What do you call 2 minute mark?
---
What do you call the 3 minute and 52 second mark?
---
Are you telling me that isn't PvP? What video did you watch?
---
It doesn't just sound unhealthy it is unhealthy lmao. It leaves little to no time to eat any decent food beside frozen meals or pizzas unless they did some meal prep sunday or something. Not getting a full 7-8 hours sleep is a cancer risk as well. You can also be damned sure OP isn't getting an exercise unless he also has a treadmill desk or something.
---
If that's what this guy wants to do then so be it, but fuckkk.
---
What? Why would I base anything off TBC?
---
Quests are same exp and rep until grey.
---
Keep posting...I am enjoying this
---
Cool video. What is pvp blues?
---
My thoughts exactly. I was worried I had scoured the wrong patch altogether, but it seems to be the right one. So they might just be latent from adjacent patches or something
---
. As a side note, while it WF had no internal gcd it was great, after DW was still better than the alternatives.
---
Dead space 3 had me hype, when to the midnight release and well you know how that shit goes
---
Yeah that's why this thread is deleted now? üòÇ
---
Pretty safe to say if it happened in 1.12, then it still happens now.
---
I glitched twice on my mage (that I can remember) falling through nothingness. The first time I didn't know what was going on as everything was white. Then suddenly I landed and died. Woops lol. The second time it happened I kept casting slow fall...took forever but I lived!

Hes wearing aq40 gear at like the 7 minute mark.

Whats your best record on a warrior to 60? If youve never did a warrior speedrun, what would you guess the best time a warrior can hit 60 /played?
---
Check out this video from TipsOutBaby. Some friends/followers sent him some screenshots of the Classic Beta

Oh I'd get in serious trouble bro. Yeah ok dude. Go play on your private server and stop trolling
---
Player run casinos. 
---
A 13 year old boy can gamble?! Sign me up!
---
Just realized the guild of the players in that video is Serenity Now, the infamous guild that crashed the in-game funeral. What a coincidence.
---
Weather is server side
---
Post more.
---
Is there an Addons button?
---
That's not why it got deleted ... use your brain.
---
Yea also noticed a few other things like the loot-a-rang that didn't fit either.  I'm actually hoping that Asmongold reports him for using footage of him without his permission. Then the whole things just gets struck down and we never see it again.
---
No Wildstar love?
---
I've been playtesting a rogue to see how that stacks up, but I've never done a warrior speedrun (is there even a thing :D ).
---
Seriously though, there are a number of speedrunners who are working on warrior routes, and it seems half of them are duo runs in conjunction with a priest or another complimentary class. Many of them are a fair way into designing routes, but they are still working towards 60.
---
5 days seems to be bandied around.
---
can you test the ironfoe proc chance for me &lt;3
---
Are there routes that are more optimal for certain classes because of a particularly powerful quest reward? By optimal I don't mean 5-10 minutes faster for a zone, but 5-10% faster for a level bracket.
---
I, for one, appreciate your posts
---
Isn¬¥t weather a server side effect?
---
This image looks like Snap going into the real world on the show, Chalk Zone.
---
I asked my server dev about the available tables, but he told me that that kind of data isn't there, at least not yet.
---
It's up there, but I can't bring it to the top because it IS a game I've played before. I would have to say Cyberpunk 2077 is my most anticipated game of all time. Classic is definitely up there somewhere though.
---
Upvotes to the left!
---
Just ask them directly if they're female, they are legally obligated to tell you. Just like undercover cops.
---
Death running as a night elf rogue at level 16 to ironforge to learn maces and buying two white maces from a vendor.
---
wait there's a beta and people are playing it?
---
Yes, especially for melee classes. Because their dps and uptime is so dependent on their weapons in particular, it becomes more efficient to nose out and complete quests rewarding items, even if there's an initial loss of xp/hr needing to travel or group up.
---
Verigan's Fist for example for paladins is a big one.
---
The rank 10 pvp set, it has a lot of stamina https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=547
---
There's also some other gear you can get from BG reputations
---
Actually the 1st thing I tried when I loaded it up lmao
---
Lupos was fixed before 1.12 so that's a very easy one to answer.
---
I agree, it could very well just be an artifact from adjacent patches or something. Nothing to lose our heads over. Also 2.0x was vanilla, right up until the portal opened.
---
There are 3 pvp factions that provide great his via rep and can get blue gear from the faction qm based on rank, if I'm recalling correctly.
---
Lmao that is fucking awesome.
---
My soul died a little when they announced the real money auction house feature before the release.  I vowed not to play at that point.  Such a sad reality.
---
I specifically remember trying to hunt people down plenty of times and losing them in the bigger zones pretty easily. I just accepted it at the time but now it will feel like an unnecessary limitation imo.
---
Oh well if it doesn't change then so be it.
---
D3 and Fallout 4. Both a huge letdown.
---
Reason I said it was because vanilla client has a weather slider in the video section.
---
wow 5 days played? Thats pretty hype. Im planning on going full hardcore to 60 with a duo pally, gonna go 30+ hours on launch. Weve got a plan to get whirlwind axe very very early with a group of 5 guildies. Id imagine a completely new route needs to be redisgned of course because some quests wont be as worthwhile because of non shared quest items for some quests. Also the amount of mobs able to kill as well etc etc. Were planning on going decently heavy on grinding and chainpulling with cleaving 24/7 with a weapon progression list laid out. Do you think that would still give us a 5 days played estimate with that approach?
---
There is no reason to die ever to mobs in appropriate zones. It happens to most people, but you can totally make it 1-60 without deaths. 
---
If you‚Äôre good, you probably shouldn‚Äôt die to players of similar level often either.
---
Regardless of class, both of those are skill issues, not class issues. 
---
If you want to heal, and be the best, you‚Äôll wear a dress. If you want to have heals, but spend you time dpsing in a raid, you‚Äôll be a shadowpriest in a dress or a furry‚Äîso gay either way. Additionally, they only bring one of each of you to the raid. 
---
If you‚Äôre a man play a warrior, if you‚Äôre really a priss and can‚Äôt play or can‚Äôt stand dying play hunter.
---
ah, someone with a "twitch" name gets right into beta. Steamer favoritism indeed.
---
That's pretty hyperbolic, and people tend to really overstate the risks of short-term nolifing.
---
As long as you are avoiding blood clots by getting up and moving a bit once every couple of hours, there aren't any real risks involved in short-term sleep deprivation. This isn't even an extreme case like the madmen running 72+ hours.
---
The cancer risk stuff is pretty ridicilous as well - even if some niche report has found a correlation, there are likely billions of people getting by on less than 7-8 hours of sleep on a daily basis.
---
Damn that‚Äôs hawt
---
Thought people might be interested in seeing this trend. As a quick note, there was a strange bug on 3/30/19 were we gained and lost thousands of subs (with an overall net gain of something like 4,000 subs) which I think was a Reddit-side glitch... or some strange bot sub/unsub event. So, that date is blank.
---
Mine is Diablo 2 but the game was already out when I started. WoW is a close second and therefore most hyped.
---
Ugh the extent which people go to shit on Druid content is so frustrating... don‚Äôt listen to the hate Ebn, love your vids and the other content you produce for us. This video is HUGE and makes me even more confident that I‚Äôm making the right choice maiming Druid in classic!
---
do I need proof?
---
HYPE
---
Whenever i started posting was when the reddit saw huge growth since yesterday. Hmmm
---
It doesn't confirm anything until we hear something official from Blizz...
---
Everyone chasing that first high. It's like a carrot on a stick.
---
It's.. It's beauitful..
---
Same. Me and my buddies first character's were ally. All the way up till bt. Then we rolled horde and never looked back. Another guy we met in wotlk has always been horde. I now play with him every night since in different games. So initially we were gunna be horde. But he's a pally main. And was a lock/priest before that. So he'd probably roll a lock. And then I'd have to reroll because I wouldn't want to have 2 of the same. But I don't think he wants to go ally which would technically be the best for us for class selection. And probably better end game with him as a pally. But we also pvp. And dem sweet horde racials and duels. 
---
And then there's the case of my initial friend mentioned up above that hasn't gamed in 6 or so years. I'm talking him into building a new pc (he's been wanting one for 6 months) and then talking him into coming to classic. I don't have any idea where he'd want to go. Man.... The confusion is real. I'm also planning on them releasing a TBC remake eventually so all of us would want to be horde for that as well. So just a whope. Bunch of fuckery in what we do.
---
Hell. Yes.
---
I always wanted one back then and now I get to make it happen :D I can‚Äôt wait
---
Tailoring/Enchanting or Mining/Engineering.
---
You are doing the lords work.
---
Based johnnyboy coming through with his bitchboy priest
---
What would you prefer if you were in my position? I feel tailoring would be worth it cause I can make gear.
---
Don't fear the majesty, embrace it.
---
there are no new animations for anything, but graphically it does look slightly different
---
Spell rankings... class identity in spells and utility... it's just so beautiful
---
Still fucking mad about this
---
Getting by on less than 7-8 hours of sleep does not disprove the fact that a lack of sleep causes health risks. Yes people absolutely do work on less than 8 hours, but that doesn't mean it's healthy. 
---
Getting up to reduce the chance of bloodclots is good, but even if you are getting up every hour or so nothing is a substitute for exercise even if it is just walking for 30 minutes every now and again.
---
Before you ask me to quote sources, feel free to google it yourself because it's not that hard to look it up with the internet at your fingertips. If you don't care enough to look it up then I couldn't care less tbh.
---
Well, this is a bait.
---
I did too but only because I wanted to be stronger. I started in BC and the mana wyrms in the belf starter area were kicking my ass.
---
Stacking Spirit gear on my hunter so I could do all the Aim Shots
---
If this goes well you know they are going to go through a couple of the good expansions.
---
If you don't care for any other expansions then yea don't worry about it. Seemed like you were on the fence and their power levels are already pretty close. So I was using the future events to help make a choice.
---
Clicking the eggs in ZF because I thought they would drop loot.
---
They do not, in fact, drop loot.
---
Hnnnng inject it straight into my veins üò©
---
What guild were you in? I was in AoA and Nulli Secundus during Vanilla and then Strawberry Banana Fusion and Ballas during TBC
---
Thank you!
---
As a fellow pally, you will find that the pally side will be slowing the warrior down especially towards the end :( If your guild can help you, boosting to get ahead will greatly help because you're really going to rely on having lots of mobs available to you in order to keep your xp/hr up.
---
Are you planning weapon progression on definite availability eg quests or on % drops?
---
Turtle mount was a reward from the TCG
---
Skinning and herb.
---
Skinning for dm gold farm. 
---
Herb since mages are the best at getting black lotus. When AV opens up black loctus will spawn and mages with blink will get there the fastest.
---
I see. I appreciate it, but the T3 gear is only relevant for vanilla.
---
Once TBC drops I could just roll a mage and gear them up with the arena.
---
It's likely a pserver my dude.

Can't say if these graphics are 'updated' or if its just the client...and for all I know, these could be fake (which is more than likely true).
---
Check out platinum wow on YouTube. Doesn't have a huge following but his videos are fantastic, informative and hilarious.
---
Refreshing your post history was the right choice! Keep them coming! Awesome work.
---
I'm pretty sure a mage is going to view you the same way that you view a warrior, as an xp sponge.
---
A mage will get mauled by aoe crushing blows even with a priest healing, and you'll likely just pull aggro and fuck the pull up if you try to help him.
---
If he doesn't fuck up, you're just a drain on his xp and loot. If doing big boy pulls, he'd probably rather just group with another mage.
---
It‚Äôs got a fun end game, and build system, but possibly the worst loot system and itemization in the Arpg market.
---
Now I started in wotlk why is black lotus to valuable. Sorry for the ignorance!
---
When I played the Classic demo, we had the option to pick either 'Classic' settings or upgrade the graphics. Graphics upgrades related to being compatible with widescreen monitors, higher resolutions, more density in grasses, better shadows etc. No option for modern animations or looks.
---
I didn‚Äôt notice that crocolisks had 6 legs until after TBC launched.
---
I seem to remember in the demo DPS weapons had a second decimal, ie. like 75.92, nice to see theyve changed it back!
---
Wtf is your problem? This is just an informative nice video why you gotta be a fucking dick?
---
Does the last picture mean that wall jumping is going to be a thing?
---
Tauren Druid, RP-PVP. üòè

there is an option to buv report every item?

Jesus people are getting hostile and jelly up in here

Why are u being such a little cock sucker? your daddy fuck you in the ass today or something?
---
These are great thank you!
---
What‚Äôs up with that last one though? Where are you and what are you wearing?
---
At no point did I state that it was healthy, just that it isn't actually dangerous in any way.
---
It doesn't even matter if there is an actual cancer risk attached to sleeping less than 7-8 hours, because that'd apply to such a huge amount of society that it isn't unique to no-lifing.
---
There's simply no serious risks attached to short-term sleep deprivation.
---
Ahh, okay. To me a match is the entire game, just misunderstood you. I understand what you're referencing to now. Sorry you didn't like the video! GL in classic :)
---
To craft flasks for raid
---
this is supposed to be classic, why is our fresh warrior buddy in t3, or that he has nothing in his bag and a level 60 epic weapon?
---
I would do Tailoring/Enchanting and focus on making greens that cost the fewest mats and then Disenchant them. With the disenchanting mats then use them to level enchanting. Enchant friend's gear for free. Or maybe advertise enchants for a few gold each in trade chat. If you are business savvy you can make a fair bit of gold. You think that doing raids and such is the game and how you win, but honestly you can focus on making your own business in the game and focus on making money as the game. I did that for a time and I thought it was more fun then the actual game itself.
---
Mining/Engineering is better though if you want to focus solely on PvP.
---
So, I have an uncommon story. When the game first released I created a character and played for 20 minutes. I get a steam message and my Counter Strike team needs me for a few competitive matches, so naturally I jump off to go play with them. I was enjoying WoW, but for some reason I never returned to the game for some time and ended up lending it to a friend of mine.
---
One day I wanted to try the game out again, so I offered to my friend that I would pay to transfer his character to another account that he created. Instead of taking me up on the offer, he quit the game cold turkey. He essentially said that he‚Äôs addicted and this was a wake up call for him. 
---
So, I log in and see a fresh lvl 60 with cool ass gear (I‚Äôll later learn he was in full T1) on a Human Paladin. ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù I said to myself, ‚Äúthis is awesome‚Äù and promptly log in to the game. As I‚Äôm standing in this fortress called Ironforge, I get a party request and then a summon to a place covered in lava (Molten Core I later find out). There are people everywhere and we are slowly pulling mob after mob. I‚Äôm trying my best to heal, but I have no fucking clue what I‚Äôm doing. Finally, we get to one of the bosses (don‚Äôt remember which one) and I lay of hands the tank right when he runs in. The entire raid is wiped.....being that my friend is well respected in this guild, they think he just fat fingered the button. We get everyone back up.....and I do it again...because noobness, but this time they are like WTF? I promptly get kicked out of the raid and told to sober up by the guild master (they think my friend was drunk). 
---
It hit me that I had no clue how to play the game so I promptly re-rolled an Orc Warrior. I never played that paladin again. It‚Äôs actually still sitting where I left it outside of MC in T1 gear. I‚Äôve asked my buddy multiple times if he wants it and he keeps saying, ‚Äúnever again‚Äù haha.
---
:P who knows, some people are just grumpy.
---
Enjoyable, but definitely some on the downward side of the hill
---
Wonder if we could see a blue post regarding beta as soon as today or Friday, will be interesting to see.
---
yea theyre all definite availability but some gaps as of now, i havent had time to layout a full 1-60 but plan to at some point. I wouldnt be surprised thats the case towards the end as the warrior will have plenty of armor and plenty of damage to chain mobs a couple levels lower pretty easily. Were trying to find areas that have essentially twice as many spawns to create grinding loops as opposed to solo level grinding areas. Either way, it will probably just be more fun to level duo although ive never tried it before
---
&gt;It isn't actually dangerous in any way.
---
ok then
---
How are people getting their hands on this?
---
Oh ok great! Here soon im gonna do some research before I jump in
---
Dude you're the man.
---
You wouldn't be the only one eating ass in Goldshire ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
My deepest, darkest secret.
---
I came in on BC, WoW had been out for a while and I kept reading books on what character to make while I saved for my first computer. I was dead-set on a Nelf hunter I fantasized about playing. Didn't know they were referred to as huntards either. I finally got everything I need after saving my "teenager working at Pizza Hut" money and my friend is showing me how to play, but she and her bf quit. I was on my own on a dead PvP server, but was committed to my character. 
---
I played by myself for about a year and half on and off, I was having a good time but never understood how everyone was leveling characters so quickly. I was still level 43. Also being killed a lot.
---
One day I was in STV and my friend logged on and decided to find me, I was being completely murdered over and over. She was a maxxed-out mage and destroyed the Orc and pals ganking me. She said "How are you dying so easily?" "Have you actually played the game much?". I explained, yes, for a year and a half. She said "So what points did you put into your talent tree?". I said: "What's...that"?
---
I somehow never paid attention to talent trees, and was basically using auto-shot to kill things the whole time. I AM the definition of a huntard. Level 43 for a year and a $%@%$% half. But I did love the game. 
---
My DNA still screams from this memory.
---
This is gonna spike HARD when the beta comes.
---
What was the 3/12 spike?
---
Hyped: Star Citizen (lol)
---
Anticipated: Classic WoW
---
Wow ignore 700 Enemie's armor.
---
Bladestorm is gonna be so op... Oh wait.
---
Spider-Man 2 game was it for me. Close behind was Spider-Man PS4. I love Spider-Man, I love video games.
---
If Classic had come out whenever Nostalrius was in it's prime, I'd be extremely excited for this. But also, I'm kinda skeptical about it still. I loved Nostalrius but like, I also got to play with a lot of cool European people that I won't be playing with on Classic (I assume) because it'll be separated by region.
---
Being good at the game trumps gear until people are aq geared.
---
Might kind of be a long answer but could you possibly list the zones and levels you go to them in the 40-60 bracket.     That‚Äôs usually where I get a little lost or not sure where to go next
---
what was it like watching the first person pick up the scarab?
---
are there going to be any new items in classic wow? I heard somebody say that. Might be cool
---
Hey birthday twins!  Happy bday fam &lt;3
---
It was possible to fall through stormwind to beneath it.  Looks like maybe itll be possible once again.
---
Is this the beta??
---
I'm sad about the lack of new models pic !
---
Warrior t3 and under storm wind. You can see the spires above it clipping a little

Woah, I am never seen someone so emotional about a bad video.

Please try to get into Hyjal.

  Anyone that saw the classic panel on how they're redoing the world knows that going into hyjal, an unfinished vanilla zone but with modern client, would lead to some very interesting results.
---
Blizzard really needs to mention something about the beta tomorrow
---
I never understood why Blizzard didn‚Äôt hit us with a WoW 2, something with badass modernized graphics and back-to-roots gameplay. The game just kept evolving into something that doesn‚Äôt feel fun to just play and explore (cause it just doesn‚Äôt look modern it doesn‚Äôt feel new and exciting) and the focus all went to end game grinding schemes. Dailies. Random item rolls. Trying to min/max the same piece of gear. Leveling is just gone you blow through it as fast as possible, and dungeons while leveling are a total joke.
---
Thanks for doing this!  Awesome read so far!!  How fast were Blizzard devs cranking out new features for Support?  It seems like they took Support and building tools for Support very seriously.  For example, I was banned from the WoW beta (Fileplanet subscriber beta) for an inappropriate name.  I was 13 after all.  Any, I still have the email and this is how they used to have you change your name:
---
 *As a temporary resolution, the character has been assigned a random name. ¬†If you are not satisfied with this name, please reply to this E-mail or send an E-mail to WoWNameChange@Blizzard.com &lt;mailto:*[*WoWNameChange@Blizzard.com*](mailto:WoWNameChange@Blizzard.com)*&gt; with a list of at least five new character names along with your World of Warcraft Account Name. ¬†Please list your choices in order of your preference, and we will do our best to accommodate your wishes. Inappropriate names will not be selected and the next valid name down the list will be chosen.* 
---
Now obviously they just rename your character to an invalid name, but I know they have developed many more tools since then.
---
Im pretty sure 16 year old me was curious about basically everything when it came to my dick.
---
Bonus points if i could make older people uncomfortable with that curiosity.
---
I mean...hey...i already have retail on a thumb drive....
---
Might just have to replace that with classic when it comes out (or buy a bigger drive....)
---
Ahhhhhhhhh hell yes
---
You know damn well what to do.
---
Idk what you'll do after about 20 seconds of that, though :P
---
We get to relive these times!

I didn't know duo speedrunning was a thing! Is this all being discussed on a discord or..?

i did read somewhere that it will *not* be a thing - wall exploits will be fixed they said
---
No vanilla weather :(
---
The bulk grinding should help you increase your chances of appropriate green level drops.
---
and how dare you have fun sir. Speedlevelling is serious business! :)
---
You can but depending on class you‚Äôll have to walk to TB for a trainer. I‚Äôm debating doing it, I love the look of an undead on a Kodo
---
Of all the things you can do with your time for thousands of hours why this
---
Why not turn on your PvP flag while farming?
---
I also would really like new updated models and textures. Im cool if theres like a option to swap for those who like the blocky stuff. But the Vanilla say, female tauren faces and the current ones are light night and day in terms of quality.
---
New models in classic wow world would make it really "NEW" feeling while keeping all the great aspects.
---
*stares at the resurgence of Chuck Norris jokes in Barrens Chat*

Why my pp go hard?

Also, im not sure if i missed it somewhere (and im tired...wtf, why am i not showered and in bed already), but can you get a screenshot of the advanced system options?  Also, what exactly does the classic button do on the graphics options?  At first i assumed it was a preset for the 'max' that classic allowed, but reading some other posts before im wondering if its actually to possibly control things like weather, etc.
---
Huh, so was that goofy Twitter functionality just in the Beta menus?
---

Because this is just someone screwing around in a private client setup seeing as there isn't an actual server you can connect to yet?

How do you mangy alliance curs deal with the crushing pain and shame of being on the sharp ends of superior horde weaponry?
---
Played exclusively vanilla on private servers for the last four years, even though my heart truly lies in TBC, because for me it was a 'slightly' improvement over Classic, but vanilla is my second favorite by far :)
---
Every time I‚Äôve followed a speed leveling guide, despite finishing all the quests, I‚Äôve always fallen behind. Am I supposed to be killing every mob I see? Are the guides based on rested xp? (Joanas for example)
---
Sure, I can give you a summary
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
Badlands
---
STV again
---
Feralas
---
Tanaris
---
Hinterlands
---
Searing Gorge (depends on what's available at launch)
---
Feralas again
---
Tanaris again
---
At 50ish:
---
Blasted Lands
---
Azshara
---
Un'Goro Crater
---
Felwood
---
Winterspring
---
Burning Steppes
---
Eastern and Western Plaguelands
---
and Winterspring again to finish
---
Because they're not connected to the actual beta server. They've just summoned the items to look at them.
---
you can actually play/!?!?!
---
Spells are batches in 400ms loops. Anything lower than 400ms puts everyone on the same playing field.
---
Ever find out?
---
Translation: Soon (tm). :)
---
I would for once like to see someone backing that with actual numbers. How much more dps do you really get¬¥? I bet for some it is rather miniscule, in which case it is a dick move to still roll for it.
---
Everything will be 1.12. If they do decide to do new content post-Naxx it won't be for a long time.
---
What is the difference? I played vanilla, retail and private servers, but I never noticed any difference at all.
---
You should definitely be in the habit of killing every mob you see.
---
Treat a speed levelling guide as the quests you do as you travel around murdering everything in your path.
---
The only exception to this will be when you are needing to travel through an area where the mobs are too low for you for the xp to be worth it, or when travelling on a mount to a major area for the next section.
---
If you just want professions to have fun/make some money   Skinning and herbalism are good to have.

If you are trying to min max your performance in pve/pvp you will probably want to be engineering and you can do whatever else until zg comes out then you‚Äôll want engi/tailoring

Cry angrily then passive aggressively harass you on wow forums

I can't afford quality drugs

Yes it's a very cool thing! Check out Barrens Chat forum, or join Joana's speedrunning Discord, where most of that kind of talk happens. It's a very supportive community.

I hit level 60 on a hunter, and mained it for about a week before rerolling.

I didn't know how to dismiss your pet, so i would just not feed it and kill it over and over until it ran away.
---
As far as pvp videos go, mage play looks pretty. This video made me decide my main pvp character will be mage:

---
Mine was DOS 2 too... And the witcher 3. Classic os comming pretty close, and If they ever do a Dragon Age Origins remake It'll enter the list of extreme hype too.
---
You need to nolife first day to get ahead of curve, it's definitely worth it.

No there are no new models, but you can up the graphics tho.
---
March 11th was the announcement of the [content plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346), so it's safe to assume that's the cause for the spike.

i died a lot before lvl 6 on my nelf warrior. weapon broke so i remade my character because i didn‚Äôt know i could repair it.

My latest "most anticipated game of all time" before Classic was mass effect andromeda...  That...  didn't work out.  Glad we have classic
---
Human + hardcore
---
:thinking:
---
Look on the bright side, depending on the patch, they paid 2 gold for a weapon that was arguably worse then a 30 silver, white Xbow sold in UC
---
Except he didn't. He started up his own server and used the files from Blizzards CDN to test hem out
---
Moar pls
---
Yes
---
Doesn't look like /focus is in Classic.
---
It depends completely on the guild you become a part of, the amount of time you choose to put in relative to the PACE and goals of that Guild, and that guilds specific class needs. Also some bull crap about making friends who may not necessarily care that you are the best geared most optimized or most skilled I don't know some social crap who knows
---
~400-600 ping regularly back in tbc and wrath and it wasn't too much of an issue.
---
Lol the rain was amazing in vanilla, it was filled with fog and it made it hard to see in the distance. You could also tell it was night in vanilla because everything was dark af, I remember trying to increase my brightness because I couldn‚Äôt see shit.
---
The gun would later on get sold for around 30g+ which in vanilla days was damn good
---
Imgur album? Nah. 
---
Maximum karma farming.
---
I'm planning on rolling... Druid. I never got to play Vanilla WoW, and I was a Druid main all the way from Burning Crusade to early Cataclysm, because I always loved the class. I know that Druids don't really master anything in Vanilla (except... *maybe* PVP, I guess that's still a matter of debate), and that's kinda sad for me, but dammit I'm gonna have fun.
---
Alternatively, I might make a Rogue / Warlock / Warrior / Mage / Hunter alt. Just... Because.

Whatever you say loser üòÇ

arent u a human ?

I don't understand. Is this Itemization? What is itemization?

Well the most notable thing is the rain.

Sorry, what is personal loot? First time I‚Äôve heard this.

ur a noob then

I do hope they don't forget about the weather tho!

One of my earliest groups clicked every single one of those mounds of sand in Zul'Farrak. I don't know why but I think everyone else thought they knew what they were doing so we could fight the witch doctor boss easier.

Was about to mention System of a Down lol

Hypnotize rogue videos FTW

Randomly heading north of barren at maybe level 15 as a hunter. Find a creepy but beautiful forest, get chased by a ?? elf. To escape said elf  I Run off the road and get absolutely lost and unable to find way back to said road until i was close to the Shore. I was totally engrossed and in  the game for those few hours trying hard to survive totally out of my comfort zone.
---
idk
---
Without a shred of doubt. I barely played any games since I stopped playing in WotLK a decade ago. Been playing on and off on vanilla and TBC private servers since around 2012.
---
Once Classic is over, so is my gaming "career" most likely, unless they move on to post-Naxxramas content or to TBC. I will never touch another private server nor will I play any modern games because it's very rare for modern games to appeal to me - I can count a handful of games of the past 15 years that I've liked. Get off my lawn.
---
This is pretty douchey but i suppose you‚Äôre part of the vanilla experience lol
---
You have two windows keys so just pop out the left one, you'll never accidentally hit the right one.
---
Mount and Blade is such a simple concept for a game, yet it‚Äôs a complete master piece.
---
I believe Scarab Lord was in vanilla, but it was overridden by any PvP title
---
I had read a great post a month or so ago about how using a discovery method of leveling might be better at launch(they might have used the word taxi or exploration) Becuase the servers will be so dense for the first few days.
---
Have you thought at all about this for your routes? What ere your findings?
---
Also, what was your biggest difference from expectations once you started testing.
---
Yes. I remember how painful it was thinking we would never get to have it.
---
I‚Äôm not reading your wall of text. Briefly, you‚Äôre in this subreddit so you‚Äôre already fucked and second, if you rock wow literally one night instead of going out or going to a movie etc. you‚Äôve gotten your money‚Äôs worth.

4/7-4/9 : Release of PvP Plans within the 6 stage plan
---
Yes, they definitely did! But I believe some people still were able to wall jump in the Demo client, so maybe it's still a work in progress.
---
Still, the answer to the question is what you said, and the picture is only taken there because GMs can go anywhere.
---
Good shit, gotta bunch of friends hopping back in for it and looking for a guild or people to run with. What time zone are you in ?
---
I hope they add that, the weather effects were awesome!
---
Do you know of any resources or rough guidelines designed for groups of 5 for 1-60?  
---
Not trying to break world records but my group would like to quickly get to 60 while still playing together.
---
ill gank you
---
Thinking my skillful combination of arrow turning and strafing was just as good as using a mouse to turn. Using Shift 1-5 to swap action bars with the default bindings still set, because why would I want more than one bar of skills at a time. Making it through every tBC raid and up to Ulduar before raid mechanics required that I turn on a dime and run out of fire. Realizing "Huh, so people must hold their mouse all the time then.. Maybe I should try that."
---
lol &lt;3
---
So does this mean private servers can get a hold of the official classic data and use it as their core?
---
Nah.
---
But now I'm crying more
---
Shield and Renewal will save his ass, also having aggro on me is fine since I can also help pack the mobs. I will be at a fair distance from the mage, thus being able to kite long enough for the mage to freeze again in those trouble time. 
---
True on the second part mage/mage but I've been lucky enough to group with many mages in the Pserv during fresh, because there are a lot of noob mages out there who are incompetent and unreliable vs a competent healer + nice to have a resser in the pocket as well.
---
Damn boy, most dont make it past 32.
---
I guess you‚Äôd be right, but I don‚Äôt want to have any lag issues if I do manage to raid or pvp. So overkill is ok and also.......the wife wouldn‚Äôt know what I spent....as I‚Äôd buy it with my errr stack account...üôÑü§£üëÄüëç
---
The toxicity level in this thread is worrisome. To utter one‚Äôs opinion is never not ok. 
---
OP: Even if you find some reasoning in inflation and rising electricity prices, I think you‚Äôll have to look entirely elsewhere for the actual cause of the price. I simply don‚Äôt think it is in their interest to divide their player base, and for that reason only I believe they will pursue the $15 subscription.
---
So, you know the whole campaign mode that didn't feel like diablo? They said fuck it. They created a whole new game mode that the game actually is played on called "adventure mode" in it, there's these awesome things called "rifts" and there's two types of them, essentially one for farming and one for seeing just how far you can push the limits of your character. It's awesome. 
---
The other guy is right that the loot system is a bit limited (WAY too much emphasis on sets instead of legendaries) but it's still a blast. 
---
Oh! And each ladder season (about 2-3 months) you have a few goals for your character called your "season journey" and you get some neat rewards for completing it. Also each season has a "theme" so this current season you need 1 less piece of each set to get the set bonus. IE, you need 3 pieces for the 4 piece bonus or five pieces for the 6 piece bonus. 
---
There's also these really neat legendary gems that you level up by doing the hard rifts ("greater rifts") which are really neat. 
---
Honestly, if you have D3 and are bored, here's what I'd do. 
---
Here's the Blizzard post summarizing the current "season": [https://us.diablo3.com/en/blog/22820656/season-16-the-season-of-grandeur-is-now-live-1-18-2019](https://us.diablo3.com/en/blog/22820656/season-16-the-season-of-grandeur-is-now-live-1-18-2019)   
---
The Haedrig's gift sets this season are:  
---
* Barbarian ‚Äì Immortal King‚Äôs Call
---
* Crusader ‚Äì Seeker of the Light
---
* Demon Hunter ‚Äì Natalya‚Äôs Vengeance
---
* Monk ‚Äì Uliana‚Äôs Stratagem
---
* Necromancer ‚Äì Trag‚ÄôOul‚Äôs Avatar
---
* Witch Doctor ‚Äì Spirit of Arachyr
---
* Wizard ‚Äì Vyr‚Äôs Amazing Arcana  
---
Here's a guide for each of those sets (I'm just googling this so can't speak to how good or bad these are, although I played a tiny bit earlier this season and can vouch for the demon hunter set and the crusader set both being quite good this season).   
---
Barb IK set: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/barbarian-immortal-king-set-dungeon-guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/barbarian-immortal-king-set-dungeon-guide)
---
Crusader Seeker set: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/crusader-hammerdin-build-with-blessed-hammer-and-seeker-of-the-light-set-patch-2-6-4-season-16](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/crusader-hammerdin-build-with-blessed-hammer-and-seeker-of-the-light-set-patch-2-6-4-season-16)  
---
Demon Hunter set: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/demon-hunter-natalya-rain-of-vengeance-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/demon-hunter-natalya-rain-of-vengeance-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16)  
---
Monk Uliana set: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/monk-uliana-seven-sided-strike-build-with-exploding-palm-patch-2-6-4-season-16](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/monk-uliana-seven-sided-strike-build-with-exploding-palm-patch-2-6-4-season-16)
---
Necro: --You need to pay 15 bucks for the necro, and I can respect you probably don't want to do that, fair enough. Also most Necro builds suck, they're usually not the epic undead army builds of D2. 
---
Witch Doctor: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/witch-doctor-arachyr-firebats-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/witch-doctor-arachyr-firebats-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16)
---
Wizard: [https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/wizard-vyr-archon-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/wizard-vyr-archon-build-patch-2-6-4-season-16)  
---
Looking at the sets in those builds (just scroll down and you'll see them), the Monk set looks pretty cool too. 
---
It'd probably take you about 8ish hours to hit 60, and then you can work on getting your gift set, which is honestly a lot of fun, I do recommend checking it out if you have time. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
How did you find the rogue? Do you record these runs? I might want to watch the first few hours so I can kinda learn how to get ahead.
---
You think t-this ..this helps?  It only makes the wait so much worse  .Its beautiful thanks OP
---
I keep three plans for launches - the discovery method (never used to date), the optimum run (sometimes I get lucky), and the busy start (gets used the most).
---
Discovery method is a guaranteed XP rate and gives you the FPs for later, but ultimately is too slow at start and puts you at a constant disadvantage, as returning to the start area forces you to work back through the crowd for much longer than normal.
---
Optimum run is great if you have access to a healthy number of mobs and static respawns are working well (eg plants for quests), because you have a clean route and can quickly get ahead. However this has never been the case at launch.
---
Busy starts consist of a combo of quests that don't rely on static respawns or heavily camped mobs, and being patient and tagging and killing mobs in the start area. I usually work towards a bare minimum level to leave, then jump the queue into an area that I can grind ahead of the pack.
---
On my last launch run, I was an hour and a half behind my PB at about level 12, but was running second on Alliance side by level 24 out of approx 1200 people at that stage.
---
Expectations were absolutely destroyed by testing multiple times :( First I believed that the various guides out for vanilla were the absolute best well tested available, but quickly found that was not the case. Then I discovered the problems with pservers awarding the wrong XP for quests, or too much rested XP, or mob density being too high.
---
I threw out my route at least twice completely before settling into the last draft, which was developed on more correct values.
---
TBC and WOTLK were pretty damn good followups imo. It was after that things started to get super fucked up. All 3 of those pieces of the games' history have been glorious.
---
god
---
Should've made a female pally
---
I did record the run but it's not uploaded due to Blizz not allowing pserver content distribution.
---
What I found with rogue was that pausing to grind from 8-10 then continuing a guide 2 levels higher than listed worked really well. It had a very beneficial effect on XP/hr due to higher crits, less misses and a little less dependency on equipment like weapons.
---
I have been thinking much of the same things as you [Rough Draft](https://imgur.com/a/6p8EkZc).  I do tend to like Mind Flay more than most, and will probably use it when I have excess mana instead of other spells. 
---
I've decided to go the renew/flash heal route, but only if I need to heal instances instead of mainly for leveling.
---
Commenting for later use
---
I think without a doubt it‚Äôs MK11.
---
Try checking out Joana's speed levelling discord to find others who are looking to theorycraft groups of 5.
---
It's so specialised I know nothing about it sorry.
---
If you're taking 6-7 days /played to get to 60, you're not fast enough to get that far ahead of the curve. You really need to be sub-5 to get super far ahead.
---
For context, speed levelers are hitting low-mid 3 days these days. Joana has a 3d10h, several people in my guild are sub 4d.
---
Ever took interest in 2 man aoe farming with a class that compliments druid?
---
Paladin druid or for real men druid shaman.
---
Thorns + swipe + magma totem + stone skin sexytime + heals = big pulls. I have a feeling this could be a good leveling duo.
---
I was wondering about this. Looks like it won't be. I honestly cannot remember when that was added. But its fine.
---
Spamming Lamb of God lyrics with a macro in tirisfal glades/in PVP after killing someone. I was an Undead Male Warrior.
---
On brand, I know lol.
---
I guess it‚Äôs totally down to you and your guild. I was a hard core raider back in vanilla, playing everyday once home from work and most weekends. I never completed T2 as I didn‚Äôt get my dragonstalker legs from Rags, despite running MC so many times.
---
I am seeing many guild recruitments saying casual raids....twice a week, some 8-11pm. So there are good options out there to be casual and still raid.
---
Best advice I can give you about raiding is to do all you can to be the best. There are tonnes of webpages with the BiS (best in slot) items for every class and spec, for pre raid gear. Do your best to get your character as well geared as you can from crafted gear, and 5-15 man level 60 instances. This shows you‚Äôve put the effort in.
---
Then get the best enchants to boost your stats more. And then also get the necessary consumables to further boost your performance in the raid.
---
Watch vids on the fights and learn your class rotations well.
---
It‚Äôs not that difficult and by 60 and once you have done the 5-15 mans instances several times to get better gear, you should be ready.
---
Remember raiding is fun, it‚Äôs great feeling working towards downing raid bosses. Try to get into a good PVE guild early and level with the team.
---
I will log on my 60!
---
if they do not get goosebumps when seeing the Announcement and the trailer i think they are not classic lovers
---
Other than Ulduar and the levelling experience in WotLK I pretty much hated WotLK and it was when I first quit the game. The first raid tier was lazy beyond belief and an absolute joke compared to TBC (My guild cleared everything in the first few days of the expansion). Heroic Dungeons were a zergfest. DKs were insanely unbalanced. The Trial of the Crusader content patch was the worst thing to happen to WoW until LFD happened in the next content patch. They did a lot of things right in WotLK, but so many things wrong too.
---
OMG I'M SO EXCITED
---
It was after vanilla. I didn't really expect it to be in, but I did hope.  
---
I think people will make addons for it though.
---
The best healer I ever played with had around 500-600 ping (in Australia playing on a Europe server) when everyone else was 200 or lower. 
---
It's certainly possible, you just need to adjust a bit to compensate.
---
Why Ebn become enemy #1 for posting a video about aoe pulling as druid is beyond me. But I always said never druid Druids they are shitters who piss and trash everything they touch, damn wild animals.
---
ill kill him with my 42
---
already did
---
Reading this just made me so happy! I love a damn Druid. I was never good at one (never made it past level 25) but I just love a damn Druid! You have so MUCH fun! :D
---
Are you talking grey mobs not giving any xp, or is there a level range to stay in as a rule of thumb?
---
This exactly. God damn I went to college during bc-lk and I didn‚Äôt learn a god damn thing except not to stand in fire and how to pwn noobs lol
---
Very cool.  Thank you for doing this.  I always ended up getting a little stuck around level 30 on Alliance characters.
---
Normal day started with av queue, 45 minutes later I am in the beginning of an epic 13 hour battleground. Every moment of it was the best feeling ever, damn I miss that big boss in the middle helping players. 13 hours later the fight came to an end and I had to go to sleep :P
---
Vaelastrasz almost destroyed my guild.  
---
We failed for weeks to get him down. Thousands of gold in flasks, repairs, and staying up until 3 am with a 40 man raid plagued our morale. The top players were getting active invites to join the two guilds that had succeeded so far, and if they had accepted the invites, it would have hollowed out our roster and disbanded the guild.  
---
One attempt fell apart half way through when a tank died and Vael flame breathed all the DPS. We were so close, but most people were dead. Rogues were running in to evasion tank for a few seconds before dying,, and everyone was blowing cooldowns to survive. Eventually only one hunter was alive and his brother (a paladin) yelled "AIMED SHOT THAT MOTHERF\*CKER" and he managed to aimed-shot Vael for the kill, seconds before dying to the debuff.  
---
We wiped, but Vael had fallen too, and Ventrillo went insane. We went on to clear the rest of BWL pretty consistently, and the experience was amazing.  
---
Also, we caught the whole thing on video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wt-4qYmOi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wt-4qYmOi8)
---
I played vanilla with over ping and had to use a macro for my mage that looked something like;
---
/cancel
---
/cast frostbolt
---
Every time the cast bar got to around 85% I would press the macro.
---
If you're casting one heal, it won't matter, but if you're chaining heal after heal, a similar macro will increase your HPS.
---
Grey mobs definitely
---
Green mobs are fine provided they are within 2-3 levels of you. Below that the XP/hr starts to drop right off.
---
So at level 30 I would probably grind through an area that had 26-28 level mobs, but I would skip an area that had 24-26 level.
---
Pics on the internet haven't gotten me erect like this in 20 years.
---
Female trolls are the ultimate waifu and no shoes means instant access to fewt pussay.
---
See I actually enjoyed the ToC content a great deal. I just wish the 5 man ToC wouldn't have given welfare epics like it did. That was too easy of a catchup mechanic for people who hadn't done ulda. I thought the 10/25 man ToC and especially ToGC were very well down.
---
LFD was a huge mistake, but we also got ICC which is one of the best raids the game has ever had imho. Some of those fights had some crazy ass mechanics, and fighting the Lich King was fucking epic.
---
Can someone link the video? not working here
---
It 100% would be if I had not been playing private servers all these years. For me it's number 3 of all time hype.  
---
1. Guild Wars 2  
---
2. Vermintide 2  
---
3. Classic WoW
---
If you refuse to wear an objectively superior item because it has the word "cloth" instead of "leather" please don't join a guild.
---
This and the under city one were some of my favorite memories from vanilla/tbc.
---
was the old runecloth hand in for rep a thing for this iteration of the game or was that way later?
---
Wow he sucks, he keeps getting frozen /s
---
Burning Legion? Alliance or Horde?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I remember too. Meld get automatic better stealth
---
This is brilliant!!! I had a similar issue, I saw my brother playing wow and it looked amazing. I got the game and rolled a hunter. 
---
I got to about level 16-17 and he came to help me on some quests......but couldn‚Äôt believe how bad my DPS was or how I just auto shot and meleed. He also asked me why I didn‚Äôt have a pet. 
---
I hadn‚Äôt ever been to a trainer, but just kept questing away.  Didn‚Äôt know about talent points of class trainers. Felt like a right noob! Haha
---
They need classic to run at the same speed as retail.  It makes server management much easier, but it wont improve graphics.  The look will be the same as vanilla in 1.12.
---
Oh god, you're right /laughsob
---
Play restore druid? I'd think hots are affected less by ping but I've never played one so I could be wrong.
---
Tailoring/Engineering is the absolute best for both pvp/pve if you intend to tryhard
---
I used to use a stance dance macro so I could bind all 3 stances to two key binds, also a macro to equip a shield and cast shield bash allowed you to interrupt in battle stance.
---
As for charge, it has always been buggy as hell, but it used to at least let you get a hamstring off, and your charge didn‚Äôt get slowed if you were snared. Many of the pserver charges end up in you being nowhere near where your target was in the first place, and you get there so late that they have already had time to move.
---
The whole doing the same raid 4 times a week thing and the massive amount of daily quests is what I was mainly getting at with ToC. The raid itself was pretty easy and OK.
---
The fact we are legit getting classic with modern wow graphics I think this could be the greatest game ever
---
Your friends and family will begin to give up on you as your self destructive pattern of behavior re-emerges.  That will be the final nail in the coffin, the severing of your last bit of hope.  Bereft of your tether, you will surely be doomed to your fate.  Abandon hope all ye who enter.
---
Seriously... Judgement, Bloodfang, Transcendance.  
---
Actual artistic masterpieces.
---
You're correct. Came from a quest in the first scourge invasion.
---
You're telling me I won't die instantly if I play for more than 5 hours? Madness.
---
Using all my guild to buy Bloodrazor, an epic sword with no stats at level 54 on my Warlock, just because it was 'epic'
---
Ahhh haha, all the tedious and downright unenjoyable shit so many people have forgotten.
---
Yeah, Tier 6 and Tier 13 come close, but Judgement really is the best looking set of all time.
---
Thanks!!
---
I, as a level 13 mage and a 12 year old body, body pulled things in Ragefire Chasm, and told the tank to cool his shit when he was (rightfully) pissed at me for body-pulling, meele+fireball, and dying over and over.
---
Rest In Peace :(
---
"We made it boys!" Almost as cancer as "LETS GOOOOOOOO BOYS"
---
Is the Character stats screen just the same as 1.12?
---
I‚Äôm confused why lay on hands wiped the raid? Because you had no mana?
---
No problem, gotta keep those Hordies sweating ;)
---
I'm not concerned with my reputation after 55 or so since by that time, I'll be exalted with all the main factions. I'm mostly concerned with the reputation at level 40. Basically, besides the fact I don't want to ride a ram, I also don't want to waste gold on a mount that I'll never ride again once I get the cat.
---
i believe one of the main reasons it won't be in is that they fixed the issues that made wall jumping possible and won't be messing with them to re-enable it.
---
On a similar note, I spent a few hours killing bears with my friend outside of uh...the dwarf town in loch modan, in order to get enough silver to buy one of the common axes from the blacksmith in the town.
---
Thought it was freaking amazing.
---
Wait. Are they really just going to eventually re release all the expansions in order? I thought the idea was to just keep vanilla alive for people who want to experience while still expanding on retail? That‚Äôs so weird if they just eventually re release all their expansions lol.
---
I suppose this would be my route. Seeing it visually now, man I really don't need to go back to the trainer much later on. Seems I can go from 27 to 33 w/o a trainer. 
---
for some reason I am blanking out on level 28 talents...as a dwarf - I dont really need desperate heal updated much. So 27-33 should be faster now. Then hit the trainer at 34 and probably skip until 40 unless I found myself having to hit the city for some reason.

Are we already in a day and age where 60fps is being looked down on?  Damn, I‚Äôm getting ooooold.
---
Nae, my true friends and family have been waiting 15 years for my return...
---
Am I retarded?  I downloaded and it isn't very large and it's missing essential files such as the .exe.
---
Thanks for putting them all on in an album. Just keep updating this thread. You might even get a sticky!
---
Unpopular, I know it, but Tauren Druid for me.  :(
---
My understanding is no. You'll notice that there are no mobs around, that's because they are controlled server-side, and this is just the client side. Pservers have had all the client data since they've existed, it's the server data that they don't have, and still won't have. They may be able to use classic to test certain things more thoroughly and update their cores to be more accurate, but they won't be able to just pull all the data (especially because the classic data has been updated to fit into the newer engine). At least that's my understanding from my somewhat limited knowledge, someone may correct me if I'm wrong.

The difference between a 4 hour slog and a 30 minute loot pi√±ata raid is consumables.  Playing a mage?  More than 3 targets? Lip,  Oil of immolation, sapper, cone, snap, cone, AE.   Every single cool down.  Your ability to be the best relies on understanding what the best way to play your class is.  90% of mages would just frostbolt each target until they died.

I‚Äôm upping this SOLEly (see what I did there) on just how bizarre and comical this is.
---
Top comment hell yah
---
This was kinda a fun day!  For the most part all the GMs were still needed to take tickets, as those kept rolling in, but of course we knew what was going on and were very interested our selves!  We had some of the work stations monitoring the events so we were helping people and periodically taking a look to see what we could.  Mostly it was a fun Blizzard pride kind of day for us because it was another cool milestone that happened while we were there, but there were quite a few invis GMs running around while that was going on! ;)
---
Awesome!
---
How. Do. I. Subscribe? My 15 year old self is dying right now
---
Dear mods, if you could pin this instead of the MRGM post I think a lot of us would appreciate it. It sounds like OP is going to update this when he has time.
---
It was probably Skyrim but this is sure high on the list.
---
100%
---
Did he take the pictures down or something? I don't see any.
---
There are definitely some elements to the rise unrelated to the announcements. My guess is that search engine rankings of this sub now reached a point where more and more threads on here can be found in search results without even querying for Classic-related keywords. I'm sure there are more explanations though.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to actually raiding the content of classic. Me and my friends reached 60 about 2 months before TBC launched.  By that time most guilds on the server were done running things or had given up cause it was going to be redundant.
---
You are very incorrect if you think Mages and Hunters are in the same bracket.
---
&gt; I'm sure there are thousands of others just like me. I started my journey as an orc hunter on Eonar (US) in Fall 2005. I joined a BRD pug and needed on HoJ because it had attack power.
---
All the pictures are there and working
---
I spent most of the games melting rogue faces with retaliation with my 2h fury warrior.  Didn't read the notes when they added the spinning sword animation.  Preceded to get kited and wrecked by a rogue I had been going kill for kill with for the better part of a week in winterspring.
---
All pictures are here and working!
---
I never played private servers but I'm gonna start skinning mining to save up mats to level engi.
---
Drop skinning for engi then eventually drop mining for tailoring if I need Robe of the archmage.
---
Then maybe drop tailoring for herbalism if I get an alt with alchemy
---
Do that but ask people in game for help. ;)
---
That way you'll gain friendships and community etc
---
and probably get you banned as well.
---
Haha!  Interesting, let me see what I can remember.  Since that was from the WoW beta that happened before I was working there, so if I recall correctly they did update the tool at some point to have a check box I could check that flagged login and select a new name.  The 5 name thing is vaguely familiar though, so I wonder if it was updated very shortly after I got there, can't remember exactly!  
---
They were definitely updating the customer support tools!  We actually went through an entire overhaul of the support tool and we had to beta test the new tool while it was in development.  Eventually we switched over but it was basically an updated version of the same thing so it wasn't to big of a deal.
---
Nah that was added later
---
Probably meant Devine Intervention. I think it is to be an aggro wipe on the target even if they cancelled the shield so you could really fuck up.
---
What do you find is the most successful way to use your guide? Second monitor? Or do you effectly just know it so well you hardly reference it?
---
How much homework would you suggest someone needs to put into this guide to be able to get something out of it?
---
Thank you for answering by the way, it helps a lot.
---
[huge]ly shit post
---
‚ÄúI was thinking of joining the military.  But what if I lag out there!?  I‚Äôm dead!!‚Äù
---
I have done this, we were 2 druids 1 rogue. Just as doable but of course with more gear it becomes more efficient. It's probably possible with 1 druid 1 rogue if they are good at this type of stuff.
---
Poor warrior.  We/they don‚Äôt stand a chance against anything.  T__T
---
I feel like you're not trolling, but there's no pics. Just says 'loading...' in red.
---
I have a question related to that.
---
Hypothetically, if the speedrunning community really takes off in WoW, if speedrunners start doing things in groups of five would they eventually include dungeons in their runs do you think?
---
What I'm basically asking is, is the reason that dungeons aren't part of speedruns currently because there's too much risk of wiping and too much inefficiency in finding a group and going to the dungeon? Or even under perfect circumstances would dungeons still not be worth it in classic WoW?
---
Thanks for all your awesome hard work with this, it's really inspiring.
---
This looks so good. I just woke up and you already made my day man haha thanks!
---
Try using the imgur link i have posted on the top of the post. Same pictures there
---
Your welcome man!
---
God it felt like a distant dream then, now it's soooooo cloooooooose
---
LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
Warriors are best end game/raid tanks. Druids are good in dungeons for their AOE capabilities.
---
Warlock is not as strong as hunter in early tiers, stronger than hunter in later tiers. One spriest is usually brought for the debuff that increases shadow damage, but they don't do a lot of damage on their own. 
---
All of the classes are great in PvP in their own respects
---
on your PB records of speedrun - is this based on 100% all tags, all quests w/ no waiting for spawns?
---
personally I am annoyed with many of the speed runs I have seen on barren chat, since they do not account for actual competition from other players. With that said, if your speedrun is based on live active servers that you have to compete for and perhaps wait for X quests spawns / escorts to respawn - what are your times look like for the following categories:
---
1-10, 1-20, 1-30
---
with the standard fc spec you have 3/5 feral instict, which makes your stealth more effective, although the difficult spot is in the ramp leading up to the door you picklock, the pack needs to be distracted by the rogue, so that the druid can pass.
---
Not sure what was happening here.  It was either some GM going rogue or there was something going on that was being investigated and that area really was off limits.  My only doubt it how they handled it, which is why I wonder if they went rogue.  I feel like that isn't normal protocol, but without the behind the scenes hard to speculate!
---
Yikes.
---
T3 Warlock is the strongest pvp class in Vanilla by a very large margin.
---
Good. Gooooood.
---
Something I noticed. Is bnet integration in game gone? I don‚Äôt see the button above chat

Choosing a night elf hunter on my first play session.
---
You're welcome!  It's been a lot of fun reminiscing with everyone about vanilla WoW!  Can't wait for Classic!
---
this actually made me lol. perfect
---
That's true but now they can use a new client which from the looks of it will be much better than the old one. Although the next problem will be if the addons are going to be compatible which I doubt.
---
Amazing! I have it for pc but I wonder if im going to buy it for my switch. Definitly checking it out!!!
---
The pepega one killed me haha, I love it
---
&gt; Partially done means it's not done...

By this defintion, it will never be "done". You do know that?

I'm not sure how to link the discord, but if you go to his main website I think there's a link there

I'd love a list of the strengths and weaknesses of each class in regards to the whole 1-60 experience. Things like, what classes have good uptime, good aoe pulls, pvp, even like movement speed/efficiency. 
---
What are some good class combos to duo level with? I see you mentioned warrior/priest.
---
Muse and Ben Fold Five were my WoW grinding music.  Every single time I walk onto the shimmering flats I hear "Well I thought about the army".
---
I remember being very new to the game and low level, and I was cheerfully window shopping at the Darnassus weapon vendor on my nub warrior, thinking "I can't wait to level up and afford these weapons." I thought those garbage white weapons were my future. Cute, when I think about it.
---

---
Your story is nice btw. It's any gamers dream to meet his wife on the game he loves haha
---
I swear the VAST majority of people hating on druids have never played one, and certainly not in Vanilla. 
---
It's a GREAT class and INSANELY fun.
---
I came from a game where you couldn‚Äôt respec, and I knew I wanted to heal. So I leveled a 0/0/51 healing druid from the bottom up to 60. 
---
The only reason I didn‚Äôt give up on the game entirely in my 30s in STV was a rogue who took me under his wing and from then on helped me level to 60. He ended up doing all the logistics of quests and damage/tanking while I was essentially his pocket healer. 
---
But with all that i wasn‚Äôt a good healer. I didn‚Äôt really realize I could down rank, and I used regrowth a lot (which was a really expensive spell). I only really figured out how to properly heal in MC when someone introduced me to a post about priest healing on elitist jerks. I then applied these ideas to druid and was able to redeem myself as a good healer from then on, 
---
The good old times when nobody knew how to play properly.
---
Dude.
---
That link in the comment you made works. Thanks.
---
Science damn it!
---
It's super fun on consoles with a friend! Also I think it comes with the necro on Switch I think (could be wrong there).

He doesn't know about down ranking in classic. PepeLaugh
---
It's maybe not bad, but it's not on the same level as Path of Exile by a mile
---
I suppose it might have been a threat issue either way :)
---
Gnome warrior. 
---
Nothing breaks immersion faster for me than something that small able to be as physically capable as a creature 4-8x its size.
---
From what I recall/gathered alliance warlocks are better in raiding because paladins can help them manage their threat, while horde warlocks are better in pvp because they don't have to deal with Will of the Forsaken.
---
Lol brother
---
This one is brilliant you poor thing
---
I do two types of timekeeping - one is to around level 20 or 30 on live launches to account for competition, and the second is 100% all tags, all quests for the full run, because generally I am by myself by somewhere level 20-30.
---
I think the important part is to consider what your PB means to you. For many people on Barrens Chat, it's their PB compared to others in the same sandbox, so they can compare apples with apples. For others, it's their PB in a more PVP manner on live servers outcompeting both fellow faction players and opposing faction. For me, it's my PB against myself, on classic values.
---
Having said that, here's my most recent run on a live server launch:
---
1-10 2h 9min
---
10-20 10h flat
---
No 20-30 time as my power went out around level 24 but I was running second Alliance at that stage.
---
Some zones were darker, some Vanilla zones were actually brighter than their Modern counterparts. Elwynn Forest. 1.12 on the left, Modern WoW on the right: [https://i.imgur.com/6n8fsqf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6n8fsqf.jpg)
---
This would be entirely internet speed dependant, I've heard Korea's internet is quick though so you'll probably be fine
---
To be honest this is one of those times I've gone based on other people's assumptions about the inefficiency of doing dungeons. The only real way to know for sure would be to get that group you mentioned, and then measure the XP/hr.
---
I would do a run with just pure XP/hr from doing the dungeon, and I would also do a run using the available quests including travel time to turn them in, if it's not too onerous, to determine what the XP/hr was including the quests.
---
There's also the added benefit if you are trying to speedlevel a melee class, that the armor and weapons you get from a well run dungeon and its quests will have a nice knock-on effect in your further solo levelling.
---
The only way you'd know for sure would be to do it.
---
Aside of refresh rate going 21:9 instead of 16:9 will be noticeable too - an ultrawide monitor rocks in WoW.
---
Love it - really appreciate the response.
---
MY  BODY IS REEEEAAADYYY
---
Whatever your class, if you don't raid, PVP will be very frustrating once "everybody" is in BWL / AQ (unless you reach rank 13 and get the epic PVP set, but if you have enough time and commitment to reach R13 you would be able to raid).
---
It probably comes third to Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm for me
---
We made this guide to be printable or to be viewed on a second monitor or a device like an ipad. I know it by memory up to around level 40, but I still stop and check because I'm getting old and sometimes forget things :)
---
Homework wise, it would be ideal to do at least one milk run through it, slowly even, just to get a handle on where quest givers, mob locations, etc are. That would be the biggest improvement first up.
---
Actually she looks pretty cool. Might roll one.
---
Cata probably, that's when they updated the saber rep grind I believe. I didn't play Horde so I can't be sure.
---
Is grinding hard worth it?
---
It's painful to go back to 60Hz once you've gotten used to 144Hz, but if you've only ever been at 60Hz then it's no problem.
---
Honestly I'm a bit of a one-trick pony - I best know Hunter and levelling. Coming second would be Paladin, since that is what I main. The rest of them, including other melee classes and duos, is only from practise runs testing our guide and talking to others who specialise in those departments.
---
If you listen to podcasts, check out some of Countdown to Classic's more recent ones, there have been quite a few segments recently talking about the specific classes and how to pvp with them. For duoing, I'd suggest jumping on a specific speedrunning community like Joana's world discord.

Classic WoW is #1 for me, seriously. Vanilla WoW have been the #1 for me until now.

---
Christ  this sub's a joke, you idiots find something some other idiot said and because he said it 13 years ago and archived it, you think you've found the rosetta stone. The formulas are wrong and the guy who added them to the wiki admitted it was only a barely tested guess.
---
What is it/what does it do?
---
Why do you have 200 ms??
---
If you mean to get XP/hr, some grinding is worth it, because at certain stages and levels you will find grinding is more efficient. But only grinding is a slower way to level, because it's disregarding all the XP you can gain from quests as you go.
---
Fallout 3 for me.
---
Almost every single release I've ever been hyped for has been a major letdown.
---
Halo Reach, Dark Souls 2/bloodborne, skyrim and most pokemon games just to name a few all taught me not to get my expectations up. They are all worse than previous games in the respective series, and they all proved to me that a good game is often lightning in a bottle rather than something a company or series can consistently create.
---
Isn't it the right way to do it ? It has been something like 15 years since I didn't run ZF but I thought if you don't open the tombs they all open when you agro the boss.
---
I'd always recommend Classic to anyone wanting to try it, theres never any harm in trying any game really. It will offer a good challenge, a chance to have a real social atmosphere where you can make friends (or enemies), and the class diversity in Classic is quite fun.
---
Not to shit on the idea but why would you want to do that? 1-10 only takes a couple hours so it‚Äôs definitely a huge waste of time to get over there and try to do it so if you‚Äôre leveling with a friend or something it‚Äôd probably be better to just meet up in barrens or something after the starting zones
---
Gz
---
I wouldn't duel until about lvl 20.   I thought if I lost in a duel, I'd die and the other player would be able to loot me :(
---
This is cool, but you're missing some spells for the warrior. For example, R1 Sunder armor is level 10, not 22
---
(Female, ugly, old, beehive hairdo) Gnome Warrior that never shows helmet. Prot and Arms only. Fury is a joke to me.
---
I was a Late Bloomer. Was still a Little Guy when I started playing. Lots of other small kids wanted to be a hulking beast. I wanted to be a strong little guy. 
---
As soon as I saw a Gnome with a 2 Hander, I knew that was my class. 
---
Rerolling my gender for MAXIMUM PvP humiliation.
---
How is this the wrong sub? It's classic content on the classic sub. I can't argue if it's pointless or not because I don't plan on playing druid, but it's infinitely more interesting than half the stuff people post in here.
---
It sounds like you want to play a PvE server on retail because nothing in vanilla hits all your criteria.
---
Downranking spells would add even more keybinds. Am I missing something? Tf is a pepelaugh?
---
Even Dasani?

Bullshit.

Start with mining/skinning go engenering/taillering later.

My favorite casting animations are the Orc Females.

Good luck man... sleep is good though, remember that.

---
When I used your guide this never made sense to me? Is this a typo or are you supposed to grind a whole lvl?
---
Thanks
---
I mean, IF was more popular than SW in Vanilla anyways so just chill there instead.
---
It's a good way for them to give a little something to eat to the community without committing to any firm date. After 15 years running the game, I don't think they're still naive and think we wouldn't notice the beta client.
---
I didn't realize it at the time, but meeting my future wife.
---
I think my concern was that I wasn't sure if classic was just a nostalgic thing that everyone wanted to play again or if the gameplay was actually decent and FUN that people want to go back to that style. 
---
Why exactly there is so much hype for Classic WoW is really intriguing to me. I'm looking forward to more info on it. 
---
Thanks for the input
---
in bgs to have the most kilks with my T2 Hunter. even MC trash mob farming with 20 people was very cool.
---
Could you dm me as well? :)
---
I wish your posting would get struck down so I never had to see it again.

A friend of mine rolled a warrior for the entirety of vanilla. In tbc he noticed that he missed his lvl 10 warrior quest for the defense stance. 
---
He tanked btw. Not very good, but he tanked.
---
FF6 for sure my fav and I played them all from 1 to X-2. 
---
I've just been leveling my WoW alts out of boredom, but now you got me thinking. Think I'll try to bust the Playstation out of storage this weekend and play FF6 through 9 during this classic wait.
---
I'd say the gameplay was decent because it offered challenge at all levels of the game. In current WoW or even SWTOR you can pull tons of enemies and AoE them down even at the lower levels. In Classic WoW if you pull more than 2 enemies at a time (sometimes even 2 is too many) theres a good chance you'll be killed. As far as the rest of the combat goes it's your standard MMO hotbar experience and the classes are more diverse in Classic than in current.
---
It‚Äôs definitely one of the most fun MMO experiences I‚Äôve had, having played on a private server. Started in 09 with late BC, I can‚Äôt wait to play the official blizz version. 
---
Basically modern wow is incredibly boring because it‚Äôs been simplified for the lowest common denominator. Classes all feel identical, I can‚Äôt stress that enough, all melee, all casters, all healers feel very very similar and on top of that less spells/ abilities than ever. 
---
Classic has engaging combat, great world ambience, atmosphere and most importantly a truly social world because everyone‚Äôs forced to cooperate if anyone wants epic L0oTz. 
---
You want epi3 lootZ right? 
---
Trust me you do (;
---
Dude, if undeads were a thing IRL, I would decimate them with a flamethrower.

Taurens are a model of tolerance imo :o

I'm 34 years old. I was actually planning on quitting my job this year and try getting into some studies for a year or so, which would later on help in my career. To do this I would have to move to another city.

So basically, WoW Classic is coming, I am moving to another town for university of sorts and it really feels like 2005. all over again. :D
---
Welcome, it‚Äôs gonna be a blast

Mojo I think it was Valentine's Day.  Frog that emotes hearts when you blow it a kiss I think.
---
I have played this game for 14 years and never noticed that
---
This video is great! I'm strongly considering rolling druid for classic. It wasn't my actual vanilla main, but it seems really interesting and different. Haven't decided how I'll go at 60, farming pummelers to be a decent cat dps is somewhere between fascinating and horrifying.
---
Nice attempt there bud
---

---
Why do people subscribe to a subreddit?
---
 I have every r/ I need bookmarked on my browser...
---
If classic is successful odds are they will release TBC.
---
Just an opinion non supported by facts, but I don't think it's possible to be exalted with every factions before 60. In vanilla I don't think I reached exalted on my main faction before 60 even on my first char were I explored everything and did all the quests I could find.

Thanks. It really is a dream that's come true. I'm super lucky.

It's a rare shirt from scholo but the dumb part was that it had to be a personal loot drop. you didn't get to roll on it but it's just a red shirt
---
Well, it isn't as bad. Tauren just get neglected due to hitbox messing with the deadzone unless you're quite used to it. PvE wise they are not that far, since few racials are worthy (+damage to beasts and maybe bow skill during Rhok'delar usage for trolls and orcs' +pet damage but pets don't scale).
---
I do love me some loot! I played a lot of Diablo 2 last summer and then a bunch after the Median XL Sigma update.

Very relevant to the subreddit. Never thought of using barkskin + insect swarm to farm elementals as showcased in the video. Great content!

I watched Blizzcon on my TV with my gf reading a book beside me in the sofa. The moment when they said "vanilla" (refering to ice cream), I flew up like a Bee had stung me and my beer was all over The Place. However, I had a smile on my face for days to come.
---
Care to share what quests you do in the NE starting area/what level you leave/where you go to grind? Would be much appreciated :)
---
Yes, mods have seemingly decided data-mining the Classic WoW beta client is not related to Classic WoW. Figure that one out.  
---
Or maybe they've decided data-mining is naughty despite the fact that every mainstream WoW website has been doing it every content patch for the last 5 years? Who knows...
---
yeah doesn't matter because wars will be rolling on this anyway. And if they tank the dungeon (which he should), they will even reserve the leather they need and people will still join their group because tank are the hardest to find.
---
I was told once this sub is working with blizz cm‚Äôs. Kivax eas posting here. Wouldn‚Äôt be a susprise to have some censorship here.
---
Which is not necesseraly a bad thing, as people tend to go nuts with seeing unofficial beta datamined things, then going apeshit crazy as if it was delivered by blizz.
---
They were removed because they violate Blizzard's TOS.
---
Locked.
---
I made a troll hunter and leveled to 10 in the starting zone if I remember correctly which took a few weeks. I couldn't figure out how to get out of the starting zone I just kept running in circles killing things cause I couldn't figure out how to progress and than I eventually gave up and didn't come back to the game for 6 months.
---
Undead baron mount, i want it
---
Make use of that friends list. There will be times you feel a bit lost
---
&gt;  on my own/by accident (was too young and stupid to read about stuff like this online or watch YouTube videos about it) that you could zone into Deadmines on a Mage and then blink back out of the dungeon portal and it wouldn‚Äôt actually give you the load screen and take you out of the dungeon instance. It would actually put you in the outer preinstance but still technically be in the instance of that makes sense. Only was was visible from the inside of the portal would load though. So I blinked back through and went down the hall and turned left where I saw essentially a tunnel that just stopped into the blue sky/open air. I jumped down and spent hours swimming around (it was a giant ocean with a few randomly scattered islands). I eventually swam until I was underneath SW I believe. Thought I was a pretty big badass and assumed I was the only one in the world that knew about
---
team alea hun
---
Cool it buddy
---
TBC. It just had this amazing vibe over it due to all those new things you could do in zones that were literally alien. Blizz back then really had a good sense of how to complement Classic. Those early days with people swarming through HP and Zangarmarsh really were tons of fun
---
Any plans to have people helping you for classic launch? Aka warlocks summoning you around, people feeding you gold/consumables/gear, people killing the stuff you tag etc.
---
Poor racials. WotF ends up as your THIRD or FOURTH anti-fear move (zerker rage, recklessness, death wish are warriors' in-built anti-fear moves). Cannibalize is fine as is the shadow resist. Water breathing is quite moot. 
---
Not that bad by themselves but compared to other races they do not shine at all.  Orcs' +axe and bloodrage, trolls' berserking and even tauren' innate health bonus and resistance.

Firstly, as someone who plans on levelling as Alliance thank you so much for all of the hard work you put into your guides. I spent a lot of time levelling toons with guides in Vanilla/BC after doing the 'traditional' leveling routes for years and loved how they took me off the beaten path into zones I'd never explored previously (especially Ferelas). 
---
Why is Darkshore considered a better alternative for leveling than Westfall/Redridge or Loch Modan? It's particularly interesting that you return there for levels 24-27.
---
Also, does one need to take into account the type of server they're on? Meaning, do you design the guides with the intention of steering players away from heavy PVP areas like STV in order to avoid interruptions to leveling?
---
I have a lot of good memories, but one of my favorites is my rogue friend tanking Nefarian for the last couple percent after the MT died for our first Nef kill.
---
First dungeon run. My pet was set on aggro. We wiped.
---
Yeah but I like to browse by category if that makes any sense :D.
---
Like when I want to read WoW stuff, I just go to that sub reddit, I find it strange to have them mixed up like that.
---
First moment i get out of the orc inital zone into durotar. See that castle and go in killing every human i see. Realize only after 5 kills those were just npcs. :(
---
Ya trying to figure out where I could avoid going and when I needed to hit the trainer was one of my goals for doing it visually like that.  There are many different spells which I might go back and get post lvl 40 mount, that have utility, but don't benefit leveling.  And of course post 60 I'll buy all the spells but there isn't a immediate need for many, and other even only need the first rank.
---
Nelf druid was my 2nd toon, and the one I played most with friends. I had slim to none understanding of how stats worked or what gear would be good to have, so around level 40ish I bought that 2H mace with a stun proc and no stats. Judge's gavel? Also, begged a friend for a weapon damage enchant on it (for the glows, you see). Yet somehow I balanced my way onwards, meleeing mobs in elf form. :)
---
He lacks the critical information PepeLaugh

I found a warrior lvl30-32 who only had heroic strike rank1 lol, and his name was champion in my language.

Good games never go out of style. I play old games more than new. Diablo 1/2 mostly, but occasionally old consoles. Nes, SNES, Twisted on 3DO lol :)

Why there is no addon for this? Just pack these like they did with vanilla guide and you are done.

I primarily do it your way when I want to binge a r/ every once and again.  The other method is good for secondary things, usually smaller r/ 's that might show up randomly on your feed, that might make you smile.  The cute and aww type r/.

You'll be fine.
---
Our entire guild raided with 400ms through Vanilla and TBC.
---
Think of it to be like WotLK's frost lotus but no scribes selling them cheap since they can't use it. It is just vanilla's main flask reagent.
---
From what I remember the boss will summon some mummy trolls whether or not you open any of the sand tombs and they stay unopened if you don't touch them.
---
I played SWTOR for almost a year and loved it. It does some things better than Classic will. 
---
Classic does more things better than SWTOR including the most important thing: the world feels continuous, connected, and coherent. 
---
Answer 2: Current WoW shooed off most of its players who wanted an MMORPG. The players who remain are largely comprised of people who want easy rewards. That is an untenable situation since there is no longer anything beneath the surface and meaningless rewards feel shallow after some time. It just took a few big mistakes with their current gearing system and with changing some class talents and cooldowns to blow the lid off the simmering volcano.
---
Pretty certain you missed the Tabard of the Protector which came from the invasion event I believe.  (Still have that one on my Shaman yo this day)
---
Yes plain and simple. Just looking forward to having a strong server community to be a part of again.
---
The Tabard of the Protector came from the invasion event, it looked the same but had an on use ability.
---
back in vanilla as hunter i only respec once. my plan in classic dont to respec my shadow priest.

It actually bothers me that orcs are the only horde race that wear shoes. Forces me into orc everytime for that reason, I like full gear sets and not seeing shoes bugs me.

I second that. They're pretty much one of my standard go-tos when I'm at the gym. ;)

warlock skill field is so thicc  someone is going to make waifu out of it on Deviantart...

Anytime!

Darkshore when done well provides you with about 20k XP/hr which is much higher than Westfall. This is due to the very high number of quests in the area, plus a high density of level appropriate mobs you can kill as you travel about to quests. It also has two graveyards which helps a little if you do happen to die in the higher level area to the south.
---
Westfall has some great questlines however suffers from everything being spread well apart, and some of the quest chains require travelling to SW etc. Any time spent on a gryphon is XP you lose. It can definitely give you good XP/hr but it's not *as* good as Darkshore.
---
Server type - the guide is my own personal speedrunning guide designed to chase a first to 60. As a result, you're expected to be running clear of everyone else about level 30-40 if not earlier. This reduces the issues around PVP. Even if you're dealing with some ganking in STV, it is still more efficient to quest/grind through there than to grind elsewhere. It's extremely rich in quests especially at stages in Alliance levelling where there is otherwise a lack of quests you can do. There are definitely areas where we mark to skip quests though if you're on a PVP server, such as Stonetalon Mountains, because you're far more likely to be impacted by PVP and for not enough reward to mitigate XP loss from being ganked.
---
This is me but the grinding is reversed
---
Lvl 13 Tauren Warrior here.
---
Met a lvl 47 troll priestess in the Cave of Thunder Bluff.
---
I was surprised because she was the first troll i have seen since i immidiatly created a tauren without looking at the other races.
---
She had such a cool hairstyle :D
---
We were talking for weeks. 
---
One day she said follow me. We were running from Crossroads until Org. Took a zeppelin to Undercity. We were walking and walking until we reached a strange building with a massive bridge. 
---
 Behind the building she started to undress her character. 
---
Began with talking in /e and kneeling down to my char. 
---
I was so shocked since i was 12 years old about all of this. I remember how rockhard not only the taurenhorn was.. 
---
Then i pretended i have to leave the house because of parents. 
---
I dressed up and used my hearth and logged off for 2 Days.
---
After that it wasnt the same between me and my best gamingfriend. 
---
She was 18yo and have a thing for younger boys..
---
btw. For all of you. she send me a video of her doing what we just talked about so that wad enough verification for me back in the day. And she was pretty to no end.
---
I know some people do this but I personally prefer an unaided run. Call me a traditionalist - I think solo runs should be solo, apart from the odd party you might make for a quest with other levellers or trading greens with another player in the start area.
---
When you're interested in lots of subs it's very handy to have your own frontpage to quickly check the most relevant news of the day from all of them, it's like r/all but made from only subs you're subscribed to.
---
If you regularly use only a few subs ofc it may not appear that useful.
---
In any case it doesn't prevent you from going into specific subs for more detailed content, it's just an addition.
---
Your thumb,  can it bend even more?
---
In case your serious.   This is so relatable to me. I had given up and resigned myself to just away off my mother's generosity till it ran out than kill myself because I couldn't find any decent work and depression was being a major bitch. 
---
But, there's always something if you look for it.  I just got a job as security full time 40 hour weeks at minimal for $10 to start with.  Will probably hit $15 an hour in no time.  
---
And that's me with no high school diploma or GED and minimum useful skills.   If I had a diploma and more relevant skills they wouldve started me off at higher pay. 
---
So there's hope for almost anyone.  Just keep looking and you'll eventually face plant into a job somewhere! üòÅ
---
the most streamers are no pro gamers. people like me are good players and getting bored when watching streams of noob gamers.
---
After looking for videos i have detected that only few videos with cool shadow priests exist.
---
Im planning to take 6-8 weeks off (vacation included) for Classic
---
Idk, I feel like my videos might get them hyped, but only if they played back in the day.
---
Most people that comment seem to say things to that effect. ;)
---
Hi, /u/Vralak
---
I started on an rp server but went to ED when it opened as RP-PVP. With the refusal of blizzard to release rp-pvp at launch I have decided I will just go RP. I also agree with you that at the end of the day being on a pvp server is just an extra hassle.
---
Help me
---
That's because that is the old Brian Kopp's guide and not ours. It's not a typo in that guide, but it is a bit janky.
---
This is from our guide for around that section:
---
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mrM5Zmd.png)
---
I had no concept of a DPS rotation. Every dungeon I went into I just spammed fireball or pyroblast. No rhyme or reason to which I used. Think I used pyro on bosses because it does the most damage and I need to hit harder because it's a boss. I'd then stand still for the rest of the fights because I was oom very quickly and didn't think to wand attack either.
---
lol hes just being one of those 4chan meme kids, downranking is usually only used by healers in pve to save mana. in pvp frost mages tend to use rank 1 frostbolt for a quicker cast to apply slow. basically you can get by without downranking for many classes
---
PvP server is something that's already sure. Class/faction is quite far from it.
---
I mean....play on 144hz for a bit and then go back to 60 and you will be quite shocked how it feels in comparison lol
---
Sure nps
---
im a surveillance officer making $12 an hour. i was in the military but got screwed, and since my dd214 is required for every job i apply for, i cant make use of my criminal justice college education. ive been denied over a dozen police and CO jobs. and non CRJ jobs as well because of it. 
---
so ive resigned myself to my low tier easy job until classic comes out. ill play it and relive the memories of when i was happy. then when that fades, im gone
---
You're not going to gain a competitive advantage but I can promise you the  difference between the two is real and it's large.
---
Being LVl 49 realising What talents Where lmao
---
i will always fear mob groups in dungeon. i dont heal when the tank dont wait for my mana.
---
Because the notion is laughable ?
---
It's whatever it was in 1.12. No need to hope for anything.
---
here is a MadSeasonShow video that explains all the main reasons why he (and i think most people) are looking forward to the Classic game again:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdvm62IUU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdvm62IUU0) 
---
he also points out differences in the game and mechanics. its quite literally a \*different\* game now than it used to be, so i think that has something to do with the fact that so many people are itching to get back to original :)
---
For a busy start, I do everything except quests involving static respawns like Iverron's Antidote if I have to wait to get a spawn. I also will skip the quest for the dresser in the furbolg camp as that one tends to be an issue, and skip things like the sprouts quest for the elementals if they are being monopolised.  
---
Nelf hunter is a problem before 10 so often I'll grind to 10, or use up all the quests I can get in the area early to get to 10 and get a pet.  
---
Busy starts I'm heading out of Teldrassil by level 11. Perfect starts I am nearly 13 when I leave. The main thing is to avoid the traffic. Not all quests in Darkshore are available at level 11, so you also have to do some grinding there, but there's plenty of mobs so it's easily done.
---
Both a rogue and a warrior can spank you in a few global so while Fake Casting MB may work if they are low HP, a fresh health player will not care and you'll have just lost 2.5 seconds of valuable time you could have spanned HN
---
Fake casting is easy, the time wasted by doing so is plenty to let a rogue in particular farm you
---
Are the mods asleep?
---
Great post buddy
---
Is there a horde equivalent?
---
I don't do horde side, but doesn't the Forsaken start one rep level lower than the other races? Would this have an affect on whether they can do quests there?
---
Joana's Horde guide is currently the best horde guide available
---
These didn‚Äôt work in the demo either just to confirm.
---
Skinning until you buy a mount, then drop it for a crafting skill.
---
I am playing Diablo 2 Path of Diablo mod!
---
This is nostalgya with benefits.
---
Try it. 
---
kills time realy efficently.
---
Ah is that still the case, do you both offer add-ons?
---
That's really interesting, thanks for sharing. I do wonder about quest chains that lead to dungeon quests. As you're speedrunning it makes complete sense to avoid those since grouping up would only weigh you down. But would you advise a more casual player to pursue them? I'm thinking of the Deadmines quest chains in particular. 
---
I also wonder about how gear factors in with speedrunning. I assuming you're purely utilizing gear from quests and random drops alone. Do you find that is sufficient for all classes, or merely as a hunter?
---
If you‚Äôre interested in lore, I‚Äôd say give WC3 a shot, it sets the stage for classic WoW and is a fun experience too.
---
I totally agree. My most anticipated expansion of all time was TBC. I remember when they first placed the Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands. I almost get goosebumps thinking of the moment I finally got to enter it. What a magical time that was.
---
I believe Joana is planning to offer an addon for his Horde side guide to his patreons, but I don't know much more than that.
---
We'd like to arrange to have one made, but right now we're flat out working as it is.
---
Were they at least naked? Lol
---
Wow I am really surprised. I expected this thread to get overrun with care-bear snide comments but this community seems to share the same experience as me.
---
the most people will never see naxx and people who play naxx will need to wait 18 months after release of classic and another 8 months to clear naxx and equip all members with T3 items. make the math 40 member each 8-12 items is over 350 items the raid must farm
---
Holy Fire until Shadow Spec
---
nah. i‚Äôm pretty hyped i guess but i‚Äôm too concerned about my daily schedule and possibly moving as it comes out to be as hyped as i can be. i was definitely looking forward more to oblivion (and the xbox 360 in general) when i was in middle school, and i was insanely hyped for fallout 3 since one of my friends had actually just introduced me to fallout 1 and 2 just months before it was announced.
---
The pets thing is why I would like the stable master to work as a pet/mount tab. Basically storage so people can actually collect these things if they want
---
Yes, it's possible, but you can't pick some quests (like Cleansing the Well quest chain, cause it's tauren-only).
---
So freaking colorful
---
Hey! I played SWTOR from launch until mid-KOTFE (I also miss being a Sith badass), and have been playing WoW since vanilla beta (side note: I was 9 years old at vanilla launch, so my memories aren't as clear or meta-oriented as some of the older players). Current WoW is a huge, divisive topic so I won't touch on that here. Not sure how much you know about WoW, especially vanilla, I'll just mention a few things that come to mind:
---
SWTOR, gameplay-wise, is quite similar to WoW--I remember thinking when I first started playing SWTOR that the UI and gameplay was almost a total reskin of WoW, just Star Wars-ified. There are differences of course, but at their core both games use similar systems--especially the combat. Vanilla/Classic WoW was and will be more challenging than SWTOR for the most part, but nothing on the level of Dark Souls. This is mostly because mobs can hit pretty hard.
---
Mana and HP management was a big deal--even just typical questing required mana potions, bandages (if your class couldn't heal with spells) and food, drinks, and carefully monitoring your own resources and surroundings. I didn't raid until much later, too young and shy, but I watched my dad do raids and dungeons with his guild every night and they had their own challenges and mechanics (which I'm assuming was difficult enough to warrant all the yelling and profanity). On top of the typical MMO requirements of 'tank, heals, and the rest DPS', specific classes each bring their own utilities and strengths to the group, in a much more important way than modern WoW or SWTOR. 
---
If you like RPGs, you'll like Classic WoW. It had weapon specializations/skills that you leveled up separately in combat, like bows and daggers and maces, to get better at using. I even remember there used to be a window that showed which languages your character could understand. The classes don't have subclasses like in SWTOR (ie Juggernaut and Marauder), but each has three talent trees which provide variety to the class. There are more stats to keep track of on gear, such as resistances to certain elements (nature, fire, water, etc). If you play a hunter, you'll have to purchase and keep stacks of arrows in your bags, as well as food for your pet (and remember to feed it!). 
---
The world feels huge because a) it is, and b) you don't get a mount until lvl40, if you can afford it right away, and they're definitely not as fast as speeders. All of the zones are connected, within each of the two separate continents; this makes the world feel big and seamless, because it isn't disconnected like the SWTOR planets are. There's no system like Quick Travel points--only a hearthstone that can take you to one single specific innkeeper (which you can rebind to a different inn as you travel around, but no more than one hearthstone at a time), or paying a mage to create a portal to any major city for you (or making a portal yourself, if you are a mage), or teleporting to the zone called Moonglade if you're a druid.
---
The zones don't scale to your level like many of the planets do in SWTOR. SWTOR's level scaling system is very similar to current-WoW though. In vanilla, each zone has a set level bracket that the mobs do not exceed--ie lvl 50-55. If you out level them, then like in SWTOR they stop giving exp, but they also stop dropping any significant loot, from what I can remember. Most of the questlines lead you through the zones naturally, but the level brackets act as a guide too if you ever get lost (or want to change things up on another continent).
---
In order to know where to go for quests, you have to actually read the quest text. There's no area or arrow indicators on the map/minimap to show your objective location, like there is in SWTOR and current WoW. This really helped with immersion, and honestly, I remember the vanilla questlines more clearly than I do the current quests in WoW, more than a decade ago, cause I had to actually pay attention to them. The lore is really awesome when you get into it.
---
Like SWTOR (unless this changed post-KOTFE), every class has a castable class buff which boosts a stat in some way, and these buffs were important enough that buffing strangers would often be met with actual gratitude, and you always buffed yourself and your group before the dungeon/raid/battleground. (But unlike SWTOR, you can't 'collect' more than one buff via a legacy system).
---
Speaking of legacy systems, not in vanilla WoW. There's no legacy cargo/bank or legacy/account unlocks for things like mounts and items. Everything is specific to your character. This is different from current WoW, where mounts, pets, and transmogs are account-wide, and many items bind on account. You do have a personal bank for each character; I don't think guild banks existed until the first expansion was released. Lvl 1 bank and Auction House-only alts were a thing.
---
There are no companions like in SWTOR, aside from a pet if you're a hunter, or a minion if you're a warlock. You do all the crafting and selling, and any backup heals/tank/dps is gonna be an actual RL person there alongside you.
---
Vanilla puts emphasis on being social, because so much of the game requires some form of teamwork or communication. Grouping while questing so that you all get credit for the mob, asking for help finding a specific mob/item/npc because the quest text is vague, paying for portals, paying people who know how to craft certain items (and giving them the mats for it), grouping up for dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds, and creating a recognizable presence on your server/realm because there's no cross-realm interactions whatsoever. Even as a very shy child, I was much more social in vanilla than I am now in current WoW, or was in SWTOR, because I honestly had to be.
---
This ended up being really long, I am so sorry! Hopefully it didn't turn you away from Classic, which I do highly recommend you give a try when it releases!
---
Damnit every time I read one of these posts I remember back to classic when I got a hyacinth macaw and dropped it on the ground because my bags were full and it was only a white item. :-(
---
My first character to 60 was my druid, I leveled as resto all the way. Yes it took a very long time, yes I regret everything!
---
Abolish disease can be useful and shouldn't be forgone imo. also it's Renew not Renewal
---
As soon as I can farm enough gold for one, I‚Äôd be happy to try.  But that‚Äôs a ways away, sadly.

If you get gravestone scepter from BFD and you have the wand talent then it does about equal damage to mind flay at lvl 36, and cost no mana. After 40-45 when you get sform and shadow weaving mind flay rank 3 does more damage, but before then it's not really good.
---
Kinda fucks with me too, but Escape Artist is just so powerful in wpvp and engi bonus aint terrible either.
---
Gonna be really hard for me to choose min max human (+wep and +rep)  vs pvp memegod gnome.
---
Getting the assassin's blade to drop and selling it for 200g at level 20. I felt like a sultan. 
---
Also getting my level 60 epic mount on my paladin. The game actually tells you "Congratulations!" It felt truly epic and rewarding.
---
What i look for in a raider is some kind of will to improve and loyalty. 
---
If there is something you do not know how to do then ask. Enchants, Pre raid BIS, tactics, consumables all fall under the category of showing up prepared. Classic will have alot of veteran players who want to share thier hard earned knowledge take advantage. 
---
If you show up prepared to my raids i would give you loot even if other players outperform you on the meters. 
---
If your guildleaders are asking for help to do something then help them. 
---
If you are low on the dmg meters ask for help on how to get better.
---
Silent, salty, soloplayers are the worst raiders nobody knows what is up with them and tomorrow they could be gone. Do not be that type of guy, be dependable.
---
I've posted this before but as a 7-year-old I started playing my first character and got stuck on some boxes in kharanos. Not knowing how to jump I deleted my character and started again because that seemed the most logical decision at the time.
---
never played SWTOR so can't compare to it but expect lots of grinding and being grief when playing classic wow. Vanilla WoW wasn't for the softies and casuals whined A LOT!
---
The game is awesome and those hard times were well worth the stories. It's not as brutal as Ultima Online or Everquest in terms of dying but the headache, anger and turmoil was still real.
---
Then you finally hit 60 and raids! Ohhhh boy - try to join a guild that has minimal experience and knowledge of raid dungeons in classic and you will be in for a treat, having the full experience of knowing NOTHING!
---
Sadly, Im going to miss that portion of the raid since I already know the mechanics. But since you don't - DO NOT SPOIL YOURSELF or join an experienced guild who knows what they are doing. The raids made this game and took the title of "Crack" (World of Warcrack) from the previous king Everquest (aka EverCrack)
---
Both Good points.  I dunno where I got renew from, maybe a different game.  As for abolish disease, isn't it similar to cure disease (I think) at lvl 14, where you can avoid it till after the mount?
---
play the class you can handle and dont wipe the raid. skill is the most important thing.
---
It's a somewhat unique colored shirt. Blood red that matches rogue t6 perfectly.
---
&gt; For me, personally, PVP is no fun.
---
It isn't fun dying, or, it isn't fun dying to the enemy faction?
---
You die in PvE too. Should we remove that threat as well?
---
Really nice work on your guide, i would love to take my dwarf priest trough westfall for the wand and deadmines. Where should i catch up with the guide again?
---
It's up there at the top. One of my most hyped games was Obduction by Cyan. Turned out to be alright. I'm a big Myst fan. 
---
WoW Wrath of the Lich King definitely is one of my biggest hypes. Didn't disappoint.
---
Any gamecube game. I loved that console.
---
And Skyrim of course.
---
Right now i am hyped about Hytale and WoW classic.
---
I usually don't get hyped for games. I have trouble remembering any other games i've been hyped for. I got a fairly niche taste. I mostly get excited for puzzle games, mmos, open world adventure, and creative and/or strategy games like train sim or minecraft esque games.

If he got that far with only rank 1 heroic strike he really was a champion.
---
Hi, /u/skogash
---
Again, not going to happen. Eighter you gravely underestimate how much gearing played a role in vanilla or you are judging from private serves with some shitty ass code.
---
Or you judge by retail and ignore the fact that the top end is farming mythic raid gear from m+ and are just bypassing the gear requirements.
---
You can't kill kt in only 2.5 tier gear even with world buffs and flasks (and you might have missed this, but we are not going to be able to stack the world buffs due to the server wide CD they share. Or getting a reliable amount of flasks since black lotus have a 1+ hour spawn timer) so how do you think they will day 1 it when they don't even have the gear to do it?
---
abolish is the same as cure disease but with a DOT mechanic to continue removing another one in the span of 12 seconds. Not needed b4 mount.
---
whatcha talking willis?! :p
---
I kept spamming RMB and wondering why dont you attack faster?!
---
- confused wow with diablo ;)
---
6-7 days of /played in 10 real days is pretty fucking ahead of the curve
---
yes and no. this is assuming you hit all ticks of mind flay as well. If not, even some weaker wands can out DPS it. Wand is consistent, Flay is not. 
---
The less mana I can use, the better.
---
Thats really great info.  I'll keep that in mind. That wand is rather strong for that period.
---
Exactly. They will probably test how stable Classic runs as well as testing the phasing technology to know how much they have to use it during Classic launch.
---
Too be honest, I wish they'd give us an option to actually use all the new models instead of the old ones, same with an option to use newer animation. The gameplay is *exactly* the same, but with **much** better visuals.
---
But, then the game client would be extremely big to install. You can't have two art assets from two different games in one without making it too big.
---
Sorry #NoChanges people, but I'm at least glad they're giving us an option to increase the graphics. Though, with that said, having different skyboxes can drastically change the feel of a zone, so I'm actually not sure about this one
---
If I remember my icons correctly warriors learn duel wield at level 20, is that correct?
---
‚ÄúMob should be 40% before it starts hitting you‚Äù Sure lol.
---
I personally wouldn't mind those as well as a few minor graphics updates. But the problem lies in this; When do you draw the line? A small things here, a few minor things there and then suddenly we have a very non classic experience.
---
So I think I'd rather just prefer to be part of the #NOCHANGES group. Keep it classic.
---
Haha yup!
---
If you declined my offer to find a safe place to log out, then I assume where you stand it perfectly fine. ;)
---
For the most part I would be patient about it too, unless I was worried they were gonna cause more trouble.  I once waited for someone to finish a raid boss for like 15 mins while I took other tickets so their guild wasn't screwed over by their time out.  They appreciated it and complied with no issue.
---
Very informative video, thanks for suggesting it.
---
"I don't see how players being more prepared and spending time farming consumes for raid is "private server messing it up". Care to elaborate?"
---
You mena besides you can't farm flasks reliably due to its 1+ hour spawn timer and only 1 can spawn in a zone at a time? Does not matter if you spend more time framing if the thing you farm ain't even up lol
---
Stay out of the Barrens Chat!
---
That's the only tip I could give you, but then again, it's a part of the classic experience
---
This guy dances on mailboxes
---
Yes, Classic WoW is the only game that still brings out that childlike excitement in me. I'm not really a gamer much anymore. It's only Classic WoW I really desire to play. I basically played everything I wanted and the only thing left on my list is Classic WoW.
---
My warlock in deadmines for the first time, i accidentally scrolled down on the main action bar, like how you had a page 1, 2, and 3? I thought the game was bugged and so i did nothing but walk around and loot for the rest of my run and deleted my warlock after and rerolled a mage. 
---
Causes me physical pain to think about it now.
---
I think my reddit account is less than 2 or 3 months old? I looked for the join date but didn't find it. I played classic wow I had a 60 mage and was close to max level or hit max level around the time naxx was released.
---
He's agreeing with your play style that the BFD wand can get early and will out DPS midflay till at least level  36 version of MindFlay.  Where by that time I hope you have a new wand.
---
I believe they were in Classic, but they were too rare since the rep rates of WSG and AB were so notorious, you could farm R14 like twice before getting the 3-exalt title.
---
That's not even a lot, that's rookie bending!
---
Yes, I totally agree. By race identity has turned to ashe pretty much.
---
It didn't just provide us with racial identity but was also more lore friendly. Humans on horses, Orcs on wolves, Night Elves on Sabers etc. It just fits so well with the Warcraft universe.
---
Having to be exalted to have the mount of another race was a great idea.
---
errr they should be at 60%... meaning you dealt 40% damage... Dsylexia for the fucking win
---
I created a warrior, but didn't want him to be a dumb brawn-over-brains-type of guy; so I made sure most of my gear had intellect on it :')
---
This all started with you acting like you didn't know what my comment meant because I didn't spell it the fuck out for you. People have been banned for less, that is an objective fact. People can be banned for griefing even without using racial slurs or curse words or innuendos. Why do you have to be so hostile over me stating a fact, why did you feel the need to lie and pretend I wasn't saying something with substance because I didn't spell it out for people with stage 4 autism?
---
&gt; I'm going to do some research on WoW Lore this weekend but I don't want to go to far into it if I do decide play, I'd want to experience classic as fresh as possible
---
Know that WoW lore is a follow up to Warcraft story (RTS games), if you have some time I suggest you watch [this video - warning: it's 5 hours long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIz4lgxlLHw), it contains all cutscenes and cinematics from Warcraft 3, so you'll have the background.
---
Warrior pally is very strong with blessing of sacrifice.
---
Isn't r14 was only 1 person per faction?
---
Dartol's Rod of Transformation is alliance only.
---
I think the Disgusting Oozeling is way more rare than the Hyacinth Macaw.
---
I never did anything like that, and wasn't to typical at the time really.  Most of the times we saw Leads go in game was to fix unique issues.
---
Anything like that probably happened with a Lead GM and that wouldn't be something we would have necessarily seen.  The majority of GMs like myself were battling the large influx of tickets we were getting.  There was pretty much always a player to assist somewhere in the World of Warcraft!
---
&gt; classic was just a nostalgic thing that everyone wanted to play again or if the gameplay was actually decent and FUN that people want to go back to that style
---
Gameplay is actually decent and fun, quite challenging compared to modern games but also more rewarding.
---
That's why people have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade, you don't last *that* long just our of nostalgia.
---
Yeah fo rizzle. Bandage healin is OP af.  Should get nerfed
---
I've been level 60 for 2 days /played on my current druid char, still haven't learned every spell ranks.
---
Many were!
---
The thing is realms kept coming out.  All my original GM characters had cool clothes, but the more and more realms that came out, the less motivated I was to care to put clothes on them!  
---
Only time I might dress those characters was if I needed to show myself which was rare anyways.  Only happened a couple times where I needed to do that.
---
I mean, yeah, me too.  I know opening the door to the more modern skyboxes could also let in a whole host of changes that might ruin the game.  Still, though.  A man can dream.
---
Anything female dwarf
---
ah, its 3am here...idk why I am up....
---
unfortunately my wand route so far is lesser magic wand&gt; greater magic wand&gt;spellcrafter wand&gt;Excavation wand/Consecrated Wand/Lesser Mystic Wand&gt;Greater Mystic Wand.
---
I will be keeping an eye out for wands in AH on one of my 4-5 Alts. This alt will be holding all green/blues BoE and I hope to be able to barter the seller instead of coughing up some coins.
---
you're not welcome! :)
---
you need to constantly gain xp, as much xp per minute as you can.
---
so if you're doing a quest which has easy to kill mobs and you're done, grind a dozen more. then grind mobs while traveling to the next quest....grind some more...etc.
---
also keep in mind that if you've been playing on pservers - their droprates can be too high at times which will definitely put you behind especially if you don't grind many mobs in between quests. 
---
long story short, grind every mob you see that grants you xp
---
... in heavily contested zones like Hillsbrad Foothills and Stranglethorn Vale. Other than a few contested zones, you could pretty much be solo and you wouldn't be bothered much.
---
A lot of you saying people are going to gank eachother so much, but you have to remember that most of the time, you're just two players trying to level, and will leave eachother alone.
---
It was a long time ago so I can't remember the details. It was mostly just edgy teen jokes and saying the n-word a lot. However, most of it was through whispers (to guildies and friends), some of them must've reported me :p
---
That mount on alliance side. Instant server wide recognition.
---
Warriors if you know you will not be playing solo at all. 
---
Warlocks if you will be playing solo some of the time. 
---
Warlocks are god's of 1v1 while Warriors clap fools with a healer.
---
considering 90% of the classicwow community likely played on a private server at some point and at least 60% actively are playing on one right now, that is the most ridiculous rule ever... ESPECIALLY since this ISN'T an official blizzard subreddit.
---
quick note on darkshore - it tends to be less populated compared to westfall as well. don't skip out on darkshore on classic, it'll make for a much faster and smoother run.
---
You're but, that's not just firing up WireShark, but thanks for your answer.
---
The Halo 2 hype was insanity. Not sure if anything else has ever topped that.
---
This makes me wonder who blizzard will give bets keys to? Most of the classic content creators play on private servers and blizzard nuked thier relationship with Preach Gaming for using a potion bug to level faster (the guy that really called them out in bfa beta) so they can't really give them keys can they?
---
I don't think the game looking pretty takes away from the game play, exploration, community etc that makes vanilla wow.
---
it's called a beta, not a fucking demo
---
My first raid ever in Molten Core. New guild, new people, me being young = a lot of stress. I was playing a holy paladin. We were wiping on Baron Geddon and I got DI from another pally. So I'm standing there, waiting for the boss to reset and some people decided to run all the way back to the entrance for no particular reason but the boss obviously followed them. Since I didn't know the layout of the instance that well I thought that the boss has reset and went back to his usual position (those were the times when we pulled Geddon to Garr room). Well, he didn't reset but was still chasing those who were running and he came right back to kill me. We've had to call the raid off at that point cause it was getting late and trash has respawned. Felt pretty bad.
---
I expect it would be baller in the Plaguelands
---
It won't matter. People played vanilla with dial up.
---
If a player made it to GM island without using any hacks or cheats, is that a bannable offense?
---
No, it was added in Wrath.
---
Some of us don't live in Europe or America buddy. If you live in the southern hemisphere (say south Africa like me) you will have minimum 180ish ping due to server travel time.
---
what the fuck
---
https://youtu.be/J9YtXQd0Hio
---
Here‚Äôs a neat little slideshow vid of my progression across two servers. Dips into the level of progression a character experiences.
---
The last of us part 2 is a big hype for me
---
Actually there is hoping. 
---
1.4 unarmoured mounts were in the game, only not acquirable anymore.
---
So I really hope they implement it for some time along the lines that they do not implement 1.10. introduced items such as Executioners Helm or Spellweaver's Turban.
---
Yeah, new animations would be great
---
Ok this is epic. üòé
---
Yeah idk if it was working right on the most recent pservers, but it felt almost overpowered.
---
Some shirts for you :)
---
1. Captain Sander's Shirt

This quest is available to Horde players also.
---
2. Fine Cloth Shirt
---
Unfortunately, only for Alliance players
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=859/fine-cloth-shirt

https://classicdb.ch/?quest=258
---
3. Master Builder's Shirt
---
It drops from Fineous Darkvire in BRD

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11840/master-builders-shirt
---
4. Stylish Black Shirt
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3427/stylish-black-shirt

Can be sold by a clothier vendor in Stormgrad. I made some money back then selling it on a neutral AH.
---
5. Deckhand's Shirt
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5107/deckhands-shirt
---
A common drop from pirates in the Barrens. Can be sold on AH, it looks good on male characters (except undead :) ), so usually is in demand.
---
6. Sleevless T-Shirt
---
Can be looted from mobs (or maybe players?) in AV. I don't remember exactly where I got mine.

7. Formal Dangui
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13895/formal-dangui
---
Can be sold by a vendor in Moonglade, but it's extremely rare.
---
Playing to level 10 on my first rogue and only then realizing that using a bow is extremely inefficient. I remember reading the class descriptions online and I read that rogues could go into stealth and that bows are one of the weapons they can use. Oops
---
I‚Äôm not even drunk this time just retarded, carry on..
---
I remember doing this at 60 when I was broke lol  
---
It was \~20g per run, IIRC
---
p o g
---
Back when hybrid were hybrids. I rerolled Horde midway through Vanilla, and she was lost to time. 
---
Some goodies in her gear include Dartol's Rod of Transformation, the Songbird Blouse I spent *months* farming (now reduced to garbage), Green Whelp Armor to troll gankers, a Carrot on a Stick, the Band of the Great Tortoise (which now gives versatility instead of armor, because fuck you), and Finkle's Skinner.
---
Of all the class changes over the years, the treatment of druids has cut the most deep. I shelved them entirely somewhere between Cata and MoP, and can't wait for Classic to get that root-rotting, power shifting, "jack of all trades master of none" madness back.
---
(Hard Love Cowboys - Kel'Thuzad, if any of you fuckers are still alive!)
---
It was always really cool to see someone who worked to get a mount from another race. I really felt like, "Man that guy put in the work to be recognized by the Tauren," etc. The black PvP mounts were also amazing.
---
vsync + locked 144 fps + 144 hz = silky smooth
---
Blessing of Wisdom lol
---
Can you actually explain why beta is worth getting excited for...? If you wanna roll a character that's irrelevamt when classic comes out, you can do that right now.
---
I'm glad people finally see it this way.  
---
Last year people were all over the forums raging about how sharding at lvl 1-10 would ruin Wow classic &lt;\_&lt;
---
Yep. In vanilla there were two troll NPCs in Un'Goro, it was speculated they were added for the same purpose. During TBC Blizzard removed the female, and the male started give the mount quest only in WotLK.
---
Nobody really retained the title more then a week. You could have 2 or more rank 14s in the same week though, especially after that update to honor system.
---
I was kiting general drakkisath and key board turned off the bridge...
---
Awesome! Thank you for sharing!!  
---
Why the elementals, out of curiosity? I understand the felcloth on the satyrs, but do the elementals have good drops as well?
---
Honestly, I don't want a vanilla-like launch. Long queues, minute-long lag spikes, competing to tag mobs...  
---
For god sake give me sharding until I can run instances lol
---
Hey guys! Nice to see you there, I bought your 1-19 guide and it's been pretty good, easy to navigate and work with. Thank you for the effort :)
---
My question is - what would you suggest for 20-30 range? I'm not asking for specifics, just a general zone layout. I'm pretty sure Redridge at 20 would be great, but what after? Duskwood and then Wetlands?
---
Also, are you planning to release more portions od the guide early? Like 20-30 or even to 40. I think you said you'd release the guide before classic launch, but I'd love to get it practiced in advance, and I'm not sure if I can get familiar enough with it in time for the launch.
---
Thank you! And I will be rooting for you when the ultimate race begins :)
---
&gt;You die in PvE too. Should we remove that threat as well?
---
This change is already live.
---
I guess they were spoiled by numerous "betas" and "open betas", they are equal to early access nowadays.
---
Yeah I know, you hit r14 and buy everything and then you're set.
---
Hmm, unsure what counts as vanity items.
---
- Piccolo of the Flaming Fire (Trinket from Strath UD, makes everyone around you dance)
---
- Bloodsail Admiral's Hat (Avast Ye Admiral, also has a pet built into it)
---
- That trinket from the STV fishing contest that turned you into a fish, although that was actually also kinda useful since it gave you water breathing and lots of swim speed
---
- All those equippable fish, flowers, etc. ("15 Pound Rockscale Cod" and such)
---
- Vanity clothing and rings, like the tux and those rings sold by that one vendor in Booty Bay (The Rock, I think one was called)
---
The nostalgia will all go away by the time they reach naxx so that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
---
It is actually the games best interest to build upon the foundations of classic to keep it relevant.
---
No matter how many delusional dumbasses will repeat the same phrase ‚Äúno changes‚Äù the game will die.
---
Blizzard needs to add an incentive to keep subs because otherwise, why pay for a monthly fee when you can just have the same game on a private server.
---
too bad its not realistically farmable :(
---
(in UNBELIEVABLY rare)
---
Why tailoring?? Why not alchemy and engineering?
---
For sure. Even the first few weeks for anyone 1-10 would be fine. There will be a huge wave of casual players that take a couple weeks to get to lvl 10.  
---
I say let them have fun.
---
thank you very much!
---
We were struggling on our first Parchwerk kill, he enrages at about 2%, one shots all the tanks and everything goes to chaos. There's hunters trying to kite him, rogues popping evasion, bubbles going out in a panic, holy priests throwing smites. He gets to 1% but we seem to have failed, except we see one person still alive, a paladin, a new recruit at that, who has just popped his bubble, and is charging up hammers of wrath. Half of the guild is deathly silent, the other half is chanting 'go go go go GO', the paladin throws one hammer, two hammers, three hammers, and the multi million hp beast goes down, felled by the dps healbot. 
---
I've never heard a noise similar to the joint, ear-bursting orgasm of 40 people screaming unintelligible joy into vent that followed. Really one of my fondest memories of all gaming.
---
Sleepless Knights, Bronzebeard, US. Hope you guys are doing well.
---
Why wouldn't you include spells that you get for free, add them with 0 cost line under their icon, or no line at all. whats bad it'll do?
---
I think people want to see ALL skills and ranks. 
---
And first and foremost they'll use this picture to see at what level they get what ability. am i wrong?
---
Keyboard turning as a caster, pvp was a nightmare.
---
BC was a much more well-rounded game, and was kind of a middle ground between what we love about classic and what a lot of people hate about retail. It had flying and the beginnings of group finder etc, but the raids and PvP were great, class balance was reasonably well tuned across the board, and honestly 25 man raids are way better than 40 just because it's so hard to get 40 people together.
---
Thankyou for the posting! Really great, shared it to our druid channel in our guilds discord :) my brother will be happy since he is rolling a resto druid. I think I may have been underestimating the class
---
Agreed. We'll have enough time for that. Classic ain't going *anywhere* for a long time. Might as well be patient.
---
well the classic demo didnt let you keep anything. And there has been some betas that let you keep stuff.
---
I recall farming these (on a druid coincidentally) back in vanilla. They at least dropped some essence that was needed for some enchantmnents and other professions and sold for a solid amount.
---
Am I allowed to import WoD character models?
---
No engineering skill required but very prone to getting destroyed.
---

---
lol this guy, I saw what you did there.
---
Lovin' it on a Tauren.
---
Ah, thanks, didn't know :)
---
classic problems requires classic solutions
---
Yea I know, I also forgot /s :D people on classicwow subreddit just tend to be very downvotey (if thats a word)
---
Gross
---
Doesn't tell you much to be honest. Early on there was no incentive to subscribe as there was no weekly updates. All this does is tell you people who were coming here decided to subscribe to get notified of blue posts really.
---
Hope it's okay to ask a second question as well :D - What is the optimal "biologic" plan for the launch if you want to push really hard? I heard 30+ hours for first session is good. How much would you sleep? Are there any special tricks you do to keep your focus up and not fall asleep? Does coffee/energy drinks help or are they bad in the long run? Do you have food precooked? I have never personally pushed this hard but am planning to for launch, so I'm curious how are you coping with all the tiredness and staying alert.
---
me 1000%
---
We'll have over 100k before launch, easily. Maybe like 130-150k?
---
I don‚Äôt know about my first run, but I remember everyone saying there was a secret boss that might spawn if we opened all the graves in the room with the boss before the stairs event. Never found that boss though
---
My favourite classic wow video. I've probably contributed to half of its views on YouTube üòù
---
https://youtu.be/GZNKugMdPFI
---
As a Warcraft nerd, WoW was the game of my dreams (I loved the founding of Durotar campaign). I couldn't afford it at launch and my parents would never pay for my subscription, and I didn't get any allowance or anything until I was 16 (2006). Once I got it I was mesmerized by the game and would constantly be in awe each time I found a zone or landmarks represented in the other games. WoW classic is up there with this hype.
---
is it only suppose to be the guide for ppl that relevel class they already leveled? 
---
no new players? or people that level the class for the first time? 
---
who would it hurt if there were free spell but with 0 cost or no cost line at all?
---
also you don't remeber all the skill at what level, you'll know some iconic abilities but not all. at least i don't even for classes i have leveled.
---
tell me at what level you get cure poisons as druid, stoneskin totem as shaman etc.
---
Modern warfare 2. Spent so many hours playing cod4 Got me so hyped for MW2 stood outside in the cold winter to get my midnight copy
---
There is a block user option for a reason... derp
---
I'm not interested in getting the absolute fastest time to 60, but more considering also grinding up professions at the same time. I'm talking about aoe grinding as a paladin with reckoning /sit trick, and doing it in areas with a lot of mining nodes for mining blacksmithing. Would this be viable or is it just better to speedlevel and then come back and do the professions after?
---
Exploring as far north as me and two other Ally lowbies could from Ironforge because we had straight up NO IDEA what was even beyond Arathi. We ganked as many Horde as we could, every now and then, a ?? Player would appear and we‚Äôd all fun for our lives. Made it to like UC and got annihilated lmao...
---
Also, attacking Crossroads rolling like 40 deep was always fun.
---
Easily the funnest exploration experiences of any video game I‚Äôve ever played.
---
For me the grief is still too near.
---
thats not all skills. its only skills that you buy.
---
What is a skybox?
---
I discovered talent tree around level 30. Also i walked with my warlock up to level 50.
---
No stun hack? That is just the orc racial bonus.
---
This is what we were all fearing. Let's hope we can change their minds and get proper progressive itemization.
---
How were your 15 minutes of fame?
---
"all", speak for yourself
---
PLAGUUUUU
---
Cool
---
Yeah, I love Vanilla, but there's no denying that most "skill" is really patience in disguise xD
---
This was always clear. They only have 1.12 data. They said it explicitly. Everything will be 1.12. What they do is hold back some things (instances, items) but when those are introduced, they will be 1.12.
---
Technically yes, but it wasn't something we were trying to do.  In general the GM staff understood the players desire to see what they could explore and so long as it wasn't game breaking, you probably would get off with a warning and asked to not do it again.
---
Yeah mate and 1000g for participating
---
Can‚Äôt believe this was a year and a half ago.
---
They‚Äôre asking for feedback, wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say the fear has been realised. They‚Äôre going to miss things, that bug report will just have see some serious action
---
Unpopulat opinion : Progressive itemization is totally stupid. Like how do you expect your regular joe bloke to read up on items on the websites and know what item will change to what. And that shit item hes got now will become op or vice versa.....
---
I can't help but wonder why you include the mount at level 40, but not the epic mount at level 60.
---
thats gonna be me pretty much
---
Anyone who's played on both nost and other servers knows that proper progressive itemization is objectively superior. We've had thousands of players "beta" test this for them we know how 1.12 items play out and all their downsides.
---
Oh no, does this mean I have to work at Starbucks again? :(((((((((((((
---
I See asmongold i puke and run! One of my biggest issues in retail! Unacceptable guy...
---
Pretty sure Mojo was from ZA in BC.
---
There's no objectivity about it. This sort of stuff is all down to opinion on what someone prefers.
---
No it is objective. Unless you prefer easy content and trivial gearing path? Go play retail if that's what you want.
---
Troll master race. If I could play a troll druid, would main the hell out of it
---
I guess that would be the most practical way to do it,but you know immersion.
---
I came directly from EQ without ever investigating the WoW mechanics. My first toon was a human mage. I remember farming all day and night, killing mobs and meditating slowly to regain mana. At some point around level 16 in Westfall I realized my food and drink wasn‚Äôt running out. 
---
I asked a random player of food consumption was bugged, when they said no you have to click it for regen. Turns out I was leveling without using food or drink to speed up regen and instead using the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù regen.
---
TL;DR they stole a lot of concepts from PoE and still can't compete even remotely with the GGG dev team
---
Easy content? When was vanilla ever difficult?
---
&gt; Swift Zulian Tiger (ZG Mount)
---
Give it to me baby
---
Even more so when you notice that the "60" list for warlocks is two columns wide.
---
100% agree. All progressive itemisation does is reward people who have knowledge from outside the game. Everything in the game should be able to be figured out by playing the game itself. Progressive itemisation goes against that completely.
---
Being vindictive and being vindicated are very different things, even though they sound similar.
---
I also spot the twig of the world tree! Back in the days, where there were real hybrids.
---
Yea its definitely a game you have to get into. The first few levels can be boring but once you begin to recieve quest items, drive into your talent tree, and clear your first dungeon you really see what the game is all about. I promise you if you manage to get past 20 you'll be absolutely hooked... its bitter sweet really. Lol
---
The 1.12 client data has been available since 1.12 dropped in 2006. The Classic beta client will not include anything more. (Well, based on everything we know, nothing is 100% in life.)
---
The unknowns were always the server side things which will remain hard to get. I'm sure people will try and sniff them out after Classic actually releases but you can't just "datamine" them from the beta client.
---
This and warcraft 3 reforged and making me lose my mind, can't wait for either to come out!
---
"Time to level: 7.7 hours"  
---
Oh yeah... fuck.
---
I feel out of the loop, never playing Classic... Is fishing actually useful here?
---
I am really hyped about Classic but there is one thing that doesn't make it the most hyped.. and that is knowledge. Sure I am super happy to go back but game can't really surprise me. We know every single little detail about Vanilla so there is no adventure, exploring and seeing new amazing things. The main reason I really look forward to get into game is because I was quite kid back then and I want to actually get into things that I missed back in Vanilla.
---
Look at... all that, progression. Oh god.
---
No. 
---
When Naxx comes I want fresh vanilla servers 6 to 12 months later. Or stand alone TBC servers. 
---
I‚Äôve learned the active private server player base enjoys fresh starts. ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù is a meme in the community for a reason. These private server players have been the most vocal in supporting official classic servers so it‚Äôs in Blizzard‚Äôs best interest to actually cater to the players responsible for kicking up this fuss, and not all these people( read; you) coming in asking for things that aren‚Äôt as close to a 1:1 vanilla experience.
---
Cool, so you would obviously want the 1.0 talent trees as well right, because the updated talent trees do far more to trivialise content than itemisation does. 
---
Funny how the progressive itemisation crowd never talks about progressive talents isn't it.
---
&gt; Thanks man! 
---
It's a she. She was a guest on countdown classic podcast.
---
I was curious because of this video posted back in 2007. She actually found a GM standing on the island. I found it quite interesting üòÅ

Thanks for the reply and thank you for all the hard work you put in. Cheers!
---
How did you get in beta ?
---
Awesome, thanks :)
---
No. Still good.
---
Exactly, that's how it's supposed to work. Respec was only there to use very infrequently when you wanted to change your char "permanently".
---
Either pick a spec and live with it or level multiple chars. Or farm enough gold to respec but either way it's time time consuming and fully intended.
---
I played with Retrodruid on Tichondrius, and all I can say is... what a legend.
---
Vanilla+ content would be awesome but I think it shouldn't be stuff that can be done by anyone for easy benefit, maybe behind a certain content clearing wall so it doesn't affect regular vanilla raid progression and purists don't have to have their nostalgia tainted - I'm sure an argument would be made against it but if it doesn't impact the original vanilla content and adds some new stuff for after say a full Naxx clear, would be cool. Obviously they can't introduce things that would alter class talents or base spells unless it's keyed into a tier set or something. 
---
OldGame+ content worked really well for OSRS. 
---
Personally I would like to see BC servers come out too; until it's thoroughly evident that Classic is a worthwhile money maker, I don't see Blizzard spending the resources to commit to something like BC or even Classic+ content.
---
First time Deadmines
---
Alright let me create a more specific scenario.
---
On nost I played a warlock. There was a belt in scholamance that the devs forgot to downgrade when they did their progressive itemization pass. It drops off the bat miniboss. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13956
---
As you can see with 1.12 stats this item has 1% hit rating. For a warlock this is your best stat especially earlygame pre ZG and this belt becomes bis until you can get your hands on veryrare low droprate MC epics like mana igniting chord.
---
Blizzard is delaying the release of diremaul so players have a new dungeon with gear upgrades to run but if they launch with 1.12 itemizationthere wont be any belt upgrades inside diremaul for my warlock.
---
This effectively kills content for players before they ever step foot in the dungeon.
---
Do you really want less content and less cool rewards to seek out?
---
Its a slippery slope. First your asking about them sky boxes and getting your wishes granted.
---
Next you‚Äôre on all four getting trounced by Blizzard. Be careful what you wish for.
---
Probably depends on class.  
---
As a paladin, Judgement was better than anything PvP related.
---
Can world records only be set on brand new servers?
---
If we get a June release, I will shit myself. Literally.
---
Look we have this kind of thread twice a day.
---
We don't even have a release date, not even a beta date.
---
Yes it's too early to talk about what we will do after Naxx.
---
Back in Vanilla Naxx came about 2 years after release, so we still have a lot of time before thinking "what's next".
---
It will depend of the success of classic. What people want now and what they will want in 2 years is probably very different.
---
But afterwards would i go directly to ashenvale right? I guess I cant continue in darkshore?
---
As subs go up, the quality of a subreddit go down.
---
Until you are at 0 hp, you haven't lost.
---
Through communication with other peoplewho know what's up? But also system for sold/deleted item restoration that retail has would help.
---
Did working as GM help you with raiding? Did you get some kind of inside info about things like armor values or timers or something that helped you with raids?
---
I don't remember, we'll have to test that (and wipe maybe :D ) once in ZF, it shouldn't be long now.
---
I leveled my dwarf Hunter to 10 before shooting my gun. I didn't know you started with ammo...
---
People are going to be so surprised when they find out how hard it is to get a 40 person raid going.
---
Im not a speedrunner btw
---
Betas are for testing, feedback, and reporting both of those to Blizzard so the launch doesn‚Äôt go horribly.
---
There is no chance they would bring 1.0 talents because they were tweaked very often throughout vanilla lifespan, itemization wasn't. But yeah, hqving true 1.0-1.12 progression, even with broken classes, would be fun as hell.
---
Classic is not a remaster. It's a recreation. It'll be completely Vanilla (with some freebies from the modern engine: optional improved shadows, water, larger model and ground clutter distance).
---
See this if you are interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
One way to set a target would be look up the Joana times for each milestone and add 20% or whatever.
---
Trying to kill a level 12 kodo while I was only level 5. I gave it ~4 tries before I deemed the game too hard and quit. I really wanted to make it happen because I thought it would drop meat that I could sell for a ton of money.
---
I think I was 10 at the time
---
I would gladly pay a monthly fee just to be sure the servers doesn't disappear out of the blue one day. If I want to take a break for a year, I can just cancel the sub and know my chars will still be there when i resub.
---
This isnt beta its an offline Ps with classic client ?
---
Yeah lets make a bunch of systems just so a few autists can pretend to be good at the game by stocking up on items that will be good later.
---
Good luck with that endeavor.
---
The good thing being horde (apart from WF totems :D) is that the Baron's mount doesn't bring anything we can get to the vendor. But the ZG tiger on the other hand &lt;3
---
where others see problems i see opportunity
---
Sweet thanks man
---
The hyena packs in Desolace that have lower HP but give same amount of XP as regular mobs, is that blizzlike?  If yes, wouldn't grinding on them, assuming no competition, be better than questing?
---
I don‚Äôt really like it because there are going to be very powerful weapons equivalent to endgame items from the beginning, items that won‚Äôt be changed out until AQ or after, if they‚Äôre going with staged releases of content why not do it with the items aswell, or else what‚Äôs the point in staged release at all, May aswell just launch the game with Naxx already there
---
Could you please post a few pictures from it? I kinda want to buy a copy.
---
They‚Äôll re-release all expansions while maintaining classic difficulty and play style. E.g not implementing dungeon finder/teleport, no more races or classes, keep the talent trees etc.
---
Are you really really sure your wife is really a woman ?
---
Because back then we all knew there wasn't any girl on the internet, specially not in Wow and absolutely not in the Horde :D
---
Illegal danish.
---
This.
---
You still can't get it that old itemization is to make MC/Ony and BWL progression at least a bit harder by making you being able to loot the gear that Blizzard designed to drop around these days, not for AQ/Naxx progression?
---
TBC then Wotlk
---
Just got my beta invite       and I wrote it.
---
Aoe loot
---
24/0/27 ..... is that rly resto ? seems like a hybrid spec to me :-)
---
I've played on Nost and some others. I always dislike progressive itemization so it's more subjective than objective.
---
I agree this is a good argument against item progression. However there are also good arguments for it, such as rather significant differences in the power of the items.
---
Darkshore is great for sure but people shouldn‚Äôt overlook the potential speed of a Loch Modan/westfall route. 
---
I speed level dwarf and go from Loch to Westfall for 13-16 and its not bad at all. 
---
Dwarf Hunter - Loch/Westfall - 1-20 7:45
---
You can then go to Darkshore and smash out the quests there and do the initial Ashenvale quests.
---
Both can be great
---
Don‚Äôt know why you are being downvoted. They literally told us exactly what they would be doing in a blue post like 3 weeks ago.
---
I am going for ench/skin (disench plus selling furs). Later minning/engi (on 60 maybe). What u guys think?
---
Heya Nordinus, glad you‚Äôre getting some value out of the guide :)
---
Did you pick up the maps update - just came out. 
---
Do Darkshore to 20 then head to Loch Modan, IF and Redridge. Then go to Ashenvale, get FPS at Stonetalon and back to Ashenvale, Wetlands and then do Duskwood to 30 üëç
---
Dude they literally told us 3 weeks ago this is how they were doing it...this community can be so dumb.
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
exact opposite for me, feels like not even the last blizzcon
---
I don't have time to dig through blue posts and I did a google search before asking those questions and I didn't find any reliable official information but partial ones.
---
That's why I created this topic and asked questions.
---
I couldn't care less about downvotes, but you and the rest of the community do look like toxic and unfriendly.
---
Feels like posting questions on a crypto subreddit and not one of a videogame.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I ran ZF dozens of times since i tried to twink for Pvp. I was one of those guys who used to sit and max honor at each bracket rank 6 at 30-39 rank 8 at 40-49. 
---
I pretty much only leveled through ZF on 2 characters and i don't remember even clicking those tombs, the only thing i slightly remember was to not stand on them.
---
And yes it was spawn a easily handleable amount of adds, but on every private server I've been on, you will just get ass fucked by every tomb instantly.
---
Essence of Earth and Elemental Earth dropped from the Desert Rumblers. The essence was for enchanting and the elemental earth was for alchemy, especially during AQ progression, as it was used for the Nature resistance potion.
---
No one is expected to optimize themselves in classic, regular Joe Blokes can play casually perfectly fine and have fun without researching what items will change stats.
---
&gt;hey‚Äôre going with staged releases of content why not do it with the items aswell, or else what‚Äôs the point in staged release at all, May aswell just launch the game with Naxx already there
---
Do you really need the autism hammer to make a point?
---
I did and there are no answers to my questions.
---
I remember being pretty amazed with tanks having such perfect threat management that they could "over aggro" eachother at the exact perfect time that the other tank had to tank the boss. I told my friend that our tanks were pretty good at it and he was like:
---
"Dude warriors have taunt, that makes the boss attack that warrior?"
---
And I just remember thinking "Ohh that makes sense"
---
I would get vids of hectic nef and ouro from aq kills. As well as huge pvp videos with over 100 combatants. The Classic 30 second gameplay loop is pretty terrible by today's standards and unless you play wow pvp vids are really boring but the massive scope of vanilla is what made it special so try to push that.
---
You've just described why it's not objective. Some people prefer a different path. Cheers for proving yourself wrong!
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it but likely affected by lack of mob resistances - but holy is always amazing in plaguelands!
---
well you look at the back side of your character about 90% of the time this is the main reason i play female characters in most mmo's
---
or would you rather look at a guys ass for a few thousand hours
---
By signing up for beta from your account page
---
Pretty much my very first memory of wow was me not knowing how to cast spells, i played a druid to level 7 by just autoattacking everything.
---
I plan on making a mage and aoe farming my way, alliance.
---
How saturated will I find aoe farming? Do you think its a feasible plan?
---
This seems really arbitrary. The whole point of the non-emulating rule is to prevent people from cutting into Blizzard's subscriber base by offering a game that uses their assets.
---
Emulating a beta client that no one can even connect to or actually play anything on doesn't do that. If anything, it's promotion for an official Blizzard service that will make them money.
---
Everyone insist that the content is so easy anyway, what's the point of complicating the dungeon content? Which, for the vast majority of players who won't ever raid is the end game content.
---
I also don't think that it is fair to say that the items were changed because of new raid releases. They were changed because some of them sucked worse than intended, they were changed because some had mistakes, they were changed because dungeons didn't feel rewarding enough. They were changed because of what Blizzard learned about the game after release.
---
The exception to this is of course the phase 6 catch-up loot and stuff like T0.5. Which is why that content is time-gated.
---
What? Proof?
---
No it wasn‚Äòt. Just the PvP titles were included in Vanilla.
---
Absolutely on point. Don't know why you get downvoted so much - the crowd in this sub has changed in a strange way.
---
storywise the best imo, gameplaywise it's the point of no return to the retail we have now
---
Regular Joe Bloke will know though that some horrible items will be changed to be good though. It's very against the spirit of classic to have players feel they need to second-guess or research every loot decision.
---
Just because Joe Bloke doesn't look up every item and has excel sheets on the ready it doesn't mean Joe Bloke won't be rightly bothered by this.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the point I was making. It‚Äôs a beta aimed at finding bugs so that they won‚Äôt be there on release. Not a demo made so you can mess around just for the sake of it.
---
It all depends on your starting zone and class.
---
I can make a bit more than 2 hours to ding 10 with a troll hunter, but with a tauren druid it was something like 3 hours.
---
Now this is with optimal conditions, but on release there will be hundreds (or thousand without sharding) players competing for the same mobs than you.
---
What is this sort of reverse elitism? Mocking players for trying to optimize their gear? This sub is deteriorating by the day.
---
How did you even arrive to this comment. You must have A) Not read anything on this subreddit for the past 24-48 hours, and B) Somehow saw what the video was without actually listening to anything.
---
they keep adding more and more to it, but with every thing they add it feels like the release is more distant than before
---
No it wont...if you use updated graphics it will look tons better.
---
Why should I play mage in classic? Sell it to me because i'm on the fence.
---
Did you build BlizzGet.exe from source or just download the binary?
---
He's right tho. It's the beta client with a private server. There is no official beta servers yet.
---
No reason to be a jerk.
---
But the majority of players weren't even 60 when dire maul was released in vanilla. You're arguing for an experience that only existed on private servers.
---
There are already surveys if this. Why didn‚Äôt you search the forums before creating another one ?
---
The big thing people push for is to not add the catch up items, not update every item as the patches go.
---
If the catch up items like Diana's Pearl Necklace are in game then you have dungeon items which ate better than raid items on launch.
---
Portals, food and drinks, remove curse (idk if this is a selling point), awesome AOE grind, really good DPS throughout vanilla, I don't think you have to switch the talents so often etc.
---
I‚Äôll preface this with a health warning: long sessions sitting and lack of sleep can kill you. We‚Äôre all mostly a bit older now (well I am) so health is important. 
---
I‚Äôm gunning for a record first so first session for me is 36-40 hours then days split 6 hours sleep and the rest levelling, until 60. 
---
For most, 24 hours will give a great head start. 
---
Keeping awake is not a problem. I‚Äôm very competitive so the buzz keeps me going. I actually have more trouble getting sleep. 
---
No energy drinks and light on the coffee - mostly water, very light on sugar as it can make you crash. 
---
Same with food - light meals, premade salads, low on heavy starches and carbs. Think vegies, grilled chicken, nuts, tuna. Big heavy meals make you feel tired. 
---
I practise a lot and have runs memorised so I often put on some music, an audiobook or podcast but for actual launch game only. 
---
I also have routines to get up and stretch, hand exercises, blood pressure monitor etc.
---
That game had the potential to be one of the best mmos ever. Player driven economy was by far one of its heights. Shame that the endgame was meh...
---
I guess you can add picolo of the flaming fire to vanity items. Not a cosmetic but the effet is definitely fun !
---
Naxx will be cleared the day it‚Äôs released on lost servers by at least one guild and within the week by many more.
---
Pro: Kinda everything about it - DPS, utility (portals/food), good leveling, good farming, good PvP, a lot needed in raids.
---
Cons: There will be plenty so you'll have plenty of competition for gear and raid spots.
---
If you want to be a pure DPS'er and have a love for magical classes/characters Mage is the choice. If it doesn't suit you at 60, at least you have a good farming character then :D
---
For me it was OSRS (Old School Runescape) now it's Classic wow so yeah I'm pretty excited for these games
---
I had a hell of a lot of great classic moments, getting our first C'thun kill, first boss kills in naxx, just going through MC, bwl, AQ40, naxx and so on. Getting Thunderfurry Hitting rank 12 pvp and all that.
---
But honestly my very best moment and the one I remember as the first thing every time I think about Classic. Is me and 2 friends having a LAN party in my room at my parents' house, starting our very first characters, all 3 trolls 2 hunters and a priest. The best moment were getting to that 2nd village with the islands, going out on those island to kill trolls, tigers, crabs and that "boss" where you have to get his head. All 3 of us were just absolutly amazed at how awesome that place was and the funny thing is that looking back at it, it was a very very standard place, but man the feeling we had was just absolutly epic and we had no idea we were gonna spend countless hours playing that game and the expansions to come.
---
And no I did not get Thunderfurry as a hunter, we all rerolled later on because we had to have the same experience with Undeads now playing Rogue(me), Priest and Warlock. What a fucking epic time that game was.
---
Cool video, but mostly the same stuff as the demo.
---
I tried that but couldn't find a list of his /playtime by level. Is there a way of finding it that I've missed?
---
The /sit is not likely to work on Classic. 
---
Personally I think there‚Äôs nothing better than levelling professions when you have a mount. If you‚Äôre PVE that would be 40 and PVP I‚Äôd probably go 60 so you can level professions unimpeded.
---
It's the modern casual wow players. that used to be apart of the wall of no shit.
---
What I actually wanted to say was: it's really awesome that it's getting so much attention, I'm really hopefull this will affect Blizz more then just as a nice thing they do for the fans.  
---
I just hope this will return some significant and perspective changing funds back to Blizzard.
---
Yes you‚Äôve outlevelled Darkshore at that point
---
You can still frustrate the hell out of people with dots and fear, and if you team up with a couple mates you will be a wrecking ball against other pugs in bgs!
---
Started vanilla on a pve server. If I could take it back and play on a PvP server I would.
---
Progressive itemisation just balances items according to the current bosses available, just like it was in Vanilla. The people who played during vanilla didn't have much of any forewarning either.
---
Can we find your guide somewhere?
---
I'd definitely see Remove Curse as a selling point! Mages have so much utility, it's insane. I imagine the game designers in 2005 going like "Okay team, we've got food, drinks, portals, and overall good class design for the mage. Anything else we've missed?"  
---
***"ayy lets give them a curse dispel also lol"***  
---
TL;DR: Mages are great
---
I had over 100 days played on my ally warlock in vanilla. I PvP‚Äôd and raided with my warlock and had a lot of success doing both. I got to rank 7 pvp with my lock, would have been higher but I rolled a rogue and farmed to rank 12. I raided up to 4 horsemen in naxx. 40 man naxx we used very few warlocks (3 iirc due to needing max dps) so it was kind of a best of the best at theat point, but any raid before that warlocks were well represented. 
---
I really loved playing my warlock and wish I never sold that account, really fun class!
---
f joe bloke, probably a horde player too lol
---
Lol that‚Äôs actually hilarious
---
Should we really be catering this playerbase though? Or play the game in its original form where the items were progressive?
---
Buffs and nerfs to items have always been a part of WoW and it still is in retail.
---
World firsts and server firsts for sure, but server records and world record times are going to be broken for years to come üëç
---
The speed running community are still starting to look at what a legit solo record will look like, and Joana has proposed a leaderboard for the world and server firsts.
---
!remindme 7 days
---
My best and most memorable moment was when I obtained my epic dreadstead mount on my warlock. Back then the questline along with the items you had to gather finished by a epic boss fight was absolutely brutal. My second would have to be when I obtained my nether drake after doing that insane rep grind.
---
&gt;Everyone insist that the content is so easy anyway, what's the point of complicating the dungeon content?
---
Because it's more fun, obviously.
---
Yeah, some items were changed because they were not that good, but still, raids were designed and released with these specific items being in the loot tables.
---
Playing a tauren warrior to 18-19-20... going on AH dreaming about the level 60 gear... proceeding to buy 'cool' looking gear. GG cloth warrior with int and spirit until a friend said we are doing it wrong

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
Right, because non-progressive itemisation has only happened on private servers so that's the only thing you CAN compare it to.
---
I respect your opinion but the result of this is that we‚Äôll have PvP gear on launch that‚Äôs almost on par with Naxx gear. That can‚Äôt be what we want.
---
I asked someone about this recently, will check my notes and get back to you!
---
I was a "jerk" because his comment was ridiculous. Maybe that's what he meant, but it sounded to me that he was trying to say that these screenshots are from a classic private server, not the beta client. Which is ridiculous.
---
No, it was not. We're in a bubble.
---
Even a game as GTA-5 was way more anticipated than Classic as it had millions and millions of fans more.
---
Omg I forgot about the ZG tiger
---
I'm curious about interactions with Blink, for potential platforming benefits. I always loved exploring those pseudo-Out-of-Bounds areas in BC, so platforming utility is actually relevant to me.
---
\- Could you Blink over gaps like the Ironforge "moat"? Or would it cut the Blink short, or snap you down to the bottom, or whatever?
---
\- What about Jump + Blink? Could this be used in conjunction with speed boosts and such to clear really large gaps, like the broken bridge in the Thandol Span?
---
\- Could you potentially demount midjump, then Blink while in midair? This seems like it would also benefit this greatly.
---
I‚Äôm subbed to dozens of subs. There‚Äôs no space for that on my bookmarks bar, and I don‚Äôt get to use any of Reddit‚Äôs subscriber-focused features. Your method is highly idiosyncratic and doesn‚Äôt seem any better than just subbing.
---
You got the dartols rod.. nice...
---
I have that on an unused alt on a forgotten realm.
---
I leveled a Human mage to 60 and collected 5/8 Magister's Regalia (I desperately wanted the whole set, knowing nothing about min/maxing at the time) before deciding I wanted to try horde instead. Since I was so attached to my server's community I deleted my mage and re-rolled as a Tauren Shaman on horde. 
---
Easily the dumbest thing I've done in WoW, although I guess it speaks to how easy it is to get attached to a server community in Vanilla Wow, unlike today.
---
[Here](https://soundcloud.com/user-19077365/the-truth)
---
Yeah, coming from RuneScape to WoW I was shit scared of dying in PvP so I didn't do it for the longest time.
---
Influencers
---
Yea that is why I am playing one. Thinking UD or Troll. Maybe Troll for breserking bcs I don't care about PVP.
---
TBC most hyped ever.
---
But Pantheon MMO is a close 2nd.
---
Classic I'm just excited about.
---
I think it would be cool for blizz to allow hunters to tame the famous spirit wolf for the first couple of days if release.üòÅ
---
Even without those news spikes, we‚Äôre growing quite fast. I‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on subs when I come here, we only hit 50k a few weeks ago and now it‚Äôs 70, still months before launch.
---
I'm personally planning to do level 30 in less than 2 days, so that's my milestone and will be pushing hard to do that :)
---
Agreed, which is why we left in Loch Modan/Westfall for the other races. Nice time by the way! üëç
---
Probably got downvoted because replying "This" is useless. It brings nothing to the conversation at hand. The up- and downvote buttons are there for a reason.
---
The screenshots are from a "classic" private server. I Did not say a "vanilla" private server.
---
...and then it's time to sleep for a week to regain the lost hours of your life.
---
Came here for this just on thread title alone.
---
*don't quite know, iirc no
---
*no
---
*yes
---
On phase 2 launch. And only 1 person per week can get the weapons. By the time phase 2 is over that‚Äôs like 8-12 people on a server with thousands of toons.
---
There's been some threads about this, like https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/80av0n/levelling_pace_average_level_6_30_mins_10_in_5/
---
1-60 you're looking at 6-8 days if you're keeping a good pace, about 11-12 days for an average player still mostly focused on leveling, anything beyond that for more casual players who might be taking time to play battlegrounds or whatever.
---
Which endgame equivalent items are you thinking of that will be available from the beginning?
---
It‚Äôs feasible as I know a number of mages planning to speedrun doing just that. 
---
The only caveat is that if you‚Äôre currently testing on pservers keep these in mind:
---
Vanilla respawn is 5 mins not 6.5
---
Pserver mob density is maxed out, all potential spawn sites are spawned. This won‚Äôt be the case on Classic if it‚Äôs like vanilla
---
Dynamic respawn is a pserver thing not Classic
---
Mob resistances aren‚Äôt working properly on pservers
---
Would recommend some beta testing for sure. If it ever arrives
---
Still unacceptable imo. And don‚Äôt forget about the armor, which more people can get.
---
It‚Äôs https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60
---
No, items like bonereavers edge will be more powerful than or equivalent to certain raid weapons later on in the game, I never said there will be endgame items available from the beginning
---
So with the less spawning of mobs and potentially more resisting. With many others planning on doing the same thing, do you think I would actually be able to get an opportunity to aoe farm effectively? Or would it be better to go straight questing? And aoe farm at another level e. G 30 rather than starting at lvl 20

These titles were added before teh achievement system, though.
---
Just go in blind. You're in for a real treat.

Me and my friend were like 10 years old in vanilla and we had dwarf hunters that we played to like level 10 and used some time to get there. It was Winter's Veil and we stepped in one of those machines that makes you a christmasy lepergnome. We thought "oh fuck, our character turned into a fucking gnome" and tried talking to the NPC close to the machine and looked around a bit until we just logged off in frustration and deleted our characters...
---
It wasn't until later that we visited a friends house and saw him take off the buff by rightclicking it (we didn't know what buffs were or how to take them off) and we got really pissed :D
---
Probably my most noob moment
---
We cannot change something on which nobody has control. We saw on private servers that the ¬´¬†after-naxx¬†¬ª has only one way to keep community in one server: TBC. It‚Äôs not for nothing that blizz did it that way... 
---
I am sure activision won‚Äôt release new content for Classic and not sure that they want to continue the adventure on TBC.. After Sunwell cleared the same problems appears so what? We go in WOTLK? In this way we‚Äôll play Classic BFA soon... 
---
I think they have already thought about that and the solution will be: enjoy progression, enjoy FRESH servers or enjoy small pop realm to continue raiding with your guild and raid-log at raid time.. so the objectives of such realm is just to get your full T3 gear, take a pic and tell yourself ¬´¬†I did it¬†¬ª. And then you can begin a lvl 1 other class char and have fun again during progression..
---
Taurens also have the well purification chain that starts in their starting zone that no-one else can do.
---
People who have computers that correspond to what they want to test?
---
What are some of the most popular specs PvP wise?
---
Yes, of course WoW should cater to its core audience.
---
Scheduled buffs and nerfs have *never* been part of WoW. There was *never* a point in vanilla where you knew that an item would change significantly in a few months. At best you could know what would happen when the PTR went up.
---
Progressive itemization is as artificial as it gets. It's like backporting game-breaking bugs.
---
It‚Äôs not stopping any other mage speedrunner so I can‚Äôt see why not. There‚Äôs been some banging times from mage aoe farmers lately.  The consensus seems to be get ahead of the pack and then take advantage of having mobs to yourself.
---
Who cares about regular joe, if he's not mentally capable of doing that research himself, he shouldn't be playing the game and blizzard doesn't have to cater to mentally disabled people.
---
which tbh is bad game design
---
Of all time? No. That was Dark Souls 3 and unsurprisingly didn't live up to my expectations. Wow vanilla was close second and I couldn't play it at the time because I was poor. 
---
Classic lands a third place.
---
Not sure if its related or not but:
---
I was level 30 or something, Ashenvale, and we someone invited me to raid for Darnassus, so there is that hunter that presses 'feign death' and I'm like 'what the fuck happened, this guy died, can someone ress him? is there an enemy rogue around?' Then he done it few times more, and I asked him what happened, well that was 'feign death' spell.
---
Sorry I meant to reply to  [**u/Lightshoax**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lightshoax/)
---
I'm a big fan of the elemental spec, which is a frost and fire hybrid. Basically talent for the instant cast spells and use scorch in between. You should check out aftershock on YouTube, a really skilled elemental mage :)
---
In vanilla gold isnt as easily accessible as it is in current wow. What i plan to do is roll a mage so at lvl 40 and lvl 50 you can sell portals for 1g a pop allday long at booty bay or other less accessible areas. My profs will be tailoring for making and selling bags and mining for strictly selling the ore.
---
Love it! You made my mind up for me. Always loved druids playstyle but hated the horde cat form &amp; loathe moonkin. 
---
If I can effectively play a druid in humanoid form, even better!
---
Yes.
---
Plus you want that check mark under wow beta testing üòä
---
Imagine asking for Classic servers for 15 years and #NoChanges, then demand simplified systems to cater to casual players. Basically asking to dumb down the game and pushing it in the direction it is currently in retail, and it's not even in beta. Oh the irony. 
---
At this rate we'll see threads asking for personal loots and flex raids next month, because it's too hard to manage 40 people. Maybe add LFG and LFR as well, because I cba talking with people to make a group.  :^)
---
Came to Wow from Ultima Online. When I figured out that you couldn't be looted, oh what a joy that was.
---
I had already pre-ordered 3 copies before that. So I played the RMAH until I made back the cost of the 3 copies. Then I quit a week later. Felt right. Made me happy. =)
---
In first world countries its common to get 4-6 weeks of paid time off per year.
---
Awesome! Thank you for this
---
The dataminer has connected the client to a local 1.12 database. This doesn't mean anything.
---
It's one of the defining games of our generation and we're getting a second chance to experience it. I'd try it for that alone.
---
Leaving a comment here to reference this when I'm doing my leveling in Classic.
---
Why should i roll mage over warlock ?
---
I just checked it out and it looks great! Especially considering there might be no sort of quest helper for quest coordinated. Definitely useful. 
---
I have trouble hitting 20 in Darkshore (usually end at 18), but I suspect that I'm doing way less grinding than I should. I'll try this route for my next run, thank you :)
---
.... really ? So you think it is a good game design to have item stats randomly changing every few weeks ?   
---
No ? So why do you think it is a good game design to have them change over time to specific known and researchable stats.
---
If you the better stats would impact the game too much, such as making bosses easier wouldnt it be much better game design to simply buff the bosses a bit ?
---
You're replying to the wrong guy, mate.
---
I never played vanilla so I jumped on a private server when I heard Classic was coming so I could try out the original version first.
---
It's hella fun. Seriously good.
---
I thought the dating game was pointless. Josh clearly had NA preferred from the start, and whatever homoerotic line they said was like ‚Äúoh most impressive, I love it‚Äù while whatever one OCE said lead to Josh looking for the flaws in it. Without knowing what he picked, I could still tell which it was going to be from the intro to the segment, so making a show of it seemed almost disrespectful to any Ozzie‚Äôs who really wanted at least one known community figure on their servers, like it was rubbing it in. Kind of a missed opportunity for a real and balanced discussion about the pros and cons of each region. 
---
Also, people don‚Äôt like to hear about all the work a streamer/figure won‚Äôt have to do because their viewers/friends/clique will do it for them to get in their good graces. It might‚Äôve been a joke but it‚Äôs still likely to happen.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be dramatic, and I liked the rest of the episode, but that segment rubbed me the wrong way.
---
I don't care about your design issues. Just keep the game as it was.
---
Do have a look at the entry config XPS15, refurbished if need be. 
---
They have massive 97wh batteries and the best FHD panels out there. They're much more pleasant looking and feeling machines than the "gaming" branded ones. 
---
And with a GTX 1050 (ti) they're more than enough for WoW, performance wise.
---
I just ran it with the steps that I posted and it worked fine. Don't build from source or edit anything in the code. I don't know why your download is hitting  http://US.patch.battle.net:1119/wow_classic_beta/cdns considering the string "wow_classic_beta" shouldn't be in there. 
---
Make sure you select "wow" from the dropdown, not beta or anything, and overwrite the hex BuildConfig id that it finds with the one you got from the versions file.
---
see you Classic wpvp, that will not be that eazy to survive for you like this commenting on other people content :)  goodjob ebb! /r/WowClassicDruid
---
Take your time and really make a point of mass murder as you go. There are great grinding spots to stop and grind for half an hour. I‚Äôll make a note to do an example vid.
---
Items will have the stats from the Patch 1.12 not from the early patches of Classic WoW.
---
For example some item can have +2 stamina in patch 1.07 and then later in patch 1.08 this item will have +5 stamina.
---
so wouldnt it be much better game design to simply just buff the raids a bit ?
---
They're great in pretty much all aspects. But I'll play the negative Nancy. 
---
Raid rotation is not exciting and raid tier sets are poopy until Frostfire set.
---
The one thing that truly keeps me from playing a mage is how boring the leveling is (to me). Frostbolt &gt; Frostbolt &gt; Frostbolt &gt; Frost Nova &gt; walk away &gt; Frost Bolt, Frost Bolt &gt; *Hear "Need more mana*" &gt; Drink &gt; Eat &gt; Repeat.
---
Warriors of any spec will push more buttons and play more intensely in PvE than rogues of any spec. 
---
Rogue is intense in PvP but you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre one of the least so classes in PvE.
---
I had one!
---
Someone dying = real world event.
---
People grieving = real world event.
---
People organizing a mourning ceremony via an online game as a mere tool = real world event. 
---
I'm most certainly not the one who can't seperate fiction and reality.
---
Definitely most hyped about TBC because like you, vanilla had won me over bigtime. 
---
Everything after was a major letdown though, sadly.
---
How is it keeeping the game how it was if you specifically know which items will change to what ? Nobody during vanilla had that knowledge. Now you will specifically hunt for different items which will absolutely change the game.......  
---
What will be in the spirit of vanilla maybe would be to - progressively change DIFFERENT items ;-)
---
It's not changing every few weeks. It's chaning once when the 1.10 itemisation change happens. Items changed over the course of vanilla to reflect raid progression and introduce catch up gear. That's how it should be.
---
&gt; Funny how the progressive itemisation crowd never talks about progressive talents isn't it.
---
That's because progressive crowd are private server babs and they are used to it, while progressive talents were never there. They are almost impossible to recreate due to amount of coding and database work that would go into it. Not to mention lack of automatic update system would mean that players would need to have at least 12 different clients ready to go.
---
Yes, but it's the #nochanges_REEEEEE territory.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt word it that way, but there‚Äôs a lot of players who want physical classes and not casters, and the vice versa. Nothing wrong with that. I‚Äôve played since 2006 and never levelled a clothie past 30.
---
They keep the game as it was in 1.12. You are asking for change here.
---
The plan is not to improve Classic, the plan is to bring an authentic experience.
---
I got a 144Hz freesync monitor maybe about 2 months ago and i notice it EVERYWHERE, even windows desktop when moving something.
---
When my fps in games drop below 100 it sucks.
---
A lot of guilds (semi-hardcore) will be raiding twice or three times a week, probably for around 4ish hours at a time. You obviously need to be able to attend those on a regular basis to earn and keep a spot as a core raider.
---
You'll likely be expected to have certain consumables, again depending on the hardcore-ness of the guild. Less hardcore guilds won't have as high requirements as hardcore ones. At a minimum it's probably going to be bandages, +stat foods, and various potions. Higher end guilds will expect more potions.
---
Therefore to be a regular raider you're probably looking at being able to dedicated 15+ hours a week to the game at a minimum. 8-10 for the raids themselves and the rest to make sure you have the gold to buy repairs, farm mats, so on.
---
This is all "finger in the air" sort of numbers to give you a sort of ballpark. It really does depend on your guild's raiding schedule and your own ability to meet the consumables requirements they want for your class and role.
---
any new decent monitor you will will come with a DP cable
---
I played on these and find progressive itemisation stupid.
---
I would agree with this pick.
---
Just suck it up and go for a mail class. Hunters own wpvp and levelling, and have a place in endgame. Shamans are pretty good at a bit of everything, and have great heals and buffs that put them in high demand.
---
&gt; But, then the game client would be extremely big to install. You can't have two art assets from two different games in one without making it too big.
---
I don't think so. Original WoW took 5 GB. Even if the new assets are twice in file size it comes out to 15 GB, that's quite reasonable. The whole of BfA takes 45 GB so I think 15 GB is pessimistic.
---
Yeah, you're right it seems. I removed them from the list.

---
the Naxx vid is also rad!
---
No Final Fantasy 7 remake is... for me anyway
---
No it's not because exploits make the game unplayable
---
It's a huge box around the complete level (or zone in WoW). The bottom half is usually empty as it is obscured by terrain anyway.
---
Things like clouds, the sun and moon, stars and atmospheric effects are put into the skybox. It's more or less what you see when you look up.
---
No. It was probably Witcher 3. Even though vanilla WoW was probably a top 3 gaming experience for me.
---
4 bucks on eBay!
---
From my experience,
---
1-10 took about 3 hours,
---
10-14 took 3 hours more,
---
then, approximately, 1 hour per level till 20.
---
So, it's ~12 hours till 20 (on a popular server, not super optimized but with the previous experience ).
---
Dying to pulling more that you can handle, or not having enough mana or hp before pull: A learning experience.
---
Dying to lvl 50+ undead rogue while trying to level in STV: Literally a waste of time.
---
My quest log has always been at like 18/20 when I hit 60
---
I may be blind but I think Priest is missing the Fear Ward Racial Skill for Dwarfs
---
Then we should have 1.0 talents and Ragnaros dropping T2 items because it's authentic.
---
If you‚Äôre ‚Äòjust optimizing your gear‚Äô why can‚Äôt you ‚Äòjust optimize‚Äô with the 1.12 stats? Why the need for some convoluted progression system that only benefits people who happen to know the curve?
---
The thing about progressive itemization is that in practice patches take months and months to release.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The average joe might not know that Bloodmail Boots become prebis in phase4, but there's no way they'll be farming prebis boots for 4 phases. They would have upgraded with raid or pvp gear long beforehand.
---
There are a few items like bonereaver's edge that become end-game viable with the update, but these items are already difficult to get from end-raid bosses. There isn't a single easily obtainable item that is upgraded into an end-game bis item
---
lol this is either a shit bait or you never leveled on a pvp server getting cockblocked by a 60 camping you or a dominant opposite faction in the area taking all of the quest mobs/items,
---
Definetely the same as occasionally dying because you pulled too much (not)
---
Earlier peaks in PvE, less gear dependent in PvP, more reliable CC in 5 mans, great utility in portals and consumables, better farming capabilities at max level.
---
Sorry but gods of 1v1 are shadow (I luv my shadow) :P other than that, you're right
---
Was looking for some alternative to level in frost spec, and I was thinking about arcane, no pushback on missles, imp. wand dmg. What are your thoughts about it? Got some build i can look into?
---
I began playing close to release of Cata. Played the game religiously for 5-6 years every day, and gradually became more disappointed as expansions released. Instead of the game becoming incrementally better as expected for each expansion, I conversely became more disappointed and disheartened to play my absolute favorite game of all time. 
---
To add more fuel to my addiction, I watched YouTube videos of WoW, and people always complained and referred to Vanilla as the greater in WoW's lifetime. 
---
I searched for solutions for experiencing this so-called "Vanilla experience", figured it out, joined a server, disliked it by first hand impression. I was persistent, and in a matter of hours, I decisively canceled my subscription and played Vanilla WoW. 
---
For years, I thought aloud about an official classic server and more so contacted Blizzard - obviously in vain - about a solution for experiencing vanilla on official blizzard servers. Advancing a few years in time, and my lingering wish was granted. 
---
**So yes, I am overly excited about Classic and has been since the very announcement.**
---
just enjoy the road.
---
17/0/34 for improved CS is the best with bad gear imo, Elemental is reliably bursty and fun, PoM Pyro is stupidly bursty every 3 minutes but relatively mediocre the rest of the time.
---
Progressive itemization is a change. Never in vanilla were there scheduled item changes known months in advance.
---
This just shows that #nochanges is at its core a meaningless statement. Imagine asking for Classic servers for 15 years, getting 1.12 with #nochanges, and then people ask for changes to itemization for... some reason. Oh the irony.
---
You really think that leaving the items as they are without artificial switcheroos is the same as asking for flexraids? Sure. Sure.
---
The sale records would be unimaginable and beyond unprecedented.
---
It's also to protect their copyrighted property.
---
If no actions are taken against these emulators, it could compromise their ownership.
---
Not sure if I'm late into this thread but, I'm currently considering between warlock and priest.
---
Never actually played one of them for long time or lvled. From vanilla wow I was usually playing hybrid(shaman) or meleee clases. Currently considering between warlock and priest and it is kind of tough choice. I really want to be usefull in raids and pvp. But want to have most of the fun from gameplay in world pvp, and probably priest with mind contol is my best bet here? 
---
Warlock though has a lot of cool pets, quests, abilities also. Hard to choose!
---
Happy cakeday \o/
---
In retail you aren't officially allowed to use tmorph, but some people use it anyways.
---
Blizzard's anticheat software might ban you, so use it on your own risk.
---
Thx mate
---
And then you hit 40, respec and kill 8 things at once.
---
This, people would loose their mind.
---
NO CHANGES to my sub
---
You can blink to break fall damage
---
None of what you're talking about has anything to do with people setting up a private server to check out the beta client.
---
Are gnomes really the fastest? How do the 1-6, 1-10 and 1-20 compare to the horde?
---
There should be the whole video. Skip every couple hours or so and note down the time/lv
---
Well put.
---
First character Nelf drood. 
---
Taking 4 hours to get too level 4.
---
Never went up the tower in the first area because I thought that bridge looking thing would take me to a new place and I didnt wanna get lost, proceed to never go up the tower missing the class trainer. Comming to next area and the other same leveled droods had cool spells, asking how they got em someone told me and I went back, got moonfire and thougjt it was the coolest spell ever. 
---
Get immensly lost in the stupid Barrows den quest, brewing a hatred that made the question wether to ever do that quest again. 
---
Then doing the lasts quests outside of Darnassus I fall of a branch and my character dies halfway on a ledge down to the water. Corpse run and then try to land the Ghost on the ledge but misses the ledge and end up at the base of teldrassil tree. 
---
Thinking everything is lost I delete my character and start a new one. 
---
Not understanding any instance xD especially gnomeregan, fuck that.
---
He still never responded to me lol
---
Amen.
---
Don't see any Shadows winning that Dueling Tournament. While Locks are winning with a secondary spec to SL. 
---
Sure Shadow is good, but lock is better.
---
to be fair, POE is focused in a large part on raw difficulty, game complexity and rewarding, rewards.  
---
Where d3 currently is focused on acccesibility and streamlined gaming experience. (that can be mostly min-maxxed/completed in 24 hours)
---
Don‚Äôt forget to save Shadow on the floating Island!
---
I honestly leveled as fire/arcane back in the day and it wasn't that bad (didn't get into a lot of world PvP though).  Been so long I cant remember the rotation or key spells though.
---
As someone who only dabbled in WoW after lich King expansion, I'm looking forward to playing Vanilla.
---
Everyone who was here has gone through that phase.  I think the new people should also - their journies have just begun.
---
Okay yeah I‚Äôm looking forward to it
---
Stop! You can't downtalk my shadow! :D
---
Really? I feel like hunters suck until level 10 and after that it's a breeze.
---
They have a slightly better starting area, but imo Nelves have the better 10-20. There‚Äôs not much in it unless you are really getting down to absolute fastest times. 
---
At the last pserver launch Alliance was leading the Horde at 20.  Joana hit 20 in 12 hours and I hit 20 in 10.
---
Wildstar was pretty hype for me but I wouldn't say it was the most hyped game of all for me. I went in knowing I would be doing a horribly boring grind for the leveling (Wildstars leveling really didn't feel great imo until the level 30 zones) so I was going in knowing the first 24 hours were going to be meh.
---
I guess you are against progressive itemization? (I mean changing stats.)
---
If so, I completely agree. :)
---
In fact I don't think any kind of "phases" are necessary, really. Classic should be one eternally unchanging game. That it changed during it's life as Vanilla is just a side effect of how it was developed, not something inherent to its gameplay. But people would have flipped out too much without progressive content rollout, so Blizzard tossed them a bone with the phases.
---
Thanks, I liked this very much. May you do something similar for other healers?
---
It's not private in any way if it's shared with others through public channels.
---
Back during the days of Xbox and halo, reach was probably my most anticipated but now classic is by far the most hyped/anticipated game for me
---
That is incorrect
---
damn i had no idea it was actually that long ago!  it was a pretty turbulent and depressed time for me and it was the nail in the coffin of my last pserver character.  i really had no motivation for the raids we were doing at the time.  a lot has changed for me since then!
---
Is there any way you can show the class results by faction?
---
AM is only really useful for clear casting procs and pvp. If you are an advanced level player you could try arcane for novelty sake, I am trying to imagine the daily grind with an arcane build and the best bet would be to open frostbolt and then spam scorches for clear casted AM, other than that spamming AM is just a worse way to spend those seconds than fireball or frostbolt, and it costs 5 talents just to make it viable.
---
On a pvp server it wouldn't be worth it until at least 40 or more preferably lvl 45 to get 5 points in fireball/frostbolt cast time.
---
You could say that about most classes tbh. 
---
Hunter: AA while pet does most of the damage, throw in the occasional arcane shot or sting. 
---
Warrior: AA as you wait years for rage to build up 
---
Priest: Using wand most of the time. 
---
Warlock: DoT and wand, make sure to hit drain soul properly. 
---
Rogues and druids would be interesting due to having an ability to stealth around and open from stealth.  
---
But mages certainly have a lot of down time drinking compared to the other classes that can more or less keep going as Long as they have some HP. But then you have the possibility of AoE grinding as a mage (not as feasible during launch but an option for those ahead of the pack)
---
Idd, idk why mods would be so carebear towards this, when it's not an official community.
---
They're fucking screenshots. Blizzard didn't lose their ownership of Warcraft overnight because some people shared some screenshots. Do you understand how ridiculous you sound?
---
Even if a server was set up for people to log in to through the beta client, it's no big deal. There's no server data and no real game, just a curiosity at this point.
---
Halo 3 was the fiirst time I was absolutley obsessed with a game before it was released. I'd spend most of my free time watching beta footage and looking at pictures in magazines. Atm Im having a similar obsession with cyberpunk. Classic wow is different becuase you know what youre getting.
---
Most diversity in specs in the entire game, go double 21 in any 2 trees of your choice, or go 31/20 or 21/30 in ANY two trees of your choice. Not all specs are equal, but each one brings different things to the table.
---
This is mostly because mage talent trees all have really big 21 pnt and 31 pnt abilities, not all classes have such a strong emphasis on those milestones.
---
Do you stream speedleveling \ know any decent streamers ?
---
The BoP chest piece and the bloodvine set.
---
I can appreciate that. It‚Äôs to be expected they have questions. But this is not a new sub, and there is so much discussion we‚Äôve had on these topics already. Another postnaxx thread won‚Äôt make the difference. 
---
Maybe they should use the search function. Or wait for a few days and see what conversations constantly come up before posting a thread. That‚Äôs what I did.
---
Yeah... at lvl 7 you aren‚Äôt properly introduced to the game yet.
---
I was chatting with the customer support about my account, and asked this question at the end, just for fun. But the answer got me thinking - there is a big chance they don't know the release date themselves. They have the goal set for sure, that's a fact. But are they reassured they are able to release it? I really doubt.
---
I mean, everyone keeps asking for a release date. They may not know it themselves :)
---
And then put it in a spreadsheet and post it here for karma.
---
Next to the arguably greater utility of mages (portals, food/drink, decurse, best dungeon cc) the real difference is the playstile of the two casters. Mages are very mobile and sort of "tricky", but have slightly less raw damage and basically no self sustain. Warlocks on the otherhand have almost no mobility or kiting capabilites, but they make up for it with great raw damage and beastly sustain. They  are the "turrets" of ranged dps.
---
Blink had issues in terms of reliability across odd terrain. It seemed to behave like NPC pathfinding in that sometimes an npc walks past a small log on the ground or has to take a weird ramp up a hill instead of crossing a very very narrow but very deep crack in the ground. You couldn't blink through certain doorways especially in terrain changes, like blinking out of a house in hillsbrad could get you caught in the doorway, you might blink 2 feet and hit a pebble/root on the ground you didn't see
---
The anticheat is what prompted my question. IIRC swapping models involves replacing some patch.meq files in the data folder. I'm assuming it'll get flagged.
---
I do remember, back in vanilla, people used to upload videos where they replaced their character model with Ragnaros or some crap so people were presumably doing similar stuff to what I want and getting away with it, but I'd sooner not risk it unless Blizzard sanctions things.
---
If I were you, id join a guild and always raid, and never never never never never leave my house again.
---
Most dedicated speed runners aren‚Äôt streaming due to Blizz actively striking pserver streams. 
---
There are a few. 
---
I don‚Äôt stream as I have rubbish internet. We‚Äôre still trying to make a solution for Classic launch streaming.
---
[Robe of the Archmage](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18457/robe-of-the-archmage) is pretty good and while you can wear [Bloodvine Garb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) without being a tailor (as it is BoE), the set bonus requires Tailoring 300.
---

---
Good point you made there, but i was thinking about that every tick on AM can proc clear casting and that imp. dmg on wands which in total can lower your downtime. 
---
I know mages have unlimited supply  of water, but in frost spec you have to drink every 2-3mobs.
---
Why wouldn't /sit work? It worked in classic and in all 'blizzlike' private servers.
---
GIRL = Guy In Real Life. Stay safe boys.
---
Why would a random guy working part time as tech support for blizzard be aware of internal release dates at blizzard?
---
Teleport moon glade for droods? I believe its level 10?
---
If we‚Äôre talking aesthetics, they ook physically feeble compared to all the other horde races.
---
You can ofc level how ever you like. Fire is definilty doable, i guess arcane might be aswell.
---
  BUT: Frost is heaps and bounds better than the other trees for leveling. It's more mana efficient, more gear efficient (more free stats through the shatter setup) and a lot safer.
---
Just to put that 100k subscriber count into perspective, a vanilla server would allow a max of 3000-3500 players at any one time max, and blizzard actually aimed for between 2000 and 3000 max. 
---
Granted this sub isn't US only (I'm Norwegian for instance) but it's still a very high count, even if only half of subscribers end up playing regularly that's enough for many servers in all regions.
---
NZ/AUS might have a bad time though, unless

RIP totalbiscuit the OG trollcaster
---
Some guildies used to do something similar.   A single warrior standing somewhere in searing gorge that horde would have to run by to get to BRM to raid.  Meanwhile there are 2 druids and 6 rogues all sitting in stealth waiting ...

I remember my first character being a male NE druid. Got to level 10, tried the bear form quest and died. The quest log stated "failed" I thought it was permanent. Straight away I logged out deleted him and made another druid, this time a female. Luckily I finished the quest first try this time around üòÇ
---
best method i found as a resto druid was aoe farming frostsabers with insect swarm, lightning, and a bit of bear form if necessary.  i had skinning which upped the income, but herb would also be good as i think black lotus spawn around there
---
You ever see a female gnome warrior tank Ony?
---
Yeah, I've been playing around with every class on an instant 60 private server just to test classes out and I have nearly double the keybinds on Warlock as I do as ever other class...It's pretty daunting especially since I don't have any engineer or consumables bound. https://puu.sh/Dfmm9/b5f10b998d.jpg Yikes.
---
I was a successful holy pala in wotlk on 25 man hardmode lich king on my 3G modem with 200-300 ms. Ping is not an issue if the connection is stable and there is no packet loss. 200 is ok to get used to it.
---
Once you get serpent sting you can actually kill mobs very efficiently. 
---
Start auto shot from my range. Immediately after auto shit goes off cast serpent sting while strafing away from the mob. Stop and let next auto shot fire followed immediately by arcane shot and strafe. One more auto shot before the mob reaches you if it isn‚Äôt dead yet. Then toggle auto attack and hit mongoose bite.  The mob will be very low hp by the time it reaches you with a dot ticking. One last melee or serpent sting will finish off the mob. You only used ~20% mana and  barely lost any HP.  Total kill time was like 10-15 sec with almost no recovery time between mobs. 
---
So, yes they are annoying to level without a pet but it is actually still faster than other classes.
---
Well some of us can.
---
For others though...
---
I never redeemed myself on my druid, max rank healing touch and regrowth all the way lol. I remember thinking downranking was stupid. "why wouldn't you want to heal as much as possible, newbs lol."
---
You probably dont know who is support. 100% sure its indian guy sits in india on part-time job and clicking buttons in admin panel.
---
Damn, this is what I seemed to remember from brief stints with Mage alts back in the day (although I never played one seriously). I was hoping I remembered incorrectly, and that it was actually just a teleport with a LoS check or whatever.
---
Oh hai.  I think I was one of the boosts before CDN announcement. 
---
And in my case its cause I've been getting more and more antsy for classic and than it finally occurred to me to check for a classic specific subreddit lol. 
---
Might be similar cases to account for the spikes.
---
I was 12 and had a dwarf hunter as my first character and I reached level 50 (?) . You get a quest at level 50 (?) to hunt stags and get perfect antlers. I literally spent weeks and weeks killing stags endlessly and leveled all the way to level 58. I literally did nothing else with my little time on the game. I became so frustrated after so long that I just decided to delete the character, only later to learn I wasn't killing the things I needed to the whole time.  
---
I tried making other characters but I wasn't satisfied, and I ended up quitting until the release of BC.
---
I don‚Äôt mind only having 1.12 talents but nice try.
---
Who says it needs to be convoluted? Adding depth to the game isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and if people want to maximize I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that. It isn‚Äôt like the information isn‚Äôt available to everyone. Also, it is minmaxing so you don‚Äôt have to be doing it. It is just something extra for those who want more flavor to their game. 
---
Come back when you are ready to have a reasonable discussion instead of only throwing ad hominem arguments.
---
Horde having a base in nearly every contested zone when Alliance doesn't in several &gt; a few vanity items.
---
I know that frost is proved to be the best, just looking for some other way.  
---
Just can't imagine start spamming frost bolt since level 4 all the way to the AQ.
---
Interesting, although those spikes are skewing the gradient coefficient. What happens if you remove the outliers: 3/12,3/19 and 4/7-4/9?
---
How come? WoW:C will **never** be as the original Vanilla. So it will **always** be partially done from that perspective.
---
74 silver hell yeah brother.
---
no
---
/thread
---
I'm in favor of true patch progression, with 1.0 talents et all. But in the absence of that I think Blizz is probably doing the right move.
---
The nost-like idea of item-progression without spell-progression is a half baked solution, having 1.12.1 talents already changes the game so much that the argument of progressive stats to make content harder is a band-aid, not a fix. IMO classic wow should be as true to the patch experience as possible and finally move to 1.13, so skipping to 1.13 isn't so bad really
---
&gt; achievements were added in cataclysm
---
Troll
---
No, and also, achievements were added at the end of BC, beginning of WotLK.
---
No. Your gear and reputation are your achievements in Vanilla WoW. Some arbitrary point system belongs in retail.
---
WoW Classic, Diablo 2 &amp; LoD, Overwatch
---
I don't know if this sub allows discussion of private servers, but if you search reddit / google about new WoTLK you will find it.
---
This depends on what kind of player you are. You can stay one spec forever, you can respec every day or once a week.
---
If guild is casual it will not care what your spec is for raids. Most guilds will never care for your spec outside of raids, so doing dungeons as any spec is acceptable.
---
You could stay for example in raid spec forever. PVPing as a raid spec is fine and for farming there is several stuff you can do. You could level an alt which can be used for farming. You could do some dungeon or world farms that are desirable for you to be in raid spec, like for example DM E jump runs, or DM tribute stealth runs, or Strat orb runs. You could do some proffesions or AH manipulation to earn gold.
---
If you want you can of course respec, as much as you want. It caps out at 50g which is about 1 hour of farm (make it 2 hours even, still doable with enough time). So you can find a guild with connected raid days and stay raid spec only on those days, while respecing and farming on off days.
---
Back then you had no internet to hype up a game. If you didnt follow game magazines, you often didnt know what games were sought after. 
---
I dont even know why i bought ocarina of time, i just remember having zero expectations and enjoying it a ton.
---
You have some indications that a game will be better, but i feel weve all got to let go of popularity and franchises. Way too many misses and we forget that most of the greats started modestly.
---
Look at Demons Souls and what that turned into. Imagine ignoring it because it wasnt devil may cry or elder scrolls!
---
Only spamming frost bolt is a meme. Even in MC/BWL you do more(aoe, kite, decurse). But if you just don't enjoy Frost as a specc (which is totaly legitimate) then maybe mage is not exactly what you are looking for.
---
Graphically, i see game that make me want wow 2. My wife has been playing the remade spyro games and they are cartoony as hell. The levels themselves almost look lile they could be a super upgraded wow. If only!
---
Achiv was there in woltk . But no one want it
---
Sorry but why would someone who works for the tech side of blizzard, which is most likely an Indian person working a part-time job have any clue what the release date would be.
---
Strong contender for first place with Cyberpunk 2077.
---
Nah I pass.
---
Yes, the people in vanilla had no idea which items were going to change to become better. The difference here is that with progressive itemisation, people *do* know what items will become better, but only if they check outside of the game. Again, this rewards people who check outside of the game for additional information and penalises people who simply play the game and reasonably expect that they can figure everything out by playing it.
---
absolutely!
---
Not realising the tank / healer / dps trinity was a thing. We accidentally aggrod a Harvest Watcher in Westfall and had it chase us all the way to  just outside of Goldshire, before my friend (A night elf priest) had the bright idea for me to hold aggro (warrior), so he can heal me. Most noob / biggest wake up moment.
---
but he says there's not many hunters on horde side.
---
Dark Souls(and bloodborne/sekiro/demons spuls) filled the void that diablo left behind. To the point where its the franchise with more of my favorite games than anyone else ever.
---
6 games that brought back a lot of what wow and diablo lost, and a whole bunch of new shit. Thank you dark souls!
---
I leveled as a rogue through Teldrassil with 2 hunters. For some reason I thought I had also chosen the archer-like class and couldn‚Äôt figure out why my throw ability sucked so much. Then I spent all my money on a caged cat bc I thought it would be my pet like hunters had. Total waste of early money, but definitely glad I chose rogue after awhile!
---
WELCOME TO THE PARTY PAL!
---
Its my most hyped game in a long time. Before that was Stardew Valley which mostly delivered everything I was looking for. 
---
And before that was Mass Effect 3 which I didn't even finish cause I hated it 3 hours in. I'm Commander fucking Sheppard why am I babysitting? Why did I not get a dialogue option to tell Wrex off? Why did it fail to import my Sheppard properly and gave me one that looks nothing like mine?
---
Perhaps also better world pvp survivability/escape ability in unwinnable situations. If you encounter e.g. a warrior+priest or two rogues while leveling, you stand a chance of getting away from them as a frost mage. As a warlock, there's not much you can do but die.
---
Age of brown was fun for a bit. I remember that there was no text in pvp (no nameplate, cant see what level the enemy is, etc) which was a veeery interesting idea.
---
But yeah, shit was brown yo.
---
While i don't agree with the challenged memelord and how he articulates himself, down ranking is quite extensively used (and should be) for all casters, not just healers. Mages for example should have rank 1 and max.rank for Frostbolt, Fireball, Cone of Cold, Arcane Explosion, Blizzard and Fireblast. While you can get by without it, you are definitley gimping yourself if you dont.
---
It did work in vanilla but was a known bug, so it‚Äôs possible it will be removed.
---
I am so sorry for your loss.
---
When is the launch?
---
How do you beat a soul link lock or shadowpriest 1v1, all else being equal?
---
Personally i'm going to level as frost and switch to elemental-spec once I hit 60. Frost is in my opinion quite boring to PvP as.
---
There is no good reason why hunters would be less popular on horde. Its always been a highly played class.
---
Honestly, i enjoyed sekiro way more than I wouldve enjoyed DS4. If you havent played it yet go do so. It is phenomenal.
---
nope
---
lol nah man it was gorgeous!  fuck the desert regions though...
---
one thing that i loved with that game was that even if there was a reasonable level difference you still stood a chance in pvp.  2 lvl 60s could deal with a lvl 80 if i remember right.  i dont remembe not being able to see names or lvl though?  i remember quite clearly that any time i got ganked 10 on 1 it was members of &lt;SCUM&gt;
---
it had some fun ideas like that casting mode that greatly powered up your casting but you had to maintain it or bad shit would happen.  fatalities were fun as well for the huge temporary damage boost an shit
---
Same reason companies require an NDA for some closed betas. They don't want an unfinished product to be the point of speculation.
---
The whole point of the lost was that it's a bad design choice of the game
---
I only ever played Halo 1 on PC. Still have the game sitting here.
---
I'm waiting anxiously for the release date, so I can finally book my vacation to match it. Work has been so stressful lately that I'm literally dreaming of having an entire week of quality time in Azeroth.
---
Same here, I remember starting a Jedi Knight on the very first day of early access. That first week or two of leveling was a magical time.
---
I personally think gianstalker is superior but each to their own.
---
LOL.
---
Meanwhile in retail your skills come flying onto your bar by themselves when you level so you dont have to put any effort or planning into obtaining them.
---
I would take Vanilla every time.
---
You don't
---
16th of July
---
Source: Dude trust me
---
Valid in a lot of cases, not in this one though considering this is just an updated version of the demo client which was public.
---
I would tak≈ºe aoe loot plus auto loot. In my opinion ppl who agree with me have too many free Time to waste...
---
Seriously, I do not care at all whether there or not there are achievements in the game. I never cared about achievements and never will. If someone else likes them, good for them.
---
First, achievements were added in the WotLK prepatch, iirc. They were certainly in for most of WotLK regardless.
---
But otherwise, definitely not in the manner they were implemented in WotLK. Even though I enjoyed a lot of the WotLK Achievement system, its implementation simply served to fuel gatekeeping and grant yet more prestige to the already most prestigious activities in the game.
---
I enjoyed Achievements because the system finally granted some in game recognition for in-game activities that weren't previously acknowledged in the slightest (Explorer, Loremaster, that one for killing all the opposing faction leaders...) But the reason I liked them wasn't because of the actual Achievement system itself, it was simply because they provided recognition for those activities and made them much more satisfying to accomplish. (A huge boon to serial completionists like myself).
---
As far as recreating some of the beneficial effects of achievements... I wouldn't mind some kind of stats tab (for things like "total quests completed", "total NPC kills", "total boss kills", "total deaths", "total money spent", etc.) But if they were going to add any rewards for those obscure tasks that weren't previously acknowledged by the game, I'd want in done in a Vanilla styling, more similar to Avast Ye Admiral rather than the WotLK achievement system.
---
Was he confusing auto-loot with AOE loot?
---
Auto loot was in Vanilla, IIRC.
---
In pvp especially pve you don‚Äôt even use a lot of them. You‚Äôll be fine. Roll a lock I know I am.
---
as lvl 60 rogue after a few months that there are combopoints
---
Think it was TBC
---
It isnt updated graphics...
---
There is a loot system called +1. Rarely run in dungeons, but can be common in MC or ZG pugs. Basically if you got one item already then people that haven't will get priority over you. 
---
Regular rolling where you can win more than 1 item is common for regular dungeons.
---
Don‚Äôt ask such sacred questions!
---
It does, but how does that power level compare to adding stealth to a non-stealth class, or stone form, or hardiness etc. I wasn't saying it's worthless, but from the pov of what's the worst class/race combo, it could be in there.
---
I see why people would be against aoe loot. I don't even think I'd want aoe loot because it does actually make it easier to get loot of certain mobs you killed. For example you killed a bunch of mobs and one ran very close to other mobs and died. With aoe loot you would not have to risk aggroing the mobs.
---
Ah I just edited my reply then refreshed and saw this. Whew! That's correct.
---
Wasn‚Äôt the demo limited to certain levels and zones, though? Seems like a reach of a comparison.
---
Bezerking is 10% at full, it only gets up to 30% as you're down towards half hp. Since as a mage you're generally either at full hp or getting focused down, and when you're getting focused you'd rather cast instants, it's meh. 
---
Just like nelf rogue, it's not like it's worthless, it's just a question of is it really that good compared to the other class/race combos.
---
Doesnt matter. Your argument was that the racial was bad BECAUSE you can already stealth which I showed to be untrue.
---
If you value the other racials more than nelf racials then you pick another race.
---
If he was confusing it, then I'm fine with the criticism because AOE loot should not be in the game imo. But I don't think he confused it.
---
no changes Kappa
---
Okay okay my bad haha they were in the WoTLK, its been awhile haha
---
AoE loot actually affects the game economy though, as it drastically increases the efficiency of AoE gold farming. The inflation this causes would actually make the game WORSE for people who don't plan on dedicating 20+ hours a week to the game.
---
In my very first duel on my very first character, "Xslayer", Akama US PVP Horde. I was level 8 at the time.
---
My IRL friend was casting fire ball at me, and every time he did, I kept casting "Frost Armor" thinking it was spell that blocked other spells.  
---
He had a good laugh. This was in 2004 so I was about 9 years old.
---
My first character was a hunter I got to 45 ish. I used a White Sword for a long time because "weapons don't matter to hunters".
---
Yeah AOE loot is a complete no-go for me but autoloot doesn't bother me in the slightest.
---
Nope.
---
Not 100% sure but wasn't it July?
---
It's definitely in the summer.
---
It has both priest and mage trainer.
---
yes, they don't affect gameplay
---
You keep telling people to calm down but judging by your post history you seem mad as FUCK bro
---
Are you OK?
---
This is wrong. Tauren can't ride any other skeletal horse other than Baron Mount
---
&gt;  don't have time to dig through blue posts and I did a google search before asking those questions and I didn't find any reliable official information but partial ones.
---
The entire point of making classic is to bring the game back in it's most authentic state. Your questions are answered by the most baseline knowledge you can possibly have of this subject. 
---
&gt; I couldn't care less about downvotes
---
You specifically asked why you are getting downvoted. This statement is puzzling to me because I didn't respond to you with the assumption that you were somehow upset because the number next to your comment was a negative, you specifically asked why. I answered you. If you don't care about the downvotes why are you asking in the first place and why are you snapping at me for answering the question you posed?
---
&gt; you and the rest of the community do look like toxic and unfriendly.
---
We aren't toxic, but the question you asked is legitimately a stupid question and an inefficient way of getting information on this subject. I'll try to give you an example you might be able to relate to. 
---
Let's pretend you are an enthusiast with cars. You LOVE cars and they have been a major part of your life for over 20 years. You drive, you fix, you tinker, you study, you play. Everyone has their thing, but *yours* is cars.
---
You have driven just about every type of car their is to drive, and of every car you have tried, the 1965 Pontiac GTO is your favorite. Pontiac has made many cars since and even many iterations of the GTO, but this specific 1965 version is the one that stands out to you as the best. You aren't alone in your opinion, there's actually an entire community that thinks this is the best car ever made. They make a subreddit for talking about their car, they even petition Pontiac to beg them to remake this car. Everyone in this community is tired of the pussy ass hybrids that this company is now making to appease the masses. They forgot what made them a great company and they forgot what made so many people fans of them. We want car eat's fucking jet fuel and shits flames. We don't give a fuck if it's hard to drive or doesn't handle well or has poor fuel efficiency. This is our jam and the 'you think you do but you don't' attitude that Pontiac has is actually completely insulting. We know what we want.
---
Pontiac gives in and announces they are going to make an legitimate recreation of the 1965 GTO. Everyone rejoices. People have been talking about it non-stop for the last year. We get real communication from the company, people in the community make videos and posts about it. At this point it's pretty well laid out exactly what to expect. This is a 1:1 recreation in every way possible. It's now crunch time and the car is actually only months away from being released
---
You go to the 1965 GTO subreddit and sort by new to see what people are talking about today in your community. You click a post where somebody is asking a question about the details of the car.
---
This person want's to know if the new GTO will have the same body style as the old one. What an a completely silly question to even ask. This is a 1:1 creation. We are getting *OUR* car back. Not some shitball new creation with GTO slapped on the side. Your damn right it's going to have the same body. Are you insane? What kind of question is this? If you have been following this at all you would know that this is an authentic recreation of our beloved vehicle and to even suggest that they *might* add a modern body style to it is legitimately a stupid question. Why would you even make a post in our community forum asking something so absurd. There is a massive pool of knowledge out there that is very easy to find that answers these basic questions. 
---
This is why you are receiving backlash. This subreddit isn't for people have no idea what the fuck classic even is to come in and get their most basic questions answered. This place is for people who love classic WoW to discuss things within the community. We aren't going to shit on you for asking questions, but people around here are going to at least expect you to understand the basics. If you have never heard of #NoChanges then making a long reddit thread asking questions like if raids will be 40 man or not is just going to get you flamed.
---
If you wana participate in classic wow we welcome you with open arms, but you don't expect anyone to hold your hand while you learn the basics.
---
You have to remember a lot of us were wayyy younger. I believe the age consensus of the population has changed since 2004. I'm thinking a lot more than 5%.
---
Ice block the death coil, use shadow reflector
---
&gt; it gave a real sense of accomplishment 
---
What, killing the raid bosses didn't?
---
I truly hope that Classic's success stir shit up at Blizzard and make them change their current view on game design. I would love to see them returning to the old ways of Classic, because while I love BC in general, I felt that Blizzard already started simplifying things too much. The dungeon design stands out to me. Yes, I still love the dungeons on BC, but they don't hold a candle to Classic's. I still remember the excitement of exploring a new dungeon in Classic, the feeling that you are no more than a regular adventurer venturing into something dangerous and mysterious.
---
I cant tell you what the streets in my own hometown are called but I can tell you the names of 95% of all the abilities in wow.
---
No, no and absolutely fucking no.
---
I ran up to Gadgetzan from Thousand Needles and right clicked the horde flight master as alliance.
---
As a Paladin, I thought Blessing of Salvation (lowers threat) meant you‚Äôd piss the mob off less yielding in getting hit more softly.
---
You should be able to remove 20% by now, in all honesty. Joana recently has pushed sub 4 day runs and many many others are approaching low threes. Yet to see a non boosted sub three day run but I can personally crank out 3day14h fairly easily. A little more practice and I would think I could get down to 3d6/7.
---
I watched his videos and read his /played
---
You can also easily farm DME lashers using the same technique minus Insect Swarm.
---
Which NHL team is your favorite and why is it VGK?
---
For some people it is purely a nostalgia drip, that is undeniable. For most of the people in this sub it's not, most of us have played on private servers at least within the last year or two, we just like the vanilla experience. I honestly don't think most people today will enjoy it, the gaming industry and culture has shifted well past the difficult and unfriendly user experience you are probably accustomed to. It's a lot like Morrowind vs Skyrim, imo Morrowind is by far the superior experience, but I would never recommend it to someone who started gaming in the past 10 years. 
---
For instance, I played a private server for around 2 hours last night and got my troll hunter from lvl 5 to lvl 7, running around the starting zone trying my best not to die, pulling 1 mob at a time, and finished maybe 4 quests. It was a enjoyable two hours for me, your mileage may vary. Vanilla WoW is great, but I suggest approaching it with a healthy dose of patience if this kind of game is new to you.
---
That's absolutly fair. I like both specs for pvp, they play quite different, but Elemental is overall very fun to play. Just keep in mind that Elemental needs overall better gear to do decent, like MC or the Rank 10 set. You need a bunch of crit and/or extra stam to be effective.
---
I played SWTOR for like 2-3 years as an end game raider after playing WoW seriously for like 6 years.  
---
I always considered it a WoW clone with some serious issues.  
---
SWTOR leveling was garbage compared to WoW for many reasons, but especially on release it was bad due to traveling to different planets and every zone feeling small, WoW's world always feels massive to me and even though traveling could be a chore, not having to see multiple loading screens every time you changed zones really effected my experience.  
---
Last time I leveled in SWTOR though, it was a joke in terms of time required to level(like &lt;1day compared to like 10 days for classic WoW). Within a 6 week period I leveled 12 characters to max level and I know of many people who did the same or more. Nearly every end game raider I knew before I quit had at least 1-2 of every class option on both factions.  
---
WoW has always been slower to level compared to SWTOR, but classic is much slower than SWTOR ever was.
---
End game was the only redeeming factor of the game imo. I consider DF/DP progression to be the peak of SWTOR raiding for me, but they just suffered from a lack of new content and recycling content when they did their shitty expansions.  
---
I would consider SWTOR raiding to be most similar to WOTLK and maybe TBC in terms of how the bosses were done.  
---
Classic raiding is fun, but in a different way to TBC and WOTLK for me. Both are enjoyable, but to me, Ulduar is the greatest raid I have ever played and DF/DP from SWTOR are around top 5.
---
Gearing is the biggest difference between the games now, where you can essentially share your gear between all your characters on SWTOR. Nearly every slot can be shared(I think its like trinkets and implants are the only things that can't be shared), and it encourages you to have alts and allows you to do content multiple times per week, making gearing up very fast.  
---
WoW, especially classic is significantly slower due to getting like 2-3 pieces of a boss in a 40 man raid and no option to share it with your alts.
---
If you enjoyed SWTOR, I think you will enjoy WoW classic. But Classic WoW is a much slower game than SWTOR is.
---
No. Its objectively bad game design to force players to be a shit spec for the majority of content (Hello prot warriors) just to keep some notion of class fantasy.
---
The idea that people need to pick a spec and commit to it sounds great on paper, but it only worls if you have a wide variety of viable builds that are usable in both PvP and PvE. This just doesnt work in Vanilla.
---
In order to be competitive in PvP you must raid, and in order to raid you must be willing to play a PvE build.
---
46 is the rough halfway point. Anything under 3 days will satisfy me
---
Yeah but it actually had a server database and playable content unlike the beta atm.
---
Played vanilla since launch to end and no clue what this is either
---
I know shift-click to auto-loot was already a thing in Vanilla, and I thought menu toggle auto-loot was as well honestly. (it's built into private servers that use the 1.12 client, and UI is client-side) But even so, this is a change that actually affects nothing other than convenience, because all it means is that you don't need to hold down shift while looting. It won't make gold farming any faster or really affect the game in any way other than possibly mitigating some strain for people with hand issues. So yeah, I'd call it a frivolous objection at least.
---
I think he was probably confusing it with AoE loot, which is actually harmful to the game because it can significantly improve the efficiency of gold farmers and inflate AH prices even further out of the reach of more casual players.
---
Burn the heretic!
---
This is wrong. They are BIS until Gauntlets of Annihilation with two exceptions:
---
- You are using maces (Ironfoe, Empyrean Demolisher) (this one depends on proc rates)
---
- You are using swords and one of them is Maladath
---
But all 3 cases are before Naxx.
---
I wish I could have my lvl 60 druid back.  I lost all it's glory when playing BC and WotLK.  I was so decked out in gear but then epics became a normal thing.....
---
What was the story with players receiving their gold amount they had twice when they were hacked
---
A friend of mine had 33k gold and he accidentally received it twice in the mail when getting his items restored
---
Was this an "error" or a way for a GM to make a player feel better for being hacked
---
As said, just roll another char and use each where appropriate.
---
Also, I never said that Vanilla has the "best" design. It doesn't matter. It's what it is, Classic is Vanilla, warts and all (as it should be). You'll have to live with the "bad" to enjoy the "good".
---
It was /stopcasting

You can absolutely kill KT in T2.5 gear. Its not easy but it is very much possible. World buff (buff really) being on a timer doesn't mean you can't get them (maybe you underestimate world first guilds but they will absolutely stand around for 8 hours waiting for that cooldown if they think they need it. The first guild to down KT probably won't do it with world buffs though, again you don't need them it just makes the fight easier and gives more room for errors. Flasks are laughably a non issue. 1 hour respawns on lotus are fine, you will almost certainly have a year or more to stock up for naxx and even if not with a sane population that's still plenty of lotus (up to almost 100 per day if picked nearly on cooldown ignoring the av lotuses entirely). And maybe you missed this but flasks last 2 hours and through death. You don't exactly fly through them.
---
Where does this idea that kt shouldn't be killable in 2.5 gear come from? Obviously most guilds will not be able to do it, but its not mathematically impossible or anything
---
I'm more hyped for Pantheon atm but it also has a much higher chance to let me down than Classic WoW will.
---
Yup. there I am downvoted. Still not gonna use /s when the sarcasm is completely over the top. :]
---
Oh yea that sense of accomplishment from killing the boss in the dungeon that everyone else does...
---
yea no.
---
You didn't need a bullshit tracker, since your gear and reputation was enough.
---
Was an HK 1 kill? I had the title of master sergeant back in the day but didn‚Äôt think I killed 10,000 horde. Maybe I did...
---
Is this public though? It's in a stage where they are preparing to *make* it public. It is public knowledge to access the data files and look at the numbers, but it is against Blizzard TOS to emulate it on an actual server.
---
There is a reason we can't download it yet and Blizzard has every right to enforce it.
---
Ah Twig of the World Tree.. a fellow man of culture I see
---
Steer clear of content creators claiming to be #nochanges but in reality have no clue as to what they‚Äôre talking about. He‚Äôs technically right on this though, auto loot was implemented in TBC, before that you could use shift to toggle auto loot.
---
Imagine thinking the game gets more fun when you lock out people from playing most of their class for no real reason. Like I said, it's objectively bad game design. The game is not more fun in any way when you get forced into some niche spec that doesnt work well for 90% of the game only because its the top performing raid spec.
---
I don't see any problem with autoloot. May be someone will find this function useful but I will still use shift+click.
---
people tested in the blizzcon demo and it did not work, it will almost 100% be fixed for release
---
No there was no change in TBC which is the point. Gold was easier to obtain but the respec cost was still capped at 50g.
---
This will be invaluable to many people, thanks for this my friend!!
---
You should check out Brave New World if you haven't yet. It's a huge mod for FF6 that improves just about every aspect of the game. But might want to wait for BNW 2.0 which should be releasing very soon.
---
Honestly I saw the some on my ‚Äúrecommended subreddit‚Äù section. Pure luck!
---
Amazing man, thank you so much

As a nightelf, trying to join my friends in stormwind, I thought I was on the right continent so I kept swimming and dying on the western shores of kalimdor.

I always wondered what MMORPG would come along and would kill WoW. Little did we know it was WoW all along.
---
Honestly. I still played retail until very recently and I've been playing on BC and WOTLK servers for the past 4-5 years and I can tell you  for a 100% fact that the private server population is much more casual than the retail players. Most of the people I meet are friendlier but there are also players that are wayyyyyyyy more toxic so it's a mix bag.
---
46 or 47? 2 million ep cap is at 47 i thought. A bit over 4 million ep is needet 1-60.
---
Why would you need rank 1 for all of those?
---
Usually it depends on what they want tested. Sometimes they give instant maxlevel, sometimes the leveling.
---
I know it might not be your cup of tea but I loved the cc I could do as a frost mage or flag running in wsg. I was able to kite and dip away from so many people. Just make sure not to blink when facing the flag before you pick it up or right before the door to the tunnel. Those are just death traps.
---
Someone should make a website of this with mouseover tooltips and ranks. Would be so useful!
---
Eh, FO4 was at least a reasonably entertaining shooter. D3 was a misdesigned pile of absolute garbage and greedy hubris that took a long time to even wrench into a playable shape, and never really became a game that had legitimate value. I don't think the two can be compared. D3 was such a deafening failure from the start while FO4 only really disappointed the hardcore Fallout veterans who expected more out of the story.
---
buy the books at 60 and they give you all previous ranks, saves some gold
---
THATS IT NOBODIES ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HURT SOMEONE ELSES FEELINGS. ALL FUN IS CANCELLED BECAUSE PEOPLE GET OFFENDED &gt;:(.

Or you could take some personal responsibility and not host something you don't want to get cheesed on in a pvp flagged area on a pvp server. Grieve privately if you don't want to hear other peoples opinions about it. These aren't real world events because they're hosted online mate sorry to say if you want to grieve do it somewhere privately or go see a therapist if it's affecting you that much. You do it online in a video you should expect shit people who play EvE understand that.
---
Honestly I question a lot of the streamers.  I watched the same thing last night and thought, ‚Äúwhat is he talking about, that auto loot box WAS in vanilla.‚Äù
---
But of course because he cant remember that it is controversial
---
I thought Beast Lore was a dps cooldown because it had a lot of text on the tooltip.
---
Ive been playing games since 1993, and nothing comes close to vanilla WoW.
---
Is that the GOG version ?
---
Tips knows shit he is just a huge crybaby wannabe hardcore
---
I would think that if they re-release expansions, they would stick to preserving each expansion as it was.
---
Your experience is wrong then.  Typically when people refer to summer they are refering to the season which is the astrological definition.  If I say "I am going to to Michigan in the summer" I mean the season of summer.  The season of summer is from the summer solstice and the fall equinox.  This is the last comment I have about this because it really is a dumb thing to talk about.  There is no argument about when summer is.  June 21st through September 23rd.  End of story.  If you think otherwise you are wrong.  Google "summer 2019" for your source.
---
Agreed, I was, barely old enough to drive for tbc, it was the first time I was brave enough to drive the 30 minutes in the dark and wait on the midnight release with the other 100 people at the gamestop. Did the same for wotlk. Now I can't think of many if any games I would do that for.
---
What is a tlas?
---
I was 9 and since im portuguese the only english i knew was pretty much the colors. I jumped into the game completely blind on my brothers computer while he going out with friends. I was unaware that tarren mill and spulcher existed so every day i logged in on my hs which was ghostlands atm (yes, it was bc) and i did my daily walk to hillsbrad to kill lions spiders and bears at the entrance of the zone, repeated everyday till the mobs gave no exp, moved my killing zone a bit further and only there i discovered tarren mill (im not sure i knew quests was the way to level so i think i skipped most them if not all), a couple more moments like this and i was lvl 64 with 66 days /played.
---
i dunno man my ex used to play on a private server beginning with F and we used to have every single little weird thing in common (like going to obscure black metal gigs) and tbh i much preferred gaming with friends.  girls generally seem to enjoy games in different ways
---
she wanted to dress up and make jokes in goldshire inn... i wanted to get to 60 and raid lol.  i was much happier playing with my old MMO buddies after i split with her than i would have been if i had played with her more
---
You are correct. Devine intervention...Man it‚Äôs been forever since I played this game.
---
My third most hyped game of all time. Nr. 1 was the third Zero Escape Game (complete disappointment) and Nr. 2 the thrid Dragon Age Game (complete disappointment as well).
---
At least I know that classic can't disappoint me.
---
Honestly the "legit" solo record would really depend a lot on the rest of the realm. If the closest to you is miles behind then there is no supporting crafting turnins such as the ones in badlands, hillsbrad, tanaris, un'goro etc, which in turn would have been an easy extra 70-90k of experience by simply just clicking a few buttons. We could likely in the end look at around 6-8 different records depending on context.
---
I just /played my dwarf priest and he is at 1 day 20 hours level 30 and I dont think I pushed it at all.  He has been my disenchanting alt for a while so sometimes I forget to log him in IF
---
Maybe for PVP? I have a hard time to think of use in PVE, maybe except for grinding? It's solely use is to save Mana.
---
Rank 1 Frostbolt to get a quick Slow on a target.
---
Rank 1 CoC to kite for cheap.
---
Rank 1 Fireball to get a fast dot on a target (vs rogues).
---
Rank 1 Arcane Explosion to pull rogues from stealth or in pve to try to get a clearcast proc.
---
Rank 1 Blizzard to get rogues and to get a Slows on your targets.
---
Rank 1 Fireblast to kill certain totems.
---
Basically any time a spell has a desireable effect that you need quick but the damage scales so bad or the manacosts are horendous so that you don't want to pay the full mana to do so.
---
I didn't know there were dungeons in the game until around level 30
---
Corrected to Devine intervention. Been a while since I played.
---
Halo 3 was for sure my most anticipated release, but WoW Classic is a solid 2nd place.
---
This sorta reminds me of a spot just south of Hillsbrad Foothill that had "Elites" but the didn't have the dragon border, so they were very misleading. I'm pretty sure they were updated with the proper elite border a while later.
---
I don't play a mage so these are just guesses:  
---
Frostbolt - Almost instant cast slow  
---
Fireball - All I can think of is fire reflector ? Or maybe fishing for impact stun  
---
Cone of Cold - Great for kiting when low on mana  
---
Arcane Explosion - Great for finding stealthed characters in melee range with minimum mana cost  
---
Blizzard - Same as above, only at range  
---
Fireblast - Reflector/impact fishing again ? This and fireball are the odd ones.
---
Land a good Counterspell, then Shatter combo and hope for a string of crits with Frostbolt, CoC, Fireblast and the kitchen sink. If you land one Frostbolt that crits and procs Frostbite, then immediately silence with Counterspell, then Frostbolt+CoC+FB and all crit, that should kill almost anybody. The odds aren't that low thanks to the +50% crit chance from Shatter.
---
The first level 60 in the world after release was Xenif (troll rogue) on Stormreaver. He got to level 60 roughly on December 3, 2004. So about 10 days after release.

Almost everybody knows of GM Island, but what about the (more interesting) developer island and programmer island.
---
Did you ever visit / have access to developer island or programmer island?
---
What was the reason they were left in the game files (until TBC, I think)?
---
Did you ever ban any players who teleported there?
---
Bought mine off of ebay for a few pounds 2 months ago. Dont know how this could still be that cheap sometimes. There are a few different editions tho
---
And records for classes, and duos üëç
---
A tough choice, but I'll probably go with when I finally got my epic mount. It took me a very long time since I was not particularly efficient at gathering gold and I was frequently trying out new specs in duels outside orgrimmar.
---
But it was an awesome feeling when finally got it. The feeling of satisfaction of reaching a goal you've worked towards which gives the reward impact and meaning, which is absent in current wow.
---
Aaaand this is why locks deserve that free level 40 mount!!
---
I'm not really sure how to phrase this question but what exactly was on your screen(s), typically, when you were doing your job?
---
I mean GMs seemed capable of such an incredible variety of things that I assume you weren't just operating inside a game client - did you have some additional software open? How did it work and what could you do? How could you just appear anywhere?
---
Or were all your in-game abilities just controlled by special abilities/macros on a hotbar or commands using "/?"

E.g. /teleport DumbPlayer ToRagnaros

Downloaded the classic versions last night to shake the dust off :)
---
&gt; It's probably my least popular opinion relating to WoW, but if anything I actually wish that Vanilla had done MORE to limit frequent spec changes. Make a system that allows people to experiment early on and make small, one-off changes, but prevents players from running multiple builds on the same character. It'd be interesting to see a world where even the hardcore crowd favoured generalist builds that could do reasonable well in all fields of play, rather than excelling in one and sucking at all the others.
---
This is not what would happen. You would have a small portion of people running raids with highly optimized builds, and have reroll used for farming / PVP /etc. Rest of people will be punished hard for m√πaking mistake with their talents.
---
I remember playing at WoW with TeamViewer. It was so freaking slow, but I managed to raise my Fishing skill significantly.
---
Dwarfs orcs and undeads
---
That's really interesting
---
Dwarf mage OP
---
I just saw the TV commercial and read the video game magazines on the magazine rack at the grocery store when my parents were buying groceries.
---
Respec is 100 gold, if you want to keep your optimized build for raiding. 100 gold is *atleast* 2 hours farming. I don't think a respec will make you win 2 hours in a dungeon, even if you run multiple dungeon in the night, i think you won't win 2 hours by running an optimal build rather than just play feral with restoration spec.
---
Undead for horde 100%
---
For alliance it depends on if you want the extra INT, if you do then go gnome (gross), if not then human is a great option too
---
Actually I don't know myself, but a mage main friend told me lol
---
absolutely.
---
Empire: Total War and Star Wars: The Old Republic would be up in the same ball park for me. 
---
I‚Äôm generally a strategy gamer, and have loved the Total War series since it‚Äôs beginning (played the board game Shogun 1 is based off before, too). And having the setting move to the age of muskets was exciting for me. Despite the buggy ness at launch, I was not disappointed. I still play that game multiple times in a year, that or Napoleon: Total War.
---
SWTOR.. I had been a huge Galaxies player/fan, until the NGE patch destroyed that game. And a big Star Wars fan since I was three. Having BioWare involved in a new Star Wars MMO was exciting. I pre-ordered, and prepaid for a years worth of game time, something I had NEVER done in a sub-based game before. I was that hyped and confident in SWTOR. Man was I disappointed. Think I stopped playing after 3-4 months, even though I had paid for it. I still log on now and again, since it is ftp. I never give them any money for anything in that game though. What a shit-show.
---
Classic WoW.. I may not prepay for a year sub, but if after a month or two it is as good as we all hope/expect, I probably will after that. Really can‚Äôt wait to play again. I try to get by with reading this sub and/or listening to some of the ambiance YouTube vids, but sometimes that just makes it worse. Looking forward to being a meat shield in some dungeon for you all.
---
Wat
---
uhhh....undead can't really throw any stones. (several of their quests related to perfecting the plague are undead only, mostly since they talked about...probably using it on their horde "allies" eventually in the quest text).
---
That'll be doable but really inefficient, probably on par with leveling a balance druid or elemental shaman. Arcane spells aren't particularly good for grinding and you definitely don't want to be wanding except to finish off runners. It's awkward to gear for as well since there's very little raw spell damage gear pre-60 and practically no arcane damage gear, whereas you can easily craft a bunch of frost damage stuff in your 30s and 40s.

If you leave a blank line between lines Reddit formats it's nicely :)

no. Neutral can do quests fine (they start neutral instead of friendly like the other horde do to each other). unfriendly is the one that prevents talking/questing.

I've seen sub 20 specs for Arcane but past that Frost and Fire pull ahead in terms of efficiency.
---
10 min CD.

True, but nelf are still the worst race for rogues on ally side from a min/max perspective. Humans are obviously Bis in pve and Dwarf/Gnome have both better racials for pvp. That said play what you want.
---
Name checks out.
---
Perception and the spirit boost aren‚Äôt bad, not as good as the gnome racials sure, but they‚Äôre a solid alternative if you don‚Äôt wanna play gnome
---
Weird, i see them on mobile but not pc. My bad, I guess res is messing with it.

It might be the halfway point for total XP but by no means is the half way point of /played

Cant wait for your next video! Can you talk about druid dueling/wpvp sometime too? Thank you!
---
Really? I don‚Äôt remember ultra detail grass, water, reflections, ultrawide support, terrain distance, etc. options being in the game in 2005. Do you? Have you seen the screen shots from the client data mining that shows these new options?
---
Of all time? Probably not. That goes to Smash Bros Melee but I'm more hype for Classic than any other Current AAA release. I was fairly Hype for Diablo 3 but then that turned out how it did and my collective Hype levels have gotten far more pessimistic.
---
Arcane missiles is very expensive spell. As a mage you can't afford to stand and get hit usually anyway. Wand usage is only for when mob is low on health and you don't want to cast a spell, so improved wand is never taken.
---
If you don't want frost leveling, you can level as fire. It is only slightly worse, especially if you are not on PVP server. You are more squishy and you can not AOE farm, but single target killing speed is decent.
---
Lmfao nice graph I'm about to resub to probably for the longest period since wrath of lichen king!
---
Our power has doubled since the last time I checked
---
Dying fifty times on a raid boss because one or two party members doesn't do their job is not a waste of time then?
---
Mage is way better in PvP against melee. Warlock may have an edge against other casters but is a sitting duck against melee, having no escape mechanisms whatsoever and only trinket to get out of CC. Mage is stronger in premades as well due to Polymorph and Blizzard. Warlock is so vulnerable to warriors and rogues that it can be really frustrating to play, way more vulnerable than mages are against its bad matchups (warlock, shadow priest).
---
This is wrong. AM can proc clear casting only on spell cast not on ticks of spell. You can not wand and cast spells at the same time so wands usually suck.
---
Lollllllllll
---
I was a rank 14 rogue, raided up to early Naxx with late AQ40 gear. I never completed Onyxia pre-q. I literally swapped my Ghostshroud from BRD to AQ40 twin emperors t 2.5 helmet. I always pretended I have some important business to attend when guild was going to raid Onyxia.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure mid July

That's exactly what I'm doing :P
---
Yeah I watched the videos of Xrewz (gnome mage) of that launch, he was ahead of everyone until he logged out at ~16 or so.
---
I'm mostly interested in AoE Leveling as mage, so I'm looking for the fastest ways to get to the 21/22 when Blizzard comes "online".
---
My first character was an Orc Hunter. I made it to Razor Hill and began questing with an Undead. We finished a few quests and the Undead decided it was time to go to Crossroads. I was scared to follow him to Crossroads because I still had quests in Durotar and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find my way back if I went to Crossroads (didn't know there was a map).
---
Also, during the quest in Durotar where you grab Gnomish tools from the shipwreck to the east of Razor Hill I hadn't learned yet that right clicking allowed you to swim down. Instead, I was able to use the angle of some of the boats to push myself down in the water just far enough to reach the items. 
---
I truly miss the constant discoveries and wonder that world brought me.

I made it too early 50s.
---
Likely starting as a dwarf, but really want the NE mount, so I was thinking of running over there to get all the quests in from the start. My guess is that it‚Äôll also be the least populated area at launch, so it could work out. Have you tried that approach at all?
---
All else being equal, you really aren‚Äôt going to.

What? I have always played on PvP server

You make it sound like you have no other choices but being ganked over and over again.

Ah yes the memory of spending... 40$ dollars on a game that you have already been paying for months to play all so you can lose your progress at a cost to you!

Whew... Memories.... Hate 'em.

That's the thing though, it's said it made the mob crit you without proccing things like reckoning in actual vanilla. It's probably hard to implement o' private servers but this has been well documented.

---
I give you an overlook what WoW is all about and vastly more popular than other games.
---
SW:TOR: is a theme park MMO. Everything is highly choreographed, the Stories are heavily scripted, you have no freedom, the social interaction are very limited, but in my opinion SW:TOR has an absolutely fantastic combat system. Super enjoyable PvP.  Very enjoyable Story-lines. You really don't have one huge open world, players are much more all over the galaxy, there is no need for a lot of interactions between players.
---
SW:TOR is so much fun while leveling, but as a KOTOR fan you rather have had KOTOR3 experience as a Singleplayer game. 
---
(Keep in mind, I played the beginning of the launch many years ago.)
---
Classic WoW: is in my opinion the best of both worlds. Something between a Sandbox and a Theme-Park Type of MMO. It's not yet highly choreographed in terms of game play like the newer MMOs. So if you read everything, you get a nice Storylines, but you can also ignore this aspect. It has a much more enjoyable combat, but not yet as fast paced and still a little clunky than modern MMOs, the hole thing is slower. Which I think is not that exhausting after a long day of work.
---
Where WoW Classic shines is the mixture of Social interactions and PvE/PvP content. You can do much more PvP and PvE content wise, than a Sandbox MMO, or at least like in Ultima Online, where you don't have something like Tier Sets or PvP Ranks. But in order to achieve something, you are heavily reliant on the social aspect. Example: A Tank Warrior, will never get the Legendary Tank Weapon in the game, if 39 people don't want him to have it. While in SW:TOR, at least at the beginning, I might as well have done the content solo. Which I did a lot of times.
---
Between games like Ultima Online, which I played for 4 years, SW:TOR which I highly enjoyed while leveling my Imperial Agent and Classic WoW, which I also played from Beta to TBC release. I would favor WoW Classic, because is just a nice mixture of both types of MMO-Styles.
---
That is why Blizzard was so good back in the day, they stole concepts and gameplay designs from other games and elevated it to a much more balanced and nice product.
---
Not really understanding this. As it pertains to testing/datamining MMO-C and Wowhead have both used their own emulated servers for years.
---
No achievements.  The thing about vanilla wow is that you wore or rode your achievements!  Epic gear was not easy to attain (legendary gear was even more rare).  Coming across someone with even just one epic item meant that they were most likely doing content that most of the server wasn't doing.  I remember sitting in IF as a human on a nightsaber mount in 3 or 4 pieces of arcanist and constantly getting messages from people on how I got the mount or where I got the gear.  Those were great days.
---
We used to say it as a joke in the past that the only thing that can kill wow, is wow, yet, here we are!
---
Aside from the fact the wow before classic killed itself as well.
---
How are you playing this?
---
Sweet video dude. Could you make one on your experience at lvl 60 as a Druid?
---
No lol. I know the racial bonus is 25%, this guy wasn‚Äôt orc for one, I‚Äôve also literally seen the hack and it exists. But he was absolutely using it. Bubba‚Äôs warcraft hack is what is was called I just remembered. Look it up I think you can still use it if you set up your own server to play on. You can also make yourself unable to be slowed.
---
No. I love them but they don't belong in classic. Especially not the ones that have anything to do with raid or dungeon progress.
---
I have less of an attachment to classic graphics than I do to the mechanics of classes, quests, raids, etc. The Vanilla experience wasn‚Äôt about graphics, it was about the gameplay (classes, quests, etc), the community, the restrictions to transfers and shit. Saying graphics makes the experience is like saying you need Mountain Dew to re-release the blue and red flavors in order to bring back Classic.
---
Interesting, so it was the Reddit algorithm that bought you here
---
Old build yes, but new detection methods. They will use the same system as retail I imagine
---
Do you want to explain the route? Would love to go westfall for dm and wand. But I thought dun morogh, westfall redridge was pretty fast to lvl 20
---
I envy how organized your bags are. My bags back in Vanilla were nowhere near as nice...
---
They will give beta keys to everyone with a battlenet account and have booked "World of Warcraft beta".
---
Go to r/buildmeapc  and r/BuildAPCSales  and ask there for better recommendations tbh. The second link is for cheap parts.
---
Hell the fuck no
---
I was at a LAN party playing my first ever character, sitting next to a friend who had been playing the game for half a year, already at level 60. I was playing a night elf rogue, running Deadmines by following his instructions on how to join a group. After the first boss, this mysterious item showed up on screen, with 3 buttons to click. Need, greed or pass. I had no idea what either button meant, so I just pressed **need**. The item was a two-handed axe. The party immediately started flaming me and proceeded to kick me out of the group, meanwhile my friend next to me is laughing his ass off while I'm desperately trying to mend my reputation with the group, not having any idea what I've just done. In about ten minutes, I had learned the hard way what the concept of group loot is.
---
Are there any good specs for this you could link? Or guides?
---
If I could roll a dwarf mage I might actually play Alliance.
---
Female Troll. God almighty the walk animation.... 
---
I want to kill it with fire.

Get over it, crybaby. Pay to play the game or not.

Since they are using the modern client they'll be using the modern anti-cheat.

You think a bunch of plebs like us  know anything about WoW's anti cheat? 
---
I do know Honor Buddy gave up and shut down, so I'd wager it's pretty damn good these days.
---
Grim - Total Annihilation has to be mentioned. Such an awesome open world pvp video, probably my favorite of all. Remember seeing it and instantly rerolling an Ud Rogue. Good Times.
---
the goblins weren't involved at that point i guess
---
Yes hunter are a bit slow until 10, but druids are even worse !
---
I didn't try levelling any other classes in Mulgore, so I don't know if quests are inefficient or if it's just low lvl druids. Once you get bear form at lvl 10-12 it feels much better.
---
IMO druids are like rogues : you start to see some potential at lvl 20, and then at 30 it really shines.
---
Honestly no, I'll admit I was looking forward to Star Wars the Old Republic far more. I had quit my (retail) job for it, took 3 months off of school with saved money, and grinded my heart away before I realized I'd been duped with a great story but poor combat system.  
---
That being said, I am really looking forward to Classic coming out, I just also know what to expect from it which removes some of the mystery.
---
Clear cast can proc anytime your spell deals damage, means every tick has a chance.
---
&gt; THATS IT NOBODIES ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HURT SOMEONE ELSES FEELINGS. ALL FUN IS CANCELLED BECAUSE PEOPLE GET OFFENDED &gt;:(.
---
Cheap and obvrious strawman. 
---
Comparing mourning a dead frind to just "people get offended"... what the hell. Just as I said, Classic WoW or at least this sub really seems to draw out the edgelords...
---
&gt; Or you could take some personal responsibility and not host something you don't want to get cheesed on in a pvp flagged area on a pvp server. Grieve privately if you don't want to hear other peoples opinions about it. These aren't real world events because they're hosted online mate sorry to say if you want to grieve do it somewhere privately or go see a therapist if it's affecting you that much. You do it online in a video you should expect shit, people who play EvE understand that.
---
Sure, because showing only a most basic form of empathy is way too much to ask for, right?  Just refraining from PvPing in a only a small and very specific area for a just a very limited amount of time, is it that hard? "BUT MUH PVP SERVER RULES" yeah guess what, basic human decency beats PvP server rules. 
---
And people coping with their grief is very real, the fact that they're using an online game as a mere tool to express their grief together doesn't make it any less real. It's about the bereaved sitting in front of their computers trying to find a way to cope and it's not your or anyone else's place to judge them and shit on them for it.
---
Probably more fun to pick the race you think is coolest, or has the animations you think look the best.
---
What the fuck
---
I did that to think it was fun to Raid with the up and coming low noobie.
---
Thumb erection
---
I think I read somewhere here that for someone that knows what's he's doing lvl 30 should be something like 24h /played.
---
Yeah, who knew you could find that with google?
---
The McDonald's meme
---
Or you could conjure ol√© sport some refreshments.
---
I like this one because it's in keeping with the spirit of vanilla.  This is stuff many of us did, you wanted to use maces so you did.  That was the game back then.
---
Says 1 hour in vanilla database
---
Original DOS version of BNE, running in Dosbox.
---
If you dont already have Dosbox and an old CD version of the game, just buy the GoG Release.
---
I don't get it...
---
I mean you're a prime example of people who don't know how to separate real world events from gaming ones, I don't even need to make my argument further.
---
Do you have any recommendations for avoiding bottlenecks while leveling? Both from large amounts of people trying to access spawned items on timers as well as quests with shitty drop rates for required items?
---
It isn't going to be like that in vanilla. Bad tooltip wording most likely, AM has 1 chance to proc it, and aoe spells that hit 10 mobs have 1 singular 10% chance to proc it.
---
If you consider clear casting at its height of efficiency it will be maybe 20% increased mana, you spend a small amount on scorch and dump the clear cast into an AM. The problem is compare that to frost channeling which is a guaranteed 15% mana cost off every single highly efficient frostbolt.
---
Not choosing Greed over Need, because I didn't want to be a Greedy person.
---
I guess it was an hour back then....I know it was some time between pulls due to some people going AFK.
---
We should but it's too hard for blizzard to change talents.
---
I didn't think of our poor tauren friends. However I never liked mounted tauren (I think if I see a tauren on a skeletal horse I will have PTSD for life), I always thought blizzard should have improved "plains running" or whatever was the name of the tauren spell in vanilla beta.
---
That's a shame! That completely removes some of the weird builds from the equation, like holy reckoning for PVP. Makes me sad.
---
I'm interested as well, if you don't mind !
---
It‚Äôs not blizzlike without GM Bekyn and Zarborough.
---
Damn. That completely removes some of the possible builds from the equation.
---
Pick what you like. Make sure it fits your playstyle. If you want an extra trinket, go undead or gnome. If you prefer the extra intellect, go gnome. If you prefer having better rep gains and some occasional stealth countering, go human.
---
Sounds made up but thats maybe just me
---
Is reddit becoming a meme concentrated posts only? One can't say anything without anyone meming?
---
In a game like wow they do. Achievements are a method people use to gauge skill and it‚Äôs a reward system. 
---
Vanilla stand alone from other iterations of wow in how there isn‚Äôt aotc, .io, ilvl to separate people‚Äîyou have to know them, or their guild. Vanillas steward system was playing the game‚Äîyou got rarer and more powerful items the more you played. Achievements satisfy the reward idea with no gameplay value. You want people motivated by gameplay not a achievement point number. Imo
---
mages can literally break the game pve wise. they are monsters at controlling 100 mobs at once. they are the best gold makers and they make free food and water. vanilla has TONS of travling time across the world, guess what, you get portals to all the cities. freaking god's. all this being said I really want a mage but i'm going warlock because death coil+ seduce+ felhunter cleanse+  bad ass score in AV with crits and shadowburn kill steals.
---
Deep wounds and ms eat debuffsluts
---
So most likely no , no you won‚Äôt 
---
But maybe ? Idk
---
its doable, the dps is lower outside of early 60 (it's good there because you don't need as much hit when hit is rare)
---
Horde side you still go fury and use bloodthirst, ww and in between you spam hamstring ( only if you have wf totem obviously)
---
 imp cleave is bad, imp slam is good but hs spamming is better
---
Fuck no
---
Doing one Strat baron every day for a year is even possible for a dedicated casual.
---
In 365 times, you should see it at least once or twice.
---
Now you just have to get lucky with rolls, or be rich enough to buy the rolls of your group !
---
As horde, 50G would ensure I wouldn't roll on it, but if I was alliance I don't think I would take gold instead of the horse.
---
At the store
---
You: Can we have ice cream?
---
Mom: No, we have ice cream at home.
---
When you get home -&gt; off-brand ice cream with the flavour you just hate
---
Believe what you want to. This is also a story from ~14 years ago, so I only remember so much.
---
Lol I do the same thing, classic &gt; all
---
Funny, I spoke to Blizzard support earlier today about my account. It was banned in 2013 after I had stopped playing and it was subsequently used for gold farming. (They sent me a mail about it but Cata put me off WoW completely so I ignored it.)
---
They restored my account including all the characters, talk about trip down memory lane.
---
Very true lmao
---
.. still don‚Äôt get it
---
heh, I believe they restricted it because they probably intended to update the graphic of the quest item to actual totems which were suppose to be the Tauren racial weapon instead of the staff graphic they stuck with.
---
It‚Äôs been this way since what 2013-2014? 
---
I remember back in the days when the memes were f7u12 and advice dogs and the rest of the site linked to actual content.
---
The juice is flowing.
---
A serious guild is gonna tell you to spec Fury. 
---
A casual guild is not gonna care i belive.
---
All depends what kind of guild you are looking for.
---
Even playing casual you should get T2 eventually and then I would personally see, if you have time to go to AQ40 and Naxx.
---
It's hard to say how much time investment we are talking about, without knowing the Class. A Rogues can have 200 Buffs, but Healers are actually really Buff friendly, with not a lot of effort.
---
If you play casual, you will need a lot of time, because you are stuck in a hamster wheel of raiding. Equipping people and seeing them getting poached by other Raids who progressed further than you.
---
Super Hardcore, means that you also need to be fully buffed, with Worlds buffs and everything, but once a Raid is on farm, you will just do speed runs. So it's a lot of effort in the beginning and after that you just run it down.
---
What I prefer is Semi-Progress; where people are buffed, where you don't loose members left and right to poaching (can still happen though), but you are not buffed to the limit. Because back in the day, even in Naxx, we were NEVER buffed to the limit. 
---
That's what P-Server Community loves to do though.
---
Pick your poison, T2 is possible with anything.
---
I had a rival back in the day.
---
I was a horde rogue in full blues and really, really shitty internet (600ms and above).
---
An alliance rogue with full tier 2 would sometimes go to org and gank people. I caught wind of this one day and jumped in to help. 
---
I caught him at the cleft of shadows. Sap, cheap shot, they trinket, I quickly blind. Restealth, cheap shot, bs, kidney, rupture, vanish. From there it's history. Felt good man.
---
:)
---
This made me curious... Are there any Classic resources online nowadays, or ones that are planned?
---
That dude must of been rich as hell
---
None since I was forced to play with a asshole friend

&gt;Also i walked with my warlock up to level 50.
---
ho lee shit.  As in the walk animation that makes you walk super slow?
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was an auto-run until level 35.....
---
I don't think this is a low effort but okay..
---
Somone draw up some hentai for this one
---
Fat chance, beta is for a limited amount of people, not the entire playerbase.
---
Lmao
---
No new models, they're ugly and dont fit in classic
---
It does, sadly for paladin. I would recommend looking into a holy shock spec, the build has been theorized ok here and it looks fun.
---
On a side note, that's also why nobody should level fury on actual classic.
---
Plenty of classic creators don't play private anymore. Tips, Esfand, Staysafe. They'll surely give keys to the big name streamers like Asmongold, T&amp;E, Towelliee, Rich, Hotted, etc. as well.
---
Any eurobeat mix, or the chillest raps in existence.
---
Black Holes and Revelations by Muse and Sound of Revenge by Chamillionaire were on heavy rotation by me during mid-late Vanilla.
---
I played through Sunwell to Cata with Alexandros Mograine model wielding Ashbringer even though I was an undead warrior.
---
Welcome to the last 1.5 years for me. I am amazed I've managed to still do my job well.
---
I think the real problem started many years ago...
---
You'll still be playing primarily as fury but with a 2h and a slightly different spec to support the 2h over DW.
---
Must have
---
The only people who would be willing to spend 1k on the gloves are the ones who are trying to clear cthun/naxx. They are completely unneeded for anything outside of bleeding edge progression guilds
---
Yeah I was an altoholic back then but I never got a druid past 10 I think. It just feels so bad compared to other classes.
---
It's a meme relating to that time in life where you'd be out with your mum shopping. You'd ask for a magazine/toy/snack and she'd reply "no we have &lt;item&gt; at home" not realising or not caring that it wasn't the same as what you wanted.
---
Oh yes, I remember him now. He logged at 16. He was doing a pretty cool job before then!
---
You are not alone. Time to start a CWA group.
---
Many people are not gonna get this one lol. I'd say the Blizzard part is a bit missused in the meme though. Should've used the regular 'mom' here :p
---
Back when hybrid actually meant hybrid
---
If you run 2handed fury you'll be fine deep wounds is the lowest debuff priority and will get shoved off by all the other debuffs. So especially as horde you get wind fury and you will be able to pull really good numbers.
---
This guy gave you 2 great lessons :
---
\- the importance of managing your money
---
\- generosity
---
This is why I can't agree with people (usually griefers) on this sub that tell me that IG actions don't have influence IRL.
---
Great guy, he probably played a dwarf (money) paladin (generosity) :o
---
For me, I solve that problem by playing a druid, so I can switch classes without switching classes.
---
Vanilla raiding isn't as intense as retail, especially hpriest. You won't be spamming heals but rather casting them smartly, at the right time
---
Read my comment but deepwounds is lowest debuff prio it gets knocked off by basically anything.
---
I always start in the Nelf zone. You're right - it is lower populated so it would be worth you while doing those quests while it's level appropriate. I don't normally think about rep, but I believe that rep rewards are reduced when the quests go grey.
---
I mean maybe a bit misused but in the general context of people for years asking for Vanilla WoW and Blizzard going "but we've got &lt;current expansion&gt; wow right here!"
---
Never say the release date's name in vain.
---
I know that as loot strikes. Was very popular during wotlk when pugging raids became a viable method to do content.
---
We almost always remove posts that only relate to WoW via the post's title. Sorry I didn't add that to the removal reason, but that was the reason.
---
Moar Onyxia hide bags!
---
Yeah, that one can be nice
---
I agree with the comments that it depends on your class, but if you're looking for a general pace you can always estimate your number of kills per minute, and use that for a target. This is pure grinding - so things that will slow you down are travel\training skills\dungeons\anything else, and things that will speed you up are questing efficiently on top of grinding.

Times are in hours, so for example level 30 in a day is well within reason if you can average between 2-3 kills\minute (20 - 31 hours)
---
lose your progress lol, no continue the journey
---
We're 10 over a decade older now so make that two weeks of sleep :p
---
Somewhat similar, not vanilla but in BC I wanted my epic flying mount badly. Spent all day farming clefthoof leather to sell on the AH, fetched good prices on my server. Made good progress, a few hundred gold for a few hours work. It was never quick enough imo.
---
Met a guy who was loaded (20k or something) and he lended me ~1000g. I bought the mount. I spent the rest of that day farming again to pay him back. Epic flying was a game changer, I was able to farm atleast twice as quick. I was able to pay him back the same day. He couldn't believe that 1) I paid him back, 2) I paid him back the same day. It was the last time I farmed so much in a single day. I hated owing people money, it was theirs. Even IRL I don't have any debt.
---
Im not certain but I vaguely remember a mod that allowed you to toggle auto loot.  It was so popular it was just integrated.
---
Alright :) np
---
Disturbed, and some linkin Park. System of a down works as well.
---
Perfect, thank you. Was planning to get this done during Easter, since the vanilla wow wiki was lacking this. Now I can focus on other theory crafting.
---
Happy Easter bunny delight!
---
Deep wounds will get ousted by other debuffs so you can take it for raids.
---
MS is not good outside PVP and levelling, you still go fury for 2h raiding.
---
Arguably the Stam is more important than crit considering the loss of Ice Barrier and the fact Shatter applies to fire spells aswell, at least in my opinion. Your point is very true though, Frost can get away with much, much worse gear.
---
Like many, WoW vanilla was the exciting new game back then but you really didnt know what it was gonna be playing it.
---
So when TBC came thats where you were extra hyped i think.
---
Soon^TM
---
I had been wondering this too, I made a special point of getting the Carved Ogre Idol, because at that point items that offered a unique illusion was always something I loved in EQ. I wouldn't be opposed to these coming back in some type of non-cash shop form. I'm not sure what I would propose exactly though.
---
this. Versatility is everything. At naxx all the bear cat and resto and balance gear sets ur a god.
---
While leveling and farming for my pre BiS It was mostly Thrice (The illusion of safety and Artist in the ambulance) and crisis by Alexisonfire. Ever since I've let this sub take over my life I have reverted back as if nothing has changed the nostalgia is real.
---
One motivation for leveling is experiencing more of what your class has to offer. At level 10, theres so little to do. Higher levels means more skills and talents and dungeon challenges. More depth into each character.
---
I was really young so I just had my own guild with a couple friends named Usop's Pirate Gang
---
Time investment. 
---
Been playing my mage since start of tbc, and some times I think of switching main. But, then I remember why I started playing it in the first place, and all the time I have invested into that character, so I stick with it.
---
True that we know a lot more about how vanilla will work. But Wildstar had developer pedigree, financial backing, and came during a time when there was a much bigger thirst for a Wow competitor, so I remember a big leadup.
---
I was 7 when Classic came out. Also French Canadian. Fun times that's for sure.
---
I didn‚Äôt really know anything about Tips until he started posting Classic WoW content, but it seems like a lot of his contention is that by using the 1.12 build Blizzard is going to not present an authentic experience of the Vanilla experience at the launch of classic.
---
He has been pushing for things like progressive itemization and the removal of convenience features that came in at 1.12 and earlier update patches.
---
It‚Äôs not really realistic for Blizzard to re-insert problems in to Classic just to make it more closely resemble 1.0.
---
There is a exact same remake of this on WC 3, it is  awesome and you will love the old remade models in 3D. 
---
It's wonderful.
---
From this info we can set the lower bound of the number of players in classic to 70k!
---
The upper bound is set to 150M, the total number of Bnet Accounts. 
---
I feel 95% confident in this 70k-150M range!
---
Nice vid, really opened my eyes on some things I hadn't considered. It's good to see someone pushing the limits of what Druids can do.
---
It does take a lot of practice to do some of this stuff. Most people who want to AoE farm will just go Mage, since is is much more straightforward.
---
Considering we raid naxx with a bear tank and very effectively this argument is invalid
---
No. I was buying my spells too quickly since my friend gave me some gold, so i didn't realise i had a mount in spell book all the time. It was up untill some random group in zul farak asked me after we wiped why do i run all the way to stairs boss. Then i had noob moment while they explained to me to open my spell book find a horsehoe icon spell named felsteed
---
Iirc you‚Äôre right. Mindflay worked the same way, you can only proc blackout from the initial cast, notcthe ensuing damage ticks.
---
I solve it by playing two characters at a time. Switch back and forth.
---
Name one comment in this thread that is hating on druids.
---
So it's confirmed, there was at least one guy playing a troll rogue in Vanilla ? :D
---
Each quest has a certain XP value and you need to decide when it's not worth the waiting time.
---
For example, at level 20 you may normally expect to do 20k XP/hr.
---
A quest that gives you 1000XP therefore only deserves 3 minutes of your time outside of whatever you're collecting or killing for XP.
---
If you're likely to wait half an hour for the item to spawn, then you're better off grinding somewhere for that half hour at 14 or 15k XP/hr.
---
The only exception is when that quest grants you access to a quest chain, but again you spitball how much XP is involved and whether waiting half an hour is going to net you a nice XP windfall later on.
---
This is where your experience with the quests you are doing on your route come into play. Realistically at launch, if you are pretty competitive only the quests between 1-20 are going to be much of an issue. Focus on those and know your chains and rough XP, and make a judgement call as you go.
---
You should have pushed it to lvl 30, they're really good then.
---
CRAWLING IN MY.. DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS. 
---
every pvp video ever.
---
I didn't remember to take my warrior to train until level 22...and that is only because i was getting my but whooped.
---
Blizzard has had a presence here and they probably dont want to nuke that.  Dont bite the hand that feeds (us some info here and there)
---
For me, although there were tens of thousands in circulation, the path of cenarion for my druid made healing so much better.
---
Altitis, or altoholic. I know it well. Embrace it.
---
This so much, in original vanilla i had this problem too so i tried every class and finally after getting bored of the starting are quests i sticked with warrior (main), warlock, priest, paladin and shaman.
---
There's still some hope, but given that the devs seemed pretty clear on selecting 1.12 values to avoid bugs, and that Classic is being built on a more advanced base, there's definitely a risk it won't exist. Definitely one for beta testing!
---
Also you can turn into the hidden seal class for extra value.
---
The Reddit Way^^TM
---
What‚Äôs your other choices?
---
No problem I'll post it here
---
They literally said that they chose the modern client in part because of the anti-cheat tech
---
level 10?...
---
Or just do it at 22.
---
I tried it when it first came out, and it was ugly as all hell. I much prefer to play the originals if I can get them working.
---
Whats the requirement for the Alliance/Horde pvp mounts?  When i started in Wrath it was 2k honor for each i believe...is it the same in Vanilla?
---
Will keep an eye on it, thanks. If it doesn't work ret will be the way to go for leveling, and not sure about pvp specs.
---
Sadly I think you're right that people would have just made alts for different purposes. It would likely still have some effect simply because there are useful synergies between raiding and PvP (gear is good for all avenues, regardless of source), and on PvP servers you don't really get a say in whether or not you get into PvP.
---
It's easy to make a system that doesn't punish a occasional spec changes or making small mistakes though. A really simple example would be "Base cost 1g. Every time you respec, respec cost is doubled. Every two weeks that you DON'T respec, respec cost is halved." Suddenly, occasional spec changes are super affordable, but any kind of plan that relies on respeccing more than once every two weeks will literally become expontentially more expensive over time.
---
And the goal isn't to prevent minmaxing. The goal is to shift the meta and make playstyle flexibility a more desirable trait to minmax. I'm confident this could be done, but the game would need to be designed around this principle, and WoW is not that game.
---
I had an add-on that toggled autoloot for me like who cares lol.
---
The reason they can do it is because they pre shield and have a shadow resist buff. The mobs deal shadow damage there with their melee attacks.
---
Any tips for a dwarf priest? I assume conserving Mana with spirit tap and wand spec is going to be decent for leveling
---
I played mostly Smite Priest in PvP in Vanilla, but I also did healing as well if the premade asked for it. Priests do fairly well in the right hands. You need some gear though in order to start taking hits because starting off in just greens and blues you're going to go smashed pretty hard due to having low armor. Once you get like T2+ and/or PvP rank gear you become a lot tankier.
---
The thing is that with BGs. Positioning is just as important as it was in arena. You have to keep yourself at a distance and behind the front lines so if anyone wanted to rush you... your team mates could support you.
---
What makes you stick with mage over other classes?
---
I don't have a lot of free time to waste but I would be super disappointed inf they added AoE loot. Quite apart from the effects on the economy, it would speed up the slower pace of Vanilla and is one of many conveniences that creates a less interactive world. I think an important element of Vanilla's immersion was the more menial tasks that newer xpacs streamlined away.
---
I don't have much experience with mages (I just had an alt, fire spec, enjoyed it very much), but instead of arcane why not fire ?
---
Back in Vanilla they all levelled as fire and you can't imagine the amount of bitching on the guild chat when they had to spec frost for MC !!!
---
Apparently you do more damage as fire specced but you're less mana efficient than frost so time to kill is supposed to be equivalent.
---
Get a healer, warrior, and some dps at lvl1 and go kill boars till 10. Sorry, but it works lol
---
When I reached level 40, i was missing 52gold to buy the mount.  
---
3 guys in my guild made me a loan (40g for the bigger one).  
---
I used to continue leveling to pay them back. Ironically, I successfully paid my debt of 52g at level 52. About 2 month after hitting 40.
---
Warrior SMASH!  Or BLOCK!
---
Ordered one from Amazon for 13 EUR - price wit delivery. Some kind of updated version though.
---
Self discipline
---
auto loot would make rogue pickpocket broken
---
After playing WoW since 2005 I have never touched a Warcraft game. I started with Blizz with Starcraft 1 and diablo 2 originally and to finally have Warcraft 1 and 2 as well as original 3 from buying reforged (which you can do now) I‚Äôm honestly so happy
---
Nice to see your name pop up on my home feed Soupa!
---
You basically do the first round of quests in Loch until 13 and then make your way to westfall and do most of the available quests there then head back to Loch till 18 and then Darkshore
---
- No. Blinking forward is basically done only across nearly perfect terrain. Gaps/logs/rocks/ledge would make you just blink in place. 
---
- No. If you made it to the other side of the gap and were in mid-air above it then Blink would function, but if you click it in mid-air high above nothing you'll just blink in place. 
---
- Yes.
---
I was in the low 40‚Äôs on my first toon, a paladin, questing in Tanaris. I had my sword and board, whacking away at something with white damage. For minutes. Heal up, on to the next. For minutes. Each. Mob.
---
So I guess the noob moments came before that, and that moment was just the realization of the noobness which came before - no, I should not, in fact, solo quest as a prot spec paladin with sword and board and ‚Äòsave my spells/mana‚Äô for that big fight. That is not how this game is played.
---
I already explained why it's a real life issue that's concerned here, and you failed to present even one argument against it except "THERE'S AN ONLINE GAME INVOLVED, IT'S NOT REAL", which I already countered several times. 
---
You not understanding that is certainly not my problem, and this post here is certainly one of the more pathetic escapes from situations when running out of arguments that I've seen. :)
---
Nobody has actually died from lack of sleep (they've died of other pre-existing health issues that a lack of sleep has exacerbated though). I myself plan on doing a 72 hour marathon at launch and I've done these sessions 3 previous times during Diablo 2 ladder resets. With some pre-planning extended marathons aren't actually that bad!
---
i‚Äôm 22. this gives me hope!
---
How big of an issue is gold when speedlevelling, is hitting 40 without enough for a mount a concern? And do characters get gimped for end game in anyway by speedlevelling and presumably less gold gathered?
---
I was actually thinking about getting the GOG version yesterday.
---
It's an entirely new build. Classic runs on the same client as retail (with the appropriate changes of course).
---
The main reason for it taking this long is because they couldn't just re-release the 2006 1.12.1 build and call it a day. :)
---
If you are interested, read things here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
People who are seriously raiding won't change a bit of their optimized raiding builds. When you're playing 7-8h a day with the single goal to be the first guild of your server, you don't take the freedom of changing your spec just for PVP. You level alt, who will be used for PVP and farming, and keep your main in city / raid spot.   
---
&gt; And the goal isn't to prevent minmaxing. The goal is to shift the meta and make playstyle flexibility a more desirable trait to minmax. I'm confident this could be done, but the game would need to be designed around this principle, and WoW is not that game.  
---
if there's people who are pumping most of their playtime in a comptitive aspect of a game, they will optimize the shit about this single task. If you want to force people to have flexible playstyle, you have to prevent them to make reroll completly, and force them to do multiple things to progress in competitive aspect (For example, you can have some raid boss locked behind a PVP lock, etc ... )
---
I used to be like this in TBC - Cata. Then it got to the point where I tried everything to some degree, was satisfied with the extend that I played each of them, and then chose the class I liked the most which was warlock.
---
Sticking with warlock in classic and assuming this knowledge is retroactive. Doubly so because I actually like the soulshard mechanics and would mess around with hunters on private servers so I'm no stranger to having 1 of my 5 bags being dedicated to class resource items.
---
I also like the fantasy of being a damage dealing "support" caster in the early phases of classic while slowly turning into a DPS powerhouse in the late stages of classic.
---
AoE dot farming and harassing the other faction with fears is pretty appealing too.
---
After launch it could easily be factors larger than that depending on r/wow‚Äôs course of action. Knowing both mod teams a bit they will probably give each other a hand wherever they can.
---
It easily might. But *will it retain* those players and if so how well and for how long?
---
It fits my playstyle out of all the classes. And I just think they‚Äôre cool overall.
---
The idea is that a quick /duel, sheep and auto-attack, followed by a /forfeit would be a lot faster than sitting down and eating.
---
Yep definitely confusing it with AoE loot... a lot of people do, which doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me. 
---
Got lambasted here once for discussing pros and cons of an auto loot toggle... people thought I meant AoE lot which I didn‚Äôt even realize was a thing.
---
How do u shatter combo without water ele nova?
---
You are technically correct. *The best kind of correct*!
---
First to 60 warrior on SWC's launch, agree completely.
---
I feel bad after I log out and forgot to conjure them refreshments after doing those all day
---
Don't touch tombs! :D A lot of much more stronger mobs will respawn, compare to those who will spawn when attack boss :)
---
Yes. I have dreamed about this since the end of TBC and never thought it would happen.
---
Private servers popped up that I've tried but there was always something off.
---
Still give this a listen when im feeling nostalgic. Imo Rapwing Lair is the best WoW inspired song to come out of Vanilla!
---
Other honorable mentions are The Priest Song and Purple Monster by Ashmai of Nath

I feel bad after not conjuring refreshments and logging out after doing that all day.
---
While I won't be disappointed if TCG items don't make a reappearance in Classic, I also wouldn't say no to them either.
---
Since the physical WoW TCG is dead I have a theory they'd do it one of two ways. The most likely being through the aids that is Hearthstone. The other would be another limited run promo with Pepsi Co. with codes for random TCG items being in 12 packs of limited time Dew flavors and in Doritos bags.
---
Whats your playstyle? I was going to pick mage i just want to know what to expect, ive never playes one.
---
I get to 22-25 then switch, no idea why.
---
Played a launch of a fresh p server and levelled a rogue then a warlock then a hunter then a mage all to 20 and then just gave up playing because I wasted so much time
---
You guys are like family. Cheers!
---
You're just bad at the class, there's tons of things you can do if you have a decent understanding at it.
---
Interesting to see that early troll concepts by Chris Metzen depict them with five fingers instead of three.
---
How do you restore your old classic character?
---
I would love to revisit my old troll rogue :) 
---
Forgot the username and password long time ago tho...
---
Underoath, Senses Fail, Silverstein, Finch, From First to Last, Funeral for a Friend. That stuff was on repeat for me, also some DnB like Bachelors of Science. I also rocked a lot of N.W.A back then even though it's not era-specific.
---
Ah, the glory days!
---
Wiping to a raid boss eventually results in the baddies improving and the boss dying.
---
Dying to a rogue only teaches you that sometimes it sucks being on a pvp server.
---
Crazy how blizzard claims they can‚Äôt recover old accounts but every day on r/wow I hear a new story about someone‚Äôs 15 year old account being brought back to life. Would love to get my old shaman back üò≠
---
I was really hoping no one would say Hearthstone. Don't want to give them ideas. ü§´
---
Now imagine spending 15/month or you lose the ability to play the game you PAID for in the first place!!!!!   ^^(/s)
---
Lol good luck then playing classic WOW, I guess you Don't mind the WOW models as they are basically from WC 3 engine.
---
I think you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised.
---
Aw man this reminds me of going to my friends house to watch him play this on his Mac lol
---
There's nothing similar for the Resto Shaman, unfortunately. 
---
The closest we get is Fire Nova totem and Chain Lightning but it doesn't quite cut it. You can't use FN or Magma alone as they will pull threat from you (Nova has placement threat, Magma has normal damage threat.)
---
For Shaman the absolute best choice is teaming up with melee, preferably a warrior. You become an unstoppable juggernaut.
---
While I never played a priest (beyond a mid-level shadow priest) far as I can tell they are about as useless for farming as the shaman unless specced for it.
---
Safe to say I'll be rolling a hunter alt :p
---
As you should!
---
Yeah I really hate hearthstone, which is funny because I liked the WoW TCG. The card art was 10,000% times better too.
---
Hey there, I've been putting together my own route for my Priest/Warrior Duo and there's a set of quests I'm still on the fence about doing or skipping and that's the egg escort quests. They take a little bit of time to do and every time I do one I just keep thinking I could be grinding elsewhere or doing other quests faster. What are your thoughts on the egg escort quests?
---
Still thinking about that. The game was good, but what made it great were the people. Unfortunately Blizzard can't add them to a subscription for me.
---
Do it for all the classes one will reach 60.
---
Don't see an issue testing everything to lvl 10.
---
If Blizzard include thoses items it'll probably end in the shop for 20$
---
But i doubt, since it's like buying golds because you get a mount for 0 gold.
---
Yikes I'm doing the exact same shit lol. Get to work, check emails, make sure all my servers are online, classic reddit, Skype message a co worker about classic, then I go down YouTube's black hole of classic videos and reddit some more
---
According to alliance players. Looks like a cube.
---
Would this be a good build to go with? https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbIbZEm0V0xoVo
---
Man I know that feeling so much. I remember being 14, finally finding a socially active guild and my heart dropping when I found out everyone else was 20+. They were really nice though and treated me well, I never felt the urge to quit!
---
Which is exactly how I found warcraft. A family friend had an iMac G3 and his son (who was a few years older than me) show med Doom and Wacraft 2 when I was about 6 or 7 years old.
---
Made me instantly fall in love with both franchises.
---
I recommend checking out that one unreleased warcraft adventure game, point &amp; click playing as thrall
---
Was never released sadly but it was finished, there are a lot of easy ways to find it and if you dig a bit you can even get the cinematics
---
I remember being so horny I was putting my dick in weird places, like speaker holes.
---
No one asked you! üò≠üò∞üò∞
---
I've read about it, but point and click advanture games arent my type. I havent even played Monkey Island :(
---
Once you get to lvl 20 you'll feel like you invested too much time and identify too much with your char to bail on it. 
---
Thats how I feel in classic. The effort makes me connect with my char past a certain level due to how the world was designed then :)
---
Im FAAAR more of an altaholic postwotlk when everything is similar and can be lvled within a day or 2 with 0 attention paid while 1 shotting everything.
---
Sak! Long-time no see... guess we got the LR subreddit to sorta-kinda work after all :)
---
yeah, they recently recovered my old vanilla account i played from vanilla-wrath. made a new account in cars after my original was hacked. I never made the effort to get my old account back but my dad recently wanted to get into BfA and wanted his old character back from vanilla. Blizzard got my account and all of my characters back within 25 minutes of contacting them. I was amazed at the service. 
---
Logging into all of my characters from when I was a kid was really awesome. Can‚Äôt wait for classic.
---
The WC2 mod I tried had their own models for buildings they looked like absolute crap. I didnt even try it long enough to properly check out the unit models.
---
Trolls are the best PvE Horde race for rogues.
---
Having leveled numerous characters to 10, you should have at least an elementary knowledge on how they each play. At this point it‚Äôs a matter of making a decision, and sticking with it. The grind from the 10-60 will be a long one, and each step along the way will feel rewarding. At the end of that long voyage however.... you will be able to look back on the character you made with a level of pride and accomplishment that has been leeched from modern WoW. Each class and race respectively have their own unique aspects in classic WoW. Just take a moment to look at and reflect upon your options and playstyle and try to determine from there what you enjoyed most and stick to that choice. 
---
As you climb in character level, you will find your attachment to whatever character you‚Äôve chosen grow as well. What you are experiencing is a simple wall where the leveling progress has slowed a small degree so you don‚Äôt get that immediate sense of achievement and accomplishment. Best of luck in your endeavors.
---

A version with most of the spikes removed.
---
Gnome for Alliance. Undead or Troll for Horde
---
that sounds like some life advice as well  :D i guess you are right so thanks..
---
The training was the big purchase. It's only like 9g for the first one. That's probably why they did not care about it when they did it for retail.
---
I was thinking about this last night while in the midst of a struggle vs insomnia and I realized that it will be impossible for this second experience to be as good as the first for most of us that were active 15 years ago.
---
To me, the community and the server drama WAS the game, the personalities and the rivalries are what made it so great, raiding had a purpose, bragging rights against our rivals, we wanted to kill every boss ahead of them and once we did the shit talking would go on for days. The accusations of exploiting etc...
---
I spent more time on our server's IRC channel than in game and it was an absolute riot, if this second time around WOW captures 10% of what it did during its first run, to me it would still be a massive success.
---
And remember that this kind of optimization did not exist in classic, because such stat change foresight was not a thing. This is a private server gimmick.
---
All these people saying PvP video songs and forgetting [Push it to the Limit](https://youtu.be/vCRJyKfm1Fs) is good too.  
---
Whatever‚Äôs on youtube or Grizzly Hills radio for me probably.
---
Yeah, I actually had a paragraph of musings about ways to avoid the "specialised alts" problem, and the only way I could think of was locking accounts to one character per realm... which causes far more problems than it solves. I ended up deleting it just to avoid the wall of text.
---
And that's the kind of thing I'm talking about with "designing the game around this principle". (In fact, the Vault of Archavon in WotLK was at least conceptually similar to this, though poorly executed.)
---
I have to agree with you. Even on pservsrs now auto loot is a thing and you just have to hold shift. Tips is crazy lol. Auto loot is fine
---
If I don't see a PvP video with Bodies within 2 months I'll make one my damn self!
---
Also:
---
Man Without Fear - Drowning Pool
---
Warriors - Freedom Call
---
Breaking Me Down - Soil
---
Blow Me Away - Breaking Benjamin
---
Feel like those are some staples.
---
I think its quite reasonable to think that.
---
TBC had basically the philosophy of vanilla with more refined &amp; viable specs, arena and so forth. 
---
I struggle to agree with wotlk-hypers tho. That shit swayed far too much from the core-values of WoW for me.
---
Can't remember if it was just a meme but people were talking about july 16th a while back
---
This might be the best post I read all day
---
I have the exact same problem... been doing this since TBC... someone please send help
---
Then released in June?
---
I subbed after nost shut down, no big deal.
---
That's called having some muscle. :) I think Orcs are the best looking Horde race for rogues for the same reason. The male ones look like Ninja Turtles in the Tier 1 set.
---
For me I was a diehard rogue. Only thing I rolled (orc) and played during all of vanilla and TBC.. My greatest moment was during the AQ gate event. I had studied and found out that teebu's blazing longsword would ONLY drop during that event, but it was super super super rare. I wanted this sword so bad as I had gotten to the gear level that Hemo was getting crazy.
---
Did I get it to drop? Nope. BUT a dude I knew got it! Only one on the server and he still didn't have his epic mount (tank woes). He gladly hooked me up for the full cost of an epic mount. 
---
I was a god for the longest time heh. I'm pretty sure Diminishing returns on stuns still wasn't fully implemented because I remember destroying people 100&gt;0 full stunlocks. I could technically do it prior but this pushed it so much better.
---
well the game is launching in easy mode with 16 debuff slots so some guilds will definitley let you run deep wounds
---
I hope so too, but I‚Äôll be on vacation the last week in June and I will be devastated if it releases then
---
Anytime a GM would messege me it felt like I was getting pulled over by the police irl. Palms sweaty, heart racing, even though i never did anything wrong üòÇ i remember just getting complimented by a GM for my wide varaity of mounts
---
If retail doesn‚Äôt correct itself might be one million by 8.2
---
Been researching what I want to play (my main will be PvP focused) and every time I watch a pvp video of a different class I change my mind everyday, I don‚Äôt want something gimped in PvP but I also don‚Äôt want to play a class that‚Äôs overpopulated, 1st world problems
---
Winter 2017
---
Well, I can see that theoretically working, but it really requires everything going you way and the opponent being completely robbed of the initiative.
---
Yeah, that was the feeling I had as well.
---
Ok, so I skip both imp cleave and imp slam. I made this build https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbIbZEm0V0xoVo is it good?
---
Priests can also do the dm east farm with holy nova spam, they are actually very good for it.
---
Yes. We're going home boys!
---
Better than ever. Like trimming excess fat.
---
If you play with friends and there will be no drama over loot I would suggest free for all so the mage doesn't have to run to the corps when it's his turn etc
---
Woot!
---
Farming in BC was great. Was able to buy my own 310% just from farming terocone in terrokar forest. The best times.
---
&gt; And that's the kind of thing I'm talking about with "designing the game around this principle". (In fact, the Vault of Archavon in WotLK was at least conceptually similar to this, though poorly executed.)
---
I think a better example would be Wotlk Tournament, with the "pvp like" encounter. If you want people to have flexible build, a great way to do it is to have radically different fights, like fight which ignore entierly threat for example, which force people to get some "tanky talent", etc.
---
10 days!? Holy fuck
---
auto loot addon dont exist, even on private servers theres none. to "enable" auto loot in the 1.12 client you had to modify the client itself so thats not an argument
---
Is data like this publicly available to other users besides admins? I'd love to make some graphs like this as well for some subs, maybe even update them live.
---
I agree with you.
---
Its all result of the small loot table and a lot of theory crafting.
---
Just play what you want
---
i dont like it, so i dont join any runs that is reserved. No matter if it has no impact for me.
---
Yes, play 80's and 90's easy listening, from artists spanning from Journey to Bon Jovi to Starship. It will smooth out the leveling experience, and put you in a special zen place that will be helpful when leveling in contested areas such as Stranglethorn Vale where you will be the most susceptible to suggestions of quitting, whether by yourself or others. (This happens to players of all skill levels)
---
I expect you'll see it quite a bit. The solution would be to just not group with someone who tries to reserve something, but what most of us will do is ignore it and group like normal if it's not an item we need and avoid that person if it is an item we need. So I guess it kinda works in that sense? I never bothered trying to do it because I either played a rogue early on in WoW where if I tried to reserve something it just meant I wasn't getting a group, then later on I played a warrior tank and the loot for me was very apparent and I was the only person in the group that wanted it so it was never a problem.
---
Sounds like a great guy. Back then 100g took some grinding to get.
---
I guess it's another p.server thing then. Thanks for insight tho
---
When you run a single dungeon 50 times for a 2% drop rate item, you can start to see why item reservations become a thing.
---
I think it's fine. I'm not sure why people get up in their own pants about reservations. Just don't join the group if you don't want to play with reserved loot?
---
If you don't like loot reserve make your own group without it. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
Roughly a few minutes to kill 2-3 ghouls with 4 Warlocks and a Hunter.
---
It was worth it
---
Depends what amount is reserved. Often gearing MT will be running hundreds of rend runs or lava runs. His weapon will be researved from obvious reasons. In favor you can do as much efficient runs as you can handle for your loot and greeds for gold or disenchanting.
---
As a Shaman gearing for resto I often was asked if I will roll or could I not roll on DPS gear when going as a healer (yet able to use the same gear gearing DPS players in group need for main spec).
---
On average it's getting things clear before runs so that loot drama can be avoided.
---
I don‚Äôt remember there being a 5% discount for friendly, only 10% for honored
---
Some people dont wanna play priest or mage so  whats the problem?
---
If you dont like it, dont join those groups.
---
Set game objectives and try to imagine what it will bring you! At lvl 12, you might have a new capacity, lvl 20 a new form for the Druid, lvl 30, travel form.
---
You can also se dungeon objectives: when you hit 18 -&gt; deadmines!
---
Good to hear! And yes, you need to do quests before they go grey for rep.
---
I think high population allows it. If several pugs are being formed every hour, it is more efficient for people to reserve loot and then self-organize into different groups. 
---
If population is lower it makes less sense, since people won‚Äôt want to wait an hour or two just to find a group where they can have a chance at their desired item.
---
Oh man. Goid old days. Spent so much time with this game, so much lan parties... Need to install and play it again too.
---
As long as it‚Äôs stated up front and they don‚Äôt change the rules during the run I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
is there a way to download the beta build ? i'm searching some way, but i think i failed \^\^
---
Untrue for priest.
---
Mage is autowin against priest as game goes on and geer is more available.
---
priests  scale worse then nearly any class, starting out they destroy but once a mage hits AQ+ they can global a priest  in a cs combo.
---
&gt;Warlock is so vulnerable to warriors and rogues that it can be really frustrating to play, way more vulnerable than mages are against its bad matchups (warlock, shadow priest).
---
Really? A soul link warlock can tank a warrior or rogue pretty well as is and has several options for extra defense, e.g. sacrificing the voidwalker and/or using succubus seduction to regain range. And then there's always death coil into fear, all while the warrior/rogue is dotted up and drained. A good melee can still win of course, but certainly not easily.
---
Even if you don't need the reserved item, it often makes sense to avoid these groups, since they'll have a hard time filling since they have chosen to reduce the available pool of players who might want to join the group.
---
I had this problem in vanilla and TBC where I leveled a mage to 20 (twice, once for either faction) then a shaman to 30, then a druid to 30, then finally got a rogue to stick. If you've played enough already then you know what you like and what you don't like, then it's just about knowing that the class only gets more interesting the more you level it.
---
I remember borrowing gold from two of my mates to buy Arcanite Reaper at 58 as a warrior. We used to hang out on Ventrilo all the time while playing and one of them asked if he should be nice today. 
---
I, being a bit preoccupied with farming gold to pay him and my other mate back, answered "sure, I mean that's a pretty good view on life".
---
10 min later he came back with "there, I've mailed [the other mate] the gold you owe him and you don't have to pay me back anything either." 
---
I was stumped.
---
When I started WoW 4 months before Burning Crusade, I played two characters leveling up at the same time. 
---
Paladin and Warlock. This gave me incredible diversity and NO boredom.
---
I did play a Ret paladin for solo leveling. Having healing spells helped level faster. Same goes with warlock. Drain life helped speed up between mobs.
---
Level 40 you get free mount. Level 60 you can buy a mount, or enjoy the awesome "Class mount" quest. 
---
Nothing more satisfying than completing these long quest.
---
Have fun and enjoy.
---
Same thing with shaman or pally. I‚Äôm going shaman because they can do every single role in the game, rdps, dungeon tanking, mdps, heals, and they are a support role.
---
Just realized the mekgineers chopper isn‚Äôt in Classic :(
---
Yes it is and I didn't even play it back in the day! I'm soooo hyped to try it out
---
What are you talking about? I'm assuming it's not about the hunter resource.
---
Too many rogues :)
---
Lmao I started in patch 1.12 and never got a character to max level until Cata, I would play my sisters hunter tho and do heroic dungeons and stuff tho
---
No, Hunters will use Mana ;)
---
Depending on class just a few hours
---
I used to play custom games of me and 7 cpus (I think it was 7, whatever the max you could have in a game) in a FFA on a money map. I remember after the mine ran out of gold and I'd chopped most of the lumber I would round up all my peasants, put on the cheat for infinite mana, then sheep all of them and blizzard them to death so I could free up supply for more army dudes.
---
I'd skip booming voice for 5/5 Unbridled Wrath, 2/2 Improved Execute and 2 points where ever you want.
---
I always understood that to mean that they were more difficult to detect if they activate SM while already stealthed. Guess I was wrong?
---
Mike runs flawlessly in Dosbox after i configured it to emulate a 486, but the GoG release is supposed to be pretty good.
---
What If we are not priests?
---
Whats the discord for that datamine server?
---
This is purely anecdotal, but for FWIW I've played every healing class at 60 plus a warrior and in any battleground the one class that always stands out as "oh shit that was a lot of damage" or a player who pulled off something really crazy was a mage. Don't get me wrong, these are good player and maybe even really geared, but still....nobody else really positions themselves in a pack of enemy players, snares them all, and then proceeds to AoE the fuck out of everyone. Not that everyone dies it's just really painful. Now, I've also seen where 2-3 of them do this and there's a lot of dead people.  So bottom line:  I've never been in a battleground where I've thought to my self, "gee that warlock really tore shit up!" 
---
I don't like playing a mage personally, and I'd much rather roll a lock, but I respect the hell out of the mage class. Very scary, lots of damage via AoE and DD, plus portals, food, water.
---
This "but how average Joe is gonna deal with it?!" reminds me of Ion Hazzikostas talking how terrible pvp vendors are because some people couldn't found them.
---
Hunters will use mana but their pets will use focus.
---
Sometimes. It all kinda just depends on what works for me. I don't have enough play time to get too picky. If the options are joining a group with a reserved item I don't need and running the instance or not running the instance that night at all I'm gonna take the first option.
---
Is the scaling really that bad? I know shadowpriests have a harder time getting good gear in vanilla, but assuming they *do* get their hands on some good pieces, e.g. Mish'undare, Lok'amir and so on, how would they not scale well?
---
Focus as a resource does exist in vanilla, on pets.
---
Focus as frames doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
We'll see in a year. Im hopeful.
---
Fury's are all specced Deep Wounds as well for the impale bonus, it's no an issue in 1.12 thanks to the debuff prio system.
---
A focus frame sorry. Like having a second target pane and macros that do things to the focus target instead of current target.
---
/cast target=focus counterspell
---
For example.
---
back when you could be a hybrid
---
Warlock was my favorite class to play.
---
"Where is our green fire?" Not to mention having the best looking class mount and a pet "Succubus" üòÇ
---
Good times
---
Did you play in vanilla? Cuz respec costs are going to be a killer for when ever you want to "switch classes without switching classes."
---
I could have sworn I was using focus target in macros well before 3.0.2 strange.
---
I‚Äôm a noob sorry, why do dwarves make more money?
---
I would duel by standing in place and spin to the direction the other melee class would attack me from as they would jump around me....
---
Focus frame doesn't exist in default? But will add-ons have it?
---
Not to mention that dungeon can feel like a small raid in terms of length and mob density at times.
---
Yeah I get that but shouldn‚Äôt the rogue be lean and thin so he can be quiet and strike fast,  not beefy like Olympic bodybuilder?
---
Kinda hard to imagine that.
---
eventually i will level every class to 60, but for a while gonna focus on my warlock :)
---
This started as a pservers thing.  If they end up the minority when classic launches, it might might be a big deal, since it could be diluted.
---
I find it impossible to go back to retail with the news that my favorite wow is coming back.
---
I'm wrapping up my private server grind to 30 practice (while also self sustaining on equipment and professions). I only caved on bags...which i'll probably regret at actual launch.
---
It's been pretty solid. I thought I was doing worse but i'm level 26 now and my /played was 1day and I believe 3 hours. A few other people were bragging in the same zone that were higher played and around level 20-23 so I was happy with that considering I know I could have done things a lot better. I didn't follow a single leveling guide and my class guide I choose to ignore parts of &gt;&lt;.
---
There was an add-on in tbc that allowed you to do it before blizzard brought it in as default in 3.0
---
RTS
---
I bought one myself a while back.
---
You definitely don‚Äôt need it but it‚Äôs super cool, it has a map of each zone and an there‚Äôs a list of important details in it and it tells you the location of the more important mobs in that area.
---
Super cool and really handy 15 years ago before all of this was on the internet.
---
That being said, I‚Äôm really happy with my purchase lol.
---
Doing a quick google search, you seem to be right that there was no such addon.
---
But, how is it easier to make gold with auto-loot being a toggle option rather than having to press shift while looting. It's a pure change in convenience, which does not affect difficulty or efficiency.
---
Mage w/ enchanting FTW
---
58 of those are Demon skills though, so you can save money by skipping ranks of them and buying the max skill book at 60, and you don't have to bind all those at once.
---
Yup it is new graphics mashed in with the old world
---
Yeah, don't get me started about that progressive itemization he keeps going on about.
---
This. At least until some of the major changes that the classic player base took issue with came about in WotLK. I imagine they would progress and release TBC/WotLK but never adding dungeon finder, LFG, or anything like the Lich King progressive buff that noobs like me enjoyed at the end of WotLK.
---
Your comment reads really dickish but I‚Äôll assume you have the best of intentions here...you need to read what I wrote- you can use those seals to avoid drinking and I did that at 60 as holy in WPL all of the time. Was any years ago but I definitely recall doing it.  Have a nice day!!!
---
As a racial trait they can track treasure chests.  I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs the reasoning behind it?
---
I remember loot reserving back in vanilla, so this being a pserver only thing is wrong.
---
I was trying to remember if very early on autoloot would loot dungeon gear without rolls or something. I know the loot system changed but I feel like that was solved immediately if it happened at all.   
---
IDK does anyone else remember wtf I'm talking about?
---
Sounds shady.

Not exact, rounding errors and such, 1-20ish might be a bit off cause early video stuff... but should be pretty accurate.
---
How? You can still do it by holding shift ... It literally makes no difference in terms of efficiency or difficulty.
---
Well troll is for pvp and undead is good for pve.

First of all I reccomend everyone to take their medication! 
---
Well on a more serious note the leveling process may not be engaging enough most of the time to keep your mind occupied. I'd recommend listening to a podcast or some other semi-demanding activity.
---
Yeah trinkets are never on CD. You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Go away
---
Dwarves are naturally good at finding treasure and beer
---
I don‚Äôt know enough to answer that, sorry.  I‚Äôm sure someone can make something, but if blizzard doesn‚Äôt want it...
---
Do you have a round up post of all the classes you've put together like this?
---
What were the servers like in Classic? Were they PVP and PVE back then? or was everything PVP? Sorry for noob question.
---
in the player mechanics sense, they dont; in traditional dwarf fantasy, dwarves are very skilled craftsmen and due to their mountain preference, tend to have all the precious metals too
---
Rogues cant shift + pickpocket, as a rogue that spent a shit load of time inside BRD i can say that would boost their gold income so fucking much.
---
Auto-loot was added in patch 2.0 (TBC), and shouldn't be in classic.
---
His BWL episode 2 is what got our guild hyped to jump into there from MC
---
haha yeah i was able to get there, by jumping up the mountain in the very south of winterspring. it took a lot of time to bug you over there. but it totally payed off :)
---
This was absolutely a thing in vanilla
---
If Focus isn't part of the base UI I'm really hoping someone will make and addon. It's a QoL aspect that doesn't go against the vanilla mythos.
---
Yeah, the two teams are all friends, except no one likes u/Myri0.
---
If you check his YouTube channel is has a lot of videos about wpvp and some about dueling too!

---
wrong. One of them for sure does and even still has clips and the VOD posted from a private server duel tourney this past weekend.
---
lose*
---
That's the one! I used to go there on late nights after raids with a few guild mates to hang out. I think there was only two times I got asked to leave or ported out by a GM
---
Pick what you like but:
---
Gnome (PvE and PvP), Undead (PvP), Troll (PvE)
---
Hybrids can do all 3 while in any spec while leveling at least.
---
 Now what‚Äôs the R squared of that trend üòâ
---
Can you plot the total subscriber count trend, that might give a better fit.
---
‚ÄúForming group for X, nothing reserved. Need a tank 2dps and a healer‚Äù
---
Easy solution
---
Their spellpower coefficients and critical chance literally makes them less viable, I would know, I had a r12/13 geared spriest on a reputable PS.
---
They‚Äôre just too vulnerable, and only have 3 damaging attacks.
---
Mindflay gets obliterated by imp CS, and they go olmmso fast a mage can reset fight by sheeting and evocating  and then they‚Äôre oom.
---
Also, spriest dropping out of sform to heal costs 3 global sand so much mana.
---
It sucks, they look so cool but are ass outside 1v1 with mana potting.
---
My first character was a mage back in 2005.  Leveled fire/arcane (as did everyone I know at the time), and then spec'd frost at 60 for MC.  Certainly doable, and was pretty fast as far as I remember.
---
Depends on the frequency. Less than once a month wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
---
10 is the only one I beat. I tried all the other ones people love but couldn't get into them.
---
I just loved 10 so much for some reason. Beat that one twice. The music in that game man!
---
That seems really weird to me since AoE looting was added well after i started playing (in Wrath).  I dont remember if it was Cata or MoP that added that, i just know i was really happy when running old instances/farming cloth or other mats.
---
Its not like they were added at anywhere near the same time.
---
gonna blow through the roof once classic launches
---
thank you for making this.
---
I knew there‚Äôd be at least one of you snowflakes that would respond.  
---
And I‚Äôve raided with a DPS ret Paladin in vanilla.  Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good choice compared other options available.  Can it be done? Sure.  But it wouldn‚Äôt be anybody‚Äôs first or preferred choice.  And the difference is far more vast in vanilla when compared to other expansions where all classes can legitimately fill any role they‚Äôre able to spec for.
---
Neither the spectral tiger not the rocket chicken was in vanilla, so I can safely say the answer to that is no.
---
Originally  you had pve, pvp and rp (which were pve). A few months after release they also introduced rp pvp.
---
"pre-bis" as in a crafted item, but you cannot get it on a fresh realm. Requires raidmats from MC.
---
Ohh, umm, good question...
---
Get past level 20 and you'll feel more bonded with your character.
---
With retail dropvalues maybe (~1%)
---
But back then the chance for a mount drop was 0,02% for the Baron Mount. It's really ridiculously rare, if you had it you were likely one out of 2-3 people who had it- if at all!
---
ZG Tiger and Raptor are much more reasonable at around 1%.
---
Sure while leveling, again im not saying you cant just asking cuz respecs are going to be a big factor in vanilla.
---
There are some websites that track this stuff, but I've never found a reliable/good one. As far as I know, only Reddit admins (people that work for Reddit) or subreddit mods (someone like me) can see these stats. I assume the admins that work for Reddit can see a lot more than us lowly volunteer mods can see, too.

"So the longer we delay release the larger the player pool!" //Devs

WoW Classic prepped me for bitcoin and stock trading...the auction house started my obsession.  I love it.
---
Ect.
---
Agreed.
---
Adult themed sex game.
---
I see one potential issue with auto loot, but it's extremely minor. With rogues, it's possible to macro pickpocket with your normal opening move to initiate combat. With auto loot, that effectively means that with absolutely no change in playing style, you'll automatically pick pocket humanoid mobs an instant before you attack them, resulting in a modest extra gold from the mobs plus a fairly steady supply of junkboxes to skill up lock picking. But honestly, all I see is a quality of life improvement.
---
You look less fragile with some muscle, and the armor tend to look worse on the scrawnier races. But to each their own.
---
Pretty sure xperl provides focus targets even in classic
---
Carved Ogre Idol was added in WotLK
---
oh god plz no
---
Fuck those that reserve loot. It's well within group leads to do it...but it's well within my right to put them on ignore and ruin the leader's server rep for practicing such a nonsensical philosophy.
---
While we're on this topic, since I know some of you haven't played the game in a while, they now have a do-it-yourself item restoration service here - https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration
---
So if you make a mistake, no need to wait for support. You can restore items yourself once every 15 days.
---
So I'm really thinking about starting with mage. What is honest opinion if leveling? Is it just frost bolts?
---
I did rogue and hunter last time and both were pretty speedy.
---
Good first class to play for sure
---
Like many hunters .... I didn't immediately change my playstyle when I hit 10. I hunter melee'd a good 2 or 3 levels after that totally unaware, with my pet just chomping at my side
---
Several comes to mind but most happened in TBC since there's where I started.
---
1. Trying to get from Undercity to Silvermoon City through the Plaguelands as a lvl 30. Bonus, as I was discovering the map and trying to pinpoint the exact way to the Ghostlands, I ended up in a zone full of elites but kept going until I reached the entrance to Stratholme. This was when I gave up and asked if there's an easier way to get from UC to SC.
---
2. Trying to get to Kargath from STV. Went through Duskwood, Deadwind pass and got lost at the Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Another attempt to get to Kargath through the Wetlands and spending 30 minutes roaming the elite dragons zone only to find out that's not the way after being mauled to death several times and corpse running the majority of time.
---
In a third attempt to get to Kargath I think I finally found a way through Redridge mountains and passed through the Burning Steppes, Blackrock mountain and into the Searing Gorge. Finally found my way to the Badlands. Needless to say, I didn't get there unscathed.
---
When I started playing Vanilla on a ps, I already had a good grasp of the map and finally found the proper way to Kargath through the Wetlands.
---
3. Try to solo the elites at the temple of Atal'Hakkar before the instance entrance.
---
4. Needed on every single piece of mail gear including two shields on my first run of Wailing Caverns as a paladin. I wasn't tanking but I though you could always need if you can equip it.
---
5. My favourite one: was leveling through STV as an enhancement shaman and was trying to kill a murloc 6 levels below me. I spent a good 2 minutes killing it and kept thinking "woah, these murlocs are fucking strong, what's going on?". Several murlocs later I realized I had equipped my fishing pole...
---
6. Raiding in the Molten Core I was casting Ancestral Spirit on one dead player, 10 seconds later I end up in Kargath because I have clicked the wrong button and was casting Astral Recall without noticing since they have the same cast animation.
---
Alright I'll give you that about the rogues. But addons still allowed for rogues being able to auto loot while pick pocketing.
---
&gt; Auto-loot was added in patch 2.0 (TBC), and shouldn't be in classic.
---
This is just #nochanges , thus not an actual argument.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Good to know that it's possible for an add-on to do it.
---
My b
---
I think Ironman-mode is actually a highly supported game mode for WoW.
---
What
---
gonna get worse the closer the release is
---
What information would that be? As far as I‚Äôm aware, dataminers get the information first, other news are links from twitter, wowhead and various other sources, nothing directly here from Bluzzard themselves that is exclusive for this community.
---
I learned how to save money, resist the desire to buy flashy AH gear in order to buy bigger purchases (sometimes months later which is akin to years as an 11 year old), I learned the value of a dollar through hours of tedious grinding, supply and demand economics through manipulation of the AH before there was add-ons to help you, how to heavily prepare for tasks beforehand  (raiding you need world buffs, pots, watch videos and read rotations), how to coordinate with groups of up to 40+ people, how to interact with adults in a professional manner without being a pest (I was 11 when I began and legitimately was friends with: a professor, SAHM, a collegiate athletes who I would watch play on Saturdays on ESPN, and a semi-pro Surfer in Cali). I played a Boomkin - so I learned that to be competitive and overcome natural disadvantages and heavy stigma you had to try harder then everyone else. 
---
It wasn't until recently that I reflected on some of these things while considering classic and realized that a lot of these experiences have had a profound impact on who I am now as a person.
---
didnt know u could rezz at your body when i died walked around in ghostform for like half and hour and then deleted my character
---
LOL
---
You dont even touch the frostbolt key for almost half of the boss fights in MC you are aoeing on these fights now and the mage aoe rotation is kinda complicated. What you're saying about the class was how it was played in 2006 and that wont be true for how its played in the classic version
---
I am 100% ok with it. Running large raids and coordinating making the groups is NOT easy or fun in many cases. It is a way of encouraging people to raid these things. If you know what item is being reserved or which items, it should not be an issue. Just make sure to ask pre raid so you are aware.
---
I would never lead raids if everything was RNG. I would just join random pugs and put forth 1/10th of the effort. Leading is way more demanding.

sticking to mage is a little easier cause you can play many different specs
---
I think an ironman style wow would be pretty sweet. Would want them to change up the gameplay elements a bit, more survival, fish/hunt for your food, have to sleep (though this probably doesn't work with an mmo since you can't just speed up time while you sleep, so maybe not that).
---
World pvp would be... interesting. Would probably need to build in a lot more ways to survive longer in combat and implement rules to prevent ganking lowbies if you only get 1 life.
---
Hmm, didn't know that about their coefficients, interesting.
---
&gt;Mindflay gets obliterated by imp CS, and they go oom so fast a mage can reset fight by sheeting and evocating and then they‚Äôre oom.
---
Conversely, couldn't the spriest mana burn the mage? But good point here as well in that mana doesn't regenerate as fast as health while sheeped.
---
But at the time I'm 18 won't i be to high level for Darkshore?
---
@darth\_shopping\_maul there is a ton more things to live for than money or a job. There are so many options out there. I'm in the Air Force right now and I know it can be shitty getting out with something other than honourable. But your life is more precious than a few set backs. Go back pack around the country, go find yourself. Don't sit around and waste away with your depression and DON'T kill yourself dude. You need to contact the VA. I'm pretty sure they have transition training and counselling for members who got out other than honourable. I swear to you the military is extremely focused on suicide prevention and as long as you take the step to seek help, you will find it. If you need to talk let me know.
---
&gt;This is just #nochanges , thus not an actual argument
---
How is it not an argument? You are retarded, while we are at it lets add summoning stones from TBC aswell.
---
Accurate
---
It doesn‚Äôt impact anybody.  Just don‚Äôt join loot reserved runs.  ‚ÄòProblem‚Äô automatically ceases to exist.  
---
Or, create your own groups *gasp*.  
---
‚ÄòBuh buh but creating groups is soooo harrrd and takes effort on my part.  I want somebody else to do the work for me, and do it exactly the way IIIII want them to do it.‚Äô
---
If they don‚Äôt communicate loot reserves ahead of time, then that‚Äôs called ninja looting.
---
Focus is so damn useful for cc. I remember using a shackle macro that allowed me to re-cast shackle undead without having to find my target or switch frame targets.
---
Anti-cheat in WOW is undertaken by a bespoke Blizzard solution called "Warden". As it's unique to Blizzard games anti-cheat creators have to be willing to design their cheat software for a very limited number of titles, which makes it commercially non-viable as a general rule. "Amateur" software, largely for botting purposes, does still exist although it isn't shared widely as the simplest way to catch cheat software is to have a copy of it for comparison purposes.
---
This is especially true for Warden as it does not actually make use of Kernel Mode and runs entirely at the User Mode level, restricting what is possible to detect. For example, Warden cannot directly detect an open kernel-handle that is changing values in memory although it could (no idea if it does) use more complex techniques such as memory-trapping or the like to determine that tampering has occurred without knowing specifically how this was achieved.
---
Ultimately the story is the same as it ever was though, the more you try to cheat the more likely you are to be detected but it's not an exact science and it always depends on the amount of time the developer puts in to refining their anti-cheat program in response to the information it is collecting.
---
I used 2 intellect daggers on my rogue because I thought they look cool
---
You can't Shift + Pickpocket, you clearly never played rogue, lol.
---
I was a very poor 40 something mage, 13 years old. Wasn't entirely sure on how to even gear for my class or anything, much less do anything else. I'm killing mobs in stv and boom staff of jordan drop. Equipped that bad boy SO fast haha. wore it until well into TBC because I was so proud of it haha
---
horde - undead / alliance - gnome
---
I leveled a mage to about 40 on a private server last year.
---
AoE was nice but not needed. It‚Äôs great for grinding to 60 but if you follow any sort of quest guide going single target frost is a great build. 
---
The crucial talent is the the mana savings it provides. Fire just pisses mana away. I found myself drinking after every 2 mobs.
---
Alliance Pve:
---
Alliance PvP:
---
Also Gnome
---
Horde PvE:
---
Troll (10%-30% Haste cooldown)
---
Horde PvP:
---
Undead
---
But thankfully in both cases the choice is not very impactful. Troll Mage for absolute min-maxers in PVE content maybe, but it's not a big deal (compared to other  combos, like Priest or Rogue).
---
He's losing productivity because WoW classic isn't OUT yet . . . I got some bad news for you . .
---
Yeah you're right, I didn't know the drop rate but if it's really 0.02% you'd  need a bit less than 10 years of 2 times a day Strat Baron to have a good chance to see it drop ! Yikes !
---
What? Auction house has been there since the beginning.
---
I always thought I was a god in vanilla, turned out I was just less of a noob than most people.  Still a massive noob though.

Some of my most hyped games are definitely like Burning Crusade, Halo 2, Skate, MX Unleashed, Mass Effect 3, Cube World (plz wolfram), DayZ, RDR:2.
---
I'm thinking I'm more hyped about classic wow than any of those though. Only reason why Vanilla wasn't the original list because I didn't know about it till after it launched and my friends were playing it for a month or two until I was able to convince my parents to buy it for me and also get better internet lol.
---
I started playing Grim dawn recently it's really scratched my rpg itch while waiting for classic to come :).

I will be testing out my levelling/farming bot on the beta client when it goes live.

The good thing about this wowclassic is it uses the modern code so it was fairly simple to port over my bot.
---
Wow what happened on March 12th?
---
yes playing a mage is basically playing classic on easy mode
---
Just bought a used one for $5 off ebay after seeing this, because why not? It will be a cool physical item to hold on to. I may even try to use it occasionally for nostalgia purposes.
---
Tbf nowadays it‚Äôs pretty accepted that HS is bad to use. Not only uses rage but also stops your auto generating rage.
---
Much better to sunder spam and fish for overpower procs. Sunder spam also means you do more damage the lower the mob gets

A mage jumped off a cliff and so I jumped after because I didn't know what featherfall was. Splat.

If that‚Äôs the case and the only thing about the expansions being released is just the content and not the progressively worse play style then damn that‚Äôs a good idea. So Classic will just be the ‚Äúhard‚Äù mode for wow, with the ability of playing through all the old content again. 
---
Would be cool if they preserved each expansion too somehow, like when you start a new ‚Äúclassic‚Äù character you have to start at vanilla then go through tbc wotlk, etc. or at the very least let you choose which expansion you want to start in.
---
I just do the main chains and skip the initial lower level quests, usually head down to Ashenvale around 21 and do the first quests there afterwards
---
Illidan is an arrogant fool! I will crush him and reclaim Outland as my own...
---
Or you can use Reddit Enhancement Suite and not have to remember Reddit formatting at all. :)
---
I played on Burning Blade - US in Vanilla. Soulsista level 60 rogue. lol
---
Yeah fuck that I'll definitely be in Westfall
---
It takes a long time before it's really worthwhile to go SL, and it's pretty much only a 1v1 spec. Most warlocks go SM/Ruin since it's a more universally useful spec and you can even raid without respeccing. SL does better against melee but then you get new weaknesses like anything that can heal, since you do very low DPS as SL.
---
i member
---
Yeah and what's worse is that (for alliance at least) it's like only 4 real quests. Kill the dragons to start, kill two bosses that you kill anyways in a BRD run, jailbreak, kill drakkisath. The rest is just walking around. You can find 200 something hours to cap your character but these 4 quests are too much?
---
Will be funny to see dozens of people trying to make the jump to Haleh again.
---
Oh ok, I thought it would be on August
---
Totally, I've done that as well. I'm not trying to advocate avoiding these groups to create some kind of cultural shift. Just that pragmatically we've all seen somebody shouting in trade for hours for the same group with a reserve while watching several groups all form and go run the instance in that time since they were less picky on membership.
---
the only way ur viable is with bre on horde
---
If auto look makes it into Classic I'll be very happy.
---
If anything, you can just change the key-bind for auto loot to only be right click
---
Hum this makes me think, did you have to look "professional" when you needed to show yourself in the game?
---
I dunno. As a tailor, I'm not very keen on the idea of having to roll against 4 other players for truefaith vestments pattern simply because it can be sold on AH. Likewise if someone can prove to me they are alchemist by brewing something in group, I think it's appropriate for them to get that rare flask recipe if it drops despite its AH value. It's part of the reason they are there anyway.
---
Same.
---
I was playing almost exclusively FPS and RTS games at that point on my PC.  I wasn't psyched for WOW after playing the open beta briefly (I think I was a tauren shaman for about 6-8 levels?) so I didn't even think to touch it until a friend convinced me the summer after release.
---
&gt; I think he was probably confusing it with AoE loot, which is actually harmful to the game because it can significantly improve the efficiency of gold farmers and inflate AH prices even further out of the reach of more casual players.
---
Gold farmers aren't a problem on live and we're using the same client (albeit just with vanilla data) so I don't think gold farmers will be an issue in Classic.
---
You can't spec arms because it takes a debuff slot.
---
2h fury is totally viable, especially on horde with WF. IIRC part of your rotation is hamstring spam to proc more WF. Just get bloodthirst and impale. Get relevant talents for PvE.
---
&gt; The whole of BfA takes 45 GB
---
Pretty sure its more than that.  The data folder itself is 62GB+.
---
2 hours later :  ‚ÄúForming group for X, nothing reserved. Need last tank‚Äù . \^\^
---
I really don't know why anyone would have an issue with auto-loot, other than the most diehard "herp derp it wasn't in vanilla" people.  And even then it was just you had to hold Shift, so what's the problem with just making it the default?
---
You know only Nelfs and tauren can be druids, right?
---
Getting my Level 60 Paladin Mount was pretty satisfying. All that time farming paid off in the end.
---
I think OP is speaking about dungeons not raids.
---
Not all hdmi cables support 144Hz, most support 120Hz. Best bet is to just get a displayPort
---
Well here's hoping you get caught!
---
Not sure if serious?
---
Tauren is the only horde druid option.
---
I am aware of that.
---
Even early deep wounds wont push off debuffs that matter.
---
Take a day off for that BRD full quest run.
---
Hi, /u/BossOG420
---
That is auto loot. It just picks everything up without selecting each piece. Tips doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about OR saying that to make content.
---
Oh, you're right. Google gave me a link to [this page](https://www.wowhead.com/news=281321/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-system-requirements-for-windows-and-mac#screenshots:281321:4) for searching "BfA requirements" and gave me the legion picture.  Still, I think 15 GB would be plenty.
---
I'll give it a read, thanks for the info!
---
Shaman.  I hate hate hate the totem system.  Im glad its in the game but i dont want to control it.
---
Yes there was a lot of that going on. rip Chester. I did enjoy LP at the time but I can't stand it now :(
---
Blood rage is really overrated. It's only a bonus to your base attack so it doesn't scale with gear, and has a tendency to get you killed.
---
why wait for classic to try it out and just try a true vanilla private server. You'll have a blast and have some practice before classic drops
---
Exactly. I swear, I've seen all the videos there are on Vanilla &amp; Classic, and I will just rewatch them.  
---
I hope wowHobbs comes back for Classic. Watched his videos religiously during wrath. One of the main reasons I ended up making a Paladin.
---
I mean, the only difference is now we won't have to hold shift at every corpse.
---
Downloaded a speedhack to see if it would work, was mainly curious. Leveled up a character to 19 or something like that and then played warsong gulch and just capped all the flags instantly. 
---
Keep in mind I was TRYING to get banned.
---
Totally agree. I fired up my top 3 favourite PvP videos (vurtne 1, vurtne 66, ironicz women and children die first) and stared listening . It has made the hype worse :(
---
So... why is this a problem?
---
I think that private servers have given wpvp a bad rap.  First time round, the servers were smaller, you only rarely ran into opposite faction levelers (as in, in any given zone there may be a dozen or so enemies.  On high pop psvers there is basically an enemy in sight at all times).  Competition for resources is more intense.  More importantly, any no lifer that just feels like taking out his aggression/sadistic tendencies on the unfortunate lowbies has a never ending stream of ready targets, which means that industrial scale griefing is a matter of both ability and convenience.  Even more importantly, it's all free, so if your only joy in wow is whacking lvl 29s, you don't even have to pay for your sub to have the privilege.
---
I rolled on fresh servers twice in vanilla and leveled way too many alts, and during the rush and after, most people minded their own business and higher levels passing through would sometimes kill you once and move on, sometimes they'd one shot your mob for kicks, or rarely take offense and camp for a while.  Either way it was a night and day difference from overcrowded pservers.  People camping and griefing were the dramatic exception, and the places where it happened often, like Nesengwarys, just made it more awesome.  It also made opposite faction players seem like bros or jerks- you remember. 
---
In short, play pvp.  It can be frustrating but it's also rewarding. Adds a whole new dynamic of dealing with the other faction.  I have many fond memories of standoffs coming to a head at quest givers, when a bunch of people are uneasily doing their business when suddenly a gankee decides to get his revenge when some allies are around and the whole thing blows up.
---
That said, if they did change anything about vanilla mechanics, I wish they would rework the pvp resistance mechanics.  It's silly how certain classes can hold their own and magic classes get annihilated by lvl 10+ enemies without even being able to inconvenience them.
---
I never remember that happening. It will loot gear within chests though.
---
/focus will probably work given the client is much newer and in the 8.x range.
---
 
---
Newer macro syntax will work too like @mouseover
---
Same. I also like the idea behind enhancement, but I wish it played out more like the Sith Assassin in SWTOR minus the stealth. Both share the same concept of using empowered melee weapons, discharging the magic through their weapons, and using short range spells to zap enemies.
---
Spotted the tryhard in the group.. Skins over stats ya nerd!!!!
---
Your sound card works perfectly.
---
Depends how crowded the servers are. AoE is better by far, but if it's anywhere near as crowded as it has been on the major private servers, it's nearly impossible to find good spots for AoE unless you're in the cutting edge of hardcore levelers and you get way ahead of the pack. Otherwise it's mostly just Frostbolt ad infinitum. It's not a terrible way to level since you have unlimited water, but it's not really faster than any other kind of one-by-one grinding.
---
With today's knowledge, i wouldn't be surprised if the first 60 is here in less than 5 days.
---
That video was painful. The guy trolling the GM acted like a child the entire time.
---
you should play mage if you have experience of the class and like it. There seems like there is gonna be a lot of (bad, first time) players rolling mage so if you're already good at mage you won't really have any problems with competition.
---
Thank you for the detailed information, much appreciated. Hopefully the community of Classic will help deter cheaters as well.
---
I was on the 1.12 client last night screwing around and auto loot is an option under interface options. not sure what people are talking about.
---
Paladin just isn't fair. Every 40 man needs one and that's it. So you've got to be in top 2% of pallys or you've just wasted all that time to get to 60 in one of the hardest classes to level. At least druids are easy and fun to level.
---
I only got my shaman to 30 in the days before you could press 1 button and drop all 4 totems at once, so I didn't have to experience too much pain with it.
---
I had a warrior at 60 in late vanilla. Did a little raiding, and lots of dungeons. Didn‚Äôt hit max again until Wrath (a paladin this time, which was my preferred class and now a viable tank in wrath), but then not again until Legion. Mostly because I wasn‚Äôt playing much after Cata, really hated that expansion.
---
But I always had a ton of alts, none of whom ever hit max as well. I loved the idea of a fire mage, and played her some (as a fan of wheel of time, all my casters are females, all fighter-types males). Had a holy priest that I ran entirely though dungeons when I was feeling especially social, which was a lot of fun but you can imagine how slow her leveling was. A hunter when I wanted to be alone in the world. He was my completionist, where I did all quests, took all secondary profs and kept them leveled, etc. And finally I loved tanking something simple like Deadmines, so I would routinely level a warrior to Deadmines and tank it for randoms. When the warrior got too high, I would delete and start over.
---
Theres a *lot* of xpacs worth of content at this point.  Its actually a bit impressive they've kept it that small.
---
That video was painful. The video creator acted like a child.
---
The nutty belt isnt added till 1.10
---
Of all the reddit communities I subscribe and participate in, this is hands down the best! Thanks to everyone for being AWESOME!!!!!
---
Negative
---
Warlock. I've tried to play one over and over again and I never make it very far. I'm not a big fan of pet classes in general, their aesthetic (or class fantasy or whatever) isn't appealing to me, and the race choices are poop. Warlock just isn't for me.
---
Warlock and Hunter, I just don't like having a pet.
---
&gt; You still didn't give me an addon that allowed you to auto loot, and you wont because theres none.
---
Because you added in the question after I replied. I looked a bit deeper into and you do seem to be correct on that one after all. Addons only allowed to instantly snap the window to the cursor, which was sometimes called auto looting.
---
&gt; How is it not an argument? You are retarded, while we are at it lets add summoning stones from TBC aswell.
---
Right, calling me retarded really helps your case. Also, summoning stones have a substantial impact on gameplay and the world, so this is a pretty bad comparison. Since you believe #nochanges to be an argument, please enlighten me. To me it's just a bullshit phrase that gets thrown around all the time to not actually make any arguments. And please do not come with that slippery slope bullshit either.
---
The fact is, you could auto loot by holding shift. Just removing the necessity to hold the additional button is still not changing anything substantial (e.g. no change in efficiency or difficulty) for anybody besides rogues. If you think rogues will be OP with auto looting when pick-pocketing, then leave that as is and just give the option for regular looting.
---
Can you get it on gog now? Last I heard it was only just planned for a future release?
---
I am NOT a speedrunner of any kind. But I do want to hit 60 in a reasonable, above average time.  Are there any tips or advice you can give as a 100 percent-er that are easy to do or small things to remember that save you a lot of time? I plan on leveling Rogue atm and I know I need to level first aid.
---
At 40?
---
The idea of a warlock always appeals to me, but in practice I just enjoy nuking stuff as a mage much more than I enjoy DoTing something up and waiting for it to die.
---
Focus was added in tbc, and the frame was added in wotlk. So id hope there is no focus command at all
---
I remember posting when we hit 20k. Congrats !
---
God I wish i had 200ms ping during vanilla
---
I‚Äôve heard people say alliance warlocks are better in PvP as well because they don‚Äôt have to deal with Paladin cleanse.
---
It‚Äôs a dank nice set but I would have to hide helm
---
I could never get into druid. I liked more straight forward classes. I had max lvl hunter, mage, lock. Wasn't a fan of melee combat at the time or healing so that played a major fact why I didn't like druid. Nothing against them tho. Amazing healers, damage dealers and tanks. Just not for me.
---
There was no /focus functionality in vanilla and there shouldnt be in classic either, if you want to re-polymorph a target then you should need to target it again
---
46 is indeed very close to the half way point of /played
---
With beta looking to be early may I could see July release. June gives them time to finish up any bugs found during beta.
---
Haha thats awesome.
---
Makes sense. And yeah where I said admins I meant you mods of course. And you guys do amazing work, don't consider yourself lowly! ;)
---
It's a non issue, as auto looting was in classic. The only difference being you can toggle it on and off without having to use a modifier key.
---
T6 is beautiful as well
---
It seems like I remembered incorrectly. So your point is correct after all. Not sure how that would make pickpocket broken, but your argument in itself is valid.
---
https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle
---
Druid. It's silly, but my first ever character was a druid, and it was a pretty awful experience (not necessarily because of the class choice). Ever since then, I just can't make myself do it. I've tried many times, with many different builds, both on various xpacs of live and on pservers, but just can't get past a few hours /played without giving up.
---
To be fair, I also have never really tried to play a hunter/lock (not sure if I'd actually be able to do it) because if I wanted to micro stuff I'd go play Starcraft.
---
Op didn‚Äôt mention 40? I‚Äôm assuming ‚Äòback then‚Äô meant vanilla?
---
those spooky titties yes pls
---
Thats not entirely true.  Even with the best internet that Korea has to offer youre going to get lag if youre playing on US servers.  Even playing on an Eastern US server from the West coast will give you some additional lag...now multiply that by the data having to be sent across the entire Pacific.
---
I was a GM hunter on alliance, I would say just pvp grind for a bit when the honor system drops. Most of what you linked is basic gear. Why the arcanite reaper tho?
---
For me with druid, it just comes down to the fact that I prefer warriors as tanks, I prefer rogues as melee dps, I prefer mages as casters, and I prefer shamans or priests as healers. So even though you can be multiple things, I feel like for each of those things I'd rather be something else.
---
There are so many things you can do. If you don‚Äôt qualify for the GI bill, look into some non profits that can help out. 
---
PM me if you need help with anything or need to bs or whatever.
---
If there isn‚Äôt an add on for it, that still doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be an add on for it.
---
We are using the 7.3 client and add ons will be slightly different. So the argument to not have it in the game will become irrelevant the second someone creates an add on to do auto loot.
---
I'm not. Just rank 2
---
Me and my buddies are doing War shamn priest and class to be named later combo
---
How dare you sir? How dare you?
---
Wasnt in vanilla, wont be in classic.
---
How do you guys still dont understand that everything doesnt have to be catered to, wow vanilla was by far the best game ever made, we should all just be grateful for all pservers and voices asking for this to be released,  wow classic is a tribute to vanilla and all the people who worked their asses off for this to come back, not because you who clearly dont get it, can have your retail "qol" shit.
---
Classic is for the people who made this happen.
---
Its not the cable, its the HDMI standard that is being used. HDMI 1.4 should not have a problem with 144hz unless the monitor manufacturer skimps by not using the full bandwith or using 1.2 instead. 
---
Most decent brands should support it, but DP is so common now that it really doesnt matter.
---
If i remember correctly i think my dad gave me to gold to buy a normal mount, and in tbc for the flying mount. Not sure how i paid for the epic ground mount. I think i was running dungeons a lot and gradually built up the cash
---
Gnome for alliance is definately the best.
---
For horde troll and undead are pretty equal, good in different parts of the game.
---
Just pick what you think is coolest tho, if you want to play human mage, go ahead.
---
Tips?
---
Mustard.
---
You don't have to join a reserved run.
---
But for me, I have to run brd 100-300 times and during every last boss fight I have to switch to masterloot for the purple i've reserved.
---
I did all the work gathering people, I made sure to let them all know that I want this 1 item and i've been running nonstop for it.
---
This worked for me for the headless horsemans mount.
---
As for raids, the only reserved loot will be main tank gear getting his armor sets first is kind of a given as a guild.
---
I only wanted to know the approximate date to get excited for it *cries in tears*
---
Genuine question: how much of that is down to locking them out vs. selling WoW tokens?
---
&gt;Because you added in the question after I replied
---
Just like you edited your post after I replied.
---
&gt;To me it's just a bullshit phrase that gets thrown around all the time to not actually make any arguments. And please do not come with that slippery slope bullshit either. If you think rogues will be OP with auto looting when pick-pocketing, then leave that as is and just give the option for regular looting.
---
Like I said before, auto-loot was added in TBC and shouldn't be in classic, I don't need to make any argument out of it, it wasnt in the game, this is enough to not add it. Cattering to the casuals with QoL changes is what ruined this game.
---
The auto loot box was NOT in vanilla at any point. It was possible to auto loot by shift clicking.
---
i'm 32 and this gives me depression
---
A recent comment on here helped me with popular classes. There's always going to be other players in your class. You won't be just 1 of 5 of a class. Like, comparing mages to druids...you might be 1 of 1000 mages vs 1 of 500 druids. This is with a 5000 server cap!  So don't worry too much about popularity, there's still going to be alot of every class at cap
---
I got my first 100 by giving some orc a lap dance, no regrets.
---
Maybe he's technically right but Blizzard already stated that they won't change minor conveniences on the UI side if they are inconsequential, like with the multi-item mail. I don't remember that being a very controversial stance.
---
WoW is like a Phoenix, it gets old, burns to ashes, and then is reborn.
---
huehue... "moo-d"
---
I see your point. The advantage seems pretty minor to me as you have to be in stealth to pickpocket anyways. The only thing that can happen without auto loot is that mobs detect you while pickpocketing or after, which means you won't get the loot or the ideal opener.
---
back  in vanilla a no go to reserve items.
---
Anyone else play WC2 through AOL? It cost per game I think..? I remember racking up a serious bill one summer
---
Basically what you get, cause there's no point farming dungeons for loot during lvling
---
Dont you want 5 so you have one of each blessing?
---
eh I have quite a few honestly lol. 
---
My first character I met some random person who was helping me out. I was in Stormwind and told I needed to get professions to make money. Got herbalism but didn't know wtf to do with it an eventually just untrained it. Basically deleted character after that and rerolled warlock. 
---
It took me something like idk.... 20-30? days played to hit 60????? I.... was so fucking bad at questing. And when I got into 50s in eastern/western plague lands I didn't really know wtf to do so Just killed mobs over &amp; over lmfao. Took forever.... but got a lot of rune cloth. Which was nice since I was a tailor... but was too dumb to understand how to actually make money from tailoring so was a waste of a profession for me. 
---
O yea... speaking of how bad I am with gold I would only loot like... what I thought I needed from mobs instead of autoloot lol. Lost out on precious money that way which I would regret later. 
---
Can't wait to actually try and be smarter economically this time haha and actually make some money off professions and looting.
---
Was aoe grinding a thing in vanilla or was it introduced in later expansions?
---
It's possible that won't work with whatever rules macros will need to follow. It will be interesting to see that.
---
Haha what? You have minimum 4-5 easy
---
Oh maybe, I didn't think that was better than another priest or rogue.
---
What makes you so confident that you can autoloot pickpocket?
---
Same, didn't like not ever being as good as the class I was imitating. Jack of all trades master of none wasn't for me.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's the case. If you have 100g to loan to a stranger, you have 100g to give... That's my policy with friends I trust. I don't think he expected it back.
---
Now imagine having never played vanilla and being nostalgic anyways
---
I was young when I played vanilla and I would constantly beg for money for some reason, until one day, I asked for some money to a stranger and he put in 1 copper in the chat and I refused and said something like "wow I need more than that" so he responded that I obviously didn't need the money if 1 copper couldn't help me and than proceeded to trade over 10 gold to someone else to teach me a lesson. I was a weird kid but that did teach me to not be such a snot nose brat
---
It was a thing.
---
Do you have to cycle through servers to find your characters?  I don't remember how it worked
---
So old (or lazy) the cover says rating pending
---
Yeah man one of the best money making combos
---
Nice, it might be a good idea to put total gold cost on there somewhere but I know you already finished all of them. I just know shaman is like the 2nd or 3rd most expensive to level class so could be good to know
---
Maximum effort
---
It was added in tbc.
---
In your guide you recommend everyone to go to Darkshore. What about classes who don‚Äôt have a trainer there?
---
It is not really what op asked. But you are also wrong in that a raid only need a single paladin. They are very good single target healers, very mana efficient and you definitely need more than one for different auras and blessings across the raid.
---
I'm surprised Leeroy Jenkins vid hasn't been linked yet.
---
white girl warlock cuz the homies rolling alliance and imma lock u up bb
---
I did the same thing lol, but my guy didn't harass me about it. (I was a druid, so I messaged the only level 60 druid I could find in /who).. anyway, I always thought about it and wanted to pay him back when I hit 60 and was able to farm. But unfortunately he stopped playing before I could pay him back. I sent him mail saying I'd have his money if he ever came back. 
---
He's still on my friends list today, it he ever came on, I'd send him 2 mil gold lol (though he probably deserves more)
---
&gt; Just like you edited your post after I replied.
---
But my edit was very apparent and I did not tell you afterwards that you missed something that I edited in.
---
&gt; Like I said before, auto-loot was added in TBC and shouldn't be in classic, I don't need to make any argument out of it, it wasnt in the game, this is enough to not add it. Cattering to the casuals with QoL changes is what ruined this game.
---
Right, so still no argument here. Also, comparing auto looting to other features that did have an actual impact on the game is kinda ... retarded.
---
I guess we are done here.
---
As of right now, Blizzard says this summer.
---
Where did you get your client? If you downloaded it from a link from a pserver it could be a modified client. 
---
My 1.12 client does NOT have an auto loot option.
---
Fair enough on that you may have to respec in and out of SL if you're also raiding. But on the other hand, it also takes a long time before a warrior becomes a serious threat in pvp.
---
Yeah I'm starting to realize I was wrong about that.
---
Rogues literally want every sword, every hammer and every axe. 
---
it's just annoying after awhile that since they can do most dps with 1h and they can hold 2 1h's they should roll on every weapon..
---
And yeah, a person who would object to a Reserve is totally a rogue player, they drool over everything nice.
---
It's a huge myth that spriests do good damage. The only time their damage is okay is during the very first stage of the level 60 "meta" when nobody really has any spell power and crit and whatnot. As soon as it's normal to have 300+ spell power, other classes scale so much better due to delivery methods. 
---
Spriest damage all comes from three sources: SWP, MF and MB. Two of those are DoTs and the third has a longish CD, and priest gear basically doesn't have crit on it nor are there any crit talents for shadow, so you can pretty much just say that spriests simply do not crit. They also have no instant casts to use while moving, so movement drops DPS to whatever SWP ticks for.
---
About half of the DPS also comes from MF, a channeled spell with a huge visual component, which means DPS takes a gigantic nosedive in real PvP because you don't get to just stand there and channel back-to-back MFs in any situation that matters. Imagine a frost mage if Frostbolt was just on cooldown half the time, that's basically how it plays.
---
So any given amount of spell power improves a spriest's damage output so much less than it will for other classes. It isn't doubled on crits, there aren't insta-casts to weave in while moving, and it's way harder to get the same level of gear as a warlock or mage anyway because of itemization.
---
It is possible but only if you bounce between the 3 starting zones while leveling. A bit tedious but it does work.
---
Im pretty sure they got it all backed up
---
How do you set this up!  This will be really helpful, thanks.
---
Yep. People are saying they have it in their 1.12 clients, but if they do they are modified clients.
---
Ahh, the good ol' face-melter
---
I'm a paladin player first and foremost, so I have no issues with hybrids or the hybrid tax, but yeah, I get why most people don't like it. Wish I could get over my aversion, because the class fantasy of druids is pretty cool, but its ok.
---
SM quest and RFD quest, rest you take what you get.
---
You have a modified client. Auto-loot was introduced in the [TBC prepatch 2.0.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1)
---
Pservers are an emulation of the game, they are not 100% accurate (often by design) and should not be used as a reference.
---
"Thank you u/SoupaSoka for bringing this to our attention. Release mobed to 2020!" :P
---
I was like 11... I "borrowed" \~100g from a guildie to buy The Lobotomizer (dagger from AV) and he pestered me every day for that money. UNLIKE YOU I was a little piece of shit and put him on ignore and left the guild. Ended up re-rolling horde on my brothers server and I SWEAR TO GOD like 4 months later I get a message from this dude on a level 1 saying it was him and to give him his fucking gold. Basically to get my first epic item I ruined all my friendships on the server, left my guild, and quit my only level 60 character. 
---
In summary, pay your debts, don't be an asshole, and don't sacrifice friendships, reputation, and a level 60 character for 100g. lol
---
Haha, learned something new. Embrace your blessing-bros when classic comes ;)
---
I remember when I was raiding as warlock in WOTLK I had 45 skills keybound/mousebound to shortcuts easily reachable (using ctrl and shift modifiers).
---
It was a little more than my other classes haha
---
I used to raid with this guy and hang out in vent a lot. We actually started a raid guild in BC lol
---
Fun yea but its pretty objectively one of the weaker classes
---
I did the same, while checking whether I remember correctly about addons enabling auto looting. I could not find the option in the regular setting nor did any of the addons I tried give the option.
---
I love me some blessing bros.
---
Skinning/LW +Herb/Alch. Can prove to be useful for both players, are you going to be two Leather users?
---
That's a great story, what a good guy!
---
Had a hunter and we were taking a shortcut to the Dark Iron Anvil by jumping down from the Domicile to the path below that lead to Lord Incendius circling the Anvil. I looked at my portrait to check on my health after the jump and was wondering "Why am I in combat?", looking around me to see what was fighting. I then saw my pet running towards me from the opposite side of the Anvil with Fineous Darkvire, many Golems and black iron dwarves following. And of course, Lord Incendius joined in the merry chase as my bear passed by him.
---
Quickest Wipe Ever.
---
It's fine i'll get my guild mates to run BRD with me and they'll want me to get the item I desire while gathering their loot from other bosses and potentially still getting a good drop or two from the last boss even if masterloot is on.
---
You have to understand some necessary items (or very strong items) have &lt;2% chance to drop from an end boss in some cases... You're not about to run 50 times, have the item drop, and some noob with 1/10th of his pre-raid BIS out roll you on a need. It's just not realistic.
---
The blessings are mighty strong buffs
---
you have this problem now ? you are going to loose your job when wow is out xD
---
2h fury is completely fine. It is actually better than dw for both horde and alliance in mc due to the aoe nature of the fights, and still better for horde in bwl than dual wield. The playstyles are different for horde and alli; horde you spam hamstring between bt/ww for windfury procs, and alliance you slam between bt/ww with excess rage. 
---
It is worth noting that 2h can become significantly stronger for horde in classic if blizzard does not implement everything correctly down to the last detail, as many players are worried blizzard will not correctly implement windfury resetting your swingtimer.
---
Dude these videos are great! And whats funny is the style of these videos fits my best friends personality great. I cant wait to show him these videos. Thank you man!

Has a good list at around the 25 minute mark
---
Ah, the famous vanilla axe-rogue!
---
I dont have any pinky fingers on both hands (born like that) so for me clicking shift means moving my entire left hand. Auto loot solves this problem for me. I agree nochanges but this to me is just a feature that doesnt effect gameplay...
---
Running around the plains of Mulgore.  I immediately started playing the soundtrack of Last of the Mohicans.
---
We never actually saw him so...
---
Thank you for passing on the blessing of knowledge, I feel buffed :)
---
"Yo... why is it suddenly masterloot?"
---
... *Complete Silence*
---
*Pulls boss during awkward silence*
---
Define good gear
---
I was around level 14 on my first toon (a Tauren warrior) and I was exploring the Barrens. After discovering the boat in Rachet I decided to hop on and see where it took me. When I got to booty bay it was chaos. Corpses all over the place, alliance kill horde, guards killing alliance. I remember asking in general if alliance could spare from killing me as I was new and I remember someone responding in chat with, ‚Äúok. We won‚Äôt. Lol‚Äù
---
&gt;Right, so still no argument here
---
Just like you have no argument why it should be added.
---
&gt;Also, comparing auto looting to other features that did have an actual impact on the game is kinda ... retarded
---
Auto-loot would have an actual impact in the market and gold making meta like I explained before about rogues.
---
&gt;I guess we are done here.
---
True, you really showed everyone that you have no idea what you are talking about, never played rogue (shift + pickpocket lmao), had to go through 3 replies just to realize auto-loot addons dont exist, you are the retard here, buddy.
---
Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. I just did a bit of research and I could not find any addon that does it. But since holding shift allows you autoloot anyways it did not really matter that much. It was just slightly inconvenient.
---
The alternative to not being upfront with reserves is....
---
tam tam tam tam....
---
...simply not inviting your class to the group in the first place. People like that better?
---
At least with reserves the door is still open for everybody, regardless of class.
---
As for who gets to reserves something to begin with, well it the one who put sin the effort to form the group. Which could be you!
---
Shaman. I like how the class has complexity and a lot of buttons to press but totems and the theme of shamans never clicked with me.
---
Noo.... NO... Lose your progress. Like, all of your progress. Raids, gathering gear tiers, gathering profession mats and recipes, gathering rep..
---
Oh but you can keep your useless mounts though.
---
He said he was level 40 in the first sentence of the post?
---
Look... I know the Orc Shaman has axes passive.. but I'm THE ROGUE! 
---
I *clap* need *clap* good *clap* weapons!
---
Calling June 18th.
---
I think about what I want from the game at 60. Paladin does this for me. I want to be like wowhobbs back in the day. I'm gonna try and find good aoe spots, and find ways to make tons of gold. I want to get my professions up, even the secondary ones. I want to get a darkmoon faire deck card.
---
leveling speed is definitely slower on fire. They kill marginably faster, but fire just eats mana. Frost becomes very efficient once Frostchanneling is unlocked. 
---
Not  to mention that fire dies a lot faster than frost does.
---
Auto loot with the toggle was in the game since 2.0.1 TBC pre-patch. The only difference between vanilla WoW's auto loot and later versions is that you had to press and hold shift on the keyboard.
---
*Not* the same thing as AoE loot at all.
---
The great rogue vs mage class choice debate has been raging on for over a year has really throttled my productivity, even more so lately with all this news coming out. Send help pls
---
Is there a particular aspect of the game you are excited to get back into and focus on with a single character? Dungeons, Raids, PvP, Farming, RP? I feel like knowing kind of what you want to do will help us help you choose a class that feels rewarding to play in that part of the game to help you not want to change.
---
As someone else with an a minor case of Altoholism, I respect your desire to try and cure yourself this time around and the best of luck to you!
---
Oh man. I've been waiting for this one.
---
I refuse to join any run that has anything on reserve even if i'm in high demand and it has 0 effect on me.
---
I don't care if it's a tank and they are making life easier by filling a run quicker. I would rather tip them then let them reserve.
---
Everyone in the party is putting in just as much time and effort, everyone deserves a chance at the gear. The only exception I can see if PuG Raids where certain very rare stuff like legendary quest items are on reserve.
---
Why won‚Äôt Classic server players be as try-hard or toxic?? A group of guys from my old guild are talking about going back for Classic because there‚Äôs no flying and they want to camp Redridge and Duskwood without doing any raids or anything, just griefing.  I declined and am playing alliance, but there‚Äôs going to be A LOT of griefers coming back to blow off steam being sociopaths camping lowbies
---
I still have mine in the closet ready to go.
---
I always go with the halfway point in /played being about lvl 40-42. Maybe 45-47 if youre not familiar with high level questing, where you bounce rapidly between zones compared to the pre 40s
---
The AR is the best phase 1 two hander outside raid and bonus point it's not BOP, so it's easier to get it as a hunter.
---
Why would you dual wield in PVP ? You're not going to stay long in contact so I thought a 2 hander would be the best (and with blue gear you have almost no +HIT so DW will miss a lot) : hit once but really hard and be gone.
---
That is correct. The "clearcast fishing" with downranked AoE spells is only a p.server thing. Which is good imo.
---
Yea you are right.  For some reason I remember a pet from v-day..
---
Hey Alenya I might be late to the party, but I have a question for you. I'm sure you and Umbra have put countless hours into your guide, but don't you think there's some improvements to be made if you guys are rank 3-4 if I remember correctly in current 1-20 speedruns? I think your time was about 1-2 hours behind. Possibly a better setup for the later levels?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs because on most private servers they use tbc stuff so it isn‚Äôt truly a 1.12 client most of the time.
---
great pic.
---
It's really not that unlikely. The most improbable thing about it is critting three times in a row which, with like 70% chance, is still decent. The rest is just a matter of getting off 2x Frostbolt and a CoC while the target is frozen. With Frost Nova and Frostsnap, you can usually make that happen. Mages are good, yo.
---
never try nervous mage üôà
---
This. Priests and paladins are going to wipe away all of your magic damage. ALL of it. You‚Äôll land your curses though, so congratulations on that I guess...
---
Hi, my name is SoupaSoka. I don't tend to get overly excited about things because I'm a scientist. This means I love graphing how excited people are about classic wow as my way of sharing my excitement for classic wow. It seems to be linked to how hyped I am. Wait until you guys see the graphs that will come. I'm not even excited enough yet to understand the data. You'll just have to wait for my excitement graphs.
---
WC2 was the first PC game I bought as a kid. It was a blast, especially the Map Editor!
---
I remember vividly how I fantasized about Warcraft as a child, even thinking about how cool it would be if there was a game, where you could play as one of the characters with your friends, so I kind of wished for WoW years before it was getting developed. I didn't know what an RPG was or even an MMORPG, but I knew I loved the special kind of fantasy world Blizzard created.
---
So, no more flying orcs ? :(
---
&gt; Just like you have no argument why it should be added.
---
But I did:
---
* You could auto loot anyways by holding shift
---
* It is of no consequence regarding difficulty or efficiency
---
* But it makes looting a bit more convenient
---
&gt; Auto-loot would have an actual impact in the market and gold making meta like I explained before about rogues, it would also boost mage aoe farming even more.
---
I already made a compromising suggestion that it could the way it is for rogue pickpocketing, as it does indeed make them a bit stronger. And I do not see how it makes aoe farming any more efficient, if they still have to go up to every corpse and auto loot anyways by holding shift
---
I am not even going to dignify the rest. You are just a #nochanges fanatic.
---
I seriously hope that dynamic weather will make a comeback in classic.
---
Yea he's probably more shocked that somebody did it in 10 days on release with no information to go on at all rather than 10 days in general.
---
Since we're playing in 1.12 and BRD will be there at release, why this belt wouldn't be in the drop tables in phase 1 ? Do you really think they will do that progressive itemization ?
---
IMO if the instance is in game, all the drop tables in it are definitive.
---
Chinas been downing content with an entire roster of 350 ping so i think youll be fine
---
Mage my friend, mage.
---
"It's peanut butter jelly time"
---
Probably because it was a child or close to it. It was 12 years ago. I just found it interesting.
---
The funny thing is most private servers use a modified version of tbc. None of them are #nochanges.
---
There is nothing wrong with auto loot as a toggle. The only thing you could say against it is rogue pickpocket. But that is easily solved and honestly not a big deal
---
What private server is that?
---
Nah, you'll be fine. You may have to be a but more predictive than normal but just dont try to play "how young can I give my tank their first heart attack" and you'll be fine.
---
Them sweet sweet priest racials BROOOO!!!!
---
I just put those people on ignore. It was awkward when an officer &amp; a couple other people in my guild started doing it, though. (Maybe I'm in the wrong guild.)
---
I played solo most of the time, all I really did was grind dungeons, so I‚Äôm looking to get the full Classic WoW experience, I want to join a guild and make some friends, get into PvP, and eventually try out the Raids.
---
Agree, as do undead. Love em
---
I dont see a problem as long as it is still fair. Like, if I run a dungeon and only need 1 specific item, its not unreasonable to reserve that 1 item. However if there are multiple drops and I roll on them WHILE reserving the best ones... thats just dickish
---
Hollandaze. Is that a fellow chefbro i see?
---
This is why no one runs affliction in pvp really. Most the pvp specs are nuke damage builds.
---
Yes it did and if you were new and bought ah gear and every skill having 100g at 40 was rarer. i just started a new account on a private server and I‚Äôve been testing some low level money makers and so far I‚Äôve cracked 10g in about 15 hours from scratch. With a bank alt and a lvl 17 warrior.
---
Oh I have no idea. WoW tokens are expensive though, that's for sure. Nobody has that just lying around, you need to farm to even begin to earn that kind of gold.
---
What I‚Äôm playing because BFA is boring as hell with no insensitive to do anything other than raid with raid group 2x a week
---
Legit made it to exactly 32 on my dwarf pally. Lol
---
&gt;You could auto loot anyways by holding shift
---
Not the same as just looting the mob, shift looting also had a minor delay, so its not auto loot like TBC where you get it instantly.
---
&gt;It is of no consequence regarding difficulty or efficiency
---
Yes, it is. It would increase the efficiency.
---
&gt;You are just a #nochanges fanatic.
---
And you are just a bfababy that wants QoL changes in classic.
---
Maybe classic is more balance? They are rebranding modern wow so the coeficients could differ?
---
They have mentioned sharding the initial starting zone. It‚Äôs not clear yet what the plan is.
---
Yeah, if it's someone going for a .01% drop mount or an epic that I wouldn't use anyway, I generally don't care. When people reserve things I can use, it's a show-stopper.
---
They already confirmed 1.10 items arent in the game till aq phase
---
This is uncanny.
---
Can't decide on orc shamen or human paladin:( I do have tricks with the shaman:D
---
Make sure to go tailoring. You can craft some nice stuff to remain somewhat competitive. It wont be until AQ and stuff comes out that you'll start really falling behind though if you're still playing pvp wise, unless you reach certain ranks to buy the pvp gear instead.
---
That said, I don't think raiding is going to take nearly as much time and effort that original launch did. People are MUCH more knowledgible about everything now. Even gear to shoot for that's BiS is way different then what I remember people going for back in the day. It's way more fine tuned.
---
The cherry on top is the debuff limit from day 1 will be 16 instead of 8 as well. This is going to have a pretty large impact on clear speed.
---
Outside of maybe the first week or two of raiding for most guilds getting used to 40 people and whatnot again, I expect most raids to be full cleared in an hours time most likely. It probably wont be 3 hours a night x2-3 days a week.
---
Does battle.net work? Any games going?
---
It's not currently present in the beta targeting keybind menus. For reference, the functionality IS present in keybind on retail.
---
Hunter was boring as shit for me too. Strangely enough, I absolutely loved playing my lock though.
---
He could have played the beta to get some idea, but yeah it would have been a lot harder than now.
---
I meant in context of the guy giving him 100g. You are absolutely right he did mention 40 in the op.
---
I have 1.12.1 client that I had on a backup harddrive that I use to play on Pservers and Autoloot Corpse is there.
---
Look at this retail nub. I bet you didn't know you can roll orge in classic either hahahahhshahahahahahhshahahahhshahahahahahhshshshshshhsshhshshshshshshhshshshhshshshshshshhshshshshshshshshshahhahdjektojccjsnb2nxkcolendurkedjijrikkdkwisiiidiroksnfnalllp0eiodojokkkdonttouchmeinsterilenxjfixhdusizneikzjsidksjcieknzoeldmdmdoorhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Mulgore is amazing, probably my favorite starting zone.
---
Ruin the leaders server rep? Lmao, what a tool you are.
---
interesting, I never saw the screen shot of the ding, like was readily available after every expansion after
---
I played destro lock from Vanilla to Cata. Always enjoyed it. My guild managed to beat Lich King 10 man heroic a week before Cataclysm release.
---
Good times.
---
Wondering this question myself. Mained mage in Vanilla and basically did everything except fulfill T3/Atiesh and tried every build except elemental. Very much thinking of going lock for something new, to try the \*other caster\*, but on a 60 PvP server I feel helpless against warriors and rogues up in my grill. The mobility and nova/ice block of mage was very much missed, though I love the methodical lock gameplay otherwise. Reading all the responses here
---
I'd be very happy to have aoe looting in vanilla. I consider myself a purist but this is just a no brainer subtle improvement imo.
---
Paladin, cause Horde for life son
---
I have such fond memories of playing vanilla wow, I know it may not live up to my expectations and the grind will wear away at some of my nostalgia, but I'm honestly stoked!
---
He's seriously irritating. I blocked him on YouTube.
---
Haved tried Multiplayer, as I havent even tried getting on the internet in Dosbox.
---
I was a huntard aswell. Never learned abilities, pets kept running away from me, auto shot my way to 25 or something and never left the barrens.
---
It doesnt get any better than this!
---
watch the video with sound xD
---
"soon have"  ??  They have ONE MILLION.  lol.
---
No, it's just a sandbox server.
---
Unless I‚Äôm thinking of a different AR, it adds strength (completely useless) and a small amount of Stam for an outrageous price considered it will be a fresh server. Assassination blade, tooth of Eranikus, warmonger, barbarous blade, or duel wielding for more stats, crits or more agility
---
It was added to the client in 2.0.1 so your client has to be modified.
---
Blizz employees have access to play the beta. Beta invites to the plebs haven't gone out yet.
---
I agree IG activities have influence IRL, but genuine player to player engagement requires some possibility of negative experiences. In OP's case, meaningful moral behavior could only be demonstrated because there was the risk OP might take the money and run.
---
Did you even bother watching the video before rushing here?
---
Just a theory - all we know for sure is "Summer 2019" but the theory is sometime in mid to early July... I wouldn't put too much faith in that just yet, though.
---
There are other games that I have a huge sense of nostalgia for, because I grew up with them, like: Dragon Age Origins and Mass Effect 2. 
---
Like bruh... I tear up just hearing the original legends of azeroth track.. I dunno how to explain it.. It's just filled with feels. I guess I had so many great experiences back then. I was 8 at the time I tried the trial, and then bought the game the next week.
---
I remember my older sibling helping me install the 5 discs on our family PC, overnight, because back in 2004 my net was not as good. But then that might've just been 2004.
---
I remember checking out the old game website, with it's background of tirisfal glades. As a kid, all this spooky stuff with those big grey hooded statues holding their swords, was all so interesting. 
---
I remember opening the game's box for the first time and just reading all the awesome stuff on the cover. And as a kid I actually made a massive tear in the middle of the box, because I didn't know how to open it. Hahahaha. Never bought a game with a box. Though I always wanted to. It's like those massive hardcover fantasy books, they look so cool, but I'm stuck with my paperback ones because I can't afford them. Well, anyway, I was so in awe of the Diablo 2 advertisements in the leaflets that were included in the game's box, as well as that "forum" or "news letter" on their "website" advertisement. It had a human warrior/paladin with some cool chainmail armor on it. And it was in a black and blue background, which was so mysterious. I know that sounds stupid xD
---
Sorry I'll stop typing, far too much already.
---
Getting into a raiding guild in classic is similar to retail. You have to show you're serious typically. Make sure you farm most if not all of your BiS preraid stuff. Know your rotations etc (way easier in vanilla, most rotations for raids were 1-3 buttons).
---
I think raids are going to be a lot easier then it was during original release. People have a lot better knowledge of the game, BiS lists are way better, addons make life easier, the API is going to be the newer version making the game smoother etc.
---
Outside of people getting used to a large 40 man raid again, I believe raids are going to be full cleared in a single night in 1-2 hours quickly. I don't think it'll be multiple nights of 3+ hours to clear just MC.
---
SWTOR is a WoW clone for sure, but it copies the expansions rather than the original game. Classic is a much more open ended and social experience.
---
&gt; Not the same as just looting the mob, shift looting also had a minor delay, so its not auto loot like TBC where you get it instantly.
---
I just tried it on a 1.12 p-server client. It was instant, although it's p-server, so who knows. Anyway, if there was a delay back then, then keep the delay. There is just no upside in having to have to hold shift every time.
---
&gt; Yes, it is. It would increase the efficiency.
---
How on earth would that do that? If everything else stays the same, just not having to have to hold shift every time cannot possibly make it quicker.
---
&gt; And you are just a bfababy that never played the game back in the day and wants QoL changes in classic.
---
I have never played any expansion after MoP and barely even played cata and MoP. And I did play vanilla back then on official servers. So ... you were saying?
---
Where's demon hunter?
---
&gt; Your experience is wrong then. Typically when people refer to summer they are refering to the season which is the astrological definition.
---
Not only are you wrong, you're also a douche. You have no idea what my experience is. It can't be "wrong". That isn't how that works. You also do not know how people talk about the Seasons in every country on the planet.
---
What a waste.
---
I played in Vanilla but not on pservers. I remember reserved loot being a thing. People definitely made it known they planned to Need on certain things.
---
AOE looting is not the same as auto looting. And I am not for AOE looting in the slightest.
---
yeah, but the first screenshot was a character named Tipsfan or something dumb like that.  What Dev would do that?
---
And then the invites will be sent to a limited amount of people who've signed up for WoW betas.
---
Those are the most useful skills for life though brother! No shame in that! :)
---
I used to get way hyped for Pok√©mon but most of the original DS Pokemon games turned out to be very disappointing in terms of graphics, even by GameFreak standards
---
blizz wont tell us shit
---
That's not how WoW works. It's not like other games.
---
What is the price range looking like?
---
The only can‚Äôt miss weapons would be dungeon quest awards and those should come up naturally as you‚Äôre levelling. Off the top of my head I remember the SM quest reward being good for a long time. Then Thrash Blade from Maraudon, which is basically a right of passage for rogues.
---
Bc had beginnings of group finder?
---
I don't remember anything like that. If you mean meeting stones, they came in vanilla.
---
Alliance
---
Thing.
---
It's honestly so dumb. Let's downgrade blues to greens Pepega
---
My favourite expansion, though I recognize that many beg to differ.
---
You're exactly the kind of person we're looking for in our guild, eager, passionate, yet not hardcore.  
---
We focus a lot more on the having fun, then the getting it done.  
---
And we've got a bunch of people who know a lot about wow and would be happy to discuss class pro/cons with you.  
---
PM me if you want to join and I can add you to our discord server.
---
Yeah exactly my point; no one cares if auto loot is a toggle keybind or on/off in the UI. Autoloot addons will exist nonetheless
---
we still dont know shit even anything taken from the pre beta build is pure speculation because they coupd 0lan to change anything
---
6 weeks here in Tech
---
I said I wouldn't respond and honestly this is a waste of my time.. like talking to a brick wall but whatever.  Why would it matter what summer means outside of the origin of the speculation?  We are trying to figure out when the game will release, which will be in "summer" according to Blizzard, a California, USA company.  It honestly doesn't matter what you think summer is it matters what blizzard does.
---
I'm not shitting on anyone.  I'm annoyed I have to tell people to use google to figure out when summer is.  It's really easy just google when summer is why am I teaching you how to google easily available information?  It's a waste of my time and honestly I don't know why I keep trying with you.
---
Not realizing that stats like int were more important that armor for a mage.... I had no idea what int was, didn't care. I would just wear whatever looked cool.
---
They do it because they can. A tank knows that he can put items like Ironfoe on reserve and people will still join, because people need other items from the instance and the chance of it dropping is low. Putting more common items that everyone needs from the instance like the dal'rend's or truestrike shoulders is pretty retarded, however.
---
Realizing there was an AH I could buy gear, until then I bought my gear from the vendors, the shitty white gear without any stats.
---
Back then, people didnt care about world firsts, racing, or blowing through content to prove you are the 'best'.  That wasnt the point, that is why it wasnt posted all over, nobody cared.  Its not a competition, its a role playing game at heart.  Just for having fun.
---
At level 10 you have barely scratched the surface, most classes come into their own in the 20's, where the game becomes much more fun for me. You'll just have to be disciplined and stick to one character.
---
I wish the in-game assets for wow used a smart contract blockchain system. Then we could have all sorts of awesome automation with gold tokens and in game non fungible assets. Having a credit rating and loan system would be easy
---
I exclusively listen to Vietnam Era Rock starting with Fortunate Son while in STV.
---
Dwarves have racial Treasure Tracking in Vanilla don't they? (shows chests on your mini map) Also just reminded myself of hunters having like 20 different tracking skills, haha.
---
Nice resource, I saved it for Classic release. Thanks!
---
This is awesome.  WoTLK was definitely the high water mark for WoW. 
---
I have many fond memories of that WC3 manual since I was freaking obsessed with that game when it came out.
---
Man I love Mulgore and Thunder Bluff. Memories of me and two of my school buddies making Tauren and getting to level 7 before calling it a night, after discussing our great plans for our characters :). My lone warrior is still there in Bloodhoof Village, tucked away on a server somewhere. I haven't seen or spoken to either of those guys in a decade. Ah I can't wait to visit it again.
---
Its fine if the reserved loot is all that GM or leader is taking from the instance. When its like ‚Äúthese two items are reserved AND im still rolling on any other gear‚Äù its pretty fucked
---
&gt;  you get new weaknesses like anything that can heal, since you do low DPS as SL.
---
I don't see how anything that can heal will be able to kill an SL lock.
---
While its much newer, i just cant seem to level a monk anymore.  I actually mained one when they first came out, but after a raid tier or so i stopped playing it.
---
I dunno what it is.  I dont really tank much anymore (poor memory and not a fan of active mitigation), and for whatever reason the healing just isnt fun for me.  The only mdps i ever really enjoyed much was rogue, and WW just isnt fun for some reason.
---
Warrior ive never been much of a fan of, either.  I did fine tanking dungeons with them, but it was just kind of 'meh'.
---
Ive had multiple hunters as well, but the only time i really, really enjoyed them was with BoA gear in low level BGs in Wrath/Cata.
---
I'm certain every Hunter will feel good about getting Lacerate over Wyvern sting.
---
I don't necessarily mean gold \*sellers\*, I mean actual players just going out and grinding mobs for gold. I have no idea how the economy works in BFA, but I would be surprised if farming mobs for gold was still around, given that it had already been largely phased out in favour of dailies and gathering professions by Wrath. In Vanilla though, it's one of the best ways to farm gold in the game, and the sheer amount of time it takes to individually loot every corpse is a major factor in how their efficiency.
---
Yeah, or have Shadowcraft Boots (rogue D1) with 21 Int.
---
Ironfoe?
---
This is amazing, didn't expect this quality regarding the animation, great job! Subbed and can't wait for his next quest! :D
---
Dynamic weather and Dark nights are two things that are kinda make or break for me. Immersiveness is important.
---
Powerful mage dual wielding massive fireballs? Check
---
On or Near Karazhan? Check
---
Fighting the Legion at all cost? Check
---
How is this brown haired fancy cloaked mage fighting legion on top of Karazhan not Medivh exactly?
---
Oh yeah
---
:sigh:  
---
Been waiting to play a High Elf Ranger going on 23 years now.......
---
Sometimes i really miss Wrath destro.  It sucked that there wasnt much of a way to *really* max out your dps, but the rotation was always smooth and i actually didnt mind not having a bunch of CDs to use.
---
I'm going warlock. I have a leveling guide that i'll follow to a T to save money. I should easily be able to go up to 60 without spending anything on respeccing.
---
At 60, I plan on going the starting raid spec that is also good in PvP. It's not amazing but it's good. I'll make it work but it depends at the time what i'm focusing on. If i'm pvping 90% of the time i'll go a more pvp focused build instead.
---
I think the most important thing at 60 is, you kind of want a jack of all trades spec if possible. You don't want to go pure pvp unless that's all you want to focus on. You want something you can get gear via dungeons on, but also farm solo and maybe delve some pvp as well. Not every class has the luxury I guess of a jack of all trades spec but just food for thought!
---
Gold as a fresh 60 is so insanely important. Vanilla has HELLA running around. Mobility is so big, you want regular and epic mount as soon as humanely possible.
---
Death to min/maxers *grabs pitchfork*
---
Both horde and alliance have quest reward swords from RFD, SM and of course, thrash blade. 
---
Those are the milestones I'm looking to hit and just roll with whatever drops/rewards I get inbetween. Thrash blade is just a hair below pre-BiS and honestly is perfectly fine for your mainhand going into MC, so that is the one that is a stone "can't miss". Luckily it's a quest reward so no worries about hoping for a drop.
---
Its just a normal human mage
---
Of course. Seen it drop retail during BC, so i've made it a point to get one for myself this time.
---
How good is sageblade?
---
Well good news, level 60 warlock presses curse, then shadowbolt!
---
AoE works on empty servers. In Classic your life will be spamming Frostbolt for 56 levels and 2 raid tiers.
---
If you have the tanks, the group will fill up. Healers won't need any of the items you reserve, so they'll also join. Dps are plenty.
---
He downloaded a client and made a server to explore features on and called himself that retarded name its not a blizzard employee
---
Not great for the money.
---
I've definitely watched them all =)
---
I guess. I just don't see very many fireball dual wielding mages fighting off legion on Kara.
---
These are hilarious, keep it up!
---
Its a cinematic you know ?
---
Yeah depends, I just swear 90% of reservers are see are rogues reserving baron cape, an item from a zone with basically 0 tank gear. Good luck with that.
---
But I don't remember any email address connected to my old blizz login. I don't have a phone connected to it either. I don't even have a blizz account tbh :D 
---
Back in vanilla it was a seperate entity so wasn't connected to battle net like todays network.
---
So i guess it's a lost cause?
---
Can someone make that meme with strong arms and one is r/wow and one is r/classicwow and they clasp over hating  Myri0?
---
I would but I just woke up.
---
Pretty sure its in a weird place under Interface Options &gt; Display.
---
These books never mentioned talent specs?
---
When you go from a vanilla server to a tbc server the first thing you notice is not having to hold shift each time you loot. If they left it in it wouldn't be the end of the world but I think it should be disabled. Make them hold shift. Who cares? That's how it was back in the day. The whole spirit of classic is you have to work hard to achieve your goals. The game doesn't hold your hand or give you any help you have to overcome this world on your own and part of that is having to manually loot.
---

Here‚Äôs time from his most recent run on repack. I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre ‚Äúserious‚Äù your goal should be x% quicker than these.
---
It's a sandbox, meaning there are no npcs/mobs spawned in, unless you manually do it, and even then you can't attack them, or I haven't figured out how yet. I was going to test front stabbing and some stuff, but it's just not possible yet. Afaik.
---
What I do know though, is the og unarmored epic mounts are in the game, as well as the armored versions. That was the coolest thing I did so far.
---
Deep frost and Elemental are your only options.
---
Yes! I'm glad to see this is picking up steam! There's incredible potential in this series and hope to see it explode in popularity. Thanks for putting out more content for us Gorak.
---
Roger, thought the client was the original 1.12 client and values were modified. Didnt know they modded the client itself
---
People usually only reserve a specific item, more than that is ridiculous (ironfoe emp/jump runs for instance). But keep in mind people do this indirectly all the time; they simply won‚Äôt invite you. 
---
‚ÄúSry already have a rogue/hunter/mage/whatever‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs not like having two mages in a 5 man is bad for anything but reducing the loot per mage/cloth wearer.
---
20-30 the whelplings in wetlands are super good if you can get there early and farm abit uncontested. I stayed there from like 23/24 to 28 and needed 45min/lvl on a hunter
---
July 16, 23, 30 would all work for me with 16 being preferred.
---
No they don't lol. Most TBC pservers are bad because replicating TBC is so difficult.
---
Most private servers use a modified 1.12 client.
---
plus maraudon q
---
Yeah it was fun not watching Dots cool down.
---
Alright, so there's two classes that are clearly just the winners of vanilla, and that's warrior and mage. They're just superior and there's no way around it. It's no mystery why they're the two most played classes on any server.
---
Mages have it all. Let's look at it piece by piece:
---
**Solo:** Mages are exceptional levelers if you can AoE grind. It has been difficult to do on some of the biggest pservers because of overcrowding, but if you can get to do it, it's insanely effective and lucrative. Mages also happen to be some of the best gold-farmers, although it remains to be seen how Classic instances work out. It *will* be a little slower than on pservers where you can reset yourself back to the entrance, but even if you can't, mages remain the best for farming DM:E which is better than just about anything short of a hunter soloing DM Tribute. Mages can also farm in BRD and various other places. Teleporting around is a massive convenience. If times get tough, you can sell portals all day for steady income. Top solo and moneymaking class, even without the pserver instance reset trick.
---
**Dungeons:** Mage is pretty much the only DPS class that is actually sought-after for dungeons. You will never hear "LF1M DPS Strat, need fury warrior!" People want sheep and water, and getting groups as a mage is about as easy as it is for healers. You will get your pre-raid BiS faster than any other DPS class except warriors who can tank the dungeons. The ability to portal the group also shaves a not insignificant amount off the time it takes to do an instance--seriously, it's easily 10 minutes of not waiting for people to get on zeppelins and shit. And the class is frankly just pampered; ask warlocks and priests how hard it was to get the patterns for their epic class robes. Yours is a common drop from LBRS trash.
---
**Raids:** Everyone knows raids want mages. Great DPS, great personal survivability, great mana management, and water. I wouldn't go so far as to say that mages have the easiest time getting raid spots of all the DPS classes, mainly because there are so many mages, but it's pretty comfortable. The itemization is excellent as well, and the class is great from start to finish, unlike some who take time to become great (e.g. warlock) or drop off later on (hunter). Mages have special roles in some fights thanks to Ice Block, and often greater DPS uptime than other classes due to Blink. Both also give mages much better surivivability in PvE than pretty much any other class.
---
**PvP:** Mage is widely considered the best all-round PvP class. They can just do everything. Great in 1v1, XvX, premades, solo queue, great CC, great mobility, great defense, great control, range, mana sustain... they even make passable flag runners, for fuck sake. Mages just have it all. And as if it wasn't already a luxurious enough class, its bad matchups are one of the less played classes (warlock) and an even less common spec (shadow priest).
---
Nope, I just checked again ... it's not there. Maybe you have a modified client?
---
That's just wrong. Plenty of people were reserving items back then.
---
When did it go away in retail, and why? I'm playing retail currently and it's obviously gone but I've taken a few breaks and I'm not sure when it happened.
---
July 2. Bet on it
---
I don't mind it used sparingly, especially for BoEs and recipes. Maybe some 2% BiS drop that you desperately need.
---
If you're reserving a bunch of stuff, that's stupid and I wouldn't join the group out of principle.
---
There's no doubt in my mind that they did, I was just too focused on RPing. Like I remember in one of the books it said that Nelfs can choose claws or fangs at a certain level. Idk. 
---
I wish I could find all of my old books I bought.
---
How are you doing the animation?
---
To be fair, I expect Blizzards budget for this is hundreds times higher considering everyone playing will be paying a full subscription fee.
---
Mulgore was the first starting zone I ever started in so it was pretty much my introduction to WoW, I love it so much
---
\^\^\^\^ This
---
Yeah, that's what I thought
---
I have a conference the week with 7/16 so I'm going to request the following week.
---
Realistically I think its going to fall 2 weeks after LFR from 8.2 hits....2nd week of August?
---
Tailoring is kind of a must for any cloth wearer. You can get gear that is almost = to it but it's not the best. Tailoring you can make the robes if you get the pattern that's pretty much BiS for all cloth until BWL gear I believe. Once ZG comes out the 3 piece set is BiS until NAXX for some classes. I know for sure it is for Warlock, not sure about priest/mage.
---
Secondary is up to you. Gathering for money, enchanting is my plan to DE the greens I made as tailor. Not to mention back then getting enchants was a pain.  You couldn't buy it off the AH you had to spam for an enchanter and meet. You can also make your own wands which is pretty big.
---
Engineering is amazing on any class but without mining it's super expensive to level. It's worth leveling though, so don't discount it. Engineering in vanilla had stuff for every class in pve but also pvp. The stun grenades are core to any serious pvper as well as so many of the nifty tools such as the reflect trinkets.
---
It's a tough choice! I'm def going enchanting to start but if I get my epic mount and amass solid gold, I might drop it and power level engineering (unless I have some rare enchant recipes learned).
---
Oh I know, thats exactly why I think an exact representation of the model for Medivh would not have been used back then. But a general representation of Medivh and Karazhan back then...
---
While I don't think auto loot is a huge deal, the "it's a convenience argument" is the rabbit hole that lead down the path to the current (terrible) state of retail WoW. Convenience change after convenience change, you slowly eat away at what made the game challenging and rewarding.
---
It's not.likr I'm going to need it. I just spend so much time in WoW back in Vanilla, and had so many good memories, that I figured I'd maybe buy it for the memories if it's half decent. 
---
I'll take a look around d on eBay and get one if the price is right.
---
This is my favorite kind of post. Reading things like this for some reason reminds me of the old tv show The Wonder Years.
---
I like the optimism! Really hoping to get good, end game loot :)
---
yep fact is itemization in vanilla sucks donkey balls
---
oh didn't remember to cross with BFA stuff, they will take bfa patches into account ofc
---
So we see here differences between those who likes liberty : I have the liberty to create and lead a dungeon group with reservation because everyone is free to not join it if he also wants this item.
---
And the red people : I will ruin your reputation because you are doing something legal in total honesty but I don‚Äôt like this and it breaks my vision of the game !! Each player shall have the same rights in the dungeon. No matters you have created the group and you have taken the time to lead it.
---
üòè
---
Your desktop user is showing haha
---
I was fortunate enough to have the gold for the mount and training at 40, it was the epic mount (even after getting exalted w/ AV) that got me. Luckily, I knew someone who got the money from someone else and didn't have to pay them back. 
---
I'm going to really budget this time tho, not buy the skills I don't need and all that and see if I can pull off getting an epic mount at or very soon after 60.
---
Sorry but I don't recall when exactly it was removed.
---
I assume the reason was to improve performance.
---
Priest is the only class I have never had an inkling of a desire to play.  I've leveled Rogues, a Hunter, a Warrior, a Shaman, a Mage, a Death Knight, a Warlock, and I'm kind of interested in leveling a Druid eventually.  But I'm just not even slightly interested in Priest and I can't really put a good reason on it.  If I'm healing I find Shaman much more flavorful, and if I want to do magic damage I'd much rather play a Warlock.  I don't even have anything *bad* to say about Priests, it's just that they pale in comparison to the alternatives, I guess.
---
My first character was an Orc Hunter. I made it to Razor Hill and started questing with an Undead in the area. At one point the Undead decided it was time to head to Crossroads. I didn't want to go because I still had quests in Durotar and was afraid I wouldn't be able to find my way back (didn't know there was a map).
---
Also, during the quest that is east of Razor Hill where you collect Gnomish tools from a ship wreck I hadn't yet learned that right clicking allowed you to swim down. Instead, I used the angle of one of the ships to push me down in the water just far enough to reach the tools. 
---
I really miss the sense of wonder and discovery that original WoW brought me.
---
ok thank you, sorry if I don't know what that is.  I didn't know anyone would even be able to download the physical files much less use them in any unofficial capacity...
---
No of COURSE it's not Medivh. At this point he'd been dead for ages.
---
If I had to guess where this took place I'd say it was in Silverpine Forest, Hilldbrad Foothills or Arathi Highlands on a now destroyed Church or Library. I reached this conclusion because earlier it shows the Infernals being summoned by a forsaken Warlock and I just assume this guy is fighting his Infernals.
---
Any rogue worth his salt just wants the dal'rend set
---
But we can put in the same amount of time. We all are just not in the place we were fifteen years ago where we could dump tons of time into it at the start.
---
Each person has to decide exactly how necessary to maximizing to fun it is to be able to dump hours in at the beginning and hurry to maximum level. For some people that is fun.
---
ok, I didn't know.  I don't know how all this stuff works.  Thanks for explaining.
---
You're not going to ruin anyone's rep because no one cares what you think.
---
Blizz has got to release the horde equivalent of  the Winterspring Frostsaber WTF?????????  Com'on that aint fair.  #tinychange.
---
Because Medivh had black hair, Atiesh and is dead.
---
They wouldn't release it right before the fourth of July. Its a holiday in the US and most people have it off. If anything, it'd be the 9th.
---
this is Frostganker a lvl 56 fire mage
---
Find a guild?  Join a discord? There are fairly straightforward ways to avoid these type of groups. Those solutions involve being a bit more active in the community which was a big part of vanilla anyway. 
---
what‚Äôs your solution to loot reserved groups? Make a pact here on reddit? That won‚Äôt stop or most likely put a dent into the frequency of these groups.
---
Seriously, your post was totally fine and you stated a fair opinion until your TL;dr. Stop assuming what other people like or do not like. I have played vanilla back in the day when it was retail. I have played vanilla on private servers and I am really looking forward to enjoying it again. But this does not entail that I blindly accept everything the #nochanges crowd wants.
---
Having to hold shift is not a deal breaker for me. With this post I was mostly stating that I find it confusing that there are people who are against the option to toggle auto looting because to me it is a seems like a non issue.
---
1.  There won't be dungeon queues at all, let alone cross server.
---
2.  There probably will be battlegroups.
---
3.  I don't know if it being toggle-able is an option.
---
4.no idea
---
5 maybe way down the line but I bet a relaunch of TBC is more likely
---
How is it that Blizzard would allow anyone access to physically download these files and use them like this before they released them in some official capacity?
---
Find a guild?  Join a discord? There are fairly straightforward ways to avoid these type of groups. Those solutions involve being a bit more active in the community which was a big part of vanilla anyway.
---
I don‚Äòt like playing druid, hunter and mage. Thex just feel wrong when i play them üòÑ
---
You really are.
---
Everyone agreed that the astrological definition is what it is, yet somehow you keep shoving it down everyone's throat. I said that a lot of people talk about "summer" differently, and that in my experience the astrological definition is almost never used in normal conversation. Then you manage to deliver this "gem":
---
&gt; Your experience is wrong then.
---
How the do you know how people speak where I am from? That is such a weird thing to say. Holy fuck man...
---
You are also now twisting the subject from how summer is defined, to Blizz being in California and release date bla bla bla, when all the previous posts were about definition and how summer is talked about by people.
---
It is very possible that you use the strict astrological definition in daily conversations too, and that that is normal where you live. I pretty much never hear that here, yet I don't try to claim that you are lying about how people talk about summer where you are.
---
Yeah, but that‚Äôs why you do guild runs. Want the tank to have Ironfoe? Better do guild lava runs. While I feel like reserving items isn‚Äôt in the spirit of Vanilla, they‚Äôre a response to idiots rolling on items that are better for certain characters. However, the better way to handle it is to discuss it ahead of time. Like ‚ÄúHey man, while this ring might have 10 agility, the 5 defense is my BiS item. Could you not roll on it?‚Äù It serves the same purpose as reserving, but handles it a lot better.
---
Roger, thought the client was the original 1.12 client and values were modified. Didnt know they modded the client itself on pservers
---
Same :(
---
Auto loot should be an option because pressing shift isn‚Äôt hard but it gets tedious.  Aoe loot shouldn‚Äôt be a thing.
---
if you know your old account name, and password or email, and you have your personal ID you can send to them they give it back every time
---
I assume blizzard will be trying to minimize the amount of people on at once.
---
What makes you think this is Karazhan? It looks nothing like Karazhan and the sky would be so much darker if it was (like in Tirisfal Glades).
---
I love Shaman BECAUSE of the totem system. I stopped playing Shaman in retail when they got rid of most of the totems.
---
Solid point. I think the dungeon que is the least likely one I wanted, but figured I would toss it up there.
---
The PVP ques though is one I feel is almost needed once the PVP BGs are all available.
---
If Blizz doesnt stay on top of botting, it devalues everything across the game.  I dont think they realize how detrimental it is.
---
What you are doing here is jumping to the conclusion of the slippery slope. One minor convenience change; e.g. auto looting, which kinda was in the game already to begin with; does not lead to lfd/lfr, flying mounts or whatever else comes to mind. It is a fallacy.
---
I forgot about everything on my old account since i quit before TBC.
---
I emailed with the support for weeks guessing emails, name on credit cards that i think i used (my dads since i was too young) name of first pet, character info on the account etc. Finally they said "close enough, here is your account"
---
Great service.
---
This was my first starting zone. I fell in love with this area. Hands down the most beautiful and serene areas in the game. Gonna have a Tauren alt in classic just to sit in bloodhoof :)
---
Not to mention Medivh swore not to use fire magic after he accidentally killed his pappy with it.
---
He was joking that rogues can‚Äôt use axes in Vanilla.
---
1) Servers should be entirely self contained and no cross server anything. as for Dungeon Queues, the only queue that exists in vanilla for dungeons is via innkeeper and summoning stone. if you want to use those go ahead, but unless  they fix it (Please don't blizzard), it isn't that good of a system
---
2) I'm a wash on this.
---
4) do you mean Add-ons? they existed in vanilla wow.
---
5) right now the goal is an authentic recreation, and for me that means only what was actually released in vanilla.
---
Dungeon Queues? What Dungeon Queues? I think you mean "actually talking to people to people in Trade/LFG/World chat to form a group for your desired dungeon, then actually running to the dungeon entrance yourself through the open world."
---
Early on it's int and stam that are the most problematic. I'll probably get some dung gear and then go at it. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzbcdZVir0obth
---
Might try that, not entirely sure how much i'll need Master of Elements since i'll lose imp. Scorch. Elemental precision i'm not entirely sure on either since we don't know which +hit items will make it into the dungeons pre 1.10.
---
Tips did that himself. 100%.   
---
He steams vanilla severs on another account.   
---
He hosts a sandbox server for background video.   
---
He made this illegal sandbox and plays it off like its a 'fan'
---
I did not know that either, but some people have pointed out that it is a possibility. And I am pretty certain that the client I have is a non-modified one.
---
Pet classes (Lock/Hunter). I hate controlling pets.
---
Just to not feel let down I say August 31.
---
How would a on off toggle for cross server queues work? That there are two completely separate queues, one for people participating in cross server q's and another for people who only want to queue with others on their server?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I remembered my old email when I recovered mine. But I was in a similar situation with one great asset. My original wow discs with the CD key. They were able to look that up and I was able to confirm some info under my account and they restored it for me.
---
Warrior up until mop because they never had a real good Ohh shit button when leveling (I think they got second wind in wotlk) so it was just a pain to lvl one
---
I was a feral druid main.
---
I did not have the gold for a mount.
---
When the PvP sets came out, I ground out my set for the speed bonus.
---
Being able to chase people down on their mounts while sprinting in cat made that time investment totally worth it.
---
My simple way of "reserving loot" was always:   
---
Invite people that don't need the loot.   
---
I refuse/refused to go to "loot reserved" groups.
---
I assumed some of the utility totems would be of similar annoyance but i dont play warlock.  You dont have rely on dots to succeed.
---
If it stated before the run every one know it it like orb reserve in Strath or so.
---
Better that ninja looters or people that cry about reserved items
---
As someone who mains a priest in BFA, and does not have the mog for Benediction... I would 10000% love this.
---
That being said..  I don't think there should be any linked rewards and the games should be separate and not link anything between them.
---
I was going to say I would be fine with it but I think we would get retail players ninjaing items because of it.
---
Exactly.  
---
Let people chose. Do I want to play against people I know. Community component that many people loved. Maybe wait a bit to get a que?  
---
Or say, I don't care who I fight, I just want to get some pvp on. They pick the global que and get into a que for a BG almost instantly. A toggle would basically put you into a que pool that is either larger or smaller. Allows users the choice.
---
Me not that kind of Orc!
---
But then they would have to support the game during the holidays right after a launch. I do not see that happening
---
1.12 or prepatch. Lots use 1.12 and use data from TBC. It is why you will frequently find options like auto loot toggle and improper exp for quests..aka giving TBC exp instead of vanilla.
---
It is a shift click to auto loot toggle.  It is not a toggled box to switch every right click to auto loot.  
---
The right click to auto loot was certainly added in pre tbc patch, not in vanilla correct
---
Doesn't really work with Vanilla. For some items there are multiple specs who want the same item, regardless of the armour the class could use. Pretty much every melee is going to be going after leather pieces and the same trinkets and such. Not inviting the class to the group could mean not inviting over half the classes in the game.
---
Increase your hype by playing Warcraft III. You'll learn a lot, like why the orcs moved to Kalimdor, why Sylvanas is a banshee, and who is the architect of the Scourge.
---
ye for a 15 year old game they could at least lower it but... at least they listened now
---
Me too. Check out this awesome addon I hope makes it to classic.  
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=350kUS3Z8m0
---
Oh I can't stand browsing the internet on the phone, let alone typing anything.
---
&gt; don‚Äôt change the rules during the run I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
Hah, that just reminded me of an old memory from Vanilla that hasn't crossed my mind in forever.
---
I had joined an UBRS run on my rogue. At the start of the instance, the tank/party leader said that one item was reserved - I forget what, probably Draconian Deflector. Other BoP items should be rolled based on need, and for BoE items everyone is free to roll regardless of what the item is.
---
Fair enough. No arguments from anyone.
---
About 3 or 4 pulls into the first room, a skullflame shield drops. Everyone rolls and I happen to win it.
---
Suddenly, the tank/party leader has a change of heart: "WTF! Why would a rogue roll on that?! That's mine, I'm the only tank here!". Starts freaking out in chat and refuses to continue tanking the instance until I give it to him.
---
The party members from his guild take his side, of course, while the other half of the party is on my side since the rules were clearly laid out beforehand. The run falls apart.
---
Then, this guy's guild spent like a week spamming general/trade chat calling me a ninja looter and trying to get me blacklisted from dungeons. I had the presence of mind to take screenshots of the chat window where he clearly stated the rules and his freakout when it went down, so I posted those to photobucket or whatever the image hosting site at the time was and gave links to anyone that didn't trust me after their smear campaign.
---
You use the word snowflake and no one listens pst that point
---
If you don't have that much time, I think you should just go with a Warrior and experience the leveling journey. With grinding low level dungeons and keeping your gear at good level it will be fun. Prepare to tank btw.   
---
 Warriors are very gear dependent and good items will make it fun.
---
Note that this is coming from a player that doesn't have that much experience playing warriors. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I would say that is my main concern, it did obviously exist during vanilla but I can only imagine that type of activity must be a lot more common today. It would be interesting to know if its a current problem in retail atm as I haven't played in many years but the gaming community as a whole today is definitely more toxic in my opinion.
---
It couldn't hurt to ask them and see what they can do.
---
not only would we get players ninja looting, we would see a lot of increased player turnover and mistrust between players too.
---
Imagine this - your guild just got it's first benediction after helping one of your priests unlock it. only for them to not show up anymore because they were only there to get benediction. that hurts 39 other players.
---
What, no mention of guild banks? :)  While I don't advocate for them really.. I wouldn't balk if they ever happened to show up :)   But I also would be incredibly surprised if they ever showed up.
---
Oh no there are other ways to make gold. People don't really mob farm.
---
More honest groups have all-need rule for thing like the horse, sometimes even the recipe. Specific main spec items then get reserved. If groups want to farm the recipe for themselves then they post the rules beforehand and those that agree join. 
---
When doing Rend runs in a partial pug an item dropped that our gearing mt really wanted - but it wasnt reserved. Our guild leader that was in that group went really clear and that the item must be rolled or guild reputation (and honesty) will suffer. Was really surprised how important that was - in a positive way too.

&gt; Let's do this
---
Let's not
---
imo,  No thanks.
---
Also, they‚Äôve made it very clear that they‚Äôre two completely seperate entities that only share a subscription and partially a name
---
Everything indicates that they're making no changes to balance.
---
Darto'ls...I'm gunna miss you Dartol's...
---
Seriously?  This does seem like a problem.
---
oh good im not the only one who believes that...
---
Please bring back the weather effects!!!
---
Honestly, as a Prot Warrior, if I see a group LFTank but has a piece of mail or leather DPS gear reserved, I‚Äôll whisper ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go if I can roll on Mask‚Äù. I still need DPS gear even if I‚Äôm Prot, especially in a raid. But, it means I can get that reserved booted (discouraging loot reservations for items that anyone should get a chance to roll on). If it‚Äôs BiS for multiple classes, and not a meme spec, those people should get to roll. If it is a meme spec, you can get a shot to convince me. But, I‚Äôll only roll need on a bow over a hunter if it‚Äôs Satyr‚Äôs bow (or whatever the phase 1 equivalent is, Wiley‚Äôs Cannon?).
---
I mean it helps that they got sued for 8.500.000$, but I agree that their overall anti cheat is pretty good, both in the legal and in the programming way.
---
If they did remove it, would this apply to other self-crit procs like Warrior's Blood Craze talent, or only Reckoning? I don't see why it's regarded as a bug so maybe I'm missing something.
---
haha i like this one
---
The problem with the first point of servers being self contained is the populations fluctuate and if you are on off hours or any number or other variables, then your gaming experience can be drastically changed in a negative manner. Join a guild that is huge and has enough people in it on at all times? Many people hate not feeling like they are worth anything to a guild. There are entire communities that like playing in smaller groups, but struggle like mad when their core group has a few people missing. The ability to PuG into other randoms that you don't really need to interact with later is a big sell for many people. NOT ME. Devils advocating here for people I know like that.  
---
I agree dungeon ques take away from the community component, but many people loved the ability to que up for a dungeon instead of having to find people to play with. I don't think a que would hurt anything as it allows each user to choose what they want to do. We all know the risks of PuGs.

"This time, I will NOT die..."
---
I'm sorry to say this, but Quality of Life is just not what Classic WoW is about. It's an MMO, and will require a certain amount of time investment to participate in various of its features. If you can't afford to make that time investment, then Classic WoW isn't the game for you. I know it sucks and isn't what some people want to hear, but there are all kinds of other games out there for those with less time to put in. Trying to make classic WoW one of those games is how we ended up with retail.
---
Wrong.  It's always a 1.12 client.
---
Hunter. It‚Äôs strange though because I love them aesthetically more so than most other classes but their mechanics and play style put me off a lot in almost every expansion that I‚Äôve tried them
---
Lol people will just bind one of their macro mouse/keyboard buttons to shift+click.
---
Plus it's just Quality of Life feature which only loots that single mob.
---
Tuesday is the industry wide standard for games these days. I still think June 25th or July 2nd, right around the FFXIV expansion.
---
Because Classic and BFA musn't be linked. And you should let the legitimate Vanilla players feel a bit unique with theirs removed items
---
It's like a selfish request for me : "i wasn't here to get this, it's beautiful please let me have it"
---
I can say I'd be ok with the auto-loot checkbox staying in the interface window so I don't have to shift click loot things... guild bank would be snazzy too just so guilds don't end up sharing a bank character account because guild bank characters are a necessary evil in current iteration of classic so a real guild bank doesn't change anything except make things more transparent and more secure. That is about the scale of changes I'd be alright with.
---
August 6th
---
Ah true.  
---
But they are Californians. Does California even celebrate American Patriotic holidays? /s
---
did the same with Kroll blade, but that thing was actually badass
---
I never understand people that just aggressively assert statements of fact while actually knowing very little on a subject. 
---
Why on earth were you so confident in saying that only 1 is coming to the raid?
---
&gt; Still don't like leveling a pally to not get gear or respect in raids.
---
...What? How do Paladins get shafted on gear and why are they disrespected in raids? I legit have no idea what planet you are from.
---
I don't wanna assume your financial situation, but a dollar a day isn't too bad, if you look at it from that perspective. Plus theres only so much you can do in Lego Batman. 
---
But obviously I have huge bias here because I love Classic.
---
I think it was Cata
---
July 16th based on how they seem to enjoy the middle of the month releases more.
---
I logged into a friends account that pissed me off and stole 8000g from him. He thought it was a chinese gold farmer. Even got his gold back. I never got in trouble. Stayed friends and never told him. Lol
---
That would've been my guess as well.
---
i completely agree. i don't want linked rewards, but apparently there is a little bit of a push for it right now.

"Put your job in the bag"
---
This video his so many nostalgia nerves: gamecam, MS Movie Maker, 4:3 ratio, that mid-2000s trance, uncontrollable immaturity and emoticon usage
---
Some quests are interesting but in general I really don't care about why random jackass Y wants me to gather 10 animal parts.
---
I was thinking skinning/herb as you level up and farm ~2000g for mount, Maidens Circle and Archmage Robe, then switch to Tailoring and Engineering cause I have a feeling herbs will be worth more than ores and it's better to buy it.
---
Doing all the available night elf quests at the appropriate level will in fact get you to exalted by 40. Honestly didn‚Äôt think it was possible, but it is. 
---
Your route should be teldrassil, darkshore, ashenvale, BFD, Stonetalon, Desolace plus quests that five alliance rep. 
---
If you are short by the time
---
You reach 40, there are Darnassus rep quests in Feralas
---
Also, take one of those points out if improved overpower and put it in Anger Managment. The tooltip is wrong, it gives you one rage every three seconds.
---
When you're spending hours mining/herbing, and some bot runs past you, its soul crushing and not fair.  It truly devalues the game, especially if everyone starts doing it.  
---
And dont forget the affect on the economy.  It lowers the prices of the goods youve spent hours farming......  Naaaa, botting is cancer and kills the game.  
---
Folks dont necessarily rage quit over bots, but it screws up the community and makes it toxic, and players definitely quit over that.
---
Pay attention Blizz.  Get it right this time.
---
Humanity is amazingly diverse. I was under some false assumptions about pallys.
---
If I never assert what I think is true, I'll never find out if I'm wrong. And I really don't mind being explained why I'm wrong, I never forget something I've been proved wrong about.
---
Anger Management is an extra 20 rage per minute, so in early gear it's certainly useful.
---
In the fury tree I'd get rid of Booming Voice and definately invest in Piercing Howl. In raids such as AQ20 AoE slow on the Rajaxx packs is very valuable.
---
I get paid more to reddit than actually work.
---
This is awesome! Just what I was looking for (and was actually in the middle of making my own!)
---
How did you come to the 6-day semicasual figures?
---
*tl;dr I don't think it would be as big of a grouping/ninjaing problem as people think, but I do think it would significantly alter the game economy and potentially increase inflation and cheapen existing gold sinks.*
---
I don't think they should actually do it, either. I have some concerns regarding transmog. Whether it would be implemented directly into classic or not the implications are still similar. I don't think it would be a huge enormous problem like some people think, the nature of Classic and relying on your relationship within the community would in itself probably be a pretty effective deterrent to transmog ninjas. But I still believe the problem would exist in some fashion, especially at lower levels when alts are easy to create and new players aren't accustomed to the idea of a server blacklist and no sharding/CRZ to fade into.
---
I'm more concerned, however, with the impact it could have on the economy. Oh, lots of people are trying out WoW to see if they can fill out their transmog collection? I'll just list this generic loot that had its skin removed in the live game in 4.0 for a 300% markup. Somebody will farm the gold to buy it and enjoy on live. That transmog market is a thing, and it was when it was implemented in Cata. There aren't very many effective gold sinks in Vanilla, though. No mammoth mount with vendors, no tokens, nothing like that. I don't think farming a few pieces of transmog and cheapening, say, the epic mount grind is a step in the right direction for example.
---
A simple que makes it into one of those games?
---
So sitting and waiting for pvp is a good thing? It adds to the experience of Vanilla WoW? I personally thought it was just a mechanic that came about as they did not have the technology to allow users to que against other servers. Once they implemented those ques, people really could get into pvp. CASUAL people.
---
I know I am barking up the wrong tree with a log of this community, but casual is what makes or breaks games. Hardcore get their fix and do what they are gonna do, but if the casual crowd burns out or hits too many aimless time syncs, they flame out and move on.
---
A few little QoL things can improve the previous experience just enough to keep that from happening while not taking away from the challenging grind content.
---
I played all the vanilla content. I remember how good/bad it could be. A few suggestions and little tweaks could really help.
---
we're having fun to this day about that one haha
---
Also the trinket for extra swings is nice.
---
Bro you don‚Äôt know the struggle of your pinky getting tired from holding shift down. Shut up üôÑ
---
I used to think the same thing before looking deeper into the paladins kit.
---
I'm not going to play one personally but I definitely want a handful of them in a raid to abuse those buffs and st heals.
---
This is one of the things I love about vanilla, alot of things look one way on the surface , but underneath is things you'd never have imagined :D
---
Thanks! Was planning on running that route.
---
look - you're talking to someone who works nights. so i totally get the "no ones on when i'm on" argument.
---
but LFD was not a part of vanilla, and won't be part of classic. neither was cross connected servers except for Battle Groups.
---
Love the name btw - huge WoT fan.
---
I have a feeling that aoe farming might be nerfed in classic wow. Idk why it just seems like an embarrassing oversight on blizzards part and a little bit OP compared to what other classes can do (for leveling and farming). Do you think the same? Doesn't it seem a little problematic anyway?
---
Le notre dame
---

---
You could always do rule #4 of the sub reddit rules
---
Both solid ideas.
---
Two Evil/awful mechanics that we encountered early on and a little tweak could alleviate those.
---
Remember when your GL would have their computer die and everything in the bank would sit there unless they shared their info? Yeah... that was bad.
---
Looking to level up frost,
---
Favoring single target damage and CC. What‚Äôs a good ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù leveling Frost spec which is good for both solo leveling as well as for world pvp? Thanks!
---
Cause a lot of morons dont wamt obvious QoL changes just cause they are hipsters that want it exactly like old vanilla.
---
Why, I dont know, but people are obsessed with all kinds of things; so why not I suppose
---
Is AoE farming while leveling better than questing as a mage? When should I AoE farm for xp over questing?
---
The tldr is more aimed at retail players who might read my comment. The players who don't enjoy vanilla and want to change classic to be something it was never supposed to be.
---
End of August.  Be prepared!
---
Any source on that or are you just speculating?
---
Thanks,
---
Yeah I think the LFD thing is just one I tossed up there. It is the least needed thing. NO LFD would not hurt me in any way and I could just remove it, but we are too far in now.... :)
---
Whatcha think about the guild bank?
---

I was quite wealthy during my time on WoW. 
---
During BC in a casual guild where nobody really knew each other, a guy asks in guild chat if someone could help him finish the gold he needed for his epic flying mount (5000g). When they asked how much, he said like 4000g or something. I remember everyone laughing at him like he was a lunatic and that nobody would give him that.
---
I didn't like how they made him feel stupid for asking so I proved them all wrong by saying sure because little did they know I was probably one of the richest people on that server and 4000g was a drop in the bucket to me. I hooked him up and he thanked me endlessly and told everyone in gchat, which I enjoyed since they had to eat their own words.
---
Never underestimate the power of asking for help. Sometimes, you just run into the right person at the right time.
---
100% buy it if that‚Äôs your attitude going in. It‚Äôs why I bought it and it‚Äôs worth it lol

I'm not against auto-loot. There's logic in #no-changes movement, and I would vote for pixel-perfect vanilla copy, but it's obvious that Classic will be vanilla-inspired game rather than carbon copy. So there's nothing wrong with auto-loot (or with sound in background checkbox, for example).
---
Yea not for kids lul
---
Dude was the most inspected person ever when he was in org
---
who said anything about removing LFD?
---
it was never in vanilla so it won't be in classic.
---
it's not removing it, it never existed.
---
Guild banks are something i could care less if were added.
---
Not sure why they would nerf it. Each class has unique traits/advantages that other classes can't compete with. 
---
Mages having the ability to AOE farm efficiently and being arguably the best at soloing content is just part of the game and class identity of the Mage. 
---
\#nochanges
---
&gt; Was able to buy my own ~~310%~~ 280%
---
Unless you had Phoenix or Arena Drake
---
If that happens and they end up just rolling out TBC and Wrath classic servers to the same level of success they'll probably laugh themselves to the bank with the fact that they can continue making boatloads of money without even having to design new content.
---
In fact, they're probably already doing this with classic.
---
While I do believe it is him, I dont‚Äôt believe he did it himself.  He isn‚Äôt a very intelligent guy.  He didn‚Äôt even know the cdn existed or how to navigate the build
---
How do you beta test the higher level zones with hundreds of players?
---
I wouldn't want to invest the time it takes to get to a zone like EPL into a character that I am only going to lose the moment beta ends.
---
I added it to the list as you are not the only one to mention this.
---
I liked farming level 60 content in BC / Wrath.  Disenchanting for the rare shards, dust also sold very well.  Runecloth was a lot more rare and sold at good prices but low volume.  Similarly, farming BC stuff in Wrath was fun.  You could pretty easily solo level 70 5-man content depending on class and get a lot more rare stuff, recipes, etc.
---
Warrior may still be a good option man. They can tank and their DPS is dirty w right gear.
---
*280. 310 was introduced in Wrath, even then it was based on specific mounts that you unlocked (Violet Protodrake being the main one IIRC)

'are you going to roll a night elf hunter called legolaz? '
---
I hear you. I'm more interested how you ended up at that conclusion in the first place.
---
Like I wouldn't go into a sub with mechanics asking other mechanics about cars and start trying to answer questions based on my perceived truth. I wouldn't presume to know anything.
---
I'm not saying that's what you are doing here, I'm saying you probably aren't doing that and you picked up some false information you assumed to be true somewhere along the way.
---
Did you base you thoughts on paladins on your own experience in vanilla or did somebody tell you some incorrect info on Paladins? Just curious.
---
Private servers.
---
Then I'm the mentally handicapped. I must've misread my bad.
---
Joana's pace x1.25 just happened to end up at 144 hours and change.
---
You must have been a mediocre Mage if this is your perception of reality. That or you haven't played one and is just spewing the same crap most non-informed people think is the truth in the life of a Mage.
---
Uhhh, what? There's weather in BfA, in a lot more zones than was in Vanilla.
---
It was combo of what I recalled from my time of playing classic at the age of 12, and I thought someone corroborating it, but I've been watching a bunch of guides for which class to pick in classic, and most of them had dim views of paladins.
---
This is where I was born &lt;3
---
I just did a server transfer. It still haunts me to this day.
---
The trash they drop vendors for a lot
---
Finally this is a video that is really short and has lots of information. Thanks!
---
So people just invite Mages and a Warlocks instead of that Warrior or Rogue, seems easily doable for me in dungeon content. Hell, I'm fooling around on a private realm at the moment and people are asking for certain classes for Deadmines. Deadmines!
---
Of course you can't afford to leave out classes in raids, but I do not believe that pugging anything beyond Molten Core will be a thing. And if it's a thing, then only because of certain guilds doing alt-runs + randoms, in which case the guild members orchestrate the run anyway (including loot to some degree).
---
Honestly, I would rather hear "item X reserved" than "LFM BRD no cloth".
---
"Ready to work!"
---
Protip:  GMs are more likely to ban you for the practice of loaning itself(which itself is very unlikely in case anyone asks) then they are to ban you for being a little bit late on payments for said loan.
---
Man, if the bank can just deposit back my entire mortgage when I make the last payment that would be awesomesauce.
---
Auto-loot was in Classic, just don‚Äôt listen to him and his click bait I need money from ads videos.  
---
Most of these ‚Äúcontent‚Äù creators were 10 years old when Classic was live and don‚Äôt know a thing about anything other than private server nonsense. I‚Äôll be glad when Classic is live and we don‚Äôt have to put up with them anymore.
---
Shaman, feral druid and even paladin can become an issue. Shamans can heal themselves and purge-spam your SL, ferals love a drawn-out fight, and paladins have a surprisingly easy time killing warlock pets while cleansing dots. Against actual resto/holy specs, it would probably just be an unwinnable stalemate. You might even lose to a resto shaman. SL isn't some kind of magical uncounterable ace, you just swap the counters around. It really just changes the class into something that specializes in fighting warriors and rogues.
---
If you pay for 6 months or a year up front the cost per month goes down. It‚Äôs not much but it may make it more palatable!
---
The client itself is on the content delivery network (CDN).
---
This means that through... some interesting methods... you can download whatever is on that server. Somebody downloaded client and set up a sandbox server to run the client on.
---
I farmed nagrand for ore so dam much the farm route is permantely etched in my brain...
---
Lol at the clueless GM
---
a foreword. it's definitely not nostalgia for a lot of people. i started during the cataclysm expansion, which is notable because it was the expansion that completely destroyed the ''old world'' that the game started with, and removed a lot of beloved rpg features. when i became curious about the way the game was, i was bombarded with comments and articles about how clunky and bad it was, and how people only liked it because they didn't know any better.
---
i had no reason to be interested in this game that was, by all accounts, awful. i knew better. and i still played it, and i still loved it. so the short answer? yes, definitely, absolutely play it!
---
the long answer... i can't compare it to SWTOR because i've never played, but i'll do my best to explain why i like classic wow so much, and where current wow fails on those points. 
---
---WHY PLAY CLASSIC?---
---
+the rpg elements! if you're a hunter, you have to buy/craft ammo for your bow or gun. you have to feed your pet and as you do, it gains loyalty towards you, allowing you to teach it new abilities. if you're a caster, you need to buy reagents for some of your special spells. want to cast a portal to a major city? get that rune of portals! in addition to the regular rpg stats like strength/stamina/intellect/agility/spirit/crit, some gear also has bonus damage to certain spell types. so your shadow priest might really want that mask which gives bonus shadow damage...
---
+the classes! back then, they were designed to have a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling, so anybody could get into them, and have a lot of room to improve themselves if they chose. for example, i play a hunter, and it's easy enough to get by using the same 2-3 abilities. but as i leveled, i discovered that there was so much more to the class. so i learned how to kite, how to best use my traps, how to properly pull mobs, just a bunch of little class-specific tricks that were really satisfying to get the hang of and really improved my experience. every class is like this, and every class plays pretty distinctively from one another and has special abilities you won't find anywhere else (like aformentioned portals) so you get a brand new experience with each alt.
---
+the world (of warcraft)! classic wow has two continents to explore, with a ton of zones and dungeons packed within. you only get loading screens when crossing continents or entering a dungeon/pvp battleground, which makes the world feel even bigger. it's pretty clear to me that the world itself was designed first and then had quests sprinkled throughout it, which makes the world feel much more organic. the zones are all so distinct both visually and in story, and there's so much to find if you wander off the beaten path.
---
+the social atmosphere! i'm a pretty shy person, so i never thought that such a social game would be one of my favorites, but here we are. while you can complete most quests by yourself, there are also a lot of quests where you're encouraged to group up with others. because dungeons are pretty chill and it can take a while to get a group together, people are way more likely to chat with each other, be kind and help somebody out if they're struggling. if you do a lot of dungeons, you'll end up with a lot of people on your friends list to do future dungeons with, ask for quest help from, ect... it's just one community per realm, so it's easy to build a reputation for being a good or bad person, which also causes a lot of people to be nicer. classic wow is the best social experience i've had in any game tbh
---
+the lore! i noticed that you seemed interested in wow lore but also didn't want a ton of spoilers, so i'll just give a small preview below. it's also worth noting that a lot of wow lore is divulged in quest text and in books/plaques/notes scattered around the world, so it's not really in your face but is there if you choose to look for it. wow is a really good example of worldbuilding, imo.
---
there are two playable factions, the horde and the alliance. the alliance is mainly compromised of secure, established races who are working together to protect the world from any threats. the horde is made up of races that, for whatever reason, are struggling to survive in this hostile world and are joined together for safety. they used to be openly at war, but now they have a ceasefire, and it's mostly just small fringe groups fighting each other. there's a lot more to it, but that's the overall lore. there's plenty of info in the character creation screen and the intro cinematics, and i feel like each race has an interesting story, so just play what you want tbh.
---
---WHY NOT CURRENT WOW?---
---
while i do enjoy current wow and have played it from 2012 to 2019, i can't say that the current expansion is any good atm or recommend people to try it out. there are two camps of people who dislike current wow - 1) the people who prefer a more classic style of game 2) the people who prefer the more modern action game feel the current game has, but who also realize that the current expansion kind of ''pulled back the curtain'' and seems openly unfun and only focused on forcing people to stay subscribed.
---
all of the aformentioned rpg elements have been removed. you no longer need to group up for any quests, all but the highest tier of dungeons can be steamrolled through without saying a single word, and they now have a ''dungeon finder'' so you can click a button and be teleported inside the dungeon with a random group. some realms are joined so it's not just one community again and the idea of a ''reputation'' or ''knowing people on your server'' is pretty much gone. leveling is pretty boring nowadays, you can mow down a bunch of mobs at once and not die because they pose zero threat to you, and any notion of character freedom or customization is gone. the lore has also been pretty badly butchered and the story campaign is drip fed to you in tiny tiny bits, so you get like 30 minutes of mediocre story a week. it's bad jim.
---
in short: yes, play it! at worst, you'll be out 15 dollars and at best you'll discover a great new game to play. thanks for reading it is my highest joy in life to recommend this game to people
---
Could he have actually reported you?
---
This shot was took when me and my buddy leveled our Warrior+Shaman character. We killed cougars and whoops, when i suddenly looked at the horizon. That view on Thunder Bluff took my breath and i told to my buddy "Wait a sec, gonna do the screenshot".
---
Mulgore is probably my favorite starting zone in vanilla. The blend of native music, green plains, sunny and rainy weather is charming and breath taking.
---
Auto-loot was in Classic, so you‚Äôll be happy.
---
The new weather in BFA (which is similar to what was in MoP, I didn't play Legion) is better than nothing after Cata but it is not the same as Vanilla weather.  
---
Vanilla weather was more intense and much longer (e.g., 15-20 minutes for torrential downpour where you could barely see across the zone).  In modern WoW, it's more like a passing rain storm in about 5 minutes.
---
I hope they are able to fully restore intense, long-lasting Vanilla weather because it was so immersive.
---
As has been said, there is no lfd so there won't be any cross server problems there.
---
I like the idea of battlegroups for battlegrounds. It smooths the problem of under-populated servers and fluctuating playtimes effecting your ability to get full games. As long as it's only a few servers grouped then you don't lose out on the community aspect too much as you'll still run into the same people plenty.
---
I don't think a toggle function would be possible, but if it is then sure. I imagine if battlegroups were enabled then most people would elect to go that route anyway.
---
There will certainly be mods. Whether they alter gameplay depends on how you define that I guess. Do things like DoT timers, swing timers, raid boss timers, inventory management, armor/weapon swap management, etc. count as altering gameplay to you? I assume all of that and much more will be in mods.
---
I highly doubt we get anything outside of what was in retail vanilla. I do expect to see a TBC server down the road and the return of 10 man Kara will obviously be there. I like the idea of adding new content to vanilla, but I think blizzard would be more than happy of taking the easy route of raking in money without having to design new content.
---
I made [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59id46GSdHx74Dk04TvzBY) playlist a ways back for nostalgia-purposes. It's not 100% on the mark, but it's around the time of Vanilla - LK.
---
Interesting. Thanks.
---
Do you remember a guide specifically that steered you away from Paladins?
---
Did the same thing, but with mining. Was fairly quick to level 70, and loaned like 3k from a guildie. Didn't take me many hours farming it back, the ore was super overpriced and not many had epic mount, so more ore for me. Only took a few hours over a few days to pay him back. Don't even wanna wanna think how long it would take with ground mount / 80% flying
---
Aside from shift-looting it wasn't in vanilla though. There are some modified vanilla clients that have the option, but originally it wasn't. As far as I can tell (after some doing some research) there were also no mods that could do it.
---
Anyways, the change is so minor that I do not see how anyone could argue against it. It's like saying we should play classic on crappy PCs again to get the same low fps as back then.

infra tested it on his personal server.
---
killing him every 2-3 seconds he spends nearly a complete HOUR reviving and killing him until he got it.
---
thats about 1200 kills.
---
with a normal run of 45 minutes it would take about 900hours (37,5DAYS) of farming to get it :D.
---
is it possible to get? yes.
---
realistically possible? no :D
---
What's a general guideline of good XP/HR for each other level range. You mentioned in the comments 20k XP/HR at 20, what about at 10, 15, 25 etc.?
---
Uh huh but LEGO Batman is also unlimited entertainment for a 5 year old.
---
That was indeed what I was saying. Tought the first beta invites went out. Now I'm dissapoint.
---
Dwarves can track treasure, but it can‚Äôt be used at the same time as profession or class tracking skills (Find herbs, ores, or hunter tracking). So if you‚Äôre planning on playing a dwarf warrior/priest/paladin/rogue, and you aren‚Äôt planning on doing mining or herbalism, you can basically track treasure 24/7
---
Surprised by the lack of hunter here. That's what I'm going, give me those pets!
---
Take it easy hoss.
---
Shift click is auto-looting. It was in Classic. I used it. There‚Äôs no point in even arguing about it. The first thing I did when creating a new character in Vanilla was brining up the interfacing and selecting the auto-loot check box. 
---
Shift click auto loot was there in 2004, and it will be here in 2019, just like it was in the Demo.
---
I hate when a seems to be healthy run turns to trash over an item.  I lost ironefoe to a priest because he said he liked maces.  I lost the quel‚Äôserrar book to a mage who needed on it because it was a cash item, which I traded him 500g for and did my quest
---
I just remember who NOT to group with when its all said and done
---
Do horde speed runners have to large of an advantage when it comes to leveling or do you think it‚Äôs possible for an alliance player to achieve world record leveling times?
---
So, I played SWTOR for probably around 800+ hours starting from pre-release in 2011. Left the game near the end of Shadow of Revan, when the whole Knights of the Eternal whatever debacle started. My favorite part of the game was, and still is, the vanilla 1 to 50 class stories and the story line generally.
---
You said you only started SWTOR recently, but I guess I'll still say that, from the perspective of someone who enjoyed the vanilla game in SWTOR most of all, Classic is certainly worth a look
---
 WoW differs overall from ancient or modern SWTOR in many ways, most obviously in that it has few or no cutscenes or voice acting through most of the leveling content, except for incidental barks from NPCs. That said, there are some common elements between older versions of both games, and if you liked the vanilla version of SWTOR (granted, you haven't really experienced that), I'd say you'll find a lot to like about Classic WoW.
---
For one, the original SWTOR talent system was pretty much a copy and paste from the old style WoW talent trees, which are making their return in Classic. Many, many players very much preferred this system to the style of talents that both SWTOR and WoW now use.
---
Also, leveling at the launch of SWTOR was much, much slower than it is now, and required playing through all of the main story line and all of the available side quests in every zone (and still left you short of XP at some points). These days you can reach the level cap in SWTOR in around 20 hours, or maybe less with optimal play. Back at the start, it was more like 100+ hours to get to level 50. That is similar to the contrast between modern and vanilla WoW, and leveling in Classic will be a much slower and more involved process, with reaching the level cap feeling like a real accomplishment all on its own.
---
Also, in Classic WoW as in Vanilla, and similarly to the early days of SWTOR, crafting has real utility and benefits even while leveling, and is (was) much more satisfying to invest your time into. In vanilla SWTOR, you could craft really useful stuff early on like your own speeder, and armoring and mods for gear, that could fill real gaps in your equipment when decent kit was either very expensive or much harder to come by.
---
I never played Vanilla WoW myself back in the day and only know the modern version of the game, but I did play Vanilla SWTOR and very much prefer it to what the game has become. So I can see the parallels in what older WoW offers and why it appeals so much to people, and I'm looking forward to playing it myself. Other games have done similar things in recent years reviving their ancient versions, but WoW will be by far the biggest to have tried it yet, and the one that has probably more devoted fans looking forward to the revival. Any way you slice it, it's a wonderful chance to relive an era of gaming history that we all thought was long gone.
---
What is the true proc rate of Ironfoe?!
---
Is sharding in the 1.12 patch data?
---
If not why are you so sure it's out?
---
Yup. It's [this guy.](https://zippy.gfycat.com/UnsightlyJubilantGordonsetter.webm)

Back to your mechanic analogy, you may find it interesting that I'm a professional scientist and my surest way to learn has always been to ask with authority or state how I see something with the full knowledge I don't have the backing.

I find it sparks discussion, and as long as I have the spirit of humility, things usually go great from there.

If you have trouble paying 30 dollars a month then you need to consider your priorities.

Yeah for sure, it‚Äôs something is what I mean, I do miss the feeling of not being able to see so maybe waiting it out in town or an inn and rping in the mean time
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkawrueQYXU) is a good starting point.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U83KVY5ikiE) is more in depth and a little too hardcore focused for me, but it's still very useful.
---
My big advice is to make use of pickpocket. Pickpocket every single humanoid. Get a macro to pickpocket as much as you can in dungeons. The extra gold will drastically reduce farming time for your 40 and 60 mount and help keep you up to date on paying for skills. It'll also aid in your lockpicking progress which can be a pain.
---
Oh dang, I forgot about that trick, fun times
---
That was pretty bad. Or was that the point of posting this?
---
All I know is they need to shut up and take my money.
---
It's literally titled "a terrible video".
---
In a really quick reply, I've thought about doing it, but the time lost would be rather severe so I personally think that if your playing Solo then no. However, I do think that if you are playing a Duo then an argument for this can be made.
---
You can go kill yourself or play bfa
---
I have never reserved or blacklisted an item when starting a group
---
BUT
---
As progression through classic gets into full steam and we are say, farming AQ, then the players wanting MC and BWL gear have to endure the pugs where they are carried but cannot roll on: bindings, accuria, qsr, dft, rejuv, heads or hearts.  
---
It is a benefit for all (geared and ungeared) to run older raids
---
This is why reserves HAVE to be in classic, to keep all content relevant to all players
---
I am going to guess yes?
---
* Blurry
---
* Evanescence
---
* Bad pvp
---
* Intro scenery unrelated to video
---
Fucking beautiful 10/10
---
Best classic content is made by goraks guides. Good to see some original content
---
I know, same with Hand of A'dal, Champion of the Naaru and 1 more. Was merely pointing out that they did release the achievement system in TBC, albeit it being 1 month before WotLK. :)
---
I am not sure you understand ... this post is about the option to toggle shift looting so you can auto loot without holding shift. And that is the option that was in the demo, seems to be in the beta right now, but was not in vanilla.
---
Progressive itemization makes perfect sense if you want to experience the authenticity of Vanilla. The early stages of the game become significantly more trivial with the more powerful versions of items that simply did not exist at that point in the game.
---
16 Debuff slots will already make things relatively easy mode in Phase 1-2 so at this point holding integrity to itemization would help things.
---
All things being said, this requires ample time and resources that Blizzard does not really want to invest so they will give you a less authentic representation but still close enough in their eyes.
---
"just 3 hours" like it is no big deal
---
If it makes you feel better, I've only ever had one real life friend that played WoW with me and that's rare. You make other friends who are like minded.
---
If they can't then they probably are very new to the game
---
I thought by accident at least one of the kills would sync with the music, but it never happened.
---
Also, for what its worth, these videos are great because they show the slow/laggy/low framerate environment that a large portion of people played in back in the day. People on private servers with 1080p on their hardcore graphics card on stable servers are undoubtedly going to have an easier time playing than when I did back in the day where someone would lag into a trash pack in MC and fucking wipe the raid.
---
That was not in Vanilla. It should not and will not be in Classic. Very easy topic.
---
This is genius
---
A factor to consider is just how few people knew or practiced such tactics in Yee olde days.
---
The last 14 years:
---
"Will Age of Conan be the MMORPG to finally kill WoW?"
---
no.
---
"Lord of the Rings Online? I hear you can buy a lifetime subscription to the game!"
---
"Star Trek Online might finally kill WoW."
---
"Guild Wars? WTF, this game fucking sucks. How is it popular? Oh, there's no subscription cost?"
---
"Nope.
---
Then World of Warcraft Classic delivers a crippling blow to World of Warcraft as live literally saws it's own legs off releasing shitty expansion after shitty expansion.
---
World of Warcraft Classic is literally a mercy kill.
---
How can I get data like this for other subreddits?
---
Too relatable. My friends probably think I'm nuts
---
Thank you so much! The play style of rogue combined with the PvP rules of classic are incredibly appealing to me and I had no idea that pick pocketing would assist with lockpicking, thanks a ton man.
---
Time lost and if a lot other people do the same thing, prices will be depressed.  Tough call.
---
Looks to young to be Medivh
---
Thanks for doing this. What are your best tips for rogues? I mained rogue since vanilla and I definitely remember being pretty damn squishy while leveling. However, rogues are plenty sturdy nowadays so I just need to prepare myself to go back. Any info is appreciated!
---
If my guild provides 20 members for a pub of MC, dont expect the rando's to get the eye or thunderfury materials. If you're pub'ing and expecting those anyway, you've got some interesting expectations.

Easier to clarify that up front with "reserved".

Honestly you could probably grind your way to 60 in 10 days if you no life it, and many of the hardcore MMO players of the day probably just grinded hard as quests weren't an MMO staple until, well, WoW.
---
Totally agree with this point, save the concern for game affecting issues, graphics and personal convince issues really are not worth items are silly to be getting worked up about.
---
The Borg‚Äôs culture is not based on that.
---
What will kill retail wow, when they share subs?
---
Another thing to consider is if you get enough greens to get to lvl 10 enchanting and make the wand you could alternatively sell the greens and buy the wand off the AH. Plus I think there is a low level common wand on vendors which is fine for the starting zones. 3-5 silver maybe.?
---
I know undead have a wand quest reward in the starting zone. So horde players don‚Äôt have to really worry about the lesser magic wand. Dunno about alliance starting zones though maybe someone else can verify. 
---
I play priest and I‚Äôm planning on playing it by ear. If I get lucky with some trash greens or generous amounts of cloth early I‚Äôll pick up enchanting and tailoring. If they‚Äôre decent greens I‚Äôll sell them to buy a lesser wand and stick with skinning and herbs for leveling.
---
If i join a dungeon group as tank and someone reserves and item i beforehand charge those guys a fee for tanking. If it drops or not ifc, but they need a tank, at least i make some coins out of their greed!
---
310 was in BC, it was only on ashes and gladiator mount
---
With that same logic, let's make R14 weapons accessible for cheap honor because technically it existed (during Vanilla) before TBC came out. The point is to experience the game as it was from beginning to end and not play the game on easy mode with gear that simple was not originally accessible during MC/Ony days.
---
Wow I just remembered having to go to town to train.
---
Like this? https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkIbZVVkVMxoVo
---
I don't like any non-paladin class. Easy.
---
Thanks doctor logic, but I'm not trying to draw a conclusion I'm reflecting on what already happened.
---
When I was 40, I asked a lot of golds (probably 60/70+) to someone in order for me to buy a mount. I never managed to get back the gold in time and lost contact with him over the weeks. I recently felt bad when I remembered about it, this was such a huge amount and he was not even level 60. I tried to find him back a few month ago but I don't think there is any way to. It was on Archimonde EU, Alliance side, a dwarf...if you ever read this, I'm sorry....
---
It's great that you want to spend time with your kid. But how about you let him play something more appropriate for his age. I know Classic is mostly "cartoony violence", but that's not the only thing. The game is way too complicated for a five year old and you shouldn't have to help him with everything. Wait a few more years until you get him something as complicated as Classic WoW.
---
I'm pretty sure you can find something that's fun for both of you.
---
He replied to that, he had to work in the office
---
Interesting parallels irl to automation driving costs of goods down, but displacing human workers üßê
---
Holy shit you're wrong
---
Thanks for the reply. It makes sense; my main concern was the Northshire Starting area quest with that book you have to click thats on a 5 or 10 min respawn timer and you have to do it; same with killing the NPC that's there.
---
I get your reasoning as to why progressive itemization might be preferred by some. But changes in (existing) items during the course of the game would lead to very weird effects, that also would not be authentic. Because now we would know what items change in what ways and would thus farm certain items because we know that they will be better later on.
---
But generally I believe that most of these kind of changes are mostly there to correct mistakes. My favorite example are the shadowcraft boots, which had 21 int instead of agi originally. To me this just seems like an obvious mistake akin to a bug-fix.
---
So weighing the two sides with their pros and cons, I'd say that keeping items at their 1.12 change is the better option for most items.

---
Whats the conversion rate for Classic Gold to retail. Like how much would a mount cost today in retail using classics economy?
---
Classism gone too far, we must take a stand!
---
You're more than likely correct that it isn't modified if its showing up in mine but not yours. 
---
The more you know I guess =D Either way Im fine with auto loot.
---
&gt; However emulating a server to run a game instance to see the models is a Blizzard no-no, it crosses the line into "illicit" activity.
---
How is it any different than people posting stuff from private servers?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Huh? But it is in the beta right now. So why are you saying they won't add it? If anything they would have to remove it right now.
---
And aside from the regular #nochanges or slippery slope arguments; What would be an actual reason for not having it in the game?
---
Be a moderator on those subs.
---
It‚Äôs only worth it if you plan in making more than 1 wand. You can make a lot of money selling them in the first few days. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to make 1 and stop professions.
---
On aoe tanking take same spec as as ll the /sitt guides say just remember shield spike it is important
---
Best professions while leveling vs. professions @ 60 for mage? Curious as to all y‚Äôall opinions. Thanks
---
Yeah i was like 14. Shit happens.
---
I started as an Undead Lock on Eonar (US) in the Fall of 2005 too!  I basically lived in BRD for a while lol.  Great server, met some really good friends that lasted through TBC.  
---
Many of those friends were met out while questing.  I hope they don't use Sharding (however "time-limited" it is, according to an off-hand promise) or I would have most like never met them.
---
I my mind you should wait your kid got 8 years old
---
I never got this. I was always too busy looking at the environment/scanning for red names for mobs or horde
---
You get those little lock boxes from pickpocketing, which will help. You'll probably still need to do the lockpick grind in the barrens and what not, but not as much
---
ha!
---
If it‚Äôs not in 1.12, it‚Äôs not in Classic. Hard line. Easy line. Shift click looting was in the demo. Auto loot no modifier was not. The interface looks the same as what the demo was.
---
It would have to be at least 100k. 100k now is comparable to 100g back then.
---
^^ This!
---
Same thing over here. I spent a good portion of my day all last week just doing talent builds
---
Nope
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve already made up your mind. Enjoy LEGO Batman!
---
Good point. I met many of my current gaming buddies through WoW, just hopeful to maintain them throughout this re-release.
---
Earliest white wand from vendors is level 15.
---
THE JUICE
---
They will be there. It may not show up until after the server launches but they will be there.
---
I trust Blizzard to keep classic as close to vanilla as possible
---
that varies wildly on when you are leveling, if you are ahead of the pack substantially you can level pretty quickly Aoeing, if you wait a few months its fine too, but if you are in the middle 70% of levelers it's terrible.
---
why no ?
---
Feels like the people who get mad about reserved loot never make their own grps. If you as a tank and healer starts a dungeon or raid grp you will be swarmed by whispers of people who want to join. 
---
So instead of asking every singel player what items they need from the dungeon before you invite them. You reserve them because you would not have invited them anyway.
---
Duuuuuuuuuuude!!!  Thank you!!!
---
Hella expensive and, depending on how item content is managed, prone to get out when it already doesn't matter at all unless you're a newbie trying to gather pre-raid.  Or at least that was the bread and butter of those crappy pservers.
---
The answer is no
---
I don't see a 5 year old kid getting much out of WoW. It's the time spent with you he'll remember and cherish regardless of the game played.

In my testing I've made 3-7 wands with 60 linen cloth. There is no way only 1 wand will come of it.
---
I got the 60 linen questing in Tirisfall at around level 10. 
---
It'd be best to get other casters to funnel their linen to you so it can be done around level 5-7.
---
its mostly a joke tbh
---
Skinning/herbing while leveling, tailor briefly at 60 for robe of the archmage, back to skinning for DM North farm.
---
Do you know if these are the exact same models used in vanilla?
---
Yeah right..
---
I plan to do reserve runs as a Tank, and I can mostly guarantee smooth runs if private servers are anything to go by. Farming gold as a tank is difficult, so I will reserve the occasional item for myself if it happens to drop.
---
right in the feels man, right in the feels. i remember this all too well
---
It's really hard to say without having all the knowledge at our disposal.
---
The main question is how populated are the starting zones going to be? Will everyone be sharded away from eachother? We don't know all the answers yet to lay out a plan for launchday. 
---
My current plan for launch hours is to roll undead warlock and leave the starting area ASAP. Probably around level 3-4 and start grinding undeads/humanoids for linen cloth in an uncontested area until I have enough linen to craft a wand. At that point I will be halfway into level 7 and I'll go to a grinding spot without quests and get to level 10. Do my warlock voidwalker quest and get to barrens and start questing (hopefully ahead of zerg).
---
If you're planning on playing priest on launch a viable strategy could be to /yell people while you're in towns to trade you linen in return for a LMW. Let's say you have 20 linen yourself, you only need 2 people to trade you 20 linen each and you got 60 linen which most of the time will be enough to craft 3 LMWs.
---
No change alarmists. I'm sorry but tips really has no clue what the fuck hes talking about. The production value of his stuff is so good that's why it pains me to say this.
---
Having to hold down shift or not makes no difference
---

I mean Zezima was a legend in runescape for being the highest level so thats obviously false.

Yeah, it's really only about 30% frost spam, the other 70 is conjuring water and making portals

Wow, way to make it racist...
---
Each individual person knows internally how much of the list feels like fun and how much of it feels like checking off things on the list. There is a simple X Factor that they cannot predict, knowing that the second time around will not be like the first, and hopefully they remember to rely on the things that are not pressing buttons in the right order.
---
You assume your own faction won‚Äôt grief you and let you free farm.  Good luck with that.
---
I would love 1.0 talents but they'll never do it sadly
---
Lmao I used to grind arenas back in BC with a Rogue who was an overnight Xray tech. He'd literally play from like 8pm - 2am with maybe 4 15 minutes breaks.
---
Classic WoW is how I was able to buy my condo.  In order to get the loan, I needed to have 3 things that I had paid monthly on in order to qualify.  I was moving out of my parents house, and while I lived with them I paid them cash for my portion of the bills, so there was no record that I had made my monthly payments.  We were on family plans for everything (i.e. insurance, phones) so in the end I only had 2 bills that were in my name that could qualify me.
---
Then I remembered "I pay $15/month to play World of Warcraft!"  I sent them the payment records from my Blizzard account, and I was able to move out.
---
Eh this wasn't a public private server. Just testing for classic on my own 5 player server but i understand. Next time i'll make a power point presentation isntead
---
The main reason that loot reserves were more prevalent in recent expansions is that they were more viable, because there were more people who did not need or want any drops from an instance, but instances still gave participation rewards like valor or legendary upgrade tokens that people needed to grind out weekly. Also with bonus rolls you could still use those regardless of group loot setting, and people often were willing to go into groups just to use their bonus rolls on a particular boss. I think (this may be wrong though) that you also could still use bonus rolls even on subsequent runs after you got the weekly regular loot lockout and couldn't get more regular loot anyway.
---
Most of those things that made people willing to go into loot reserved groups will be missing in Classic, and with those incentives removed I assume it will be harder for groups with loot reserves to fill, if people even try to run them.
---
I'd be surprised if loot reserves are still a thing at all in BFA since master loot is gone now, and there is no way to force anyone to trade personal loot. I guess early on some idiots still tried to post groups pretending they were going to "reserve" certain drops, but that's just an inevitable self-pwn since there is no way they can enforce it if the thing they're after drops for someone else.
---
Always sad when I see Troll rogues at the bottom of the barrel, but I'll be playing one lol

Although classic will always be my favorite wow, TBC was just amazing.  The content that was released on launch day was astounding.  You couldnt get there for months, but it was all there.

&gt;On launch, only players who have been subscribed for all of the Battle For Azeroth World of Warcraft expansion will be able to connect to the WoW Classic realms. This is to reward our loyal fan base who has stayed with us through our wonderful journey. WoW Classic realms will unlock to the general public at a later date, still to be announced. Those not eligible to join the initial release may become eligible by submitting a sworn affidavit stating "I, {your name}, being of sound mind and body, free from coercion, hereby swear it is my truthful opinion that Battle For Azeroth is a superior gaming product to Classic World of Warcraft".
---
Shit troll is shit.
---
A lot of wasted time was put into this terrible troll job
---
Nice try buddy. Now give me back the gold for real or I will report you in Classic.
---
You can't compare the drop rate from a private server that was estimated based on Vanilla incomplete data. Maybe it's not 0.02% it could be worse or a little bit better.
---
@Mod, delete this nonsense please.
---
&gt; Shift click looting was in the demo. Auto loot no modifier was not.
---
This is wrong though. The option to toggle was in the demo and is in the beta right now (according to screenshot). So you could set it up so you do not have to hold shift to auto loot.
---
The only killing that happens is your sense of fun, slowly with each minute that you play the game, and this is completely inevitable.
---
It‚Äôs Hunter BiS baby, until DM trinket.
---
So you don't want gear that was available towards the end of Vanilla at the beginning?
---
I think you see my point in the fallacy of your own argument.
---
I would be pretty disappointed if auto loot wasn‚Äôt an option. The nochanges community seems hellbent on making the game as shitty as possible for some reason.
---
That mega server thing is so retarded i dont even know where to begin..
---
I ran a casino in original vanilla so never needed a dime, but it taught me how merely having gold was the best way to make more gold. Sort of set me up for life I‚Äôd say.

Low effort...

Slightly off topic but you mentioned dark nights. I have fond memories of early Rust builds where night was so dark you could only see what was literally right in front of your nose. Made night raids interesting since you could look out your window and see a torch moving in the distance and wonder if that's a lone wanderer looking for shelter or a pack of predators out on the hunt. Also made shelter such a critical component. So many games these days use shelter as more cosmetic than actually protective.
---
Idk, lack of remorse seems like you'd still be the type of person to do that. 
---
So I don't think "I was just a kid" applies here
---
This ^^^
---
I still remember that damn name, and it's been like 15 years! I'd say people cared even more back then than now, we just didn't have social media, and google sucked, so it was more hearsay.
---
Maaaaaaybe. Cant speak for my boss in regards to who he fires and why
---
I completely miss the weather and day/night cycle.  I want it back so bad.
---
Well, PvE combat wise you'll be doing so most of the time. Rebuffing, one CS and/or sheeping every now and then, some CoC and nova to keep your distance, some AoE when needed and maybe even using one of your "oh sh\*t" buttons when things go bad... Everything is there, but the default you'll be doing for most of it is still frostbolt spam.  
---
Of course, there'll also be *friends* who might want to *introduce* you to PvP, tho ;) . That is the true combat change.
---
Nice strawman, master debater
---
Gotcha, makes more sense and certainly couldn‚Äôt play his personal characters. But assuming everyone has time to scour 700 comments isn‚Äôt realistic. Especially the folks who jump right to rage mode instead of explaining he‚Äôs not playing from home.
---
I watched a stream where he showed that he set up a sandbox.   but yeah. He's kind of a rube.
---
Honestly, I'm for AOE loot too. I think it's perhaps the best change WoW has seen in 10+ years, haha.

Arcanite reaper : [http://classicdb.ch/?item=12784](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12784) \+13 STA and +62AP it's very good for a blue weapon, I'd say BIS for PVP.
---
Expensive yes, but even if you farm MC, how long before they let a hunter have a decent 2 hander ?
---
You genuinely make by far the best Classic content. Keep it up dude
---
Can we get a ban of this troll if it doesnt pan out?
---
You get to be a cookie bitch instead of a portal bitch.
---
No one wants to group with the guy known for reserving loot all the time. If anything I'll advertise for the same dungeon with the added "nothing on reserve" and fill it faster.
---
Auto looting is not AOE looting. I am against AOE looting
---
As a private server mage main, I always felt incredibly dirty about how aoe farming on my way to 60 felt compared to how all the other classes had to do it. Being able to solo 10 mobs your own level within a minute shouldn't be part of the leveling process let alone part of the game.  And you add that bonus up with all the other bonuses mages have and, well they are just a broken class XD don't get me wrong, they are AWESOME but blizzard kinda went too farm with their capabilities imo
---
Ouch. Were do you go to know what patch a weapon was ?
---
I didn't find the info on classicdb.
---
Enjoying yourself?
---
How do you put so much time into a troll post but have grammatical errors in the first sentence of the "blue post".
---
I rerolled mage in wotlk and I loved it. 
---
Typically topped the damage mainly because of the uptime of being ranged and I really enjoyed the rotation (fire). Was fire a viable spec in vanilla? I fear it's too debuff reliant. 
---
How does the dps compare to rogues and warriors, is it night and day lower or are we just taking a few %. It would be nice to not feel surplus to requirement in fights where the utility is less required.
---
You're welcome Zaki.
---
I need rolled 100 on this. On of my personal greatest moments in gaming.

---
Gotcha. Thanks for the correction
---
I like mobility and burst classes. Fire mage is more constant damage with great mobilty, frost is more burst(if you can set it up) but more cast time than fire.
---
Arcane I haven‚Äôt played since cata or something.
---
I've never experienced it before. how does one grief an aoe farming mage? tag one or 2 mobs while you kill the other 10?
---
You had me going until the part where only "loyal fans" was gonna get access for the first period.
---
They have NEVER told us the real server cap. I don't see any reason why they have to do it now.
---
Decent sized discord channel for recruiting/looking for guild [https://discord.gg/5P8kpK](https://discord.gg/5P8kpK)
---
I dont get this debate, this was never a thing.  
---
Deep wounds had a low debuff priority, but you need it for impale which is rather important.
---
Before autoloot was put in there were add-ons that would place the loot box wherever your mouse was which was basically the same thing.
---
As for aoe loot? I personally wouldn't mind, I don't have a single good memory from vanilla that was due to there not being aoe loot.
---
And that's how I view the nochanges argument.
---
 If you change something that won't really impact those "vanilla moments" but just remove unnecessary tedium what's wrong? People don't like vanilla because they were forced to sit through loot pop-ups when they kill a big pack, they liked killing the big pack. 
---
And before the "but when do you stop" deflection comes in, well you discuss each change individually.
---
The answer is Orc.
---
Would your answer change if I asked Mage T2 vs Warlock T2?
---
Personally prefer T6 over it. T2 reminds me too much of an inquisitor, namely a more aggressive approach than paladin has by default. It doesn't help much the *holy or bust* vanilla focus for pallies.
---
This^^
---
Just like the classic graphical option give me an AOE looting option.
---
I find it more annoying with orange gathering nodes than corpses. Nothing worse than having to pinky-shift 4 times in a row after killing and looting a beast to skin it. That frequent of shifting gives me cramps or hand spasms.
---
They started popping up in late vanilla.. the people advertising groups with reserved loot were usually known for being loud mouthed goobers on the server.. same types to try and have a conversation in Trade chat.. we just ignored them.
---
wrong, there has always been competitors.
---
Maybe it wasn't most of the cmmunity like now but they already were a big part of the community
---
The channeling you do while picking the apples always had a bar without text. I never forgot it.
---
The solution is to make your own group. Usually the people reserving something are providing something for the group, be it tanking/healing, carrying the group via leadership, performance or just plain gear, or maybe just being the one to organize it instead of just lurking. If you can provide the same without reserving you will probably find people quicker.
---
That being said, I will do many runs without reserving things but I will also do many runs in which I reserve something, either for myself or for my friends. If you don't like that then just don't join. I have had my share of people complaining about reserves. Yes, to you it might seem like denying you something from that dungeon might make the dungeon unappealing or less appealing. But if I reserve Ironfoe on my 50 or so BRD runs that means 200 other people get to run BRD, whereas they will probably not find a tank as geared or experienced as me or maybe none at all. Of course there are some that get too greedy with reserves but then it is up to you to just provide a more appealing group than them.
---
Dude dont waste your time with some of these "nochange" retards. The game is full of changes. Just to what degree and what does it effect.
---
It‚Äôs a matter of getting ahead of the curve. Once you have zones and mobs almost entirely to yourself, leveling fast becomes even easier. I believe he had goons helping him out and account sharing
---
A little bit yes.
---
Trying to tackle 5-man content with a pal or two is amazing! One of my most cherished WoW memories was me (warlock) and friend (rogue) duoing our way through scholomance trash. We'd CC as much as we could, have my VW tanking, blow all our cooldowns and kill mobs one by one before running out of the instance to reset aggro and eat/drink/resummon poor blueberry.
---
We didn't have any goals of killing bosses, we were just friends hanging out and solving a puzzle that we set for ourselves. (I don't even think we made it much farther than the first room after the entryway XD)
---
&gt; And before the "but when do you stop" deflection comes in, well you discuss each change individually.
---
Finally someone sensible! I can only agree with you here. #nochanges is not an argument, just an opinion.
---
Yeah, some people like to ignore the fact that there is a real person behind the other screen (mostly). It's not just a game. It's a social experience. For an introverted kid at the other side, who doesn't have any social experiences in real life, it could really cause some emotional distress to be betrayed despite it being virtual game currency.
---
lmao your age is showing.
---
Shaman and Paladin. I'm STILL struggling to get into them now in current WoW. Never gotten one above level 20, aside from a shaman I boosted in Legion, and then deleted cause I wasn't having fun. For what it's worth, I love their class fantasy and aesthetics. It's the gameplay.
---
If you did, you'd just be getting cramps in your hands from constantly stretching your pinky down there. If toggle auto loot isn't in game I'll probably just train myself to move my whole hand like you do simply for comfort reasons.
---
Skip on training gouge / kick past rank 1 a waste of gold so you can save for a mount, always try to distract and pick pocket humanoid mobs, which will also help keep your locking picking level up so you dont have to go back and do it later. If you start out leveling your current weapons and can't find an upgrade via dungeon/ AH kill mobs 1 or 2 levels lower than you.
---
Sometimes I cannot help it  &gt;.&lt;
---
They are just so aggravating making me want to slap some sense into them.
---
I think its the pve realm thats an issue.  I havent seen many guilds already recruiting that are planning pve.
---
Mage.  Pretty good everywhere and in everything but, honestly, neither class fantasy nor playstyle appeal to me much.
---
ps's
---
More even between Mage and Warlock at Tier 2? Or do you give the edge to Mage?
---
Eh yes and no. Keep in mind that back then there was no shadowplay or streaming hardware - all capture was done by the CPU. Meaning it would impact your framerate a lot. Without recording the framerate would be signifactly better.
---
It is not. It's supposed to be [the same mage as](https://youtu.be/0c5x6_pSBjE?t=155) as the one in the TBC cinematic. It's just a generic, unnamed character.
---
Retro wow most likely.
---
I rolled a dwarf hunter and quit when I ran out of ammo. 
---
So then I decided to make a rogue
---
I bought that game as soon as it came out when I heard it was being developed by some of the people who worked on WoW. But the immense server lag and huge level grind (that wasn't as fun as WoW's level grind) really turned me off to it.
---
Sorry, for some reason I thought AR was 18 strength and 10 stam, but with that mind.
---
So duel wield with 2 weapons with +crit and get 15 agility on each, you‚Äôll come out with far more crit, ap, damage, and agility.  But maybe my play style is completely different
---
Besides clicking the magic checkbox? Not really unless you live in Irvine and can infiltrate corporate, maybe suck some D. Do you have an uncle who works for Blizz?
---
Yea you're right. 10 days on the original release isn't something to be that impressed with because this guy might have played beta and determined rogue was the best leveler. 
---
Also if beta was that impactful on leveling time why didn't a hunter or warlock win?
---
Beta may have familiarized this guy with the game if he even played it, but that doesn't make 10 days on release any less impressive.
---
My first guess would be #hype
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted\_Blood\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident)
---
Indeed. I left when they started pruning them in Cata (among other reasons) and honestly haven't returned because of all the changes in that way.
---
Actually the kid was a rich kid. His parents game him his own credit card to buy shit online with(he was like 13). He bought gold all the time and even bought a geared out druid during ulduar I remember. And he got his gold back also. He probably bought it lol
---
WoW gold = someone's time and hard work. Someone you knew.
---
Haha, how can he even believe that those two are the same? The difference is so obvious a blind man could see it.
---
Man believe it or not I did used to live close to Irvine but now I‚Äôm all the way in the northern coastal area of the state.  Unfortunately my uncle works for HP so I‚Äôll have to just hang tight.  In all seriousness, thanks for the confirmation.
---
The number one thing that's going to be reserved is semi-guild runs in UBRS for the flask recipe, I also don't mind it if the tank or healer is the one reserving it and over geared for said dungeon, it's when they are fresh level 60s and they try reserving gear
---
The lag, the 'standing still' pauses, the gangup pvp against backpeddlers. Beautiful.
---
I see what you are doing there.
---
Yeeeeah probably warlock again. My point is that on T3 warlock becomes even harder to deal with.
---
He means remove it from his list.
---
Not worth putting the time in to farm wands to sell on AH. No one will have money and will only drop very little on a wand because its all they can afford. Not worth getting behind the leveling train just for a useless amount of coins.
---
Gear for honor came in TBC pre-patch 2.0.1. It also had TBC talents and all other changes. It's not really counted as Vanilla even though the portal wasn't open yet.
---
You'll still be able to see play engagement
---
I played the demo for about 80 hours. You had to hold shift. I gonna leave this thread now.
---
Thanks for all the responses. Two follow up questions:
---
1- How long does the average raid take?
---
2- If I do one raid per week on a Friday or Saturday (assuming raids take hours), will I be 'acceptably' geared as a Warlock?
---
You can get a chicken pet in westfall by emoting at a chicken until it looks at you then feeding it grain.
---
Both Paladin mounts are alliance only (and class only for that matter).
---
It's likely players may start at 60 in the beta, so definetely no.
---
I'm trying to decide if I want to play warlock or mage, if that wasn't obvious : )
---
So stamina is king in PvP? Is that right idea?
---
Not that guy but the guy at the start of the thread.
---
There's a search function on worldofwarcraft.com that includes character search, and on the forum you can pick among your characters to represent your profile. 
---
The search function doesn't show my characters, but the forum one does. I'm guessing the search function is a database they don't keep updated in real-time and that it's just a matter of time before my restored characters are there.
---
A lot of people are missing why Blizzard is adding it to the interface toggle.
---
This is obviously a disability/usability thing. The function already exists in the game, they aren't adding a new thing. They're just making it a tiny bit easier for those with a disability to play, not having to hold an extra SHIFT button to do an in-game function. I honestly don't see any issues with this change, and I'm a pretty hardcore #nochanges person.
---
People would pick the cross-server ques because they are faster and they would need to in order to achieve a high pvp rank, even if they don't like/want cross-server battlegrounds.
---
we'll all be visiting soon
---
Aha, gotcha :)
---
Could the last title you were thinking of be either Scarab Lord or Master Angler?
---
There's the bonus rep as well.
---
Lol, then you just didn't change it in the settings. I literally just opened a YouTube video where some played the demo and was able to toggle it in the settings.
---
Estimates varies between 2500-3000 total. I do Hope they change It as a lot of servers became empty in vanilla period, even more If you wanted to level some alts.
---
How is the playerbase taking the removal of master loot ? ..... Why even do it ?  I just find it retarded ....
---
This happened to me on a pserver, actually. I was doing the circle on the shimmering flats and I charged a stoneskin basalisk or whatever it was called, and a mage kept on polymorphing to the point where I was almost dead because he wanted it. 
---
I feel like using CC measures can completely throw everything off and lead to your death.
---
Well it's still impressive but like one guy said he probably did it with no information. That would be truly impressive but he most likely lvled on beta.
---
Honor was a point system, but you needed a couple kills to get the first rank.
---
For pvp? Definitely warlock then no questions asked.
---
Not necessarily your game decider fact, but the latest project 60 dueling event (last week) hosted 64 great players ended in warlock vs. Warlock final match
---
Lvl 60 is 10days is one thing, server being stable for first days and 10days is mindblowing.
---
Don't farm until you're closer to 40. Get your skinning and another gathering profession leveled and then farm desolace or stv mobs and vendor their grays. You can easily make 3-6 gold an hour this way.
---
Shit, I used shift click to auto loot when I was last subbed in BfA, never knew there was a toggle
---
how did you not get reported by sore losers and banned for running an illegal gambling scheme?
---
Speedrunning guides are usually built specifically for hunters which is what speedrunners usually choose when running. Usually in situations like this you either hope your trainer is in darnassus or you set your Hearth in a place that does have one and travel back if you wanna stick to the guide for that level bracket
---
Now you're just baiting people to play classes that are incredibly gimped that involve ridiculous preparation pve wise.
---
These are awesome man
---
There's always improvement to be made for sure. We really aim for that 60 finish, so we don't optimise for quickest 1-20 for example.
---
Always changing a few things for QOL Id how we ended up with retail. The hard grind is what makes things satisfying. Having to work to get to dungeons is half the fun and makes getting those items more rewarding because it‚Äôs not just as simple as clicking a button and your in a group in the dungeon. Finding good players and remembering them and forging bonds is what makes classic wow amazing. You had to be a nice person and social to be able to do well in the game. The community aspect and forced interaction between your own faction and the opposite is what makes the game so beautiful and fun. Stop trying to take that away.
---
I don't sub to /r/wow these days, so I'm not sure. I know there was a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth when it first was announced, and after BFA launched. I think it was still a major gripe even well into the first couple of raids, but I'm not sure if everyone gave up, or if they finally drove away so many people that nobody is left who actually cares any more.
---
Retail WoW is all about the casual playerbase and we see how that's going.
---
Meanwhile WoW from it's launch through WotLK saw nothing but HUGE growth, especially in the casual crowd, as Vanilla WoW was a very casual game for it's time.
---
Vanilla WoW is not a hardcore game. It *can* be hardcore, but it doesn't have to be. You don't have to achieve rank 14 or full clear Naxx. If you don't have the time investment, don't ruin the game for those that do just because you want to achieve those things too. There is nothing wrong with getting to 60, clearing dungeons and maybe doing some casual raiding if you have time. Don't ruin the achievement of other, more hardcore things just because you don't have the time for it.
---
I just can't seem to get into rogue and mage. I've tried leveling both. I straight up do not enjoy playing rogue (or cat druid for that matter), and for whatever reason I just am not interested enough in mage to see it past level 10. While I enjoyed monks and death knights, I never could seem to level them very far, either, before going back to a class I like more.
---
The classes I've ever maxed out at any point in WoW were paladin, druid, warrior, hunter, and warlock.
---
I have never gotten a priest past level 30, either. It isn't lack of interest so much as I tried leveling one at a time when I was rapidly losing all interest in WoD so it just didn't work out.
---
Ever heard of Totalbiscuit?
---
Efficient single target mage leveling looks something like this: Frostbolt until enemy gets close -&gt; Fire Blast then Frost Nova while strafing away -&gt; Don't bother getting more distance after the nova, just Frostbolt until mob dies, Fire Blast again if it comes off cooldown. Rinse and repeat, drinking/eating whenever necessary.
---
Then I have a goal ;)
---
It's a bit of a crap-shoot, I distinctly remember a big hubbub about deletion of accounts which had been abandoned for a long time, and there certainly are accounts that are truly lost, though I've no idea exactly what Blizzard's policy was.
---
Hello, Ebbn!! Huge fan of your content. I've had your hours-long BGs playing in the background while I'm doing other things. And the duels are very interesting as well (although I'm wondering if there's a way to see more clearly what actions you're taking; bear charge and moonfire are obvious, but other things are tougher to see).
---
I've committed to Druid in the last few months, and you're one of my key influencers. I may even go horde for the first time ever because of you, although I am not a fan of larger character models (but I do like cows).
---
This video was particularly informative. I'd like to request some similar content regarding how you handle each class in PVP; could be part of the dueling videos or as a companion. Also, what does your fresh lvl 60 plan look like? What items do you go for first? That kind of thing.
---
Thanks, and keep posting new videos! I for one watch them all the day they come out.
---
Blackcrow from LBRS until Satyr's Bow

62 attack power and 13 stam, not too bad. Just incredibly expensive.

---
you can farm 100g easily from 37-40 if you just grind the right mobs and sell their grays/leather
---
I don‚Äôt know who is the best class/spec.
---
But i do know that the measure of skill in an MMO isn‚Äôt in 1v1 combat especially when there is no reward structure or rating system attached.
---
Rather teamplay, the skill of teamwork is what wins in the relevant part of PvP. Battlegrounds and in later expansions arena.
---
Looking forward to tanking my \*Sellables Reserved\* runs with a healer buddy 8)
---
Probably late but:
---
I mained a druid in retail. I used to be feral, now mostly Resto and boom kin although admittedly boom kin is a tad boring IMO even though I love the theme. - This seems to be a weird class in vanilla and not sure if I want to get back into it again even though I definitely love my druid.
---
Also played a mage - pretty fun but all the specs feel only a tad bit different with different colors. Enjoy kiting and fun perks like making your own food and slow fall and portals. - Up there on the list, just feel like it might get boring.
---
Hunter - only level 48 hunter but it seemed very entertaining. I think these make good mains in vanilla if I read right. Good for leveling. Maybe a slightly above avg skill cap in pvp? At least rewarding?
---
For classic, I want:
---
Something that has an above average skill cap / rewarding. I like thinking about stuff.
---
Something that levels fine - I play casually 
---
Something that's good in PVP
---
Something that has the most flavor with all of those other requirements.
---
I will most likely only have one main and an alt as well just to note.
---
Any suggestions?
---
Seriously can‚Äôt go wrong with almost all the frost talents. Pick up frostbite if you aren‚Äôt going to aoe farm and you Gucci.
---
I'd be interested for Central, but don't use Facebook due to privacy and you'd have to be OK with being featured in a YT channel with lots of subs once in a blue moon.
---
You'd also have to keep my identity private as nobody knows who I am on YT from here. Probably best to make a recruitment post once the game goes live so we can find you in-game.
---
I'd bring some old friends who aren't idiots, too, btw. Don't like drama, play well with others and can pretty much play most any class at the ceiling.
---
I'll be keeping an eye out for the eventual recruitment thread.
---
Rogues and warriors were gods in vanilla (but over half the server is going to roll either warrior or rogue so getting in a group may be tough). Warriors scale incredibly and rogues can feint and vanish so they dont have to worry about threat as much on top of doing great damage. Mages were the king ranged dps tho. This may change with warlocks being able to actually use dots since they are removing the debuff limit, but I still expect a lot of raids to stack mages. Locks will still need to use curse of elements, shadow and recklessness so unless they're the fourth lock they cant use curse of agony. Fire wont be viable for a lot of vanilla. You'll be fighting a lot of mobs and elementals with very high fire resistance so frost will be your best bet until later on down the road.
---
*disclaimer: I never really played vanilla. I started right as the BC prepatch was going live and by the time bc launched I wasnt close to level cap so most of what I'm saying is regurgitated information I've heard from various sources.*
---
Link a post talking about Druids where there isn't a significant amount of shit-talking against the class in the comments.
---
Fire is absolutely viable. Once you get out of MC and BWL fire is amazing!
---
DPS wise, due to some quirk with ignite, (which may be fixed in classic?) you'll see one mage at the top because they got the first ignite, and everyone else is lower, because they're feeding that first ignite.
---
It was always racist. The "sand pygmies" are pretty bad too...
---
Cool! Thanks
---
Magic checkbox?
---
The big point of AR is, for anyone who dares to try to deadzone you and/or get into melee range (yes rogues who were lucky to get the jump, this is for u), have a hard-hitting raptor strike, specially if you have talents dipping into survival and got the savage strikes one (20% extra crit on RS and mongoose bite as well). 
---
For strict ranged damage DW is just better.
---
I haven't. Aside from my own realm I only paid attention to the pvp Warcraftmovies videos
---
Yes you indeed did ninja the item. Isn't it like bloody obvious that people roll for items that are actually for their class/spec ?
---
There is no chance it'll be nerfed. To think they will is to ignore everything Blizz has said about Classic.
---
Are they though.
---
For solo play Druids are really fun. They have the easiest time leveling of any class except maybe hunter.
---
But you hit the end game and you can't do anything as well as other classes.
---
I am a druid main in retail for like 8 years but I value group play and raiding so I won't be playing druid.

---
Not trying to take anything away. The Toggle to que with world pvp que or just your server would 100% take care of that.
---
Dungeon thing I have already said would not be needed but people LIKED it.
---
Changing a few badly designed mechanics does not lead to retail wow. They went overboard and made the game easymode. Little tweaks, not giant crater tweaks is what this post is looking for.
---
Guild Bank and PVP cross server ques seem like those simple tweaks.
---
The Casual community took of in original WoW for a few reasons, but in this day and age, the casual community is an entirely different animal... Saying "Well if they don't like it, they can just play another game" is what leads to dead games. I am hoping to keep people from getting to that leaving point with some little tweaks. I am not looking to change the entire grind/community like some people seem to think.

If you're expecting Classic to be a lot darker than BfA, you're going to be in for a big disappointment. You can turn down the in-game brightness or contrast settings at night if you want it to be really dark.
---
All good in this case. I think what I said applies generally speaking. I got my card at 12 and never abused it like that.. I enjoyed working for what I get and still do.
---
Who got sued and why? I must have missed something.
---
Did you manage to raid in vanilla at the age of 11? I didn't even manage to reach 40...
---
Do you mean 100k is worth 1000g?? Thats crazy if you meant 100g
---
I had a similar experience. I was asking around sw where I go to buy my mount. I got a reply from someone and he asked if I had enough gold for the training, I didn‚Äôt. So he followed me all the way to eastvale logging camp and traded me the additional gold I needed.  Then when I went to buy the horse I realized that cost gold too so I asked him for 10 more and he gladly obliged.  It was so awesome and I was grateful.  Never got his name of anything just a random stranger.
---
The guide has starter sections for each race, so only Night Elves go to Darkshore. The rest meet up around level 20 in Redridge, because as you rightly mentioned trainers are limited to their race areas.
---
Hey idk what alenya's opinion is, but personally I don't think gold farming is important. You're gonna spend wayyy more time leveling professions then you lose by not getting your mount till like 42/43. Once you get to 40 the average gold you get from mob drops and quests is alot more and I've never had trouble getting the mount by 43 even with no professions. If you don't have a mount just grind to your destinations, which you probably should be doing anyway
---
Yea I'm just gona go ahead and give this whole thing a big nope.
---
&gt; Make them hold shift. Who cares?
---
Those of us with mobility issues care. The function already existed in Vanilla, this just makes it toggle-able. This change is along the same lines as adding in updated colorblind options (something that wasn't in vanilla.)
---
Basically, OP seems like the kind of whiny guy you in see in world chat who was that person who always complained about reserving things because he thought it was 'unfair' and the reason why he had shit gear. Only thing he is doing is telling everyone "hey dont group with me, im a moron".
---
Ninjas.
---
Naw I mean 100g lol. It takes about the same time at max level for me to get 100k now as it did to get 100g back in vanilla. 100k is absurdly easy now.
---
We do that.  He likes playing ‚ÄúThe Zombie Game‚Äù on his undead Mage.
---
On the contrary. Spec with 5/5 impact instead of imp fireball. 10% chance to stun for 2 seconds. Never touch fireball while leveling and spam scorch. If you spec right, you get 10% chance crit with scorch, 15% fire vulnerability, and every crit will reward 30% of the base Mana cost back. You can still use Mana shield, frost Nova, and blink without being frost.
---
You need to be opted-in to Warcraft betas through your blizzard account.

People who play on pve servers are casuals by default
---
Why does everyone fixate on the dungeon que? I already said that is the least important and not really needed.
---
I have not said anything about changing the rank 14 grind. I rather enjoy how much of a grind it is. PVP ques cross server will only improve the pvp experience for unbalanced servers and low pop servers. Sure it helps a TINY bit with the pvp grind, but people dedicating 14+ hours a day will be the only ones getting that rank, and they DESERVE it.
---
I am expecting many people to play casually, but as I mentioned, the "Casual" community from 15 years ago is very different then it was back then. Also, the technologies available allow them to make some minor tweaks to improve some of the bad mechanics.
---
Releasing old content as old and leaving it as old with all of its bad gameplay is one way to go about it. OR a simple QoL addition can make the game smoother and more inclusive.
---
You against adding a Guild Bank?
---
Adding an Auto loot toggle function in options?
---
I agree little changes are good like a guild bank would bring positive changes to classic. But anything cross realm is a no no in my book. It might speed up wait times but it totally destroys the servers feeing or community. The best part of classic was forging your reputation. I loved running into the same people in battlegrounds and getting little rivalries going, ones that carried through into world pvp. You learned of the best people and guilds on your server and that notoriety carried meaning. All that went out the window with battle groups and cross realm queues
---
I'm a fellow old man with kid, wife, dogs, etc. who has to play casually. If you guys are rolling on a Horde PvP server, I'll come be a new gaming buddy / healbot.
---
Vielleicht solltest du eine 2. Fremdsprache lernen, bevor du andere kritisierst.
---
So original Vanilla was 100% perfect? Got it. Nothing could have been added that was a minor adjustment to make lives easier without affecting the gameplay.
---
Love the depth of thought people are putting in.
---
And in only 15 to 30 hours you will have 100 gold!
---
It still was a dick move from you and you know it, otherwise you wouldn't make up these excuses.
---
But I do believe that it was just a youthful error.
---
you forgot Aion, Hellgate: London, Warhammer Online, Wildstar and god knows what else that's been lost to time
---
I'd be fine with allowing addons that add this functionality for those impaired I just personally feel having it on by default goes against the design philosophy of vanilla.
---
Depends on the item. Flask recipe or other obviously to be sold items? Piss off.  Shield for a tank? Sure.
---
1080p is even pushing it.. 
---
It's 2019...1440p ips monitor at 144hz can be easily done by a mid ranged gpu, especially on WoW
---
What is your current job?
---
Yeah, the classic guilds server pve channel is pretty dead.  I was also really surprised at how few of them are raiding Tu/Thur at 'normal' times (6~7 to 10~11 local time)
---
Seeing a lot of outdated 'TBA' lists on the content release times, so I thought I would whip this up for anyone curious about the phases.
---
Of course you don't. 
---
They're made of *hide*.
---
That's awesome! This is why I am so excited to play the old version of the game. Having a real community again is going to be so nice.
---
Same here. Male Tauren Shaman.
---
Thrall in WC3 and the Horde campaign was just... awe-inspiring. Class choice was pretty much a given, I *love* the idea of a physically strong spell-caster, and one focused on supporting his allies was just icing on the cake. Shaman ticked all the "ideal hero male fantasy" boxes for nerdy little me.
---
The feeling of going out into that lush plain, damn. It was epic.
---
Yeah, I agree, but our server got to the point that we had 30 minute to hour long timers and that got to be brutal when I was a kid with nothing going on. As an adult, a 30+ minute wait time is an eternity.
---
That is partially why I think the ability to toggle the que between cross server and local server would be an awesome addition. People can choose to enjoy the community. If that enjoyment comes at too high of a price because nobody is on/quing at that time, then they can just pvp with others. That way people can still enjoy the pvp component. Sure they lose the community, but they at least get to PLAY.
---
Im 99% sure its in the same dropdown that has fullscreen/windowed for pretty much all games these days.
---
&gt; This may change with warlocks being able to actually use dots since they are removing the debuff limit
---
Where did they say this or confirm this? I've read every single blue post to date about classic and don't remember information confirming this
---
It is 'Moonglow spec', which is one of two major Resto specs used, the other being a full Resto with Swiftmend. 
---
Moonglow spec certainly is more hybrid-ey, allowing you to do more spell damage with a gear switch.
---
emmm those smooth keyboard turns.
---
Hah Hellgate London had so much hype and ended up being so bad.
---
Its a server option, so you log into wow and choose it in the server list most likely.
---
I think I heard it in a tips out interview with someone, but I could be mistaken. It could have just been conjecture since the debuff limit was primarily for server stability and not gameplay.
---
They are not removing debuff limit they are just launching with 1.12s 16 debuffs instead of 1.0s 8 debuffs.
---
I dont know why im crying at the club right now
---
I know they‚Äôre not the same. It‚Äôs why I said ‚Äútoo.‚Äù
---
Ahhh gotcha
---
This book is amazing, I have one. It's a large coffee table book with a detailed map of flight paths and instances. Every zone has a page dedicated to it with a large area map that has every geographic feature ans also things like trainers, vendors and flight masters that existed at the start of the vanilla game. The maps have a grid defined on them to find the thing that is referenced. 
---
Every capital city has its own dedicated page with a map and NPC listing and every minor town and encampment has a dedicated half page with the same. 
---
There is also a 50 page index with every subject covered on any page listed with it's page number and grid location.
---
It's like a historical record of the vanilla world. Hopefully it is what we get with Classic.

Blizzard  sued Honorbuddy for 8.5million.
---
The only ones that are arguably in prior to TBC are the following:
---
Riding Turtle - Mount that is slower than running speed.
---
Hippogryph Chick - Minipet
---
Tabard of Flame - Tabard Epic
---
There was also TCG UDE Points - I think most of those items were TBC though not sure if Tabard of Frost was in the back end earlier.
---
I didn't know there is something worse than Comic Sans Serif...
---
I am easily bored both in games and IRL, so  grinding was never a thing I could do.  SO I had to find other ways to get gold, and I had a lot of experience in trading in magic the gathering cards, so  the AH was a natural fit.  I am not good at haggling , but I am very good in finding items that sell at a profit and predicting the flow of the market.  I never aspired to become the auction house tycoon, but it paid for all my mounts , bag needs and I could spoil all my alts with endless gear upgrades.   and that was good enough for me.
---
Apparently in Vanilla I had borrowed money from someone. I say apparently because to this day I still can't recollect that I actually did. But the person I supposedly borrowed from was insisting otherwise. So eventually I paid him back the supposed amount. When I did however, the person claimed that it should be more than the nominal amount, because of inflation correction. After arguing back and forth, I agreed to meet his demand. And when I paid everything back in full, the guy just said 'thanks..." (note the ellipses as a hint of disregard). He was one of those introvert silent types that dislikes any extravert and treats them with a passive aggressive attitude. Total jackass. Anyway, I was glad that I had gotten it over with, as this was pre-xrealm anything, and my name on the server mattered to me, so I wanted to clear any possible debt.
---
Since then I never do personal loans. Not loaning to friends and acquaintances, nor taking loans from them. Because, my twist on Mark Twain's famous expression: if you don't loan, you don't have to remember anything.
---
Most of the res runs are well organized and quick. If someone wants to go through the trouble of filling an ubrs with dps that won‚Äôt roll on TS, all the power to them.
---
Yep the only mount being slower than normal movement speed :P
---
I can't find the source where I read this, and I can't confirm from first hand experience. However, I read in some spriest guide that mind flay will keep ticking even if the debuff for it gets pushed off, as the this is only the slow effect.
---
The moral of the story is: if you're a nice person in WoW (e.g. farming the gold back) you are likely to get that kindness back to you.
---
You all think nice people are nice to be nice. They aren't. Nice people are just nice to people because they KNOW they would get rewarded for it. Change my mind. (No just kidding &lt;3 but the message at the top still stands)
---
Nope. It will be a separate game launchable from the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher.
---
Found the group leader
---
WoW Vanilla was. I was playing EverQuest at the time, and was blown away by any piece of info I saw on WoW. I applied for the beta but didn't get in till open beta, when I quit EQ without a second thought. WoW was the "EQ killer" I was looking for. Classic is the (retail) WoW killer I've been looking for.
---
We can always console ourselves by remembering that probabilities can work in our favor : you could get it the first time you run Strat Baron, or never get it after

---
No, it was imperfect. That's the fucking point.
---
Also the slippery slope argument completely relevant here. If you open some things up for changes then the door is now open. It is a whole lot easier for everyone if you just don't change anything at all. You had fucking LFD on this list. Put the bong down and get off of reddit.
---
I have the same problem except I usually get to lvl 40 than reroll cause ive gone too far ahead of my friends and I miss the barrens lol.. I usually end up with 2-3 40s on q server and than I quit.
---
Skullflame Shield is Bind on Equip. His rules for the run were that everyone can roll on any BoE items. Everyone ***did*** roll for the item. He just changed his mind after him and none of his guildmates won it.
---
I was leveling a warrior in vanilla. Another warrior level 60 came up to me and asked how I was doing. I told him I was doing good, enjoying leveling a warrior for the first time. He opened a trade and gifted me 100g and said ‚ÄúUs warriors gotta stick together.‚Äù Never saw him again.
---
You're right, I have the mandella effect on this for some reason and constantly think this. I already had a debate about this months ago lol, for some reason I remember vividly riding 310 on my netherdrake but I know it didn't happen in BC
---
I've level mage twice, once live once on private with a group of friends.  I beat the aoe levelers by questing quite easily.  I think the issue is the aoe spots are competitive and are so mind numbing people lose effeciency.  Plus you end up with better starter gear, rep, flightpoints, etc.
---
orc or undead .... also my recommendation is if your playing on a pvp server go sub spec...
---
better stealth, better openers, CC that doesn't get you killed...
---
Just added up the total gold required based on the skills I am going to prioritize over when leveling as a Fury Woyer, and it adds up to 40 gold give or take a few silvery coins. That said, this is up to level 60 and no re-spec in between.
---
I think it's fairly easy to accumulate up to 200 pure gold from normal questing and selling every single gray/white item you get from mobs as well as useless Q rewards. A mount by 40 should be fairly obtainable.
---
This is an awesome guide either way!
---
I turn in the breadcrumb chicken escort quest because it's good XP, but I leave the actual escort as I don't find the XP worth it, especially on a PVP server where you might fail the quest. 15 minutes is a long time to stand around.
---
I agree with Tips on a lot of issues. I think he overblows some WAY out of proportion though. Auto-loot toggle will probably be one of those, and even though he gets it's not gamebreaking,  he wants the game to be authentic, *without that*. 
---
I think a bigger shock to him will be the modern raid frames. I doubt we will see the clunky default UI for raid members in Classic, and I bet tips will make an entire episode about it. 
---
Again, I think hes fighting the good fight on things like item progression, even if it's kind of a lost cause. But taking 2 minutes to talk about auto looting (not AOE looting) is a bit silly.
---
I was really excited for Classic since I tried the BlizzCon demo, I've been watching guides, lore videos, pvp montages and stuff like that, checking reddit maybe once a day. Nothing serious, it did not affect my productivity at work. Then I met a girl in January, and in the following weeks I've been thinking about her a lot. I mean she just popped into my head like every hour through February, and since I work in game journalism and do a lot of creative stuff, it was really hard to concentrate. I felt the butterflies in my stomach, and it's awesome to be in love. We've been together for almost 2 month now.      
---
But a few days ago something began to grow on me. The blue posts made me want more, so I've watched A LOT of videos, and been checking this reddit hourly. Then every 30 minutes. Today it was pretty much every 5 minutes. I mean I was pressing F5 mid video while watching some guides. All I think about is this stupid game. I can feel my heart beating faster, as if launch was imminent. I don't think I managed to put down more than 30 minutes of work the whole day. I'm just refreshing and refreshing like a madman, waiting for something, anything. The love stuff I was talking about before, it was nothing compared to this. I have no idea what's happening, but that girl will have to fight through some serious shit to get to me. This game is corrupting me.  I'm worse than a drug addict. Something must change, or I'll go insane. Send help!
---
BoE items were open roll, Skull Flame is BoE. No ninja in this story.
---
These elementals drop the essence required to make the hide of the wild cloak, one of the early epic cloaks for healers. I farmed these for mine back in vanilla :)
---
Ah, I interpreted it as an "agreeing too" ... as in "Like you, I'd want that, too."
---
Classic misunderstanding  :)
---
Well if you can‚Äôt get away from melee then you‚Äôre a shit hunter lol. Trinket, FD, traps, slows etc 1 raptor strike is going to do shit to anything unless it‚Äôs a squishy.  I‚Äôd rather have more agility, ap, and crit than a melee weapon that has a chance to hit hard
---
Then you missed out on a huge part of the community. He used to run a site called [WoW Radio](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WoW_Radio) together with some other people before he got into Youtube stuff.
---
We need an update! How did your relationship with the person and the guild go?
---
Stop giving him views. Literally makes videos to be contrarian to any topoc possible because hes incapable of actual real content. Hes also never played actual Vanilla so he has no idea what hes talking about.
---
TIL they have 6 legs
---
Aren't Frost Nova/ Frostbite procs the only freeze effects in the game?
---
Awesome. Thanks! Do you know if the beta will be the same? If I get an invite that is.
---
It's the slippery slope.  "I don't see any problem with auto loot" becomes "well there wasn't a problem with auto-loot, so there won't be a problem with X either."
---
My god, I feel like a kid again reading that.
---
Haha!  To funny!
---
So what the player didn't see is there were 100 Gms that were invis also there.  That just happened to be the one who left invis off and probably had no idea.  But that is a perfect example of an idle GM character you might see on GM island.  The only difference to a GM is we saw all the invis characters there too! ;)
---
Depending on when Robe of Winter's Night (I think that is the item) is in the game, I might suggest waiting to grab tailoring until the Bloodvine set is out. My opinion is that Robe of the Archmage is a lot of effort for very little advantage when you think about alternatives.
---
I could be wrong though - typing this up on a phone so I can't look up the 1.12 itemization of those robes.
---
You are outside of your mind.
---
Yeah it was a dick move for sure. I wouldn‚Äôt do it to someone now. I don‚Äôt remember why i was mad at him but it was in retaliation to something. Im just saying that I don‚Äôt feel bad about it anymore cause it was forever ago. I do think its a funny story. Like a heist kinda lol. Robbed the bank and got away with it wow style lol.
---
Still, it's self-accrued information. I think it's impressive. He knew what he was doing beforehand, but didn't have the kind of information like we do today, where we would facepalm at not choosing a hunter.
---
The slippery slope argument is utter bullshit though. It has always been and will always be bullshit.
---
It's like conservatives saying "gay marriage will lead to being able to marry animals"
---
This isn't anything new.  I remember it back as long as I've done dungeons.
---
I usually did this if I was on my 15th run for the darn thing, it's dropped 4 times and I've lost every time so far.
---
LET ME IIIIIIIIN
---
Well he obviously rolled need for it (otherwise the person needing it would've won) - even though he intended to sell it. If that isnt ninja I dont know what is.
---
Oh for sure, it takes ages, but my point was just that you shouldn't waste time trying to farm money at lvl 17 because it's much less efficient.
---
Love it. My story is similar. Night before my freshman highschool biology final, our guild is attempting to down Rag for the first time. This was the first time we had enough FR and were actually making some progress in our attempts. We downed him on what was going to be our last attempt no matter what, with maybe 10 of us alive when he died. I was the lone mage alive and remember using nova, ice block, cold snap, all the frost cooldowns on that final add wave. Killed him around 1am.
---
My dad was so mad at me and told me he was going to throw away my computer if I didn't get 90% on this exam. I really thought that was the end for my wow career and I honestly accepted it. Beating Rag with our poorly constructed guild felt like beating the game.
---
I got a 91% on that final and moved on to a better guild that ended up pushing Cthun/4Horsemen. Nothing ever compared though.
---
Well, although the debuff limit was because of server stabillity, they also designed their bosses around it as a result, and removing it would upset the balance of classic
---
I actually really loved how the Vanilla and TBC cinematics were just unnamed adventurers - just stand-ins for the kind of awesomeness you as a player could get up to.  It was sorta symbolic of the difference in feel from other expansions, where more and more focus was placed on Blizz heros, and as a result our characters went from RPG nobodies to scripted saviors-of-the-world.
---
Haha, I like this
---
A balance of stamina, but as a hunter you‚Äôre gonna want to stay out of the fray as much as possible and snipe without them noticing
---
The whole party rolled need before you did ? Or after ?  Because sorry but I find it highly retarded for people to be rolling need on items that they are going to sell.  
---
If other people who couldnt use it rolled need before you then that is ok.
---
I mean yeah, you grind a few levels just killing mobs for greys instead of questing, and you make your mount money.
---
The faster you go, the less gold you will likely have, since being efficient means you're not needing to do as much in the game. You're also not making much money on the AH or from any professions. It's unusual to have the gold at 40 to get a mount immediately.
---
A few ways to preserve gold are to not buy skills you aren't going to use, loot everything and sell it religiously, avoid buying gear.
---
Your character is going to slide into 60 looking pretty lean in terms of gear and funds. You'll need to have some kind of plan at 60 to begin your professions or gold grinding etc, depending on what you want to do.
---
Ashes of Alar and Gladiator mounts were 310 in TBC.
---
While it sounds good on paper, it would only serve to split the community up more and really only benefit the people who want the cross play, while making the local queue take even longer. The community aspect is what makes classic wow. If you do anything to take away from the sense of community it hinders the game at its core. I‚Äôd be happy to wait 30 min to an hour for a local battleground because there‚Äôs so much more you can be doing to fill that time in instead of just waiting to pvp. There‚Äôs mats to be farmed, professions to keep up with, auction house trading or just going out and world pvping if you really just want to fight people.
---
Actually...
---
Agreed, people gimp warrior dps because of a low prio debuff
---
I used to do res run in Vanilla.
---
I was one of a few people how knew LBRS well, and could lead groups through the dungeon with no issues. I would res the hunter shoulders and something else but I cannot remember now. After a dozen or so runs, I never did get my shoulders. Of course in hindsight they sucked and worse worse than my truestrike shoulders, so good thing I never got the beastmaster shoulders lol.
---
I will do Res runs but I will never go crazy with it. If I really need 1 item I will res it as a tank. The best examples I can think of off the top of the top of my head are at some point ill need hand of justice for cat dps. I am going to res that, or just build groups with only casters other than myself. And the unyielding maul from DMN assuming I don't have warden staff by the time DM comes out.
---
Also since tanks are harder to come by in general I assume people will let tanks res items as payment. doing strat live often times first orb is reserved for the tank
---
Agree, pre planning is the ticket - I just feel it's a good reminder to be mindful of IRL HP :)
---
Why does everyone glom onto that one point? It is a valid question. People can CHOOSE what they want to do. Hell, I never used LFD even when it existed. PUGs are crap...
---
Imperfect and REALLY badly designed. Guild banks? Oh wait.. there weren't any. Would adding that somehow start the game down a slippery slope? Not if the game designers are not complete morons. Seems like you think if they make 1 change, they are REQUIRED to make every little tiny thing anyone wants without any thought? Wut? Speaking of putting the bong down and getting off of reddit. The point of communicating and going over things is to try to find improvements and potentially get attention on something that NEEDS it.
---
Guild banks could EASILY be fixed but you are 100% against any change at all? The narrowness of that and the Release 100% as it was is entertaining.
---
They have created an entirely different priority already by releasing it with patch 1.12 pvp gear.... Are you up in arms against that?
---
I was the last person to roll.
---
Didn't that data mined beta build show that revamped loot was already in its 1.12 version?
---
I specialise as hunter for levelling, so this question would be better answered by a priest.
---
Well I definitely wasnt that :-) As I never even leveled to 60 on vanilla. (I am TBC kinda guy)  
---
But rolling need for items that I will not use and sell Is something that goes against everything - unless everyone else rolls for them aswell.
---
I hadn't heard of that quest, but I checked the wiki and couldn't find any quests in tirisfal that give a wand as a quest reward. Do you remember which quest it might have been?
---
Rift!
---
Then you don't know what ninja'ing an item is...
---
See that 21 agi? Hunter loot.  /roll need
---
Haha right on
---
It will be in Classic, but it WONT be as big as it is in private servers. When you have 10k+ pop server you can be more picky about who you invite. With a massive pool, finding a handful of geared, skilled people who will submit to your rules is not difficult.
---
But when the CAP is at 3-4k, they will have a much tougher time filling that 40-man roster, or that ZG pug, with people, and they may need to make some concessions to fill that group, such as not reserving sought after items.
---
Pay this guy no mind, I have a feeling this was the tank from your story ;)
---
Lasted two seconds. That song...is not for pvp
---
Don't encourage Blizzard. Bandage healing is hanging by a thin thread. Get it? Bandage; thread?
---
In the original game, you had to go into town to que up at battlemasters. That was when they released battlemasters.... Quing up and going out and doing other things were two independent things.
---
If we had an easy way to que up while doing other stuff then I am in agreement here. That did not exist till later in the game though.
---
I believe it's regarded as a bug because of the whole /sit crit situation not being what they intended to be used. We won't know anyhow until Classic comes out.
---
This is like a two day old tweet man.
---
Which he said.
---
...which shows you they were using TBC data or it would have been the original exp rates...same with the auto loot feature.
---
Coup is great have you ever played resistance?
---
Oh boy are you in for a rude awakening.
---
I wonder if classic will be a lot different in some ways like money. I imagine more people will be hoarding gold and not buying every skill.
---
Also doing this, issue being that lot of Nelf rep is in Stonetalon Mountains which kinda sucks for ally but at least its some fun pvp.
---
Ironfoe is absolute BS. And that priest is a jerk.
---
But BOE items that can sell for 500-1k gold are worthwhile for any class and CAN be sold to fund their own BIS pieces. Its sorta scummy yes but the gold is to valuable to be given up. Rez items you gonna need
---
Listen here noob ret paladins coming at you!
---
Ok, that's an area where it doesn't work (or at least, hasn't worked yet).  There are other places the slippery slope argument works, such as gun control.  Anyone who proposes a gun control bill says "I am for the 2nd Amendment, but we need to restrict guns in this way."  It might be to limit magazines to 10 rounds, or add in a 7 day waiting period.
---
Once those laws pass, and prove ineffective (because guns aren't the problem, violence is) then we end up with a new proposed law, such as a 7 round limit, 14 day waiting period, or bans on other features.
---
So yes, your example is a case where the slippery slope argument has not proven true.  But there are many other examples where it is.  There's a ton of phrases built around it:
---
*Give a mouse a cookie, and he'll want a glass of milk (a whole book that explores this concept)
---
*Give them an inch and they'll take a mile
---
There's a website called NotAlwaysRight, which shows a lot of horrible customer service experiences.  Most of them deal with scammers.  Whenever a manager gives the scammer what they want, it validates that the scam works, and next time they can say "that's what you did for me last time this happened."
---
Similarly, any customer of Blizzard who tries to get changes made, can point to other changes that were made.  If we allow something simple like auto-loot, that might be fuel for the fire of "well if we got auto-loot, let's see what else we can get."
---
Thanks Olorune!
---
Kill mobs as you travel towards quest objectives that are along your way.
---
It just dawned on me lol.
---
$30 to play with your kid for a month? Seems like a simple yes to me. Think of the potential memories. I wish my father had even remotely enough interest to play video games with me as a kid.  I tried asking him once, he got fed up and couldn't figure shit out, and I never asked again.
---
I'm 25 now and if I had a 5-10 year old kid when I'm 35 or whatever who expressed interest in me playing videogames with him I'd jump on that in a heart beat.
---
Tangent aside, can you really put a price on bonding with your kid? I say do it. Set him up right next to you and explain as best you can so he understands to the best of his ability. Read every quest with silly voices just as you would a fantasy book. This can be your child's interactive story time.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the weather effects. I don‚Äôt even remember the night times!
---
&gt; Why does everyone glom onto that one point?
---
Because it shows how completely disconnected you are from what most people envision Classic to be and also what Blizzards release of Classic will look like. 
---
If I go to the doctor and he prescribes me a medication I will probably take it. If I go to the doctor and some guy comes in wearing a lab coat saws his legs off in front of me then offers me some medication I'm going to rightfully come to the conclusion he is insane and has no idea what he is talking about.
---
You just sawed your legs off in front of me and then asked me to keep listening to your wonderful ideas.
---
are you serious? the leader said "BOEs" are free for all.
---
For the most part no.
---
Knowing the inner workings of stuff, where the issues are and where things could go wrong from other raiders tickets gave me more perspective, but for the most part we weren't given any real specific information like that unless it pertained to a common player issue.
---
I suppose I could have gone through the official database, but player information was relatively accurate back then, so I never felt the need to go and verify every number.  The exact inner workings of boss raids was a little out of our scope with what we typically needed, that was by design kept under wraps.  
---
There were definitely people around who knew more in that regard than me though, but most were in other position than GM.
---
No lol, if the priest spammed manaburn,
---
Mage would shatter ( no dispel because that costs globals) no pressure and between mage armor, mana gem, and evocation, priest would be dead in 10 seconds of pure burning.
---
Imo CS silences for 10 seconds on a 25 second CD.
---
Priest can‚Äôt do anything.
---
If he needs it he can buy it from the winner of the roll.
---
When you hit that sweet spot with your toon, it's so hard to say no to open world PVP.
---
You're level 30-something in STV, you just got your whirlwind axe, death coil, feign death, ice-block, or any random ability that makes your character shine. You have these abilities up and you want to use them, what are you supposed to do, NOT kill them?!
---
I was a Mage back in BC. However Warlock is catching my eye. Is it worth switching this time around or should I go with a Mage?
---
Adopt the models similar to Path of Exile or D2 albeit much longer cycles. Once Vanilla content has reached it's final content, roll out a new server for people to fresh server again while letting players continue playing on the old ones. 
---
They get to keep making money with the least amount of dev work needed and majority of people will be content this way for a long time.
---
I don‚Äôt agree that it handles it better. It is only better handled in the eyes of those who feel hurt that they can‚Äôt roll on an item. Straight up reserving is more clear, safer, and upfront than politely asking when the group has already started.
---
Also, reserve runs doesn‚Äôt have to be guild runs. It is simple supply and demand.
---
Officially, "summer" still. There was an easter egg in the Blizzcon presentation suggesting July 16.
---
&gt; torrential downpour 
---
That wasn't a downpour; it was a deluge! Now it's a dribble.
---
there's something about the smell of that red nickname
---
Haha!  I guess if I had to pick a favorite NHL team it would be the Kings, because I worked at the facility they train at for over 10 years.  Off topic story, but when they won the first Stanley Cup the energy was really cool,  huge rowdy crowds of people were showing up to watch them practice every day.  Good times!
---
It's $15 for two games, that's cheap af. The coupled cost for Classic and Retail help ensure the Classic servers stay open instead of just relying on Classic only subs to justify their stability.
---
That is the most warrior thing I have ever heard in my entire life.
---
This is real?
---
Well then, that looks like the next thing we should bug Blizzard about after they met our loot trading demand.
---
I don‚Äôt recall having to wait around a specific area to get in. I do remember having to go to the ‚Äúinstance‚Äù of whatever battleground I wanted to get in to to queue, but not that I had to stay around that area to get in. Then again my memory has faded a lot when it comes to the details of classic. The main thing that stands out to me that made classic what it is and how amazing it was compared to current retail was the emphasis the devs took on the feeling of community. You always played with the same people in every aspect of the game and that really made a big impact. I‚Äôm happy with taking classic how it was. ‚ÄúFlaws‚Äù and all because even if they didn‚Äôt feel the best it all adds up to the greater experience which is classic wow. Some qol changes may be beneficial but I feel most wouldn‚Äôt be. People want classic just give them classic the way it was. :)
---
SWTOR was supppose to be the wow killer
---
Typically, Betas last 3+ months. With this being a large scale project, I can imagine it taking a while. People are saying it would take less time because we know the numbers from the original game, etc, but this is a whole new beast of merging the old data with the new client. While the two have been tested, they haven't really been tested together. So it's probably going to be 2-3 months of testing. Release in July or August at best. That's if this is actually a beta, and not an alpha with the wrong name.
---
I would agree with that. If some one were to say, "Hey I only need X from there. I don't care about any of the other loot", then I would be cool with running with them and them getting item X if it were to drop.
---
Most likely an honest mistake.
---
In general we only restored what we could verify.  Any sort of extra was really rare and almost never happened and generally required a unique circumstance.  Mistakes did happen though!  If no one ever followed up they lucked out! ;)
---
Whichever is more fun
---
If u DW sure it'll suck, due to most 1H being rather fast (and many reserved for hunters are among the fastest due to being poor for warriors/rogues such as silithid claw and hakkari MH). 
---
For a slow 2H as AR is it'll hurt. Specially since it is quite likely to crit. And notice: it is not the inability of getting away.  It is just to weave it for extra damage while still prepping whichever method of disengage you use. Its a instant (since you won't be meleeing by default, no swing timer) free strong hit (well, it costs a little mana...) which doesn't stop whichever distance gaining method you may use. 
---
And, honestly, melee are the ones being less of a problem.  Mages trying to deadzone are way worse.
---
In the course of that one tank getting his ironfoe he will gear countless other people. If all of those runs would be done by his guild only, most of that loot would rot while all of those people would have trouble finding a tank.
---
Well TBC was not far in gameplay. Most people say is the one true expansion.
---
The best advice I can give you is have a plan before you start.  
---
Don't train all your skills, only the ones you need.  
---
Make note of quests that give you weapon and armor upgrades.  
---
Know where your trainers and weaponmasters are.  
---
Try to know in your head where you're going to go next, all the time.
---
It's common practice to have everyone need on world drop epics, it's too random and in most cases valuable to just pass it to a guy who would use it. Occasionally a party leader will say "need if you need" but typically that's at lower levels or very rarely in pugs.
---
I never moved anyone from Dev Island but definitely from GM island.
---
Even we saw and spent very little time in those two places, at least for me.  Only times I can think of seeing them was 2nd hand, never on my own GM character.
---
Never happened to any of my guilds the officers shared a specific GBank account. But it was still dumb that that was the only way to maintain a horde of raid mats.
---
Just to clarify since most of this sub doesn't seem to understand the blue post about the loot revamp.
---
They are NOT, let me say that again, NOT changing stats to pre 1.10 levels. If an item was in the game from launch to end of vanilla and it got a Stat rework later in Vanilla lifetime...*it will have its buffed stats FROM THE LAUNCH of classic*.
---
If that item was added in a later patch, such as 1.10, that item will be "phase gated".
---
Clueless dunces like you are in for a nasty reality check when Classic releases. It‚Äôs gonna be hysterical.
---
Weapons gucci tho.
---
Classic WoW had insanely good weather effects. Looking forward to seeing them again.
---
I remember all these details like each individual droplet landing on buildings and stuff like that. Nothing at the time even came close. In fact, I can't really think of a modern game that does it better either.
---
I think ignoring is a bit harsh. However if a person is resing 2-4 items, yeah maybe ignore them. But a group leader resing 1 item they really need has never bothered me. If I need the item too, I just wont join that group.
---
Don't forget that hardly legible uncontrasty lettering, and probably made with Windows Movie Maker.
---
I don't care for Pay to Win.
---
Dishing out money for trading cards that could get you in-game rewards is just super lame.
---
Your welcome
---
I've seen videos of people switching out tailoring multiple times, I'm almost at the point where I don't feel it's worth it to drop the profession just to take it back up later in the patches. What do you think?
---
Sure, should be covered in my upcoming pros/cons video!
---
This is a non-issue.
---
If you don‚Äôt like the concept of reserving items you join groups that don‚Äôt reserve or even better you make your own group (optional: even advertise nothing is or will be reserved).
---
I started playing in '05 when I was around 8. It's totally possible to enjoy the game when you're young, but 5 might be pushing it. Also, you will have to shield them excessively from douches.
---
If you ever convince another family member or friend to play, I'd ask to let them have your son put a toon on their account. Just ask ahead of time when you want to play with him, best of both worlds.
---
agreed 100%
---
The app makes it much easier and if you don't like Reddits app try Reddit Is Fun
---
Yeah people are pretty confused about the loot revamp, and I'm not sure Blizz has been 100% clear. There's two different aspects of the loot, the stats on existing items (progressive itemization) and the actual gear that is available (time gated loot). From what it sounds like, they won't be doing progressive itemization but will be doing time gated loot. This is actually a pretty lame situation, since it means certain overpowered items will be in from the start since they were stat changes (Brigham Girdle, Savage Gladiator Chain), but other overpowered items will have to wait for phase (ie Spellweave Turban).
---
It's from a quest buddy.
---
I mark XP/hr based on large chunks of route. 20k XP/hr at 20 is pretty solid.  
---
In Ashenvale around level 24 there are sections around 36k/hr.    
---
Wetlands around level 27 is 38k/hr.  
---
Duskwood 47k xp/hr.
---
I leveled a warrior on a fresh server for TBC so farming money at 70 was never *great,* but early on I found out Primal Mana had a solid demand but was really hard to farm for anyone with a mana bar.
---
The motes only reliably dropped in decent numbers from mobs in Netherstorm that spammed mana burn and were hard to pull one at a time, so farming them with a mana class was just a no go. But as a Fury Warrior starting to get endgame gear, I could camp the spawns and grind them with almost no downtime (no mana = no damage from mana burn).
---
I could farm usually 10 Primal Mana in an hour and sell them very fast for 20g each. 200g an hour as a solo warrior! I felt like a genius because I was basically *the* supplier for a niche material. Prices eventually dropped by at least half but by then dailies were sufficient to afford raiding.
---
A guy on a discord Im on said he would never give if his gold even if he was dieing irl
---
"I'ma get you banned so there's no way I could ever get my money back! Take that!"
---
Holdup
---
Also in the case of those geared AQ people doing MC and the like. That is when Gold DKP runs become more common. Good way for geared players to earn a bit of gold, good way for lesser geared people to earn some gear. And normally the geared people hosting the run will res bindings anyway.
---
Bahahaha I love your dumb you sound :) Did you not read the (Not needed) part next to it?
---
That was one idea that they clearly believed was a core part of their game and it is. So to wonder if implementing it earlier is a productive thing and discussing it is too far fetched for you. Then I am sorry I broached a topic that turns your brain into REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
Glad you can really critically think and get past one sentence :).
---
You know it!
---
I think you  missed the joke, buddy.
---
WoW Classic will give you the option for a Classic Video settings, meaning the game will look exactly like it did in 2004. It has not been confirmed if weather effects will take place, but I expect it to fall under the "reacreating the vanilla experience" meaning it will be added (can anyone confirm?).
---
WoW classic will also be playable with updated graphics. Meaning shadow effects, more details on the ground, the new water and mainly improved (HD/Ultra HD) textures on models. It will NOT include animations and the WoD models. Just the old models, but in more detail.
---
For me it is the opposite. I am so happy to not see motorbikes in the game.
---
Yeah I want to do a fresh 60 video of what items to go for and how to start your end game progress as a druid. Really wad just waiting to see what they do with progressive itemization. Thanks for the kind words, glad you like the content!
---
I expect alliance will be there for sure. There have been a number of server firsts lately that were alliance.
---
They will be adding things to the loot tables, but not adjusting the individual stats of items that would have been different in 1.12 vs. previous patches.
---
For example Titanic Leggings will be added later, but BRE will be its 1.12 version from the start.
---
Good thing I‚Äôm in middle of my dead season right now, so that means I can Reddit to my heart‚Äôs desire.
---
Bad news is that busy season will start to begin when Classic is released :(
---
You can buy it if you are rank 11+.
---
Alright ... first off:
---
&gt; because guns aren't the problem, violence is
---
Guns are the problem because people will not be less violent, but we can take away weapons that will make it a whole lot easier to actually murder people.
---
Now back to the actual topic. I agree with you that leniency can be exploited (and will be by certain people). But allowing X does not equate allowing Y. It might mean that people will try to get Y, but if you refuse it then it won't happen. So in this case, the only effect of being okay with auto looting might lead to "hey, auto looting turned out to be fine, how about this other thing?" Then we will discuss this other thing, talk about pros, cons, whether it keeps in line with the vanilla game design, think about possible other effects it might have and come to a conclusion. No bullshit, just actual arguments. Any discussion with real arguments is better than no discussion because of phrases like #nochanges or slippery slope.
---
Also do not forget that we have a lot more knowledge and wisdom when it comes to QoL changes in WoW than we did back then. We see what effects flying, lfd/lfr, etc. have on the game.
---
They're working on the current engine so the lighting and animation, everything is current. But they're recoding everything to get it as close as possible. It'll be very very similar, practically the same. Im assuming there will be settings for increased ground clutter, for example.
---
We had a few different ways to help players.  The primary way which covered 95% of issues happened out of game in an In house developed program that ran like a chat program with connection to the WoW data base.  We could see accounts, change names, action players, look up logs, move players you name it, we could pretty much do it.
---
Anything that didn't get solved from there had a GM client that basically looked the same as the normal client except we could put in GM commands.  if I recall correctly it was a separate command prompt and I do recall having a instant kill macro to fix question issues.
---
Generally GMs by default are invis.  So often times I was running around your character without you knowing.  Sometimes I would teleport players to my location where they couldn't see me so that is why it probably felt like we could appear anywhere.  
---
Teleporting I remember required coordinates, so I couldn't port you to Ragnaros, but in theory I could to Ragnaros coordinates, but I wouldn't know them off the top of my head.  Most common teleports were me teleporting to you, and me teleporting your character to me.
---
Even the "private private" server footages, especially for the beta are being removed to avoid a hassle with Blizzard. Thanks for being understanding.
---
I'm not very qualified when it comes to rogues, and I think there would be many rogue players here who could answer that question better than me. I can say that on my rogue playthrough, sitting at two levels above where a guide is for a hunter worked nicely to reduce misses and increase crits and uptime.
---
In essence I agree with you. From my experience those who are against reserves are those with the least leverage and want to be carried by other group members while doing as little as possible. I understand their position, but I still find it pathetic.
---
I see people saying they will /ignore those advertising reserved runs and I laugh. Good riddance. Both sides will be free of each other‚Äôs perceived retardness.
---
Most vanilla fights were tank and spanks for the most part. I don't think having a few extra dots will noticeably affect 95% of encounters from RFC to Naxx. God forbid half the raid isn't mage/rogue/warrior and we get some actual variance.
---
Usually yes, you need more stamina for PVP than PVE (unless you're the tank). 
---
However you have to find a balance between survivability and damage.
---
This is why I made this post, I wanted to see what more experienced hunters would say.
---
Well, you did not have to wait there, but if you are getting que pops every few minutes, then you could not actually get to a location to start something else. So you would start heading there and the que would pop. When finished, it would put you right back where you started.
---
It was super frustrating.
---
I agree the community part is the main thing people are looking forward to. I think the numbers of players will surprise many people to start. The grind is certainly going to chase away some of the BR players in the first week, but it will be so fun to experience the game again.

---
Yeah understandable, sorry i'll avoid doing that again. I'll only post if there is a  tiny amount of footage
---
Nagrand was such a good farm zone but it was insane on a pvp server. Elemental Plateau was just off limits without a group.
---
Dude that's a hunter weapon
---
It will noticeably affect raid fights 100%, especially dps fights like Vael. It will also change raid composition and class viabillity
---
Why not let Classic be classic. If you want those modern QoL play retail. Not everything has to be convenient or make sense. People have been playing and loving classic for a literal decade. If a realm is dying off a server merge is the best option.
---
Yeah, my buddy's guild did the shared GBank account, but it was still silly. I really hope they can implement that one. I think it changes NOTHING about the gameplay and will not start us down the "Slippery change slope" that some are afraid of.
---
Thrash Blade is the most important one. You‚Äôll be using it for a long time.
---
What combo specifically?
---
...did you read the story at all? Or do you just not know what ninja looting is?
---
Yeah it's funny. I dubbed around on a lowbie character for a bit. This was a while after I unsubbed. For giggles I clicked the button to add game time with gold and it was going to charge me something like 100k gold and I was thinking "No way I have that, what the hell".
---
I clicked next and I received a warning that I would "only" have 50k gold after that transaction. I had completely forgot how inflated gold is now. I canceled the transaction. I'll use it when Classic comes out.
---
I think there is a legitimate argument against AOE loot because having to loot one by one significantly slows down AoE farming. Without that mages will be another massive leap ahead of other classes for gold making.
---
What's the process? Do you just repeatedly level a hunter?
---
Priest control is all short.  Silence is 20 yards, fear is point blank, and the only other thing they have is blackout and you can blink that stun if necessary.  
---
Poly on initiation, ideally at range.  If for some reason he starts on top of you and is CCing, you have to block it to get the poly out.  He can trinket poly so be ready to repoly.  
---
Open at 36 yards spamming frostbolts, expect him to dispel your slows so maybe mix in some r1s and keep backing up.  Your frostbolts should outdamage hit dots.  If you ever get lucky on a crit or two and he falls behind on HP you can blink in imp-CS and try to execute him with a shatter combo.  If he heals early let him, but if he is sub 50% healing CS his holy tree.  If you go a long time without any substantial damage to him just repoly when the dots on you are about to expire and eat+reset.  Shadow typically has a big mana pool but burns if very quickly with bad regen.  Two resets should OOM him and get him to a point where he cannot dispel anymore.  
---
Warlock is the opposite, you have to play the most aggressive way possible.  If he is voidwalker, expect him to sacc the pet early to try and get another pet.  Ideally poly him and reset when he sacs the pet but before he gets another out.  
---
If he is felhunter it is a bit more complicated, but at least he wont have the big ass absorb.  
---
Fire ward and Ice Barrier on CD, get into his face and fireblast on CD.  Counterspell shadow only.  If he has voidwalker aggressively in his face frostbolt-&gt;nova-&gt;fbolt-&gt;coc, then cold snap nova-&gt;fbolt-&gt;coc again.  He should be below 1/3 HP at this point and not yet broken your barrier. 
---
 Iceblock off deathcoil, decurse if he tounges.  
---
If the felhunter is out just expect him to fuck your combo by locking frost, don't panic and just swap to scorch for the time being.  Maybe with felhunter it is worthwhile to try and bait and fakecast so you can block out of the silence.  Shadow reflector, being undead, grenades, etc help a ton.  PVP trinket is a 2nd fear break as well.  If he has a frost reflector you probably autolose.  
---
Elemental spec isn't super popular, but is actually quite good vrs warlock.  Do exactly what I listed above except add in impact stuns, blastwave, and ignite on scorch crits.  Since you need to lock the shadow tree, and fireward cancels out his fire damage, imp CS isn't that important.  
---
I don't think you can beat a competent warlock without coldsnapping for damage.
---
Thunderbluff should have a vanilla milkshake stand.
---
I think SWTOR was what I was most hyped about because it looked like exactly what I wanted after WoW
---
There's also a few items that have freeze effects. Freezing Band, Magister's set and I think one or two more.
---
2 months from 40 to 52? I forget how long that takes haha.
---
What do you mean I can‚Äôt roll on truestrike with my Retadin
---
Planning on rolling a 39 UD rogue
---
It will only make classes more viable. Not less. I don't see that as a bad thing, but I know a lot of people are very uncomfortable with blizzard changing anything. Even if its for the better.
---
Could I perhaps get a GM joke?
---
You can block on yt? thanks!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's been stated yet.
---
Excellent name ! Since it's only good with a troll rogue, I don't think they'll steal your name, you might be the only troll rogue in classic !
---
We now have 2 troll rogues in original vanilla !!! I never suspected there were so many of them :D
---
Paladin. The gameplay and class fantasy do absolutely nothing for me. Also Alliance.
---
This thread is really cool and it sucks Blizzard no longer does this.
---
Bug them to make it unauthentic? BfA nights are virtually the same as Vanilla; some zones are brighter and some are darker than they were. If you want the game to be significantly darker than most zones on BfA, you're asking for a change. Elwynn forest, 1.12 on the left, BfA on the right: [https://i.imgur.com/6n8fsqf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6n8fsqf.jpg)
---
We probably will get cross realm BGs anyways - they were already in the game in 1.12 so this could technically go either way. Although PVP kinda died on a lot of servers at that point so ideally they wouldn't.
---
As for dungeon queue, that noise can die in a fire. Dungeon finder was the real start of WoW's fall. It's completely unnecessary. Either use LFG channel or find an active guild where getting a run going for almost anything is easy.
---
Casuals stick around when they desire the exclusive content they can't get too. Otherwise casuals just unsub when there's nothing for them to actively work towards. You could spend months at a casual rate getting pre-BIS together. There's plenty of non aimless time sinks in Vanilla - way more than in retail in fact. If you're not getting your ilvl higher in retail whatever you're doing is basically a waste of time. At least in Vanilla gold farming MATTERS, farming consumables MATTERS, getting pre-BIS MATTERS, reputations and attunements MATTER, Professions MATTER, Resistance gear MATTERS. There's none of the fake content that doesn't actually improve your character in the least. There are tangible goals that you can ALWAYS be working on solo or with a group in Vanilla. In retail there is the unfulfilling ilvl/azerite grind and that's about it for meaningful character development.
---
Or... 
---
...play at your own pace and enjoy the experience of exploring the world of warcraft.
---
For once, this home of ours will be permanent.
---
I played in late vanilla and I do remember having shift + click as auto-loot.
---
While it certainly didn't kill WoW I actually really enjoyed Rift.
---
Or hanging out in your base at night and hearing gun shots in the distance. I remember being legitimately afraid to leave my base in that game.
---
Right, all weapons are hunter weapons
---
I agree with the server merge, but how long does one wait for that? A week or two with no pvp is enough for most gamers to just buzz out. I won't, but again I am trying to look at this as a casual player.
---
If they gave numbers and made people comfortable with when it will happen, then I would be less hungry for a way to consistently pvp.
---
Classic WILL be classic. There are just enough things that could be tweaked SLIGHTLY to improve the gameplay. Also, the toggle ability would allow the core community that wants to stay tight to remain that way. Basically the que would be a way to try to incorporate more people in the end.
---
I would love to see classic power through with a good strong playerbase, I am just not sure how strong it will really be.
---
Retail is absolute shit on a side note. They made it a single player game. I in NO way want that. If you implemented a que system day 1 for dungeons, people would avoid it like the plague as content took coordination and teamwork in vanilla. It wasn't all so damn easy. People seem to think being able to que with random people will just mean insta wins. Dungeons were difficult in vanilla. Part of why I never used LFD. Was not worth it.
---
That‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm forgetting about.
---
It's in Silverpine from the last quest in the Arugal's Folly chain, you'll probably be 13 or 14 by the time you complete it. The wand is only marginally better than the lesser magic wand and by that time you can get a greater.
---
Hi, /u/blindzor93
---
Haha!  I think that was a pretty common feeling from players.  Honestly I really did feel like the Azeroth police at times!
---
In general the GMs really did enjoy helping the players and since most of us were players ourselves could appreciate things like a really awesome mount collection!  If I had the opportunity to make the player feel a little special during our interaction, I definitely wanted to take the extra step to do that. even if it was something small like noticing a really cool mount collection!
---
I mean we both have fulltime jobs, so all our spare time is going into playtesting the guide.  
---
There's a lot of repeated levelling, measuring XP rates, checking vanilla sources for accuracy, and shifting/testing/discarding sections or grinds based on efficiency. We completed 1-60 but always refining.
---
That's a good point - I didn't think to search the forums. Thanks for the advice!
---
I am so looking forward to it as well! All the good and the bad ! The adventure from 1-60 is so satisfying. I‚Äôm almost dreading the day I get my first char to 60. Which is why I‚Äôm going to be taking my time and leveling two characters with complimentary professions. Hopefully keeping them pretty close in level and keeping the burnout at bay. That way by the time I‚Äôm 60 hopefully the rat race that will be early end game will be over and I‚Äôll be able to progress into PVE at a little more relaxed pace, since pve isnt really my end game goal. I‚Äôd like to grind out the pvp ranks for their gear as first priority but I know a little raid gear would help with that.
---
amen to a permanent home!
---
I‚Äôm interested in 39 or 49 thinking.  Not sure if I‚Äôll do it or not yet but I‚Äôve definitely been thinking about it.  The lower levels don‚Äôt really interest me spamming 1-2 buttons on a rogue or hunter isn‚Äôt my cup of tea

&gt; I love how dumb you sound

---
Agreed on all points.
---
I hope the rates of phase release are not too fast. I want to have to work to get the BiS stuff before new stuff comes out.
---
I remembered about the site [https://itemization.info](https://itemization.info) so I went there to check my items.
---
Most of them were updated in patch 1.10 (they had shit stats before).
---
Does it mean that all my list is dead before phase 5 (AQ patch) ?
---
What guild? Borbie still plays on there, last time I was on I hunted him down and killed him.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up Blizzard‚Äôs sleeve next. If Classic becomes a hit and there are more subs than retail, what happens? What do you do to keep players playing 5-6 years after Classic release? We will inevitably start to get bored due to no content releases.
---
If this is successful, I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre going to do an overhaul to retail and return it back to more of a Classic style game via some expansions. Let players transfer their Classic 60s or replicate them on the retail servers, then do more of a horizontal progression for the game. 
---
This is honestly the best way to handle the situation if WoW Classic utterly dominates retail. Keep Classic there, but once content gets dry, try to revert retail back to Classic and add content that compliments Classic.
---
They might just have to make another WoW game branded as WoW2 or Starcraft MMO.
---
I think it was more you didn't want to show the player a naked character avatar!  There is sort of a mystique you want to up hold as a game master, especially since we are invis so much!  Keeping that mystique going is all a part of the GM aura! ;)
---
Me me me! Goal is to rush 60 as a mage to farm gold, start a 29 twink guild (I‚Äôll be rolling holy pally and a lock) and probably dabble in 39s.
---
Found it, thanks!
---
I am sure this is constructive and useful... will not be clicking on it. Enjoy being blocked. Troll.
---
I remember playing on my human warrior, lvl 20ish and asked a level 40 paladin for 10 silver, so I could buy a better weapon from vendor. He gave me Long Soft Tail's which I sold to vendor and got my new weapon. Those small little things really gave the world a special feeling, which IMO you cant experience in any other game.
---
Even in p-servers, I find people WAY more social and helpful, compared to current wow and im not bashing on the community, im bashing on the game which makes socializing unnecessary.
---
Certainly some of the leaked screenshots have noticeable differences while still maintaining the older look and feel. I am fine with the minor upgrades from the engine alone, but I'll have to pop in game and really compare the look and feel with lighting and weather added in.
---
If you would have told me 10 years ago that WoW would kill WoW, I would have thought you were insane.
---
I was sure it was going to be Warhammer Online or SWTOR....

Your comment made me remember how common it was in my guild to do this because of how much faster people made money with epic flying. Our guild encouraged people to chip in on a loan once someone only needed 1k more, since it's a lot of work to get to that point and it shows commitment. It was actually harder to convince people to accept it then it was for them to pay it back.
---
 **&lt;Titanforged&gt;** *Alliance / NA-(RP)PvP / semi-casual*   
---
**Raid Schedule&amp;Information:**  Weds/Fri 9pm-11:30pm EST, with an extra night on Mondays for the first months of new content. Using modified Suicide Kings. Primarily looking for DPS, with slightly less focus on healers. All players are welcome to inquire.    
---
**Introduction:** The core of the guild is built up from several long-time veterans of RP and RP-PvP servers on retail, with raid experiencing varying from casual to hardcore over the years. Though some of us played back in 2005, our experience has been very centered on retail, with only occasional forays on private servers. Classic is a fresh experience that we are very excited for, particularly the aspects of social interaction.    
---
The primary tenants of our guild are *community, integrity, and accessibility.* That is, we want to establish more than just a raid team, but a cohesive group that is a trusted name to the greater server community.     
---
**What We Expect From You:** The above mentioned values are reflected directly in our raiding policies and our expectations of our members. We intend to raid *semi-casually*, so we will not hold our members to strict class, talent or gear metas. The only expectation we have for our raiders is a good attitude, reliable attendance, and a willingness to carry your weight. No prior raid experience required, everyone has to learn somewhere!    
---
We are pushing for the inclusion of RP-PvP servers on Classic WoW, but our contingency is to roll on a PvP server-- Hopefully with other RP-PvP community members!  
---
If you've made it this far, feel free to join our discord and say Hi, or message me with any questions/comments you may have! (Or if the role bot isn't working!) [https://discord.gg/QvuAvt9](https://discord.gg/QvuAvt9)

Good lord, that‚Äôs like 1800 hours of leveling!
---
1  Deep Frost
---
2  Imp CS Frost
---
3  Pom Frost
---
4  AP-Fire
---
5  Elemental
---
6  Pom Fire
---
Fire specs get more popular late in expo when people start running fire in pve.  Also activated trinkets are a must for AP-Fire.
---
Haha no idea!  
---
In general we spent very little time needing to know very specific information like that.  The only reason we may come across that is if it were bugged and a player could prove to us it wasn't functioning properly.  Even then giving out really accurate info on stuff like proc rate wasn't something in the scope of what a GM would be able to help with, so they didn't tell us.
---
What about Nub‚Äôs wand you can get at level 10 from ‚ÄúThe Gilneas Liberation Front‚Äù quest?  You just have to kill 10 Worgens, no group required, and it gives 9 int and 2 stam.
---
You raise a fine point. Reserve runs are only prevalent because people think others will join them. I.e. Ironfoe reserved runs are easily filled (and also why you don‚Äôt see them advertised as often perhaps ? Survival bias). Rogue reserving items that tanks could use for their offspec/main spec probably won‚Äôt have the same success rate. In short, supply and demand. Tanks have more leverage in these situations.
---
Sharding is hardware/software infrastructure related, not 1.12 content data related.
---
Psst, /s really helps out here.  Too many people (myself included a lot of times) can‚Äôt discern sarcasm without some sort of indicator in a text-based format.
---
For sure. I have to level 2 characters to start.. One with my wife and one when she is bored or not wanting to play.... Will be a struggle, but I cannot WAIT for the content.
---
I plan on running a guild or having one of my friends run it. So the Guild bank thing is something we all hope they tweak. That was just inconvenient.
---
PvP ranks is something I would love to grind, but I just know I do not have the time for it. Wish I could, but there is no way. That is my main reason for the pvp que thing. When I want to pvp with friends, we get like 2 hours and then we go old people.... so we really would like to be able to get some pvp on.
---
Back in Vanilla I had rivalries and back and forths with the same guilds in wpvp and bgs. I just don't have the time for that anymore. Nor do most people I game with.
---
Orcs have tusks don't they?
---
I could see this, but at a certain point people will get bored of this model. Yeah, it‚Äôs a blast to start on fresh servers, but if all the content is the same it gets tiring after the 2nd restart.
---
I honestly see them adopting this model, but if it‚Äôs a huge hit figuring how to make an expansion for Classic.
---
Sharding is hardware/software infrastructure related, not 1.12 content data related. Doesn‚Äôt apply to the above.
---
The reason people are so against queuing is you no longer have to make the decision to join a group the decision also has to be made to invite you. Meaning if you're known for being an asshole you're not getting into that group. Its little things like that that can change a whole dynamic of a game. 
---
You're right we dont know the numbers or how strong the player base will be but instead of fixing an issue that doesn't exist yet why not cross that road when we get there. 
---
I'd also play on popular old servers IE if a realm is named Illidan then I almost promise it will have a booming pop. That's pure speculation though
---
WoW -&gt; Diablo 3 -&gt; WoW Classic
---
WoW was the excitement of the unknown and the game totally delivered (still does to this day).
---
Diablo 3 was an unbelievable disappointment that I was only ever able to finally wrap my head around when I realized it was designed from the start to be played both PC and console.
---
WoW Classic is interesting because the hype has everything to do with a known commodity.  Less potential to amaze/inspire like WoW did way back in the day, but no chance for crushing disappointment like D3.
---
I concur
---
That sounds awesome! It's one of those things that was so much more fun back then, since everybody was more unique, and you could go absolutely nuts with your talents. And classes weren't as unbelievably durable as they are these days.
---
Warlock and Rogue sounds like a fun murder fest! Craziest I ever did was Warlock and Mage. Our thinking was that nothing could kill us if we set the whole world on fire üòÄ
---
...we died a lot. But when it worked, we were like mass murdering supervillains.
---
I remember the comfort one felt being indoors in the dead of night with a forge and a couple campfires going. We had very limited light, but we were thankful for it! Me and my mates could relax and chat on vent while we crafted some items and sat around the subtle glow of the forge fire. Discuss plans for the next day.
---
Only other game I felt that sort of fear of night and relief of shelter was the blood n bones modpack in minecraft.
---
Not really; anything added after 1.12 content is out.
---
Also, if you introduce a queue it will basically become a requirement. Humans are lazy by nature and most will opt for the path of least resistance regardless of the ramifications
---
Realistically, it damn well is. 
---
Also I've got a weird coincidence going on. *Short story ahead:* Back in 2005 when WoW launched in the EU I only played on very poorly scripted private servers. I couldn't afford to buy games let alone pay a subscription. One day we were at my cousins place for a big gathering and I was helping out in the kitchen and stuff. Later when we headed home my cousins' dad gave me and my brother like 60 bucks each. And believe me, where I'm from, and the age I was, 60 bucks is legit swimming in fucking gold.
---
I immediately spent the money on buying WoW and a 2 month game card. I finally got to play retail wow "for real".
---
Fast forward to earlier this month, I somehow started working at my cousins' company. I just needed any job and they quickly found me a place. Oddly enough, I will end up spending money *again* on Vanilla, money in the form of an official salary given to me by my cousins' dad essentially, lol.
---
Kinda odd when I think about it.
---
Well this IS the definitive guide to what's in and what's out isn't it? Is sharding in or out?
---
I say we send a petition to blizzard immediately
---
You can't get any more authentic than this. 
---
This is what classic was all about.
---
My main was a hunter but I wanted to try out a friend's class so I made a Tauren Warrior. I accidentally zoomed in the camera to a first-person view the moment I spawned. I thought all warriors were forced to play in first-person mode so I deleted him. I didn't realize how dumb I was until I saw my friend playing with a normally zoomed-out camera...
---
Yeah, that is the hope. Get into a high pop server that is fairly even.
---
The Hope is real! Cannot wait for it. 100% agree on that A hole component. People got blacklisted for ninja looting and just being pricks. I remember those days.
---
The que system DOES break that so I agree. It is not needed at all early. Maybe later down the road.
---
I know, right?  Cool.  I'll try to recover my account one of these days.  It's been since mid BC since I have had a sub though....
---
Do you have an add-on and macro list that you use? And or your keybindings? Just interested
---
Well played!
---
In if they want for stability, yes. But it doesn‚Äôt apply to this guide. This guide is about the content.
---
I currently run my own business coaching ice skaters, and have for the last 11 years.  I work at several different rinks in my area.
---
I also pick up any side gigs I can hosting gaming tournaments.  I was doing that as a side thing for a couple years and really liked it! So I've been putting a little more effort in lately to apply for any jobs like that I see that come from game developers.
---
Did GMs work from home, or did GMs have to go to office? And if from home, did you have to buy your own computer to run WoW sufficiently for your job? Or did Blizzard supply one?
---
There's a difference between posts saying what is or is not included...and posts \*SUGGESTING\* what should be included.
---
People will make threads where they say 'it would be COOL if XYZ thing was included'. It's gonna happen. Don't fret, it's a completely natural thing to do to pass the time until we get more information, and Classic comes out.
---
They're gonna talk about it. You ain't gotta participate in that.
---
Tons of Amon Amarth while PvPing
---
Thanks for the insight! It really helped me with the comparisons to swtor.
---
Don't you gain exp from bgs? I thought the toggle for exp didn't come in until later. 
---
Could be wrong, idk.
---
Having a strange mix of components in your PC would probably do it... But when there are millions of people out there finding that odd mix of parts that still makes you "technically viable" as a user is gonna be a trick.
---
I will for sure I played 29s mostly in the past, will probably do 39s in classic as well as other brackets.
---
The problem with expansions is that they abandon all content . In legion people were given quest to go back to the world, that makes the world of warcraft, not the new islandcraft
---
There won't be new textures. Classic will use 1.12 data.
---
I needed and won Whiteman's hat on my rogue because I had a shitty green helm and.... I did not understand at all why everyone was mad....
---
1 more rank for that 10% discount though.
---
Classic uses the 1.12 data, including animation.
---
Could you please explain to me how you presented the traffic stats in such an attractive fashion? Thanks so much!
---
Your final paragraph can‚Äôt be overstated.  The list of overpowered racials begins and ends with melee weapon specialization for PvE (and fear ward).  As mages do not use weapons it largely doesn‚Äôt matter.  Beyond that everything is just gravy, flavor, or situational.  Some very compelling situations (WotF vs. fear mechanic), but situational nonetheless.
---
IIRC there was no toggle at all, you just didn't gain any exp from bgs.
---
Glad I could help shed some light on why people are so aggresive. We've been fighting for this for a decade and anything that threatens the game we've wanted for so long is bound to be met with very strong resistance. Even if a change seems harmless enough on the surface an mmo is all connected in one way or another.
---
exactly
---
I remember when I first quit: it was on my NE hunter and I gave away what little gold I had left and a few pieces of Black Dragonscale armor I had crafted.  All while being butt naked standing in front of the bank in SW.  I felt like I had to publicly shame my character and give away everything until there was nothing left so I'd be sure I didn't come back.  1 year later, and BAM! I was back for more.
---
That actually made returning to the game a lot more interesting, as I had to start from scratch with money, bags, not to mention a weapon - it kind of felt like playing Dark Souls as the Deprived class.  I was able to craft my way back up to something decent since I still had my 300 LW skill.  Made a pretty triumphant return and grabbed a few pieces of blue PvP gear before BC hit :)
---
Looking forward to rolling either a druid or warrior again this time in classic!  Can't wait!
---
So much hate regarding the Windows key, yet its the most useful key on your keyboard

Windows key + D to minimize everything on the desktop

Windows key + W to close Explorerer windows and some software

---
Windows key to open taskmenu
---
Windows key + X to cut

Windows key + 1-9 to open pinnee shortcuts

Etc.
---
All my window navigations I rarely use my mouse. Are you pressing it by accident or something?
---
I dunno, if you are serious about raiding, you are better off establishing your brand before you have a guild with a bunch of level 45-60's all expecting different things. It doesn't have to be fully fleshed out, but you should have an idea for a name, set up a discord and record all the basic "rules" you want for the guild. 
---
How many times per week will you raid? How many of each class would you like to aim for on your roster? Do you want a small raid guild where everyone in the guild is a raider, or do you want a large social guild with a raid subset? What are the thresholds for going from a social guildmate to a raiding guildmate? Who will lead your raids? What will you loot method be? How will you keep track of the loot distribution? What minimums do you expect from your raiders? What minimums do you expect from your non-raiders? etc
---
If you have clear rules and objectives that you communicate to people as/before they join your guild, then they are more likely to be there with you through the journey, as they know what they are signing up for and agree with your terms. If you just pray to gather a group and then sort it all out close to 60, you'll find it more difficult to get things together as different people will want different things and guilds really can't be all things at once.
---
We believe free for the game itself, just requires a $15/mo subscription.
---
My parents were paying subscription for my swimming lessons and gymnastic back when i was 5. At 6+ was football and music instrument. I dont think, growing an addiction on computer games at such early age is a good idea.
---
When I was lvl 16 ish.   I deleted my character because my friend said I chose the wrong talents.    Thinking the game was going to be like diablo 2 was at the time with no way to respec. (The diablo 2 respec ability came later on)
---
Yes sir! It‚Äôs a combination of their PVP and PVE timelines. The only thing we don‚Äôt know yet is the dates of the phases :)
---
https://imgur.com/Fjhj4Y4
---
This isn't going the way you thought it would is it?
---
It's almost like you can't really make a snarky 'Definitive Guide' when Blizz hasn't given us any patch notes.
---
While I don‚Äôt argue with you there, it will be a challenge because of time. I don‚Äôt ever expect to achieve my goal is that this game provides one for me to work towards is satisfying. I don‚Äôt even think I would have reached max rank before in classic but it‚Äôs cool to see how far you can get. That‚Äôs another thing that makes wow so amazing. It caters to so many different people and interests. There‚Äôs a little bit of something for everyone in classic wow. From a person who plays hundreds of hours a week to someone who puts only in a few. Everyone can find enjoyment in the game and everyone can contribute meaningfully to the game. I don‚Äôt expect my girlfriend to play as much as I do and it‚Äôs not necessary for her to nor do I feel hindered by it. She loved to farm mats and do professions, so shed mostly do that when she‚Äôs on and that would provides all the consumables for dungeons or what have you. All these little things are what make wow great and appeal to so many people. Amazing game so stoked they are putting clsssic out again. I‚Äôve been ignoring it with all my heart since nov 2017 with the news release, but I‚Äôm waiting on my new rig to come in the mail just in time for the classic launch, possibly even for a beta launch if we get one and the hype I‚Äôve been suppressing  for the past year and a bit is all bursting out now haha.
---
I was a paladin soo....
---
Not exactly as memorable as everyone else
---
Yeah, I have no idea what it is about vanilla, but the moment you login to your favorite starting area, it just hits you. Entirely different feeling compared to current.
---
Excel
---
Why is your class trainer always so good to you?
---
Because they Respec you!
---
But..the subs are shared. So Classic can't have more then retail. It's the same number.
---
Would be a great bday present for me. +1
---
I snort this nostalgia like premium Colombian. I can't wait to backpedal the years away.
---
So you have to get WoW for classic and it's just included. Gotcha thank you
---
I bought it from a vendor...
---
Yup. Nothing stated. My guess would be a separate launcher because of the cdn update. Which would make sense if there are any client specific tweaks needed for classic. But at this point it's just a guess
---
Priest speccing for PvP heals but with Blackout and Mindflay. Spam r1 SWP on everything and use r1 Mindflay to snare and fish for stun procs every free moment. Idk if people really did this in vanilla but you definitely could, it may have been more of a TBC thing once "mana wars" often defined fights.
---
Is leveling mage harder then just spamming frostbolt
---
The content is getting better and better.
---
Is it just me or did anyone else get the music from WC2 stuck in their head upon seeing this?
---
Oh the memories, I remember burning a copy to a blank cd so my dad and I could play together...
---
I think I remember how I got resurrection on my human paladin, wasnt it a quest which would take you to the island in elwynn forest?
---
39 enhance shammy
---
Hit 40 on my lock and paid a small fee. Also I was such a slow leveler that when I got to 60 some guildies, one of which being a lock with the mount items, ran me through DM for the epic mount
---
Thanks mate. Guess what I'm saying is I am wondering if there is a more efficient way that copy pasting numbers from my mod tools menu.
---
Back on topic too, nice job on the growing community!
---
It'll make what, a 2% difference?
---
Many other classes can aoe farm
---
You could always put a cooldown on aoe looting, every mob after 3 adds a short additive delay before it loots
---
You never got xp from bgs until later xpacs.
---
This is correct
---
No, let us wear our achievements again.
---
5k would make me happy
---
Oh the stack!
---
Sometimes I would mail world drop blues I got, or like 15g, to random lower level players with a letter saying something like "thanks for running me through on your main, hope this squares us". Of course a lot of times you'd never hear or see it again, but you'd be surprised how often it was returned and I get a whisper upon login telling me I mixed them up with someone else. I'd usually tell em to hang onto it or see if they needed anything.
---
I am really glad you are enjoying the thread!  It's been a lot of fun reminiscing about the days of vanilla.  While I can only speculate, as I haven't worked there in over a decade, it's that from what I have seen Blizzard really cares about the release of Classic WoW and giving the players an experience they can feel good about.  You never know what other tricks they may have up their sleeve! ;)
---
Either way I hope that this was as much of a fun trip down memory lane for you as it was for me!
---
I will be spending a lot of time twinking in the 19 bracket. Might branch out later but I love how simple (yet still time consuming) it can be to set up a bis 19 twink.
---
Do you really think the AH was the issue. In my mind the biggest issue was that the loot system was crap. Random stats on all items made the chance of gearing past torment act 1 very tough, except for like DH's which farmed into later acts and some got rich...
---
&gt;Used them as a 60  
---
&gt;use while leveling  
---
These are not the same thing.
---
That's not going to happen, especially since the Classic community is so hostile to the concept of new content.
---
Even TBC servers are a pipe dream.
---
In summary, don't loan gold to 11 year olds
---
Yeah, I have a screen with discount on other server.
---
[https://imgur.com/EqJEj53](https://imgur.com/EqJEj53)
---
29s isn‚Äôt as bad as 19s when it comes to rogues and hunters, although they are still pretty op. A good healer and warlock can control mid in wsg pretty well
---
&gt; My simple way of "reserving loot" was always:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Invite people that don't need the loot.
---
This. If you are a warrior forming a group, then you dont invite another warrior. Simple as that.
---
I‚Äôll be using Discord
---
We'll be shelling out $45 a month for 3 subscriptions, but our kid is 9 and not 5. I know not all kids are the same, but I think this game is more manageable/enjoyable when you can read and have reading comprehension skills. 
---
We've been dabbing in pservers to help our 9 yr old figure out what he likes, and there are still so many aspects of the game that we need to do for him or walk him through (gear and talent management, for examples - He wants to look "good", we want him to have good stats). 
---
TO pay the $15 for  kid subscription, i think the kid should be old enough to at least understand what questing is and to be able to read a quest and at least comprehend what the task is asking. Otherwise I think it is a waste of money.
---
We have a 4 and 5 year old as well. When they ask to play, we tell them  "Learn to read. Noob." (that Noob part is very important)
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, why get a melee weapon that benefits only melee strikes, when you can get weapons that will support ranged better esp since you‚Äôre pretty much only going for wing clip in melee, then getting as much. Distance as possible. 
---
Wing clip, scatter shot then gtfo, staying  in melee range longer to get a raptor strike in not smart
---
All GMs worked at Blizzard Entertainment with computers they provided on their network.  The security is actually very tight, and the powers a GM had were definitely not meant to leave that building!  
---
The computers were very good and ran WoW very well and most work stations had a double monitors for us to maximize efficiency!
---
I need to get better at pvp
---
The Sharks are going to take it if Vegas isn't careful!
---
Yep
---
But the mount I just got it from the trainer 
---
I thought everyone else got it that way
---
Boy I was surprised
---
You don't have to. If you're orc, you're better off with an axe. Honestly you can use whatever high level weapon you want, but generally the lower the speed and higher the top-end damage, the better
---
Do we really know enough about 1.1 meta to know for sure hunter was the fastest leveling class?
---
It's capitalism. If you don't like it, don't participate in those groups. Or at least assume that the alternative is the player asking for a reserve wouldn't do the run -- assuming that the alternative is the person does the run with no reserve is silly.
---
Honestly, upgrade me. The game wasn‚Äôt badass for its shitty graphics. It was badass because it was an epic journey and solid gameplay.
---
Yeah the subs are shared, but there are going to be separate servers for each, and thus separate engagement in content. Having a shared subscription doesn't mean that one of the games can't be more popular than the other.
---
This is what i‚Äôm talking about
---
Saved up, sold gear instead of equipping it, did not learn every one of my abilities as I leveled up. Because back then it was not about trying to check off items on a list as quickly and efficiently as possible.
---
This applies to all classes, but consider if it‚Äôs worth it to go back to your trainer for skills. Personally I‚Äôm going to skip training at levels 18, 20 (I do poison quest later), 26, 42, 50, and 58 on my rogue.
---
They have said that they will start with a 16 debuff limit.
---
Sadly no, just my Veridian Netherdrake lol
---
2:25PM here.. in the middle of this cycle myself.
---
I copy and pasted. If you find a better tool (I'm sure one exists), please share!
---
Contrary to most of the comments here, you can go Arms if you want. MS is amazing for some boss fights with healing mechanics. And truthfully, any warrior spec you go, any talent build, you're gonna do more DPS than the majority of people. Play what you want man.
---
Oh I had it backwards. Gotcha.
---
Wildstar was so good. They had a couple design choices that killed the game early but the dungeons and raids were so fun.
---
The true justice would his guild being blacklisted. I'd certainly never run with them again. Good on you for screen shotting it; I certainly wouldn't have htought to do that. It's a lesson to always assume the worst in people.
---
I still get the chills when I hear the opening part of the in game music!
---
I gotta say, I really wish tier 0.5 came out with ZG or something so it could have more use. I didn‚Äôt even bother with it on retail and I suspect most people who raided didn‚Äôt. But I realize that goes against the real timeline of classic so it won‚Äôt happen.
---
Oh god, this brings back the feels of 2005-06 for me. Truly a wonderful time in WoW
---
It won't kill it. While some of us old school gamers will enjoy Classic, I'd be willing to bet that the majority of current retail players that try classic will go right back to retail after leveling to level 10-20.
---
Some people enjoy the modern action combat more than auto/attacking, wanding etc, drinking every other pull, etc.
---
I think I still owe my uncle 40g from my first mount, he actually works with me and I told him this the other day lol. He told me that I should have paid him back.
---
BNet voice seems to work great if I ever actually care to use it. I‚Äôll have to get discoed I guess!!
---
Not sure i fully understand what you‚Äôre saying.  Are you talking about hardware components, and them having a correlation with how likely you are to get an invite?
---
Just like all the long cooldown spells are never on CD, like PoM, Blind, LoH, Cold Blood, Prep, Adrenaline Rush, etc etc.
---
The more you post, the more obvious it is you don't know.
---
pservers?
---
Mage (can aoe farm trash and kill some bosses) + enchanting (de greens from dungeon trash and blues from bosses)
---
Vanguard was probably the best one but was still not great.
---
Much rather be in that rain than the rain in NC right now.
---
People have been accusing Blizzard of racism because of the goblins for years.
---
I'll try and make twinks for each bracket (except 59).  Prob a few 19s.  I love twinking but I'll be waiting til I have both my main tank and money maker (hunter or mage havent decided) to max level.
---
I'm having issues understanding why this is a problem.
---
If the tank wants to reserve something, that's his right.
---
You don't like what he's reserving? It's also your right to not join the group, if you find the reservation distasteful.
---
So, what's the problem?
---
If you can get 60 the first week, it doesn't matter what server you're on, you'll end up in that server's top guild.
---
You have to think of BC, WotLK as entirely separate product from Vanilla retail that is being worked on. They can be a separate service later if Blizzard wants to put the dev team on those projects and leave the vanilla service to mainly server operations and maintenance teams. But for vanilla wow, the new servers would be ideal to keep providing the official vanilla server experience for the intended audience. People still play new diablo 2 ladders and runescape.
---
Scarab Lord and one from that isle.  Shattered hand or something :)
---
True. I'm just not sure the numbers for that will ever be released to the players.
---
There are an awful lot of people on this sub who are talking about 12+ hours a day at launch and ~6 after that. I don‚Äôt have that much time, but many people do.
---
We should do a poll - How many hours a day will you play once the launch period is gone
---
Just make sure you use a really laggy WinAmp 3 skin that takes up about half your screen space.  Or REALplayer if you hate yourself.
---
Warrior with Engineering - Doesn't matter if everyone is playing them or not it matters *who* is playing them.
---
And then you get your weapon stolen by a rogue, your legs stolen by hunter and your shoulders stolen by a "enh shaman". Vanilla isn't as simple as warrior=plate, mate.
---
If its popular enough I can imagine them taking a different route after classic with WoW instead of BC. I wouldnt mind more lvl 60 content, like Karazahn.
---
Ventrilo
---
I'd stick with a mage. Higher skill cap in pvp if you cared to pvp. And they are better dps wise. Mainly because sl/ruin isn't viable with only 16 debuff slots in raids. If that got removed or they allowed for more, locks can be pretty damn fun. Threat is a huge issue though for locks.
---
So frost until then? What happens in farm runs, do they just spam unspecced frost spells?
---
Before I download a 500MB file which will take more than 1.5 hour given my low speed internet, would you care to elaborate a little about it ? \^\^
---
Oh yeah, I really doubt Blizz would put that out there, especially since they stopped providing subscriber numbers years ago.
---
Idk about first week, but definitely by week 2
---
Right, should have been Drowning Pool. Pfft.

---
generally speaking, classes that can heal, end up as healers in raids.. but you might be able to find / convince a raid leader to let you do enhancement shaman if that's what you want to play..  or feral druid.. but you can do it all as heart of the wild..
---
sounds like you really want a hybrid and leaning towards shaman.
---
that being said I'm sure you'll change your mind 20 more times before classic is launched.  unless you are really rushing to 60.. you can always just level 2 characters at the same time?
---
You can take away weapons?  Really?
---
Most gun crime exists in places with the strictest gun control (i.e. Chicago).
---
That sounds annoying and not that much fun. I dont know who would want to lvl to 60 and gear up over and over again, its tedious. PoE and D2 are totally different things compared to an MMO.
---
Nice! Wish it was in 1920x1080
---
Don't do this to him it's not fair ! 
---
We found one of the 2 troll rogues to have ever existed we should preserve its existence with great care. 
---
At the least contrariety he could roll an undead rogue named Angwe come classic ! Nobody wants that !
---
Funny thing is Tips didn't even play Vanilla so he really doesn't even know what he's talking about as far as an authentic experience.  
---
Truth is there's no way to achieve this simply because the game is coming out in a totally different era, people are just better gamers now.  The content isn't going to be as difficult no matter what build the game launches in.  Now there is certain gear that if released too early would trivialize things and that type of thing needs to be time gated, which is what Blizz is doing.
---
What I want is to experience vanilla wow in a polished, optimized state.  Waiting too long on the PvP system will be a disaster, so hopefully stage 1 doesn't last too long.  Just having HK tracking would be good enough for a while, the rewards could be implemented later.
---
It's definitly doable, i remember doing the exact same thing for a few levels way back actually! But when you look at dpm charts (damage per mana) you can see that even without Frostchanneling, Frostbolt is more mana efficient than scorchm and once Frostchanneling is specced, it's not even close.
---
Don't get me wrong, if one enjoys fire, go for it!. But it's by no means even close to frost in terms of efficiency while leveling. I wish it was, but the numbers say otherwise.
---
Fair enough. It's not set in stone but they are saying beta in a year, for single player, but at least it's progress.
---
IIRC everything will have the stats it did in 1.12 after updates. What they did say is items they added later will not be in until the appropriate time. Examples they used were spell pen pvp items and titanic leggings pattern things of that nature. Now they may of changed their mind but I don't think we are getting progressive itemization like we've seen on private servers.
---
I like to bash Retail, but I'll be honest here.
---
I look at Vanilla the same way I look at a product made for the first time by a new company and it ends up being literally a 10/10. Say, you go to the store, you see these new cookies or whatever that you've never seen before. You try them and they are absolute bliss.
---
So you keep having them but over time you start noticing small changes made to the original product. Sugar is replaced by glucose-sycrose or whatever that's called. White flour replaced by corn flower. Cream filling reduced by 20%. You notice those things and even though you still kinda enjoy  the product, you definitely prefer the way it was *originally*. Then even more time passes and the product is so drastically changed that you almost completely stop buying it since it tastes nothing like it originally did.
---
Then, for some amazing reason, the company decides to roll out the original cookie recipe. Sales boom once more. Customers are happy.
---
I believe this is what will happen with Classic. It's sort of a "getting back on the right track" and "sticking to your roots". Retail might be *okay* for some consumers, but it's nothing like  it originally was intended to be. 
---
What you should take away from this is that *change is not always a good thing*. A 40 year old classic car does not need a single thing changed on it in order for you to enjoy it for what it is. It may not be  *technically* as good as a modern car, but that's where "good" becomes subjective.
---
Maybe eventually when most guilds have everything on farm? Could help prolong interest once the majority of players have conquered everything.
---
We're hostile against changes before the game even launches, I can guarantee that will change for most once its been a couple of years and Naxx has been out for a while. If they adopt a policy like Jagex did with OSRS (they have in game poll booths where players vote on which content to add/change, if it doesn't reach 60% approval then they don't do it) I think that would be incredible, or they could just release legacy servers for each expansion and laugh to the bank.
---
To be clear... that guy was an asshat.
---
Im with you. I want the full nostalgia affect.
---
I'm still praying, maybe, oh maybe they will doing like OSRS !
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVuspKSjfgA
---
I've never experienced an RP event, but now my mouth is watering to partake in something like that. Blizzard, please let us have an RPPVP server!
---
I remember wanting D2 with every ounce of my being, but I would say Classic is right up there.
---
A lot of hardcore guilds are shooting for week 1 MC clear. That's insane. But yeah, first two weeks should get you a spot in any hardcore guild.
---
They haven‚Äôt actually said they are doing this for all items. Just the pvp ones. But going off that logic, they probs will have all items in 1.12 state.
---
I would guess from the bnet launcher.
---
Not sure if asked... SInce you were a WOW GM did you have Down time while working when not taking tickets? and if so what would you do? Could you even quest or interact with people (while not telling them your a GM) or PVP etc?
---
&gt; Soulsista 
---
I was in High Council at one point on thtry.
---
Seeing your comments on WPvP, is warrior and alternative considering that they're the weakest 1v1 class?
---
Doing it in-guild is kinda weird unless it is done like "hey socialboy we're running this to get xraiderX this one item and you're welcome to tag along but that one item is his".
---
But it really depends on the guild. If you're in a zerg-guild there's not much allegiance anyways.
---
I used to buy grey weapons as a lock, my first character on daggerspine, thinking that they were awesome upgrades. Literally spent my first gold and change on a lvl 18 staff grey. I told my friend about it and he laughed at me lol
---
How well does discord handle ~40 people in a voice channel at a time? I've never been in a discord voice channel with more than about 5.
---
I am definitely thinking about making a twink because each level group plays VERY differently that it feels like playing minigames within the larger game of WoW. I think I'll play in the 39 or 49 bracket because those levels are high enough to have a lot more depth than spamming one or two spells at low levels.
---
Vietthorn Vale!
---
Oh OK thanks.
---
I never really delved in itemization back in Vanilla, I was just rolling with what was dropping and was an upgrade but now that I'm looking at it a bit more closely, yeah it's a mess. 
---
The dungeon blues are mostly sub-par and the good ones were added very late in the game.
---
They can easily query for server populations on Classic vs. Retail.
---
If their server populations continually come back with larger numbers on Classic than Retail, that answers the questions for them.
---
19 hunter...it‚Äôs so faceroll
---
Being able to raptor strike someone in melee for 900 will be alot more useful then the small amount of stat difference you will get dual wielding. This is vanilla wow you don't have masters call / sac or disengage you will eventually get stuck in melee for a time with someone just due to the nature of the game. Not every fight is 1v1, consumables and dispels come into play etc.
---
Great writeup! Do you write professionally?
---
I find that John Oliver suffers from the same problem that most anti-gunners do: he doesn't know a thing about guns:  how they work, how criminals obtain them, what law abiding citizens do with them, or how futile any ban will be on preventing anything from actually happening.
---
Looks solid, although i personally always go for single point in imp. bizzard and permafrost. something like [this for early stages](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzbcuZVwGok0tb).  Ice shards and imp. CoC can each bleed a point, since the majority of your damage is firespells anyways.
---
It‚Äôll be released for shareholders if they are extremely good.
---
I came here to say just this. Wish it came out earlier. This seems so late. The sets are good but at the time they come out there are so many better options that are less expensive and less time consuming to get. Still though, I love these sets.
---
These are fun :) I like them a lot.
---
Have you thought about doing an alliance version too? And what is the orc called?
---
Blizz has been 100% clear. People have very bad reading comprehension. All items will be in their 1.12 forms. Items that were added throughout vanilla, however, will not be available until the phase that their patch was part of releases.
---
Making a 19 Priest the moment I ding 60
---
Nothing's been stated, but it's always been advertised as a "classic server option", shares a subscription, the blizzcon demo was in the server list, and the beta also seems to be in the server list from the limited launcher datamining we can do.
---
Earning the gold those mounts @ 40 and 60 back then, truly felt like an accomplishment.
---
It is a class I haven't played past like level 10 yet on a private server(allegedly). I just think they look cool with their gear and shit. But on a shaman I wreck all the warriors I come across that arent skull marked
---
Cool story!
---
That wouldn't really be reserving loot, though. More than 1 person can roll Need, and that is totally fair if both people need the item. Loot reservation is more along the lines of "I'm gonna roll Need, and you aren't allowed to even if you also need it".
---
This was my thinking exactly : you don't melee very often, but when you do it has to be meaningful so that they don't feel safe either ranged or melee. The dead-zone is a bitch though.
---
Can you share a memory of a special experience assisting a player with an issue, something that stuck out after all the years?
---
Also, how did hours work for GMs that we're online during the night-shift? Were there a lot of GMs at the Blizz offices late at night?
---
There are AoE pulls that take practically as long to loot as they do to kill, like DM dogs. Even a small gameplay impact needs to be carefully considered, unlike say auto loot vs shift auto loot that has none at all.
---
But that will happen every phase. Items were added in every phase so we will see them come with their phase. There is no one point where there will be a "revamp" and they release everything.
---
They look cool, sure, but will you care about that when everyone you meet in the world crushes you with little to no effort?
---
That requires gold and lots of it
---
Oh sorry, I was talking about low lv dungeons :)
---
Still got those Push To Talk sounds burned into my brain.
---
This is the detail I was looking for
---
im a big fan of the hunter theme. Your cool pets, able to grind gold farely well and on your own. Not having to rely on others for most of your accomplishments is always nice to me, but i fear dungeons and raids will just laugh at me . Should i disregard these thoughts or am i right?
---
Kings honor, friend.
---
Personally I think they should continue it on to tbc after, and then release new classic servers every couple years or so that start all over again ‚Äúfresh servers‚Äù.
---
Just the shear amount of information available now is going to complete change the experience for the better in my opinion.
---
I don‚Äôt know what masters call is... I only played pvp on a hunter thru all of vanilla. And no, stay in there and get that 900 melee pop off on a warrior, pally, whammy, or priest and they will laugh in your face  because you chose to do damage instead of gaining distance
---
Being a GM and playing WoW as a player happened totally separate.  While you are clocked in on the GM client you are always in help player mode so there isn't really much time for that.  It was also highly recommended to not be logged into your personal account any time you were clocked in.
---
When you were off the clock playing on your normal account on the normal game client was totally fine.  I ranked my personal account up to Rank 13, when I was Rank 12 I spent every lunch at my desk PvPing for an hour before going back to GM mode.
---
The two never mixed though, and because I had a large investment in both my job and my account I never wanted to risk jeopardizing either!
---
Has anyone ever done a 1-60 fully assisted? Like feeding gear, materials etc even porting, summoning etc? I would be interested in how fast you could get to 60 if you had a sponsor, just for the hell of it.
---
Pretty much. You can even use fire on *most* of the bosses, if you want. Granted they're resistant or immune (in which case you have to frostbolt), but it can be done üò∏.
---
It handels it just fine
---
I downloaded the gog version the other day. I haven't played 2 yet but Warcraft 1 works flawlessly. 
---
They also come with .pdf of the original manual, kind of neat to read through. For system requirements they recommended at least 8mb of RAM. If the game needs any more than that it can dip into my other 15,992mb üòÜ.
---
As stupid as it sounds, this almost chokes me up. In bad times, this was a happy place. It's like looking fondly on the house you grew up in, even though I was in my 20s. My house of comfort long gone, this bacame home. None of it is real, but the contentment is.
---
Not really though.
---
that fishing hat and green goggles giving me flashbacks to running a twink guild. WoW blunder years.
---
As cool as it sounds, I doubt they will go the OSRS route. I think theyll go for the easiest and most obvious route, do legacy servers for the big 3.
---
yes and no... I feel like if you put in the time to level a priest to 60.. get gear.. and enter mc and do all the fights and heal.. then put in the work to get the eye and do the quest..  chances of you just quitting are probably low..
---
I get that it's a possibility but I don't know how feasible for the average player it will be to dupe an entire guild for however long to just ninja from them..
---
Cool, good to know. It's my preferred method of voice chat nowadays.
---
It'll definitely be discord.
---
Right. That's why it also didn't work in Australia because they also did not understand how criminals get their guns or how regular citizens do with them.
---
I understand if you want guns because you like guns. I think guns are pretty cool, too. I just don't think it's a good idea to make them easily available to everyone.
---
Once I get some money that's the first thing on my list.
---
My buddy and I were in a level 19 twink guild for a good while. Before there were time limits on WSG, twink guild vs twink guild was some of the longest battlegrounds I've ever played. 
---
Before that, I played my 29 Rogue in AB all the time and I'd argue they were the most powerful class in that level bracket if not neck and neck with Warriors.
---
&gt;accidentally opened a trade with him trying to inspect him
---
stuff of nightmares
---
I will play 16 at launch and prob8 to 10 after, as i do rn on a pserver lol
---
No. But even then, I'd still expect a ranged pet class with feign death and all sorts of high dps, high safety tools, would still be the fastest. 
---
I could be wrong, but I doubt the world first person had EVERYTHING right, you know? They still leveled in 10 days, and a hunter could probably do that faster, even at 1.0.
---
But again... 10 days at vanilla launch? thats impressive as fuck.
---
Degree of investment means nothing. It is having a negative impact on classic. It will also impact the eco
---
Sounds like someone in your own faction was trolling you. Perhaps a Troll?
---
It did. It was a more advanced version of the meeting stone system in vanilla. 
---
Rather than just right clicking and randomly being grouped 2 hours later(when you forgot you even clicked the meeting stone), it was a tab that listed groups and what they needed. Both the party could list itself as LFM and a player can list themselves as LFG for specific instances and the difficulty level (normal or heroic).
---
On my server, it wasn't really utilized all that much. However, it definitely did cut down LFG/LFM chatter. So one could argue that it began to normalize the dungeon finder we recognize as being one of the nails in the coffin of retail wow.
---
Hi snox, did you make this map yourself? I have been looking ALL OVER for a classic map that labels all the zones' names (because I've forgotten the especially the higher level zones because I only leveled one character to 60 pre-bc). Thank you so much if you did make this map, I will be looking at this as a reference countless times as I make my plans for the launch.
---
I got the Tabard from winning a raid in the old TCG.  I wonder if I still have the card somewhere.
---
You mentioned that you main a pally. A couple questions:
---
1. How much slower do you find pally leveling VS hunter?
---
2. Any advice for pally leveling specifically? What specs do you use throughout leveling? Do you find yourself doing less grinding?
---
I try to play on private servers and I agree, it isn't the same. Retail is also far from the same, but I still love the game deep down. I think vanilla is going to do far more than most think.
---
Because I like minding my own fucking business, I will be going PVE this time around.
---
Good point, but I feel you inevitably start picking up QoL improvements that deteriorated the game as you continue to move through expansions. Your sub base will eventually dwindle as is has been for the past few expansions.
---
It‚Äôs an interesting dilemma that Blizzard has gotten itself into and I feel they already have a plan. You want players to keep buying expansion packs and further content. If we hit 10 million subbing to Classic alone, $15 a month is great, but you‚Äôre missing out on $60 every couple of years.
---
I‚Äôm just looking at this from a business perspective.
---
I am scared of that more than the phase 2 on PvP realms...
---
I never understood people who bitched hard about loot being reserved.
---
Either don't join those groups or make your own group with nothing reserved.
---
But noooo, it would be just the best if someone else would make the group for you then invite you so you can get your item, wouldn't it?
---
Yeah, you need to be a good test candidate.
---
Demon days by gorrilaz came out in 2005 and I'll def be jamming that
---
Oh man. 
---
On my first toon, an Undead Priest, mid 30s screwing around in I believe Arathi. I group up with another dude who‚Äôs on the same quests as me and we‚Äôre doing good but he keeps talking about why I‚Äôm not using my wand. 
---
It was that day I was informed that wands are pretty much essential for priests, and he (and his guild) got quite the laugh after learning I had made it ~35 levels and never has used one. 
---
Leveling got much, much better after that.
---
&gt;Its sorta scummy
---
It really isn't.  If something that sells for gold drops, everyone should roll.  Then whoever wins just wins the sale value in gold, either from selling it or from saving the gold by not having to buy it.
---
Obviously if it's bop that's totally different, but a boe item worth 100g dropping is the same as 100g dropping.
---
I would say if you participated well in previous betas it would help.
---
Sometimes they invite looking for certain PC specs, sometimes long term subscribers, sometimes previous beta invitees who participated well, mostly its 100% luck of the draw. (very random)
---
The last 3 xpacs i've landed in beta without even being currently subscribed to live at those times. I did participate well in those beta's though.
---
I'm 29, i'll be married soon, I work a 9-5, I plan on staying in curve for content. Be MC geared when BWL releases, be BWL geared when AQ releases, be AQ geared when Naxx releases. I dont plan on being server firsts or anything like that, but I do plan to stay in line with the content.
---
https://youtu.be/xdgMuSCHbd8
---
I got selected for the Necromancer beta for d3 so that‚Äôs probably a good sign.
---
Before Cata prepatch revamps, I only played Feral Druid (mostly tank) and occasional boomie for "mage tanking", resto sham, frost mage, and affliction lock. I'd try other classes and just think, "Man, I just must not get it." After that patch I played everything besides warrior and fire mage to some degree, and had all at max in Legion to get all the mage tower skins.
---
During the Classic Demo, I tried everything, and found pali to be meh, as was lock. Hunter, Shaman, and mage were amazing fun! I'm going to guess rogue is gonna take a seat yet again haha.
---
It's hunter freedom and you don't have to stay in melee for long at all we're not talking about sitting there meleeing them forever just one raptor strike. There are going to be times as well that you can't gain distance because you're crippling poisoned and scatter is on cool down. You can't just wingclip and walk away because you're snared at a slower %.  
---
Not every fight is 1v1 or starts with you aim shotting from 40 yards.
---
Everyone always memed wow or blizzard would kill wow... we just didn't know that it meant re-releasing vanilla lol
---
Berry nice
---
A LOT of people bought gold from Asian farmers back in classic.  Almost everyone I knew had done it at some point because it was super cheap and easy.  I wonder if that will still be a thing this time around.
---
Yeah, I understand that. I hope everything goes half as well as we hope it does.
---
I participated in the Necromancer beta for d3 so that‚Äôs good to know. Maybe I‚Äôll get a chance with this too :)
---
Dawe
---
Yeah, it was your mom!!!!
---
Will dungeon farming instances like DM and Mara be as efficient as private servers? I‚Äôve heard people say that /camp is just a private server thing.
---
so resize it.
---
Confirmation bias.
---
Apparently the belt I chose will not be available before phase 5, so the replacement would be :  Bloodmail Belt [http://classicdb.ch/?item=14614](http://classicdb.ch/?item=14614)

So I loose 30HP, 6 RAP, but I gain 45 mana, 3 armor and 9 melee AP : not very significant.
---
While I was looking for another belt I found  Crown of Tyranny for the head [http://classicdb.ch/?item=13359](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13359) 
---
150 less mana than T0 head but 1% CRIT
---
Same here bud....

\#3 is every Gold Selling website's favourite image
---
Bold strategy cotton let's see if it plays out for them.
---
I had a really memorable interaction with a player once who was having an issue with a quest, but it ended up being a multi issue ticket once I started unpacking all the problems.  Once we got to the bottom of the first 2 issues we realized trying to solve the original one, we got to the bottom of it that their quest item was in the bank, a real common problem.
---
GMs weren't supposed to tell the players how to play the game, at best we could give you a hint that may influence your thinking... They weren't picking up that hint.  Eventually I told them 'Sometimes there are item in your inventory that aren't on your character' in just the right way and it clicked and they were really appreciative.
---
What stood out about it was that it was a real long ticket, and because of that I spent a lot of time and was very invested in them fixing the issue.  They started out really frustrated and by the time we had it all fixed up they were a happy player, those are the kinda GM interactions I enjoyed the most.
---
There were so many GMs working there at all hours of the day!  They had a sliding scale of sorts so basically most hours of the day a shift started.  for me personally I started out over night (10pm-7am)  eventually transferred to mornings (6am-3pm) so I could lead a raid guild and later on I switched to evenings (3pm-midnight) so I could go to school in the morning.  It was actually really helpful there was always a shift for me to work that met the changing needs I had in my life.
---
Which, in all fairness, is probably what they should do. As long as classic is popular enough in blizzards eyes, ofc.
---
plus tailoring to sell bags, along with doing ports and summoning food/water for donations while putting together groups for dungeons. 
---
Mage with Enchanting+Tailoring is a gold making machine.
---
I wouldn't say it means nothing.. sure someone might do it but I don't think it would be rampant..  I plan to play both games so if I get benediction on my priest it'll be to use it for my raiding and priest life there..
---
maybe lower investment items.. but I don't think someone is going to grind to rank 14 just so they can transmog it on live...
---
If I was a betting man I'd 100% put my money on this day. I've got a good feeling about it.
---
Happy birthday for when it comes!

SWTOR was fucking amazing, it's biggest problem was how much XP you got so fast, allowed everyone to easily reach max level and their end game just wasnt where it needed to be.               
---
            
---
If the slashed the XP gains by half and worked faster on end game and expansions I would still be playing that game, I'd take Frog Dogs vs Rotworms over every single post TBC BG any god damn day of the week.
---
You see druids and shamans as melee classes? I would advise you to not pick them in that case because you would be disappointed. They are hybrid healers. Premades will want you in a hybrid healing spec and so will raids. Hunters are ranged but they deal physical damage. Easiest class to level and they are in the middle when it comes to popularity. They are excellent in world pvp where they can get the jump on people, abit weaker in duels.
---
&gt; That's not going to happen
---
&gt;Even TBC servers are a pipe dream.
---
You have literally no authority or any reason to say that. Quit acting like you know shit. Maybe you think that, but it doesn't make it true, bucko.
---
I would do something similar. With my rogue I'd wait on the chain going across in BRM. When some 40man would run across it, I'd use Distraction on the very edge of the chain and send most of that 40man plummeting down into the lava below.
---
I played a human mage and orc hunter in vanilla, I won't be taking anyones names but try to remake my own :D
---
Hi, /u/noobstan
---
And this is how I learned to hate Paladins... because all you can do is run away from them back to town because they don't die and they can't kill you.
---
Say what you will but that‚Äôs an excellent hunter weapon
---
Only problem I have is paying full subscription fee for a 20 year old game. And not paying full price to play retail only to then get classic. Give me a discount option for just classic.
---
H
---
Speed leveling is not the same thing as being ahead of the curve. 
---
On ND launch I took 6 days to 60, I was taking it slow but because I went hard on day one, I was practically alone in every zone from 15-60. And that's on a 12k pop server with all the tryhard players, classic launch you can probably be on a 8day phase and as long as you have a good early game and go hard on day one you will be alone to quest freely.
---
Read well what I said. Noone called for "staying melee range longer", just pull an already-ready melee hit (buffed w/ RS and talents), which requires no GCD (using it for ur WC, counterattack if possible and talented). It requires timing (for FD-trapping to not break it), though, but it is a good amount of free unexpected instant damage with no risk that ends up adding. Staying more than this is certainly dangerous. 
---
You still should have a couple weapon sets if you intend to PvP properly. You don't lose much if you get a proper 2H weapon. And notice I'm not saying to *only use it*. If you can be free shooting (let's say AV backline in a zerg, for a common example) you should still use your DW setup. Swap when needed. 
---
Just having only a PvE DW set won't cut it. There'll be people getting to you, disarming you and then you're dead since WC is out. A 2H with a chain helps greatly here since those who want to be melee range are the ones capables of disarming and you can even get some damage for free (while having the ability of getting the distance you need). Think of PvP tryhard rogues keeping poisoned daggers for swaps on the run. 
---
Even then it's a matter of playstyle.
---
What makes you think new character models won't be a toggeable option?
---
No matter how often I see a vanilla map posted, I have to look at it in detail :) That said, nice map dude.
---
Most OP twink I've ever had. I remember spending over 10-15 min per duel with decked out rogues and always outlasting them / winning in the end haha. You're almost invincible.
---
I watched for the screen shots... eye rolled for him nearly breaking down and crying on stream.
---
I'm positive that's him taking the shots.. but someone probably set it up for him.
---
But can classic do it in a cold rainy night in stoke?

---
I was really young and shy so I never got around to the raids or dungeons, my time was spent leveling alts over and over, questing, exploring, and enjoying the world.
---
My best memory in vanilla (and all of WoW) was when my uncle invited my dad and I to a group, telling us he had something to show us, which his guild showed him the day before. He took us all the way to Loch Modan and spent 10min trying to coach us through a specific jumping route in these hills, wouldn't tell us why. We finally made it up into the mountains and followed him through lots of unfinished/barebones mountain terrain, across the empty Ironforge airfield (which I thought was AWESOME; I'd only ever seen it on the map!), and then up into the Wetlands. 
---
We dropped down onto this ledge area that looked over the zone, and it had a farm and buildings. I was stoked. But then it got better: he showed us this big old arch in the mountain, in the middle of the village, and took us through until we came to a massive drop. I tried angling my camera down and could only see gray/blue, no floor or walls, it was endless. My uncle jumped down and it felt like it took his character ages to die. My dad and I followed and it was so cool falling down this near-endless hole in the world.
---
This adventure took us the whole evening and it was the most fun I'd ever had with the two of them in game. I'd go back to that secret village sometimes when I was bored and jump down the hole. It was the first thing I checked for after Cataclysm released, and I was sad to see it had been closed up.
---
Second best memory would be watching my dad and his guild run MC. Seeing Ragnaros for the first time was absolutely unreal.
---
You're probably right when you consider the immense populations on private servers, and how far retail subs are rumored to have fallen post BFA launch.
---
But killing the enemy faction is half the fun of wow lol

I saw this two hours ago and I'm still giggling at the bottom left
---
I've heard some addon devs and content creators (in good graces) have access to an alpha version under nda to never talk about it. That kind of backs that up a bit.
---
I think this one is my favorite.
---
Horde side warlocks struggle, however if you are going ally warlocks become very strong starting at zg release. I've raided from mc through naxx on both.
---
Go orc or undead. Both are good, orc is slightly better for solo pvp and undead for BGs. Get engineering.
---
i think 5 is not an appropriate age for wow. (my daughter is 4)
---
I mean that makes the most sense business wise. You keep retail updated and make new content for classic so when one hits a lull you have the other that just released new content.
---
For those adventurers interested in testing Chromie‚Äôs portal to our past world:
---
1) go to battle.net

4) select account settings
---
5) on the left-margin menu go to Games &amp; Subscriptions

6) scroll down to Beta Access and click it
---
7) check the box for WoW Beta notifications
---
8) Update Preferences.
---
9) get back on reddit and upvote for visibility
---
Orc rogue is good but everyone know that if you want to be serious about pvp. UD rogue is the way to go to defeat fully geared warlocks
---
&gt; they're the weakest 1v1 class 
---
Dude don't say that, every time I touch the subject the warrior brigade charge full force.
---
I don't know yet if they're delusional or if the new PVP meta (engineering + mass buffs &amp; potions) has changed anything.
---
It will be huge at launch, the big question is whether or not it sustains. Obviously it will sustain everyone on this sub, but what about the casual players that have never played it before? Hard to tell.
---
That's awesome, classic is so deep, there are limitless reasons to get excited and we all craft our amazing experiences together.  
---
PM me if you want to join our guild btw, we're always looking for players like you.

If somebody is reserving loot in low lvl dungeons, they have problems and everybody should avoid them lol.

I will definitely be twinking in 19. Have done bis lock and rogue so far, but we will have to wait until phase 3 anyway for wsg ):
---
I completely agree with this, and I love the analogy.
---
I think it‚Äôs tough to say classic will be bigger at this point. I do think it will be a lot bigger than all the retail players think though.
---
I always get a chuckle when I see them talk about people quitting by level 30 and it will flame out within a year. Clearly they have never played on a private server.
---
I agree.
---
I never got to fully clear Naxx and AQ, looking forward to that.
---
Hmm, seems Im one of the few who only uses voicechat when raiding. I just like the ambiente when questing and dungeons better I guess.
---
So interesting dude thanks alot for sharing your stuff!! Loved to read it all.
---
Nah not even close. Anyone under 21 wont be able to handle classics slow paced progress. It will take time to get anything done. New generations are accustomed to instant satisfaction. Classic probably wont even hit 1 mil
---
This is where those graphics that tell you what skills get trained at what level come in handy. You can quickly see how worth it it will be to travel back to train.
---
Why do you think that. Orc warrior is good but UD rogue allows you to beat fully geared warlocks
---
On the server I played on, spawning Cleaner deliberately (which includes any action that puts you on the quest mob's threat list) is against the rules, because it despawns the quest mob and wastes everyone's time, including any other hunters waiting. You're allowed to PvP the hunter, just not grief the mob.
---
There's a whole lot more faces, hair, and skin tone options at creation now though, right? Can you toggle what's not there?
---
Whoa whoa whoa....that's a pole arm. That means it's a hunter weapon. Hand it over.
---
Will be making a 49 warrior twink
---
I have a similar story. Someone in my guild loaned me the gold to get my mount at 40 but I didn't pay him back. He would keep asking and eventually I just went dark and disabled my account for a while. Never got banned or anything though when I resubbed and came back some time later
---
If you want to be a melee DPS the only **realistic** choices are either warrior or rogue.
---
I think you will find more warriors than rogues this time around.
---
Rogues have a better toolkit to face wpvp and have cool gear sets, I'd say as cool as warriors (and I say that as I mained a warrior in Vanilla and will probably play a hunter in classic, so I have no stake in this fight).
---
Best Moments were all boss kills;
---
1) C‚Äôthun
---
2) Nefarian
---
3) Ragnaros
---
Followed by getting my first epic mount and dinging 60.
---
Thank you!  I am really glad some of the fellow redditors in this sub convinced me to post it!  It's been a lot of fun reminiscing about vanilla WoW in anticipation for Classic!  Can't wait!!
---
For raiding if you want to be taken seriously then tailoring is a must until late aq. Robe of the arcmage is strong, and bloodvine is broken good. Engi for arcanite dragonling for fire, and sappers make your already super strong aoe god tier
---
You didn't get the 4000gold back though right :) ?
---
I added a version without dots and one at wallpaper size. And I included the GIMP file if you want to edit it.
---
https://archive.org/download/WoWClassicMap
---
Even if you want to respec your druid at 60 to fill a different roll, farming 50g is a lot easier than grinding another toon to 60.
---
Well while most spells are fire, bleeding imp CoC and Ice Shards reduces that huge CoC burst. And if I were to reassign those two i'd rather move both into Permafrost than 1/3 imp Blizz. 
---
Also I don't know if losing 2/2 in arctic reach is very efficient. You'll end up with a small CoC (pun intended), reduced yd on fb and Frost Nova. 
---
Of all specs out there, this one is the one that feels like the wrong choice every single time due to trading really good stuff for other really good stuff. :(
---
I suppose AoE grinding is fun if you like being bored as hell.
---
Was finishing up Silverpine when I saw a mage frost-grinding mobs along the Greymane wall. That poor bastard.
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy mindless killing as much as the next guys as it can be therapeutic. But give me a melee class or something. That mage rotation with the running around just looks tedious.
---
Will you come back playing WoW Classic once it's out?
---
Greetings from Italy!
---
In world pvp playing a rogue means that you always have the upper hand. If you see a hunter or a mage, wait until they are in combat with a  mob or on low hp. Also human is the best pve rogue and UD is the best rogue for lategame pvp
---
I could see Blizz doing a bit of both and end up going with new content in Classic, and also continuing on to set up servers for the Big 3.
---
I whish I could tame a druid too :o
---
It's been a long time since I've actually laughed out loud. Keep these coming!
---
Well, the founding fathers did.
---
Lotta saving for that mount. Back before many farming guides, let alone YouTube or social media.
---
This! I need to know!
---
Just keep running til you string on an ally to help you! Or, you find three other hordes to pile on the damage...
---
I'm thinking about picking this up as well
---
I don't think it's changed anything, but ofc you can become insane as a warrior. Doesn't change the fact that you're handicapped and need to heavily outgear or outskill your opponent to beat them. Look at Monkeynews for example, he does great solo.
---
If you don't plan on leveling enchanting on your main then don't bother, buy the wand instead.
---
I wish they'd make 2 wows one for retail players and then a separate less pay to win or handholding wow.
---
There was still a massive portion of the population that had to play at 15-30 fps, with fps lag spikes and bad internet.
---
no changes. classic is being released for true fans of the old game, not some content patch for bfa.
---
What makes horde side locks struggle more than ally locks?
---
This is so wholesome, I love it.
---
BNE stands for Battle.net Edition, the only version of Warcraft II that is actually NOT compatible with DOS and therefore can't run in Dosbox. Looking at your campaign list, you probably meant BtDP (Beyond the Dark Portal, the title of the expansion).
---
They actually already said that they won't do this.
---
First character to 40 was a Dwarf Paladin, got it from the class trainer in IronForge, but I was super excited, and spent the next few hours running around inside IF seeing how many times I could jump over the pit between the inside and outside rings of the city.
---
Sap people in neutral towns so that they attack you and the guards kill them.  This makes them take gear damage.
---
wrong. deathknights and everything they did started the downfall it wasn;t cata
---
I stitched it together and added the graphics for the world bosses by cropping wowhead model viewer. I used an old Brady Games guide as a reference for accuracy
---
What are those summoning stone looking things across the map?
---
True, a big surprise for EQ players that there is xp minus for grouping and you are supposed to solo stuff. I didn't play it at the time but I got the image that only a few kiting classes ever soloed anything past the starting area.
---
the new skyboxes dont look like wow anymore and take the feel away. same with the new models.
---
no changes, play bfa if you want this stuff
---
High threat and no blessing of salvation.
---
I spent about a week running laps in Stonetalon gathering Kingsblood, Briarthorn, Swiftthistle, and Steelbloom to sell on the auction house. When the price spiked on Stranglekelp, I‚Äôd move to the Barrens coastline. Oily Blackmouth and Firefin Snapper were pretty decent, too, especially when refined into oils.
---
Well if you really like the pet then warlock. But as far as play style pallys are closer  because they are melee with a couple ranged attacks. Locks are only spellcasters. Also you can tank on a pally, like the dk.
---
I'm the kind of guy that will pay money for quality. And to me, Classic is much higher quality content than what I have played in the modern expansions.
---
As a side note, you paid $15/month for retail Vanilla back in 2005. And despite inflation between then and now, you will still only pay $15/month for the game this summer. That $15 back in 2005 is worth around $19.29 in 2018 dollars (based on CPI tables). So maybe you can take solace in the thought that you will be paying $15/month for something that is really worth $19.29/month. There's your 22.2% discount.
---
I'm not sure if the camp command was there in vanilla, but why wouldn't it work just as well if you logged out manually?  If anything, DM in particular was nerfed on pservers via drop table and mechanics changes and the reverted changes will make them stronger, same with BRD.
---
Okay that‚Äôs cool but WOTLK was still fun to play.
---
29 hunter to farm hks in hillsbrad
---
So easy : Humage and Arrowrc :p
---
I've showed these to my wife, holy hell these are so damn good, please please please keep making more!
---
Wonder how much Joana will take for classic.  
---
  I doubt he won't try for it.
---
If you want to do damage, warlock is probably the closest followed by warrior.  
---
If you don't mind healing, then Paladin is what you're looking for.   
---
Thematically, warlock is the closest.   
---
If you want to tank, I'd pick warrior over anything else.
---
Of course you have to, but for the Horde of course!
---
I noticed that after noticing I only had the expansions and not BNE. I downloaded BNE and couldnt get it to run. Guess I'll need windoows 95?
---
Mine was watching my friend play a night elf in darkshore. The flight paths were my favorite part of the game. Seeing him fly over huge zones with bird taxis. It was the coolest concept ever for me.
---
I wasn't able to buy the game until late tbc though mostly because I was a little kid and addicted to Diablo 2 and warcraft 3 at that time.
---
I honestly rejoiced playing with DKs as warrior in MoP. TSG was so good in random battlegrounds. "Bursting" by stacking necros which absorb healing, so a warrior can nuke through the health with bladestorm + bloodbath was just sooo good.
---
Warlocks are quite tanky with gear, so they often mind themselves in melee range in PvP however not meleeing obviously.
---
Warrior is hulksmash. 
---
You will have to ask yourself what you find most enjoyable: melee, DoTs and/or pets.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Any tips for group wpvp? I understand you would want to target healers but if it's a group wpvp and the enemies are just damage dealers.
---
Is their any benefit of leveling tailoring as you level?
---
What a legend
---
If it took "so long" it's probably because the server was unstable.
---
If he played hardcore he should be 60 in about 7-8 days IRL.

(yeah I know 10 days is fast, but for a hardcore player, it's like he was slacking :D ).

1. Go jawless UD rogue with mohawk hairstyle. You can't WPvP otherwise. 
---
2. Kill people when they are fighting mobs and are on low HP, you don't want them to fight back, do you?

3. Spec CB/Prep (you literally kill almost anyone with these CD's up) and just AFK jerk off in stealth when they are down.

4. Congratulations! You have become a real badass wpvper!

Wut?
---
Classic is not related to bfa at all. Not sure how it comes into this.
---
Also, Classic is already being released differently then it was before. So anyone who is a true classic die hard will know the massive difference.
---
So, if there was a change to be made that makes no actual game play change or affect the classic flow at all. You are 100% against it?
---
Guild bank for example.
---
did you tell tyrone and jamal aswell? will you be playing at your cuckshed? im glad my wife let me install some windows at mine
---
Another good reason to not get married, I would never accept someone dictating me how much I can play and asking permission. No pussy is worth that much.

I don't remember anything like this at all in burning crusade. Strange.

And he didnt charge you anything in return? What a nice guy.

Frost through BWL, fire when AQ40 starts (or a bit earlier in ZG if you're feeling spicy).  In MC as a mage on AQ patch you either respec, do shit damage, or wear 8/8 t2 and spam arcane missiles into instant frostbolt when you get a proc and do shit damage +\~30%.  As a fire mage in BWL, you should be outgearing the content by this point so it's kind of a fun change of pace.  Razorgore, Broodlord, Nef P1, and Chromaggus are all fully fire viable, and you'll do lots of damage to trash, but you'll be carried on the other fights.
---
Hey thanks for the reply! I had all of the ZG mounts during vanilla and some other goodies. I was so scared just to be complimented lol
---
Seriously, builds in PoE literally have infinite possibilities, I can never run out of ideas in that game.
---
I should say this... I don't have the same amount of free time like I did in 2005. So I cannot justify a $15 month subscription for something I would get less play time than I want to give
---
Why do you make all of these presumptions simply based on age? People have been whining about "the youth" since, literally, Socrates. It's never been true.
---
You act like everyone under 21 likes Apex and PUBG. They don't. Just like not everyone OVER 21 likes Apex and PUBG. 
---
I think that challenging MMOs are a niche community regardless, but that's not because of age. It because most people, from 7 to 70, like instant gratification. Retail WoW is what it is because it's what MOST PEOPLE, of all ages, want it to be.
---
Much better than WC3
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôve done all of this, but I recall seeing ‚ÄúWarcraft‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwow.‚Äù  Maybe that‚Äôs what you were implying, though.  I‚Äôll double check tonight when I get home, thanks!

This is excellent and the best I've seen so far. I especially appreciate the ship and zeppelin paths.

As the older brother, yes God bless you kind female human stranger my druid and my swift frost saber to this day thank you.

10% though? I feel like that's just too tempting.
---
Why should a L58-59 doing a BRD run get to roll on every green, blue, as well as HoJ and Ironfoe, whilst the geared L60 gets to only roll on Ironfoe?
---
They shouldn't, that's why the L60 gets to reserve Ironfoe.
---
Used to play tauren shaman for years,  
---
Absolutely hated the casting animations and the bugged hitbox was just awful for anything other than warrior or enhancement shaman. So tauren hunter/shaman/druid gets my vote.   
---
Undead warrior was also pretty meh, WotF was decent for tanking as you can't really use your other fear breaks.
---
Yikes wtf is this "Anyone under 21" bullshit dude. Im 20 and i've been playing vanilla on private servers and i loved it. Fuck off.
---

When the amendment was introduced they were concerned with the british and becoming a free country. They were not at all concerned about criminals. Or maybe they were, but fighting the brits/ any tyrannical government was more important.
---
haha triggered little snowflake!
---
the two handed "meh" strike always made me cringe.
---
Honestly, your kid will probably be perfectly happy just watching you play. WoW is big and impressive and intimidating to a youngin‚Äô.
---
You know you're old when the game you want to play has everyone talking about their wives.
---
Wish I had a buddy that will play. Everyone is married with children
---
No offense, what is up with your keybinds? Multiple spells on a single key?
---
Loved the vid. Looking forward to that pros and cons video in playing Druid.
---
Hmm? Major whoosh here but I'm assuming this is an insult. 
---
If I'm going to doing something for 40-60hrs one week and 15 hrs+ a week for a while after that I personally want the support of my wife. 
---
I know she would feel the same way about something she was doing.
---
We live as a family unit and have children. Making compromises is important to having a healthy family.
---
It's all a ruse, they  have vanish, health pots, sprint, and very sticky glue to fuck your day up.
---
He‚Äôs in swimming and soccer.
---
You are right.
---
I had the talk too.. my husband knows I game a lot and he really doesn't... we've been together for 2 xpac launches so far and I basically no life those for about a week...
---
unfortunately I got married this year, and honeymoon.. so my pto is limited.. so depending on when it launches I may have to partial life this :(
---
Why the difference with Faction? I am planning on going Ally this time around.
---
It isn't a quirk, the mechanics behind ignite just aren't immediately obvious or trivial.  It's well understood at this point though, and it's unlikely that ignite at its core will be changed in classic.  I've actually heard some talk that the ignite dot will 'double dip' with scorch on classic but isn't currently on pservers, which means the numbers will be even nuttier when done right.
---
I hope my girlfriend says the same thing to me lol I've been so hyped to play classic!
---
I understand but, some people like me aren't even logging in on the other game
---
I hated this as well on my time in private servers, but if I was patient enough I'd eventually find the group I wanted without any reserves. And considering that was private servers, which is a concentration of more knowledgeable players, I'm hoping this trend won't be popular on classic.
---
&gt;  And "as long as your amount of gaming in a normal week doesnt dramatically increase it will be fine."
---
What are you, 7?
---
[Shockingly Relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSlLXJkqMrc&amp;t=0m50s).
---
not an insult
---
&gt; I personally want the support of my wife
---
what im trying to say is that you need the support of her boyfriend aswell
---
That stoneform though, god mode vs other rogues.
---
Be a wizard IRL AND in game!
---
Mage, priest, rogue just don't click for me.
---
Nah dudebroman you gotta neglect all personal responsibilities or else you are a "cuck", 4chan told me so.
---
I mean what's low level? There are items in lvl 40ish dungeons that are almost prebis for some classes but meh for others
---
Undead warlock
---
Ahhhh, the updated undead model whose mohawk isn't fucking crooked.
---
&gt; Not inviting the class to the group could mean not inviting over half the classes in the game.
---
It's still very doable in 5-mans and it happens quite a lot. Such as a Rogue forming a group and choosing a warlock and mage as the other two DPS instead of choosing a hunter and warrior.
---
I just told her, hey when wow comes out... and shrinked my shoulders. she understood
---
Really weird comments dude but sounds good!
---
Found the Jamal
---
Thanks, I'll try!
---
Thanks for the compliment man! :)
---
Haha, thanks a lot! :D
---
Yes, it's made primarily for Windows 95/98. The alternative is to get the GOG version: it's the BNE with a wrapper to make it work properly on modern systems.
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
This is all keyframed in Maya 3D :)
---
Not vanilla wow cause I started in WotLK.. I was Paladin and in wotlk we got our 60% mounts at 20, then 100% epic at 40. I remember I was questing in Redridge and was itching to hit that level 20 mark. Even had to grind gold by killing basic mobs since I was such a scrub, didn‚Äôt have any better means. Afterwards I just ran around stormwind jumping over all possible obstacles to show off my new mount (not that anyone cared at the time haha it was close to the end of wotlk). 
---
I was young so I thought I could have a mount as soon as I started, it was a shock to me when I found out otherwise but I was motivated af to get that damn horse. At first I really wanted the night elf tiger.. I never got it. It will be my main goal (along with finally hit max level) once Classic comes out.
---
Thank you for the compliments! :) I'm glad you like the videos, so you're very welcome!
---
If you rely on wotf to beat warlocks you're not a good rogue. A rogue regardless of race should never lose to a warlock if you get opener on him, you can stunlock him to death (unless it's an orc) every time since they can't trinket your stuns. Cooldblood eviscerate has static dmg and it doent matter if the warlock is geared or not, it's a 1.9k crit everytime.
---
Haha! Thanks so much for the nice comment man! :)
---
Thank you! :)
---
That's 1800 hours of eventually lol
---
My guild on live used that until about a year ago....
---
We have a cranky old paladin that refuses to get discord, or any voice chat other than Vent.  Thankfully now we can just use the in game one, which is at least better than loading up vent.
---
I have considered making some Alliance ones, but I haven't moved beyond the thinking-about-it-stage, yet :) 
---
He's called Gorak!  :)
---
Just out of curiosity what would have happened if she said you 'weren't allowed' to play?
---
Ah! :D Thanks for the compliment, I'll try!
---
Zug-zug!
---
reverse
---
I shouldn't be pigeon-holed into looking a certain way just because items are BiS. I know people on here despise transmogs, but it's possible to balance the freedom of transmogs with the merits of beating endgame content. Transmogs in retail suck because they are are account-bound, so people buy cash-shop armors and equip them on all their toons. Get rid of the cash-shop and account-bound transmogs, and you've got a respectable character creator that allows the RPG elements of this game to shine. The freedom of players to design their toons however they want fleshes out the world. You can keep the godlike tier-3 armor locked behind raid bosses, but let me be able to wear my matching copper mail until I find armor that doesn't make me look like a raver.
---
Ah! :) Nice to hear, glad to deliver!
---
What a read lmao
---
Scarab Lord was definitely in vanilla
---
The same!
---
I will attempt to ask... will get a major eye roll...
---
Yep triggered for a good reason, one of the most stupid comments i've seen in a while.
---
Hello, my new desktop background!
---
The old UI didn't show the modifiers
---
I thought troll was for PvE and undead for PvP? Am I going loopy?
---
most of these guides seem to be tailored with hunters in mind.. having a tank for you, feign death in bad spots, kiting, etc.
---
I'm sure it's much the same as a warlock too. but what would you change generally speaking for both a high dps but gear dependent class like rogues?  or even a mid tier leveler like a priest.. you have high efficiency but still not one of the faster levelers and can't solo some of the elites and such.
---
&gt; So, for reasons unclear, we were seeing an abnormal boost in subs even before the CDN beta went live.
---
I think word is just getting around that classic is happening. I see it brought up all around the internet in unrelated gaming discussion.
---
I‚Äôve loved hunters since vanilla (and still do when dabbling on private servers), but when wotlk came I switched to DK and the play style fit me perfectly. I tanked every raid in wotlk so I know the class well, and I must say the only vanilla class that comes close (play style/feeling wise) is a well geared DW fury warrior: fast paced, ripping through mobs. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played much warlock so I can‚Äôt say for sure, but it seems nothing like a DK to me, except perhaps the lore. But to me play style is more important. 
---
And paladins game play is too slow.
---
I was thinking arena. Most likely vice versa then...
---
Everyone loves the judgement set, but all I see is Deadpool.
---
$15 is 3 beers at a bar. You don‚Äôt think you could get more enjoyment from a month of classic wow than two hours at your local pub?
---
Can confirm.
---
When you get older maybe your brain will be able to absorb the truth without hurting
---
Used to have a 19 rogue with Shadowfang and all Bis gear. Going for that again except horde this time :)
---
Right. battlegrounds will be great and come with rewards.
---
I don't gank players so I don't want to be ganked while leveling.
---
So always kill the horde, got it.
---
Ah man knowing if we can front stab would be huge
---
Despite my story I kind of feel the same. Mainly because I know I'll always return to the game.
---
sweet as
---
Get as many Twitch followers/viewers as possible. I guarantee all the big streamers/youtubers are going to get beta keys.
---
I had signed up for the beta, and never got in.
---
They hosted an open beta pretty close before launch. 
---
I remember seeing an early morning email about the beta, and ended up calling in sick to school.
---
I remember rolling a Gnome something and running around Dun Morough.
---
Fast forward to live launch, and I rolled a Paladin. One morning, I woke up at about 4am and decided to roll a night elf hunter. I have no idea why I decided this at 4am on a school day, but I somehow convinced my parents I was sick that day.
---
Let me tell you... the different between a paladin and a NE Hunter is like night and day. It was so fun to actually be able to kill stuff, I think I hit lvl 30 in a single day.
---
That's how I left a level 52 Paladin out of sheer boredom and leveled a 60 hunter.
---
You should wife her
---
I‚Äôll probably spend most of my time twinkling after hitting 60. 
---
This time around I‚Äôll make some unconventional twinks as well. I made a lvl 30 World PvP whirlwind axe twink warrior on a certain server and it was a blast. Absolutely destroys most classes up to even the high 30s.
---
he would build a cuckshed like a real man, while the wife can spend some free time with tyrone
---
They need to apply all the reasons classic works with all the ACTUAL improvements they have made (and often pulled out later) to the game since.
---
Class mechanics wrath - mop 
---
Raids bc - bfa
---
New visuals
---
Vanity items
---
A follow up to vanilla/bc wow with the original dev team (at the time, too...Keep them in the same headspace as they were, last know?) and all of modern wows tools would be immense.
---
So being free isn't important anymore?
---
Which is btw, something I'm very curious about, how long each phase is.
---
I think the point he is making is that the younger generation has an aptitude for BR instant gratification play style.  
---
Games like Wow that are sluggish in comparison to the BR games that are taking off will not likely be able to captivate that audience. YES I agree that there is a massive audience in the 5-10 mil range of mmo style gamers. I am talking old school role based mmo games that are sitting around WAITING for something that can hold their interest and be challenging.  
---
Classic WoW fits that bill for most of those people. I will not be surprised to see the initial week numbers be something absurd like 10mil+. Following weeks it will get cut in half most likely. But I still feel it could sit about 3 mil without breaking a sweat.  
---
I just do not think the majority of streamers will bother with streams until they get  into the game a bit. Until pvp becomes a thing. The pve grinding content is pretty relaxing. People don't typically stream relaxing content. Viewers seem to like the high skill intense play styles.  
---
But then again, I have NO idea how many gamers there really are. There has not been a game that could pull more then say 15% of the world gaming populations interest into one location in ages. Classic might be able to do that. We will see.
---
I understood that reference

When the game first came out my bro was 6, I let him fish for me lol.
---
Fast forward a few years I got an account for him and we went Alliance hunting.
---
nah, probably just /r/thatHappened , bllizz gms would easily track where the gold went and ban the offender
---
No good wife/girlfriend would say that. So if she said that he should've called it a day, asap. I'm not talking about the case where he would completely neglect her existance because of Classic, but her simply forbidding it beforehand is absolutely unacceptable.
---
Actually Orc is better for later game PvP due almost entirely to the stun resistance.
---
You might be right here, but then there is still a playerbase out there that doesn‚Äôt want to go back, they‚Äôve put 10-15 years in to their account, despite the more recent ‚Äúcasual/more rng‚Äù approach. 
---
Raiding mechanics are also more engaging in retail imo, let alone pvp (despite the fact every class has similar moves now).
---
At the end of the day though, does it matter? As a fan of wow I want both to shine. Nostralius may have gotten the idea off the ground, but the retail players literally kept wow alive. 
---
Now we‚Äôve got classic servers coming and retail. So it‚Äôs a win-win anyway you look at it.
---
Yeet, I basically mapped out my training from those, OP check them out if you haven‚Äôt they are on the front page of this sub

With experience you‚Äôll learn when to stunlock and when to spike, don‚Äôt stress about it. The best general advice I can give an aspiring rogue is to avoid fighting your enemies the way they want to fight you. For example, don‚Äôt bang it up close with a Warrior; kite them around until they switch stances for an intercept, then vanish off and stunlock them for a while to take advantage of their berserker stance damage taken increase. They‚Äôll dump a big chunk of their rage switching back to arms for Overpower, as well. Rogues are most effective when they‚Äôre able to knock people out of their comfort zones.
---
Most importantly, pick your battles. Rogues are uniquely able to set the terms for every fight. If you plan your attack and think a few steps ahead, it‚Äôs difficult to lose.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking as well, but it‚Äôs been such a long time and the lines are blurred. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it would port you outside the portal or your hearth or the nearest GY.
---
Wotf is still really nice to have, you aren't always going to be jumping locks in a fair fight

---
FOR THE KING! Lmao
---
What you described was the exact same experience for me when I more recently had launched a BC server and came into contact with it again. Maybe subconsciously we knew the trauma it would bring to the game so we blocked it out of our memory xD
---
Show her the divorce papers and your subscription to WOW classic and ask her to choose.
---
If she loves you she will choose the divorce because she will not want see you destroy your life once again :D
---
Me ? I divorced long time ago so I can enjoy classic like the true casual I became : all my available time outside of work :D
---
LUL
---
Careful you will get downvoted here for speaking truth. LoL
---
...it wasn‚Äôt made for raiders...
---
Well us 1% will but there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of new players I think.
---
If a warlock gets the jump on you wotf is not going to save you. But yeah it's nice. In wpvp the rogue is the one getting opener the majority of the time thats why it's orc for wpvp and undead for BGs
---
Yeah, this is kinda sad tbh.
---
and Black Desert Online, ESO...  
---
So many have fallen.  
---
I guess Live wow is next
---
It's just the rain.
---
Hate replies like this, because you are not wrong but at the same time when someone is asking about what classes are stronger, 1v1 is the only way to base it... You talk about teamplay but you could be the best warrior in the world, if your teams crap, your not going to get anywhere. That doesn't make Warrior or Warlock bad, but makes the players bad.
---
For me personally, it already has helped in contributing towards the death of retail - me and my guild quit to wait for Classic. Using this time to explore other MMO's and new games like Sekiro etc. I'm sure we're not alone. And no one is going to have enough time to play Classic seriously AND play Retail.
---
&gt;unfortunately I got married this year
---
This is a sentence I didn't think I'd read unironically.
---
Right but if I can be at 200-300g by then I‚Äôd be even happier.
---
My guess is if /camp is nerfed, people will find new routes that involve running back to the portal. GPH might go down but it will still be a thing.
---
my exact take-away as well from that very well-written post
---
Where do you work?
---
Honestly, that kind of tool I don't mind though. It was only for listing groups and you had to do it manually and still travel to the Dungeons and talk and such to organize stuff.
---
Ha. Right back at ya bud. With that attitude you're gonna stagnate and won't get anywhere close to reaching the skill ceiling Mage-play has to offer. Bet you're on of those that gets a hard-on that one time you manage to block a coil.  
---
I can just picture you spamming frostbolts to no end wondering why you're never able to be at the top of the meters. Stay average. Peace
---
I understand *exactly* what he was saying. What would give you the impression that I didn't? 
---
I just think he's wrong.
---
It might be fair to say that few people under 21 have actually *experienced* these types of games, and, thus, they do not know if they like them. And it may also be the case that some will be immediately put off by them because it isn't what they're used to.
---
It is *not* fair to say that they have a preference, in the aggregate, for BR style games. Or that they prefer instant gratification more than people older than them. This is just ridiculous ageism. In many cases, they simply, and quite literally, don't know what they're missing.
---
They very well might try it and like it. And I'm willing to bet a not-insignificant chunk of them will, particularly if there is hype in the MMO community upon release. There are no shortage of young people who had their first EQ experience on Project 1999 and stuck around for awhile too. 
---
My response was simply that there is nothing intrinsic to today's youth that makes an old-school style MMO less attractive to them. They are simply a niche product in general, and they do not appeal to *everyone* no matter how old they are.
---
Greetings!!
---
I will definitely be playing Classic WoW, I am really excited about it!
---
There's no problem with guild banks. If Blizz could have added them in vanilla they would have. No need to regress back to gbank alts.
---
Ive played a paladin on a private server before but only got till like lvl 50. Honestly the only class that i struggeled with was a hunter other than that i would win most (fair) fights.
---
Yeah but for half a dozen insane warriors on a server, how many will be canon feed for the other classes ?
---
I expect the forums to be very vocal about it like they were at the time.
---
Fwiw I mained a warrior in vanilla, so I'm talking from experience here, and this is why I won't play one this summer.
---
Well ok but even on an empty server a hunter is a faster leveller so I wouldn't feel that bad about it. AoE grinding is strong, but only in some spots and level ranges, and you have to spec out of frostbite which makes your questing/ST killing much worse.
---
You are absolutely right, I have zero experience with 40 man. Just sharing how we did it in tbc :-) 
---
I‚Äôm unsure what the best system is, I just know that you should funnel all gear to the tanks, haha
---
I love hunters so it‚Äôs never occurred to me to roll another class. Except warrior since I also enjoy tanking.
---
Wait there's no Auberdine-Theramore ship? Being alliance seems awfully tedious
---
IT at a bank.
---
To expand on the earlier answer, basically taking advantage of WoW's funky  engine.
---
Originally, as long you angled yourself directly parallel to the slope of a wall, you could walk horizontally along slopes you couldn't legitimately climb. If you found the right set of hills, you could use this technique to get to places like under Stormwind, the river above Stormwind, above IF, etc.
---
For instance, to get above Stormwind, you would go up the little hill to the left as you exit the city, then wall-walk to another hill, and eventually you'd be high enough that you could simply walk along the mountains to get to all sorts of places. You got to the Ironforge airport the same way -- by walking from the cliff next to the graveyard. Wall-walking was fixed in various ways throughout Vanilla and BC and was pretty much impossible by the end of BC.
---
Also, the engine sometimes allowed your character to stand on "ledges" that shouldn't have been there. Two places this was useful are in Stormwind and in ZG. In SW, at the west tunnel out of the Trade District, you could jump onto, IIRC, a lamp, and then you could jump out of the terrain and directly into the unfinished land under the city. In ZG, you could do something similar, involving mounting as I recall. It was on the doorway leading out of the instance, on the north side of the arch, and you just had to keep jumping higher up on invisible ledges until you made it above the arch. The intent was to get behind the portal, because there was a ton of beta-ish terrain outside the ZG portal but still within the instance. You could even get all the way to Karazhan inside the ZG instance, I believe.
---
One other trick was that instance portals and doorways didn't work properly when your character was feared. This was one way people got through the door into Old Ironforge and how some people got into Hyjal.
---
Dude how can this be a hunter weapon if you restrict it to warriors ? 
---
I'd still roll on it, maybe I can something like 30 golds from the vendor :o
---
If you're in a raid, logging out will put you outside.  If you're in a party, logging out drops group, and will autohearth you.  The key is to switch party to raid before you log, a lot of people in vanilla weren't aware of that step if I had to guess.
---
I find mage really boring tbh. Even if you aoe you gotta drink after every pull..
---
Coming out a month earlier and you dinging 60 on your birthday would be better!
---
I do the same. I lose one work day a week on average.
---
I currently have less than ‚Ç¨10 on my account and im not getting more money in over a week, so buying games is off my priority list atm.
---
I think they just mean they wish it was the correct aspect ratio for 1920x1080. It would need to be squished or cut off to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio on most monitors.
---
Taking "Need" and "Greed" literally isn't a good idea, greedy people aren't going to do you the courtesy of rolling Greed. In cases where everyone gets an equal chance it's best to all roll Need so that no individual can fuck the others over.
---
Ah, carry on then.
---

---
When the battle.net edition came out, I would map my own 1v1 maps with one side having a ton of resources and buildings and the other having normal nothing. I would then challenge people to 1v1 me to be in my leet clan and just hope I got the spawn with all the stuff. I would then come in with dragons, mages,  and catapults while they are just getting their lumbermill going and crush them. 
---
Yes I was a virgin, why do you ask?
---
You better have video evidence.
---
Or a burger joint
---
Even 10% haste every few mins is pretty good. Also you can use a dark rune to chip off a bit, and there are plenty of fights where your going to take a chunk of damage
---
No doubt PvP is a lot more nuanced and gameplay-wise you will frequently use more abilities, and ultimately is where one will grow as a player.
---
However what I'm trying to get at is that most people seem to think Mages are just waterbots that spam Frostbolt all night during MC/BWL raids, which for most Mages I'm sure this is the truth. But, if you want to push hard for those parse rankings you will have to do more than that. For example, smart use of your instant casts is one thing that'll set you apart from others. Fights are short and in reality that extra bit of damage can be enough to give you the edge.
---
if your locks are DS/Ruin you could put them in a group with a Shaman for TAT.  Proximity to the totem adds some complexity, but it should help, though this assumes you've got at least 1 other lock giving the tanks blood pact, and enough shamans so the melee and healer groups are covered first.  
---
Thinking the priority groupings for shaman are: 1. tank group (SoE/WF), 2. tank/melee group (SoE/WF), 3. melee group (SoE/WF), 4. healer group (mana tide) 5. healer group (mana tide), 6. warlock group
---
So you'd probably need 6+ shamans, though from what I read on here it seems like many guilds would prefer 7 to 8 shamans so every group gets to benefit from totems.
---
Because they will look like shit compared to the rest of the low resolution world and gear. Because they could cause a requirement of using them for pvp because they clash so such with the world. Because they want to recreate the look and feel of the old world.
---
Riiiight! forgot about the whole Hunter item being a thing... Yeah that should be a fair reason to obtain it xD
---
as long as the enemy is 4 levels below and alone
---
Thats like saying Super Mario for the NES is better than Super Mario 64. Even if theyre the same series and genre, theyre completely different games.
---
it will be the same as in demo
---
I've played WoW for thousands of hours but I've never met/seen a GM in game, do you think it is a matter of server? Do GM's group up and play with other GM's often/at all?
---
RFK and RFD level ranges seem off.
---
*Get paid for reading about wow, one day a week on average.

is that The Rake i see there? :)
---
So What are you going to tell her when your normal weekly amount changes drastically?
---
It's mostly helpful for when a priest comes along mid fight and dumps it on you, saves your trinket for a stun
---
Why isn't SM/Ruin viable due to the 16 debuffs? Each one would like to add a corruption slot; are there really not enough to go around? I'm not sure of the top 16 priority debuffs (top of my mind: sunders, demo shout, curses (elements, shadows, recklessness), winter's chill, hunter's mark...
---
I work night shift, and I‚Äôd still love for them to bring that back too!

So a couple thousand after cutting out the ones that wont pay a sub?
---
First of all, check the replies to my comment even. Second, basically every thread that mentions Druids will have people saying how weak they are...
---
Excellent and in-depth reply, thanks a lot. Beyond explaining how priests are quite beatable, it also illustrated my general idea very well, how warlocks can be beaten, but takes a lot of skill or having some kind of advantage from the get-go.
---
Oh shit son!
---
The run from IF to Menethil is the worst, lol.
---
There are lots of new game things I don't like but the Stormwind harbor makes so much sense I don't understand why it took a cataclysm to build it hahaha.
---
Or just a tunnel through the mountains for a more direct path to Menethil...
---
FFS Horde Zeppelin paths are so much better thought out.
---
Not gonna lie, one day when I was fishing around the classic WoW reddit awhile back I found an old video from a server first my guild had and I totally cringed.  It was awful, I will make no effort to ever find it again, lol.  It wasn't even me talking mostly, current me couldn't even sit in that vent channel!
---
It really said it all, the moment I was off the clock and playing WoW, I was in full player mode!
---
I actually really like the fact that they use shadowbolt constantly, I don't play warlock but having a singular strong casted spell, like mind blast, frost bolt etc I thinks awesome. It makes what you do look palpable and means you don't have crazy sods diving all over the place!
---
Wow that‚Äôs beautiful. I haven‚Äôt seen the Tauren starter zone in YEARS.
---
What a noob
---
Don't understand the people who are downvoting you, but yea, also the beta should be coming out soon if you get into that
---
Originally XP gains were quite slow. The reason they ended up buffing it overtime was because the class stories were the real strength of the game and while the sidequests were not bad, having to do a metric shit ton of them every time you completed a story chapter just to continue your journey was terrible for the pacing. It wasn't like in KOTOR or Mass Effect were the sidequests added to the entire story. They felt like an artificial MMO grind necessary to get back to the real game. While it's true that the endgame was lacking (as was often the case with MMO competitors), the journey itself was its strong suit and slashing the XP gains would've hurt it more than it would've helped. Essentially you had to treat SWTOR like a singleplayer game with multiplayer aspects. Once you got max level one one class, there were 5 other distinctly different storylines to complete. But having to do the same sidequests again, no endgame to look forward to, and being forced to play a class you might not be interested in just for the story simply didn't appeal to people in the long term.
---
From what I read it was a whole lot more than the ah.  The ah was enough for me to not pick it up at least.  I cant be the only one
---
While levelling a paladin there is the slow speed and the very slow speed : one simply does not speedlevel a paladin :o
---
You should honestly think about setting up a patron account or something similar, I wouldnt mind paying a few bucks a month for more these, just saying.
---
Spec cold blood/prep and bring along some thistle tea. Can win most fights then. Patience if the situation requires it.
---
You cannot be serious with that question. Are countries and their citizens that have strict gun laws not free?
---
In the off chance that you are serious. Being free is still important, but times have changed and so have the challenges the U.S. face. One of the challenges is that there are lots of mass shooting in schools (and many other forms of gun violence).
---
Britain and other foreign governments are also not a major concern that the citizens have to deal with anymore. Now you guys have a big military that can defend your freedom.
---
Drood, warz, hunter (only for pet management and snare discipline)
---
Also: Paladins are so easy because the class is very straightforward, that doesn‚Äôt mean undisciplined players will succeed and in fact Paladins require the most amount of discipline and adherence to method to play well
---
I game around 15hrs a week and plant to keep it there.
---
By telling her
---
Because they use anger and entitlement as the basis for their argument, not common sense.
---
The warlock mount is not cheap.
---
I've been that laying out how things will go down with the GF since Classic was announced. Even before that when Nost 2.0 was about to launch.
---
I even pick up on some chores and reminder her about how exactly how indisposed I will be when Classic launches.
---
The weekend before launch I have designated as chore and date weekend. This will be FAIR compensation for what will go down a few days later. (Though half the chores will consist of batch cooking for Classic.)
---
There should be absolutely zero confusion.
---
Don't forget to cannibalize the bodies to add insult to injury !
---
As a warlock, I‚Äôm already feeling broke.
---
our bible
---
I did it on my warlock on nost and it was a good way to get some free enchanting exp early on since people really needed those wands. You will only really profit if you are the first one to be selling the wands, and even then the profit only lasts for about a half hour or an hour before all the underselling starts happening. By that time hopefully you will have moved on from lesser wands.
---
I hate mage, I don't know what it is about them and the players tending to have this odd chip on their shoulder. 
---
Then again, good mobility, good cc and good survivability as things go. I guess I'd be cocky too. Not to mention astonishing DPS, especially towards the end of Vanilla. 
---
I love Priest Druid Paladin :)
---
What a nice Hunter weapon
---
The mats cost almost as much as just buying a regular one.
---
Since death knights originally are raised warlocks, thematically, the answer is given.
---
No. Not yet. How is it? A friend brought Coup over one weekend and a group of us played it for a few hours while eating and drinking. Lots of fun. It was like a fast paced, easy mode cosmic enounters (which is my favorite game).
---
&gt; I would know, I had a r12/13 geared spriest on a reputable PS.
---
Not trying to take a shot at you in particular, but I hope this kind of talk completely dies out soon.  Once classic launches, *no one* will care about this :)
---
Where's the boat to Feathermoon?
---
WoW died when they released Cata. It doesn't matter to me how many people kept playing it.
---
Only wow can kill wow
---

---
It takes casuals closer to 10 days to reach 60. Semi-casual would probably be closer to 8 days.
---
Bargain!
---
I told my wife I was going to take some time off from games until the summer, to get some projects done around the house... so that when classic comes out I wouldn‚Äôt have to do them.
---
Totally get your point, but I think the necessary whisper/conversation leads to a more talkative server. And I believe that plays a significant part in feeling like you're part of a community, which lack thereof I believe is the real killer for retail.
---
thanks! I think this is what I was looking for for my one of my room walls.
---
Yeah, cause I totally enjoy showing of my rhok'delar and amani war bear on retail
---
For sure, I always wanted a rogue twink with shadowfang but never could afford one back then. This time around it shouldn't be too hard to obtain since I was a young kid back then lol :D
---
Fall 2004 - coming soon to an Electronics Boutique near you!
---
Phase 7: end season 1. Esport metrics updated, rewards given out to live servers for rank achieved. Server reset. Season 2 begins.
---
What if?
---
Fuck off.
---
Man I bet! I hope I can attend a NHL game someday, I live in Finland so it‚Äôs not just like that. Was an interesting AMA, thanks for that!
---
Can confirm, mid 2000s hardware was utter trash. It wasn't until consumer grade, multi-threaded multi-core became the norm around 2010 that things started to pick up and we actually had the hardware to record in 720p... lol.
---
I believe the bloodmail belt would be a long grind.
---
You also have Chiselbrand Girdle.

---
You can solo the boss as a hunter. But you have to reset the instance a few times to get him to spawn.
---
I've never enjoyed another MMO class as much as chloromancer spec.
---
Wasn't Vanilla, it was TBC, but it works with Vanilla too.
---
When I started out, I thought Talent requirements were the cost of the talent. So I saved up points to get the big talents.
---
I knew they existed, I just didn't take anything until 40 for that creamy Holy Shock.
---
There is no hype, only classic.
---
#only classic
---
It will work. You just need to make a raid. And GPH will be higher since private servers nerf every single farming spot and Classic won‚Äôt do this.
---
I doubt I'll get to the point of quitting so dramatically, but I'm very much looking forward to being on the giving end of these sorts of transactions in Classic. It's one of the best feelings getting to make someone's day like that, just because you can.
---
Who cares will Classic be bigger than Retail or not? We just want to come back to our home...
---
I am so god damn scared of them right now, I was feeling confident before game 5 but the sharks really showed up and if Vegas doesn‚Äôt take it on home ice I fear the sharks will win in 7!
---
Is it? Will it be? Idk the last few years have show me something else.   
---
"This will happen!".   
---
"That's confirmation bias or a conspiracy theory".    
---
-it happens-   
---
"I was right!". 
---
"You were just lucky".   
---
Time will tell.
---
One had to whisper and talk to them with the lfg tool, I think?
---
Pretty sure it didn't have invite right away from the menu?
---
Eve so, super rude to just randomly invite people without talking to them first.
---
It starts a war. You gank them, they gank you in revenge, both of you add a week onto your lvl 60 rush.

---
WoW changed yet it survived and is still working 15 years after launch. I have no number avaible but there could very well be more subs today than there was during TBC or vanilla.
---
How many 15 yo games, even sub based, have ever achieved that ? Iirc the vanilla team didn't expect the game to last more than a few years, i'm glad they were wrong. 
---
One of the reason WoW changed is because it's player base changed. people grew older and new players aren't looking for the same things than what vanilla offered.
---
 Players also wanted things to change which led to the current game.
---
As you said that's where good is subjective but i'd rather say wow is better now than before, but too different to please classic fans. Well at least that's how i see it (mostly thinking about boss strats, balance, art, gameplay ect)
---
It's pretty rare to see a GM in game.  I would be surprised if I showed myself to even 1 out of every 10,000 people I helped.  I think the people who saw GMs the most were either the ones who were in unique game situations, or they were asking GMs to show themselves when they had an interaction.
---
In terms of playing the game itself. GM player behavior is very similar to anyone else, everyone has different priorities.  There are definitely little groups of Blizzard employees who are friends who play together, but there are also those like myself who wanted to play the game as a totally normal player when not on the clock.
---
There were actually a couple of Lead GMs who had their personal accounts in my guild, but they were very busy people.  It was more of a sure come soak up some MC loot we don't need kinda thing, they didn't play with us on progression raiding or rank up with us or anything.
---
I don't think so
---
I found this at half price for $15 I snatched it up
---
Yes, they are not free.
---
They are being denied the basic right to self defense.
---
I told my wife, and she was like "world of what?"
---
Yup
---
You bring great shame to your preferred faction
---
Yes treat it like a free expansion for your current account.
---
Every time I PVP'd around southshore id listen to Dance of Death by Iron Maiden. It just fit so well.
---
My wife is more excited for WoW Classic than I am.
---
While reading it I could only think of [this scene](https://youtu.be/TnbGqqXAPQI?t=494)
---
Dude, so much wrong info in this bitch lul
---
Wow and metal are a match made in heaven.
---
I think he missed the "war" part in WarCraft :P
---
I literally couldn't imagine playing on a non-pvp server.  Been on one since the very first day I played the game on Nov. 23rd, 2004 and it will be the last server I log off of when I'm done with the game.
---
Lol me and all my friends reaction as soon as we heard classic announced... they could double the sub cost and I‚Äôd still pay it
---
guild runs can't be on demand
---
I have never played any other race. Tauren are the best.
---
Rank 3 at level 40. Get em dad
---
I think she'll understand.  I've tried to explain it like if they found a long lost season of 'Friends'.  I mostly wanted to make the gif.
---
Contrary to what your post maybe implying, a whole lot of people during vanilla had the same responsibilities as people do today. I worked full time back then and still cleared MC, BWL, half of the AQ‚Äôs including Cthun as well as 2 bosses in Naxx. 
---
Vanilla wow had an underlying mechanic to help offset what you are calling a lack of QoL. It was the community. Make friends, join a guild that fits your needs. I would personally have a much easier time gearing up with your suggestions but then it really would be very vanilla. 
---
WoW launched as the QoL mmo of its time. People made it work back then while balancing real life, people can do again this time.
---
the dream!
---
fuck off.
---
True
---
judgment of light + seal of light + health pots + bubbles + self heals with conc aura yeah this is gonna take awhile
---
I feel the same way. You get what you pay for. It's that good.
---
You mentioned that the EU GMs belonged to a different department. If GMs were required to be in office, how did/does that work in the EU? Did Blizzard only have an office in say France and were all GMs French?

The very definition of no-lifing
---
Being a complete noob kid back in vanilla, I unwittingly lucked out by getting the training while fit was cheap before the patch that changed the prices on riding/mounts, then the mount after.

I don't recall how cheap it was overall but it wasnt much since I was a broke player due to constantly buying spells I didnt need and greens off the ah.

I still feel very guilty for doing it, so it‚Äôs really not worth it. But I can‚Äôt help myself. 
---
Once classic launches I‚Äôve promised myself to delete reddit from my phone. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything for myself.  (I might do this when the beta comes actually)
---
Very nice map. Just wish it also showed the flight points.
---
I died my elven hunter to this place at level 10+ (can't tell exact the level anymore), to tame the rare lion there (The Rake?). I was so proud of myself that day. A moo hunter :) was watching me and after I got the lion we were dancing together. I guess he knew the feeling of getting the pet companion you really wanted. Good memories.
---
I mean it's your call.

If I repost with Classic where Vanilla was, would you allow it?

---
sounds like youve got a project to do!
---
Not a bad idea. But I don't think I could resist that sweet Classic urge..
---
My thoughts are you live in a vacuum.
---
My friend who played was showing me the game and his bro was like "show him a flight path!" And he did, and it flew over that amazing-looking water and it was the most incredible thing I'd ever seen.
---
I‚Äôve never been in a raid that gets the in game voice chat to work correctly, everyone has to relog and it still doesn‚Äôt function correctly for some people. Discord is the way people will be going.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and I don't really remember having any trouble killing tanks.
---
I still think it's dumb that we have to wait until phase 4 to get 20-person raids, and then another one right at phase 5. ZG should be Phase 3. #changes
---
bnet voice is very basic compared to other standalone solutions, for example, its gonna be a pain to invite everyone.
---
A frost DK is one of the hardest hitting classes ever. So in Classic, an Arms warrior casting Mortal Strike will be the closest you get.
---
An unholy DK deals a lot of damage from DoTs, so the closest in Classic would be an affliction Warlock.
---
However, one is a cloth wearer and the other is plate. So I'd just say roll an Arms Warrior.
---
You could just pop shaman at the botttom really.  
---
The majority of your totems were useless, earthbind, searing and cleansing totem had their obvious uses, not really that hard. What set good shamans apart from bad shamans was their use of grounding totem(especially with WF uptime), fakecasting, purges and shocks.  
---
Specwise:  
---
Enhancement was a joke, just hoping for that WF proc.  
---
Elementals big thing was knowing when to use your nuke, but limited to LBs, CLs and shocks(who all shared a cooldown)  
---
Resto meant keep your positioning and heal.   
---
Got my shaman to r13, would call myself incredibly good at the time but the class itself didn't really have any challenges, positioning and overview is something everyone needs in PvP.
---
Yes, because we all know "flasks" are the only consumable in the game :\^)
---
Certain dude! Je voulais pas jouer en fran√ßais parce que mon demi fr√®re a l'√©poque avait 16-17 ans et c'est lui qui m'a montr√© un peu a jouer sur son account alors quand j'ai eu le mien j'ai achet√© le jeu en anglais pour pouvoir jouer avec lui! Avec le recul je suis content car c'est en grande partie WoW qui m'a appris l'anglais! :)
---
I had to zoom in, but you're correct. Thanks for pointing it out.
---
I can't remember accurately where all the EU locations were, but it was sort of like that, where they had staff for the different languages that were supported.  How that worked though I am not sure!

I hear a lot of talk on the sub on how great ice block is. I never really learned how to use it. When is a good time to use ice block and why is it so great?
---
if you are toe to toe with a paladin you are wrong
---
So when would you spec enchant?
---
Stop moving the goal post. Absolutely nothing was said that approached the topic of perfection.
---
Early Rust (legacy) night was very broken though, you could just crank your gamma all the way up and see as well as you could in the day time. Current Rust is just as dark if not darker than legacy and there are no monitor tricks like legacy afaik, so flashlights and torches must be used for their intended purpose or you won't be able to see anything at night. Rust is actually in a great place right now, aside from optimization/performance issues.
---
The lack of loot, customization, and builds really turns me off from it. Farming specific weapons for specific loadouts and playstyles, farming armor for fashion souls, being able to play through multiple time with different builds, min maxing... those kind of were a huge part of the enjoyment for me. I plan on trying sekiro, but doubt I'll be able to sink 1000 hours in like I've done with previous games.
---
WAKE ME UP!
---
Rogue trinket doesn't remove stuns in vanilla...
---
No. Ask yourself what the content of the song *itself* has to do with Classic. If your answer revolves around personal feelings or nostalgia, then it isn't appropriate for this sub. We are not a music subreddit.
---
I just realized, technically as a Horde, the quickest way to reach Arathi Highlands would be to infiltrate the NElf Darkshore camp, take the boat to Menethil and hike it up to Arathi?
---
I think the guards would instantly  aggro you but you can technically die right on the harbor and wait on your corpse just until the boat starts to sail off then resurrect on it.
---
What if it revolves around my plans on how I'm going to enjoy classic?
---
towards the end of vanilla rogues would run away from me as a prot paladin. oh you just blew all your cooldowns and managed to take 10% of my health for that effort? thats cute. here is what reckoning feels like.
---
My thumb can bend backwards to a 90 degree angle.
---
Then the post is about you and not Classic.
---
That was my favorite thing to spam in vent I had it keybound üòÇ
---
You're absolutely right man. I wouldn't have it any other way and I can't wait!
---
Hunter's mark is low on the prio list since most raids don't carry many and hunters are lower end dps as it is.  
---
Most will run the 3 curses, winter's chill, sunder armor, nightfall, imp shadow bolt, shadow weaving (spriest), thunder clap, demo shout, and faerie fire.  There's a few different options for the last slots based on raid comp, but it's more than likely you won't have room for many corruptions to be up 100%.  
---
Locks will most likely run as DS/Ruin
---
Don't listen to the cloth user, go rogue :*

How is it different from this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf2d4g/do\_you\_remember\_how\_you\_got\_your\_first\_mount/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf2d4g/do_you_remember_how_you_got_your_first_mount/) ?  
---
all about him and his memory of vanilla.
---
Definitely not many options in real Classic. Things like distance and head boggle and what not (you even had to use a command to gain the full camera distance allowed). 
---
I'm guessing Classic using the newer engine could very easily have more as it's built in and I'm not sure if Blizzard feels that limiting options is part of "no change". Unless they feel it would impact pvp for some reason, I don't see any reason to reverse engineer it.
---
For the Alliance!!!
---
A wardens staff drops and a feral druid is in the group, rolling need instead of him equipping it is in fact ninjalooting, no one needs gold more then they need bis gear, especially if the piece is best in the entire game. 
---
If the item is bis for this content phase or in the total game you dont roll need and ninjaloot gear, by that logic everyone needs on everything as the gold can be used to buy bis. 
---
You can all agree to roll need for gold if everyone agrees to that, but if the druid wants the warden staff he should get it, same thing with fury warriors and edgemasters handguards. 
---
I understand everyone needs bagspace, and that its hard to be sure that an alchemist takes the flask recipe and learns it and therefore everyone needs on it, or that every guild needs a flask recipe more then the individual and therefore everyone needs. But i can not understand taking bis gear from someone for gold, that is not "sort of scummy" its ninjalooting and its private server mentality.
---
Sounds like time damn well spent!
---
It's not a huge deal for rogues because you cant wear axes, so orc is not miles ahead. For PvP obviously the stun resist is very strong, but for PvE, neither Blood Fury or Berserking will make a huge noticable impact on your DPS.
---
That guy is talking about his experience with vanilla as it pertains to Classic. It's thought out and expressive. Merely posting a link to a song that reminds of you Classic is one step removed from the content expected to be seen on the sub. Please see our extended rules concerning rule 7 about title only posts.
---
Is that with or without using AH?
---
Oh so you just stole from his rich parents. That makes it ok then.

I used to rush the zeppelins at the horde node in stv to get to sm faster. Its pretty easy to ditch the guards till the loading screen, you can probably do the same on the boats without trouble.
---
Not me but my friend levels a druid to about 40, until he started leveling a warrior.  
---
I asked why he swapped and the reasoning was because the druid was so awfully slow killing, having trouble with just 1 mob. He leveled much faster with the warrior, saying druids were terrible at leveling and it wasn't until a few months later he realized why. He hadn't been using any of the higher ranking spells he learned since around level 20. Basically he'd been using \~2-4 too low levels of his spells. When he tried leveling again with the correct rank it was much faster than the warrior

Ok, if you‚Äôre trolling, you win.  I‚Äôm saying it now that I‚Äôm taking the bait and admit defeat.
---
In case you‚Äôre not trolling, those options are not in classic.  No DKs, no Monks, no BElfs, no Draenei, and no other races past the vanilla game.
---
Hey man, I appreciate this and I see it as well from your point of view. I work with people of all ages and have lots of young gamers in my family. I also follow twitch and see what's watched the most and played the most. I presume off what I see. I get it, its not a fair presumption but seeing what the gaming industry has turned into with all the p2w features I think its a fair presumption
---
I‚Äôm assuming the brackets will be x0-x9 upon BG release for classic instead of x1-x0 like they were orginally. That 31-40 bracket when the level 40s has their mounts was fun to blast in.
---
I believe I see the distinction, thank you.

On an unrelated note, [the rules sidebar](https://imgur.com/a/10rgsrJ) doesn't seem to match the report rules.

I told my girlfriend that I'd be putting in vacation time as soon as I know when the game will launch, so I can absolutely no-life it for a week or more. She told me the only way she's going to be cool with it is if I don't eat pizza every single day. 
---
That's my only condition, and, well, I'm still deciding if I should just break up with her or not.  ^(/s)

What part of toggeable, aka completely optional did you miss? "Looking like shit" is completely subjective, being a requirement for whatever is ridiculous since its cosmetic, client side only, and since its optional the look and feel of the old world is completely untouched, should you want to.      
---
       
---
This seems like another moronic "nO cHaNgEs" reinvidication that has nothing to do with what they should change or not, it's just stubbornness.
---
Just turn down your screen brightness. Boom.
---
The most chill zone in Classic. There is something so relaxing about TB and Mulgore.
---
ZG in Phase3 means that you trivialize BWL loot and that‚Äòs, lets say it clearly big BS.
---
Wont be even close to as big as retail, but sure man.
---
It‚Äôs situational. Sometimes used to clear dots, stuns, to wait for cooldowns, to wait for a heal. I personally love using it in WSG when I‚Äôm the flag carrier. In and out of block and quickly pick the flag back up to continue on.
---
Anyone think this would have some use to a WoW noob playing Classic for the first time?
---
Sweet! Thx! Is it a emulated game?
---
for me its literally the rest for my soul.
---
i just chilling here, slowly leveling, kiling wolf and striders, fishing in the big lake and enjoying the dynamic weather, the sound of rain and the view of TB.
---
Scat man
---
I had a friend who did that. Bought the game myself for mac for all money I had when I was 8 and I was so hyped. So was my friend.
---
It's all truth, I can not tell you how many dungeons I ran on my lock that ended with my blueberry being our tank because our actual tank pulled too much and died. In fact I got to the point where I sacrificed damage to always have it out, and would need to toggle it's taunt sometimes multiple times just to keep the group alive. Luckily my groups usually understood, because when you know what you're doing with aggro, it works... Just blatantly leaving taunt on your pet the whole time, it doesn't.
---
It can change things a bit. Some AoE farming pulls take as long to loot as they do to kill really. So instant AoE loot is a massive efficiency jump and that means more gold generated at a faster rate.
---
I agree it's handy as hell to have buuut it would definitely have an effect. Especially for classes that can already AoE farm like crazy.
---
I have the WC1 and WC2 custom campaigns on my version of wc3, havent played through wc2 yet, though.
---
This doesn't feel like the truth.
---
So would you recommend gnome or dwarf for long term world and bg pvp?
---
Exactly this. I know T0,5 is mostly shitty for raides but it was something that non Raiders could ‚Äûeasily‚Äú obtain without raiding.
---
Can be used to mitigate a huge burst cool down like an enemy mage pom pyro in mid air.
---
If blink and trinket are down you can avoid a warrior or rogues burst until frost nova is back up. 
---
Clear dots when you get away to eat up or bandage. 
---
Save you from dieing when your threat pulls aggro from the tank. 
---
Pull a bunch of mobs over to an aoe farming enemy mage to stake ownership on the farming spot.
---
Rofl. Tauren Warriors walking around with 8 INT.
---
I always loved pally/Druid fights where we eventually just both give up, /salute, and go our own way
---
I disagree. Often using fire blast early will allow it to be used again to finish the fight. Fully talented Shatter is only on average 25% damage increase for fire blast, and by using it you reduce the time the enemy spends frost nova'd.
---
My launch character was a shaman (I played one in beta too) and I can't remember what level I was (pretty sure it was 50+) before I could afford a mount.
---
I clearly remember being nervous as hell buying it, simply because I was blowing all the gold I had manage to save and didn't want to screw up. lol
---
Printing this off at work Monday lol.
---
This is the dream!
---
I used to hate seeing these res runs when I was leveling (unnamed private server). "Why the hell would anyone join these jew runs" I would ask myself. "It makes no sense, just roll for the frigging item lul‚Äú, everyone partook in the run so everyone is equally entitled to look right? 
---
I'm a fury warrior. I'm also a tank. I turned 60, found out I was competent and have since fully embraced the reserves. I tanked to get all my items. First I started to just pick and choose classes, but in the end it was easier to just res it and be done with it. I havenfully turned by now, especially after getting the very last piece of loot I could possibly need out of the 20 after weeks of hosting runs together with another tank friend of mine.
---
On the other hand, I also like to take my AQ 40 geared ass into a Strath live run where I outgear the tank heavily just to fuck with them and ruin their 1st orb res.
---
tl;dr fuck rogues
---
Haha, damn love Oxhorn so much. Thanks for bringing that up again!
---
That's bullshit, but I believe it.
---
You can definitely squish it, the map is just real nice in its original proportions. :o
---
The holy trinity.
---
Now you can summon HIM...
---
I'm saying that if an item was in at launch and it's stats were reworked later then it will be in that reworked state from launch. They only change the stats or rarity later.
---
They are patch gating some items but they will ALWAYS have their 1.12 stats.
---
You could get addons which would autoloot back then. One of the only QOL changes I‚Äôd support, but hopefully it‚Äôs toggled off by default for that OG experience.
---
It's using the current launcher, which will allow you to voip with your friends via the launcher or do whatever you want for voice chatting.
---
Watching him keyboard shuffle around made me want to kill myself.
---
C l i c k i n g
---
Doing God's work my friend.  Thank you very much.
---
I believe there was an [automatic join](https://i.imgur.com/TWUx3b0.jpg) option. Maybe if that was removed, It would be interesting to test. However, I'm just against gambling on any changes that we don't know the effects of.
---
Yes they did. During their blue post on progressive itemization. They spelled out exactly what they are doing and also mention numerous times they only have the data from 1.12 and slightly before.
---
I'm going to be using AOL chat exclusively. A/S/L?
---
Oh man this reminds me of a level 1 twink I had in tbc or wotlk. I could beat most people 1-19. Even managed to beat a level 22 once lol.
---
Sane here. I'm just not into the whole "glass cannon" thing.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. What you said is true. I said the same below.
---
Eh, careful what ya wish for. Being denied sexy times because you refused to farm 10 lotuses for her would suck balls.
---
But aren‚Äôt potions not allowed in BGs?
---
It was certainly a different time, I am just glad I know people who can verify the story for me. Makes for an interesting tale from the old days.
---
I thought the same, but OPs post history seems to confirm this is a true level of delusion.
---
I have nothing against Classic. I'm all for it being introduced. I personally will likely never dabble in it, but to each their own. With that being said, pretty much everything OP said is patently false.
---
What does what's popular on twitch even have to do with *anything*? Games that are fun to *play* are not necessarily fun to *watch*. You're comparing apples to oranges. Obviously, faster paced games are more enjoyable to *watch someone else play*. And none of that has *anything* to do with the age group. Do only people under 21 watch twitch? 
---
Do you also believe that those under 21, with the least access to expendable income, are the people driving "p2w" mechanics in games? They aren't. Just like they weren't the ones driving the push for more casual content in MMOs. Older gamers with more income and less *time* are driving both of these changes. 18 year olds are not whales. 45 year old computer scientists with no family and too much income are. 
---
You presumption is *not* fair, because it isn't even based on legitimate connections. You're starting off with the presumption that people under 21 are responsible for these things, when there is evidence that they are not, and then you're claiming that your presumptions are "fair" because you *already* presumed something wrong.
---
This man is obviously an engineer
---
What swords are those? Sword of omen and...... I cant remember the other one.
---
haha touche.. for context I meant unfortunate for my ability to no life and use pto at work.. still very happy in the marriage :)
---
feel I needed to qualify that statement thank you lol
---
No changes is stupid.. I used CT mod in vanilla, especially because of it's mailmod function. My entire guild did too. All these convenience changes need to stay, but I am for progressive itemisation. I liked the stupid gear earlier on and seeing it get buffed was great.
---
There are very few defensive abilities compared to live wow, so iceblock stands out more for that reason.  
---
In addition mage is a very control heavy class, pvp trinkets were not as good in vanilla and most classes could not escape control reliably.  Iceblocking enemy CDs or control ensures that the mage always(if played correctly) keeps a control advantage.
---
The presumption is rather clear. Look at the gaming world and the player base in each of the game fields. Currently BR games are the number 1 community by a large margin. That play style is dynamically different then the grinding of an mmo.
---
The average age of that community is also relatively low and considering that they have grown up only knowing those type of games, I do not suspect their attention to suddenly be taken by a very slow grinding mmo.
---
Sure that is an assumption, but it is not based on nothing. Mmo players did not gravitate towards FPS games until the mmo games literally died off or changed so much that they are unplayable. I do not forsee the current BR games doing that. SURE it could happen.
---
There is nothing intrinsic to today's youth, OTHER then the fact that they(most of them) have never played a slow methodical game that requires grinding and has a much lower/slower reward system then the big shinny buttons when you win or kill someone in Apex or Fortnite. Yeah, we all know mmo is a niche, but over the past 10+ years that niche has been eroding due to crap content. So anyone that has not played some of the real mmo content or experienced what mmos CAN be, is much less likely to give it a whirl all of a sudden. Call it ageism, I call it experience. There has not been a solid mmo released in ages.
---
I hope they can get out of the BR/FPS world that they have grown up in, but I expect a very low % of that community to come over. I DO expect the silent community to show up in a giant way. This is a most situation so don't get all butthurt over it. Most teens will be more inclined to stick with their BR games over trying an "Ancient" game that is being re released.
---
Also, what content do you think streamers will have for the first couple of months? Streaming a grinding game is not exactly going to set world records (IMO). Sure I might be wrong, but I just cannot see large populations of people watching streamers level up nice and slow. Watching someone stream leveling in WoW or doing some active BRs. I HATE BRs and I am way more inclined to watch people doing something active. Not grinding.
---
Once pvp wakes up and people start getting some gear, then maybe the streamers will get things going, but for the first few weeks, I do not see that happening at ALL. THAT is what draws in the younger crowds. Streamers. All of the teens around my neighborhood are always talking about streamers that they saw do this and that. Well, if WoW can someone incorporate that, then it has a chance at pulling that audience in.
---
Also, there has been almost no hype about classic at this point. Outside of this community and people who have been following it, hardly anyone has even heard classic is coming out. I find new people every day that go, Really?
---
So to me, that clearly shows the younger crowd has almost no chance at being pulled in at this point. I hope they get some hype going, but as it sits, Fortnite and Apex will still be the fotm for that younger generation imo.
---
Jesus Christ. If you think *magifek* is the one who came off as juvenile in this little exchange, I've got news for you.
---
I see this a lot, but looking at the BiS lists for Phase 4, it doesn't appear to be the case. The most items from ZG a class has is elemental, with 4 (The bloodvine set and a cape). Most classes average 1-2 items and the rest from BWL.
---
I'm happy for ZG to come out after BWL, as I think that the items will help BWL clears a bit too much. But it doesn't appear to trivialize the loot.
---
How does Zin'rokh trivialize Ashkandi? How does anything in the game trivialize Neltharion's Tear? There will always be plenty of reasons to run BWL, if only for elementium. ZG is the raid with the shorter shelf life.
---
I played on Khaz Modan US, if your father was a raider, I probably played with him haha.
---
I've only played since wod and have had multiple classes none of which I particularly fell in love with as it seemed like most people just reroll fotm, I'm looking to find a single class and stuck with it but I'm torn between mage/rogue/Hunter/warrior
---
I will be going alliance, my question is how good is their aoe farming for gold and what not compared to others? I hear that they're amazing about it but is it that much better than other classes listed? I wanna play a fury warrior probably if I went that.
---
I'm just spreading the good word.
---
I have a creeping feeling vanilla is going to be a success, and they're going to end up developing two branches of WoW. 
---
Perhaps even ultimately abandon the current retail branch and cherry pick from it the changes that fit in with the new direction.
---
There are many lessons to be learned from the expansions, like how flight was the first step to ruining the social aspect of the game.    
---
I think ultimately retail WoW is what it is with regards to the social aspect because they realised there was no way in hell they would be able to salvage it. The path was set. 
---
It'll be interesting to see.
---
I honestly think the launch will be huge, but can it sustain for longer than a month? No one knows.
---
The "players" are going to fall into different "lots" we'll call them:
---
* Vanillia Veterans
---
* WoW Veterans
---
* Newbies
---
* Newbies that watch streamers
---
Let's start with Vanilla Veterans - These are your Vanilla warriors (like us) that played in Vanilla and miss the good old days. We want that return of nostalgia, we crave Classic to return us to our childhood. As of Q4 2006 (before BC), there were 8 million subs to WoW. Now, this is the group that is going to have a higher percentage of returning than the others. I'd say a 50% return rate? So, 4 million players from that group alone returning.
---
Next we have WoW Veterans - WoW had around 12 million players as of October 2010. This was the peak of WoW, 6 years after the release of Vanilla. This number is inflated from our Vanilla veterans, but let's do some rudimentary math, remove 8 mil from 12 and we are left with 4 million in this group. Let's say 25% of this group returns and we are left with 1 million returning.
---
Bring on the Newbies! - These are people that never had a chance to experience WoW in it's glory. When Vanilla was released in 2004 they were 0 years old. I know....your 14 or 15 year old kid was born in 2004....when did I get so old. Anyway, all they've heard about from us oldies is how amazing WoW Vanilla was. What's the number on this, we really don't know. Let's say 1 million? Why not.
---
Newbies that watch streamers - Oh boy, here we go. These are kiddos that have no clue that World of Warcraft exists (yes there are tons of those). They Fornite the crap out of Fortnite with their sick dance moves. Then one day their favorite Fortnite streamer is playing this game called WoW Classic. This is a cool game. I can get a free trial to play? Awesome, let me check it out! Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is where the number gets astronomical. Apex legends had 10 million players in 72 hours and 50 million in one month. Let's say streamers start streaming this shit out of Classic WoW, and the Newbie streamers get addicted.....oh boy. 5 million? 10 million? 15+ million?
---
Now, will the numbers stick after launch? No one knows. Maybe the game is truly dated and the younger generation doesn't like the grind. However, I did complete a small experiment with my 12 year old nephew. I loaded him into a private server and had him play Vanilla, and the kid was addicted within 2 hours. He noted that it was like no other game that he played. The game was raw and not like any other newer MMO that he had played.
---
We'll see at release. That's all we can really say.
---
It's - 18 intellect. Makes one warrior less  intellectual :D
---
(cursed weapon) with - stats
---
BoE items are kind of a specific class of loot, though. If you let the guy who is going to equip the item take it, you're really only saving him gold. If you see the item as what it is, which is a big pile of gold, you understand why some people feel like no one should have priority over someone else for it. Because everyone can use a big pile of gold, whether it's to turn it into another bis item or a leveled profession or an epic mount or bag space or raid consumes.
---
You're ignoring the fact that back then there were no quest addons or anything alike. There was not even something that told you when and where to go in terms of zones. Not to mention that this early in the game he wasn't even able to check thottbot comments for quest locations/hints and shit, since he was likely the first to do some of those quests. With all that in mind, 10 days is insanely fast. You can't compare full knowledge run vs having to figure out everything on your own!
---
Vanquisher's Sword from RFD
---
I can confirm /camp worked in vanilla.  It was the logout command for everquest before wow vanilla, so devs brought it over for MMOs fans who were used to using it.  
---
I am not sure if there is any functional differences between it and logging out, I only remember using it once just to test how it would work.
---
I traded it to another friends account then he traded it to me. I was so scared i was gonna get banned. Never heard a word about it. My guess would be hacking/gold stealing was so common in those days that they didn‚Äôt have the time to investigate every case. It was before Authenticators etc.
---
The worst was the hunter with the epic staff just standing still and backpedaling for 15 sec.
---
never tell dad when hou have gold
---
Vanquisher's Sword form RFD quest
---
We couldn't get into Torment Act 2. The gear that dropped in act 1 was worse than in 2, but almost everyone couldn't do act 2 in the limited nice act1 pieces they could get their hands on. I was playing a barb and a near perfect stormshield dropped for me, I sold it for 250‚Ç¨ and stopped playing a few days later till they changed things.
---
Oh must have been druid's that removed stuns
---
Well it helped against blind I think
---
At Level 15 you can get the Smoldering Wand for 55 silver from Wand Vendor Zane Bradford in Undercity if you are an Undead caster. 
---
My plan is to get to Brill level 6ish and pick up Enchanting and Tailoring. Farm Scarlet Monastery humanoids for 60ish linen cloth to make 9 Brown Linen Robes. I will craft the Lesser Magic Wand and drop Tailoring and pick up Herbalism. Its a gathering skill that also helps with Silverpine Forest quests. I will make sure I craft a Runed Copper Rod before skill level 5 Enchanting if possible and then DE greens until Enchanting skill level 70 so I can make the Greater Magic Wand. The cost is 38 copper for the simple wood and 1x Greater magic Essence. It is already better than the Vendor wand for 55 silver. I will then drop Enchanting and pick up Skinning when I get to the Barrens. I will then level to 60 with Skinning and Herbalism and send all of it to my bank alt. Probably an undead Mage for farming purposes later.
---
The Greater Magic Wand will last until the Burning Silver fire wand which is a quest reward around lvl 40. If you can get a group for Wailing Caverns and down Deviate Faerie Dragon thats awesome too. There is also the Sizzle Stick wailing cavern quest reward. You can also get the Branding Rod quest reward from Isha Awak. There are wand options in the Barrens. The Grave Stone Scepter is also very nice. Just some wands to consider. I think the Lesser Magic Wand &gt; Greater Magic Wand &gt; Burning Silver wand progression is cheaper, faster, and more profitable.
---
I will level my bank alt to level 5 the same way and then send all the cloth from my main to create as many Lesser Magic Wands as I can with the cloth to sell on the AH. Then drop Enchanting and pick up Tailoring and Alchemy to synergize with professions with my main leveling Warlock with the gathering professions. I will just vendor all the leather.
---
I won't make world first 60 Warlock, but I will have enough gold for bag space, grimoires, Shadow Weave set, and Dread Steed epic mount quest items. The biggest quality of life changes for me are travel speed, bag space, shadow power for Life Tap efficiency. You have to think a little more long term on a fresh server.
---
Yeah he's a rare mob but he drops the recipe for the Arcanite Reaper, so farming him could be a win-win proposition. Are you sure he's reachable by a hunter ? I saw rogue videos about it, but if he spawns in one of his far away spot it's going to require some FS shenanigans with the pet.
---
Your belt lacks a bit of stamina IMO, but now that I saw the one I chose has a 1 or 2% drop from Scholo, I'm not sure anymore \^\^
---
&gt;There is nothing intrinsic to today's youth, OTHER then the fact that they(most of them) have never played a slow methodical game that requires grinding and has a much lower/slower reward system then the big shinny buttons when you win or kill someone in Apex or Fortnite.
---
Saying that someone *has not been* exposed to something is completely different than saying *that they will not be* interested. You are making a substantively *different* claim than the person you are defending. I already acknowledged that it's *fine* to say that they don't know anything about it. It is *also* fine to say that many of them may not even try it because it's so different than what they're used to. Both of these things are valid. They're also not what the previous person is saying. So your point is sort of moot. 
---
&gt;Also, there has been almost no hype about classic at this point. Outside of this community and people who have been following it, hardly anyone has even heard classic is coming out. I find new people every day that go, Really?
---
I mean, that's fine. But the question is about the hyper *after* it launches and people tried it. WoW was also only anticipated by the tiny MMO community who played EQ and its contemporaries when it launched in 2004. It still gained a following. 
---
The point here is that there isn't any reason to believe that young people are *incapable* of appreciating something new simply because they're somehow *different* than older people.
---
I mean, I'm sure 3 payments in and he was probably dying from the joke haha. Wow has some interesting characters, I've met some cool and fun people hanging out there. I don't think I'll ever get back into it for more than a couple weeks at a time like the last few years but it's super cool
---
They're not going to do that for a good reason. ZG was designed as a catch-up raid for people who started raiding later on in vanilla's lifecycle or those who wanted to gear up alts. Its loot was slightly worse than MC's, but slightly more easily attainable. By having an extra way to get loot, guilds received the power boost they needed to clear MC more efficiently (or even clear it for the first time). While cutting edge players were already well into BWL, the slackers were given the opportunity to get their gear up to a level where they could start BWL while not having to deal with the painfully slow gearing process their predecessors faced. Prior to ZG the only way to progress through MC and get ready for BWL was trial and error farming on MC, Ony, and potentially the World Bosses until you had a sufficiently geared raid. Releasing ZG at the same time as BWL would make it way too easy for players to gear up for BWL, thus reducing the time it'll take to clear it.
---
Or not
---
It's a full immunity, on the level of Divine Shield. It removes all debuffs, prevents all damage, and sometimes lets you immune important mechanics on boss encounters. It's a Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card, and only 2 of those exist in Vanilla (Divine Shield).
---
You're the best! This will really help my wife and I visually plan when to go back to town. We have it written up already like a checklist but this is like an advent calendar lol
---
I added flight path locations, quest hub locations, dungeon names and suggested level for new players to do them, and the docks and where they go.

No. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18849](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18849)

He didnt raid in vanilla. But he did in Wrath and BC. He played a human pally named Chapel.
---
played the demo for 80 hours and never opened the settings menu lmao
---
This was definitely a private server and not how vanilla worked at all... I don't expect private server behavior to be the norm.
---
Selling a \[Sniper Scope\] schematic for 10g when it was still BIS.  
---
Probably lost thousands of gold.
---
Well I didn't really get it as hard as anyone else, I was a paladin. But I remember the first time when I saw someone riding a mount, didn't know squat about the game. Damn man that was my motivation as a lvl 15ish paladin in stormwind to level up and get money. I envied that guy so much, he could get anywhere so fast... Well can you blame a 13 year old kid?
---
*and shrinked my shoulders*
---
ah, so your playing undead then!
---
Thank you for this. I wanna print an azeroth classic map and this seems to have a great resolution! :)

---
ah ok I see what you mean
---
I do not think there will be any ball sucking if sexy times is denied.
---
Do you have a link to your guide?
---
I ground (grinded?) the gorillas in STV for heavy leather and sold them on. Was the only time I really interacted with the AH as a seller during vanilla. Still didn't get my mount until lvl 46 or so.
---
Damn that's really sad.  Sorry brother, the hype was insane for d3 and they really blew it
---
I had my account recovered and they had to tell me which servers I had characters on.  Untill I connected to the server it wouldn't show that there were any characters on it.  After I connected it would display.
---
is it a pain to twink in classic without the ability to lock level
---
Madseasonshow did a very satisfying video which included some of the drama.  It was an enthralling watch.  I think its titled famous and infamous players #4.  Check it out - it may be cathartic
---
Sounds to me like she doesn‚Äôt understand what this all entails.
---
I for one would never join a party where people demand reserves. It's not in the spirit of the game and I am not using my time to guarantee some random an item. 
---
Guild mates on the other hand I am happy to go farm a dungeon or whatever with for some specific gear or recipe as I know they will do the same for me and it benefits us all.
---
Or also the **X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME** , that gamecard mount which went out at the very end of BC if I remember well.
---
you could autoloot with shift or ctrl so who cares
---
Lol, these are the exact classes I'm going to make for classic.
---
Hi, Emperor this is unrelated to the post but I‚Äôm wondering if you get me that rocket league key ASAP
---
&gt;people are just better gamers now.
---
This... isn't really true.
---
The time it took for people to get to 60 in vanilla was more than enough for one to become a "good gamer", and those who weren't simply didn't have the ability or interest. 
---
People are going to be making the exact same mistakes now as we did before.   
---
I am going to convince myself that extra mob the fleeing one pulled can be handled, then die.   
---
I am going to lose control of my surroundings and get frostbolted by a patrol.   
---
I am going to forget about aggro and get raped by a boss.   
---
List goes on. WoW is both complex in its mechanics as it is diverse.   
---
A good WoW player is quite frankly a person who is an *above average* gamer; the top of the bell curve are just "decent" in WoW, always were.
---
... but wheres the vanilla box
---
I can't remember if */console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5* worked in retail Vanilla or not, but if so, it was one of the few options to modify your camera distance.
---
yeah he thinks he has the most clue
---
I remember playing on my Dell laptop. I always knew 2 seconds before i met someone, that i would meet them! üòÇ My pc would just make a huge lag as it tried to render them üòÑ
---
Very nice, thank you :)
---
Fortunately for me, she does entirely. She's actually playing it with me, as she does with most games I play. She just isn't as invested as I am in this launch. She'll cave though and follow the same footsteps &amp; request time off. Just watch.
---
Yes, the more I lurk this subreddit the more I see Wow players are one of a kind.
---
And sadly enough, in a society that via e-sports is trying to emancipate gamers, they enforce every single prejudice about gamers.
---
Then again this is quite expected. Many of those prejudice were born or radicated in the years of wow launch.
---
Just never going a pug that is 60% the same guild
---
yeah, there is a lot of custumization you can do in that build, which is awesome! In the end it comes down to personal playstyle, I like my setup the best (after spending hundreds of gold respeccing on private servers  for testing, who needs enchants?/s ). It just speaks to the balance of the two trees that there is no clear best option. This is exactly the reason why I was hugely disappointed whne they got rid of the trees in retail.
---
You did some cherry picking in this example. Obviously this items are very good but just have a look at the Bloodvine Set. It is not just BiS, it makes content much easier. Furthermore ZG is on a 3 day lock, while BWL is on a 1 week lock. Even if many items in ZG don‚Äôt trivialize every drop in BWL it makes the gearing process much easier. This, on the other hand would make BWL easier to clear.
---
Can I have my tabord of flame please, it would look so nice with my shammy.
---
I'm struggling with exactly the same decision :(
---
Semi-unpopular opinion here:  If you are starting at launch with the crowd, then no profession is worth leveling with.  Just stay ahead of the leveling curve and do professions at max level with a mount.  
---
In particular there is no XP gain for herb/mining and it can be quite difficult to keep them up while leveling.  You will often have to go out of your way to find nodes slowing you down.  When lots of people are leveling at once, needing gold for skills and mounts, the price of mats drops to almost vendor prices.  
---
Skinning isn't so bad because the vendor price is so high, but its maybe the worst for mage.  Most classes are regening in that skinning time or waiting for a CD to reset, but mage doesn't have many CDs to reset and since you make your own water waiting for regen is terribly slow way to level.  Plus it just fills your bags all the time making you travel more frequently.  Bag space really sucks when you don't have a main that can buy you full 16 slotters.  
---
If you plan on going tailoring or enchanting just keep the mats in your bank, or maybe make a bank alt to hold it.  There isnt anything from crafting that will speed you up more then the time it makes to craft it with maybe the exception of the first wand from enchanting.  
---
@60 I'd go mining and engineering.  Level both to 300.  Get a green lens of frost damage assuming the upgraded dungeon gear isn't out yet.  Farm dungeons for pre-raid gear.  Once you have some blues start farming EPL tyr's hand and/or WPL hearthglen for gold and arcane crystals.  Once you get to 900g buy the epic mount, then drop mining, and level tailoring with the cloth you've been banking.  Go for robes of archmage, keep tailoring for ZG set when it comes out.  
---
If you pvp only and don't pve, maybe skip tailoring and just keep mining so you can farm some while out world pvping.
---
Wow this is incredible looking. Out of curiosity do you have a version of this without the levels listed? I run a DND game that takes place in Azeroth during the vanilla wow time period and this map looks super clean.
---
Wanna do one for your horde friend too? Lol
---
This and Borderlands 3. Well, at least until they said Epic store exclusive. Now i prettu much forgot about it. So ya, Classic WoW for sure.
---
google drakedog videos
---
searing pain is also not bad
---
This is why I think that rolling need should soulbind boes to you instantly. 
---
That way if you actually need a boe you roll need and no-one can ninja it as they won't be able to sell it. 
---
If no-one needs then every greed rolls for the potential gold.
---
U can't go full destro, not enough points. Ull run succubus to seduce ennemy target and cast soulfire+immo, then lots of immo/searing pain. No SB because cast is too long, u only use it on nightfall procs
---
I have some thoughts, but it all depends on what the friends do!
---
Also lots of people would say they needed it, and then just sell it.
---
Our rule was if you wanted a BoE drop, you had to wear it, and you had to not have an epic there already iirc.
---
Ive told my wife that Ill be driving her, the kids and the cats to her parentes for a week.. üòá
---
I would only follow this logic with friends/guildees.
---
If I'm running with randos in a pug, BoE items/materials are free roll since it has value for everyone.
---
OMG this is amazing! i'am going to save this vote
---
Not really, most of the gear that you craft isn't very good.  It takes more time to craft it then you will save in leveling speed.  The few items that are ok, you should just be able to find a tailor to make them for you buying giving them your excess cloth.
---
*woah*
---
maybe BoW in there, yea... this can go on for awhile. lol
---
Quality work, thank you for doing this!
---
In my experience in classic, (not pserver), Mages can farm nonstop due to things like conjured water/food. Good CC, high survivability in PvE, super strong in PvP. Hunters are good too - just use aspects/pets to keep rolling. Even better survivability, a little less CC, very strong in PvP if played right. Rogues are amazing in PvP, good in 1v1 PvE, but mostly vanish and run away if they get too many adds. Reset the fight and pick your battles - preferably a mage almost oom and half health - and then giggle because you are l33t.
---
Warriors are a fun, good class. But AoE farming is kinda difficult solo. You need a healer along with you. It‚Äôs best to buy a ton of food, and pick your battles. Open world PvP you‚Äôre kind of just a sitting duck unless you strike first, so learn to attack anything that moves.
---
If you wanna split profits, aoe on your warrior with a healer. Other than that, mages have it easier aoe farming or leveling. A lot of waiting for mobs to respawn, but I find that better than constantly attacking like a hunter.
---
tbh the sub is shared so numbers wise as far as blizzard is concerned classic players are retail players and vice versa
---
Yes but it wouldn‚Äôt be very activisuon-blizzard like to take the proven and successful business model over something new and shittier
---
It's the case in live. It was the case when I started playing (late Vanilla) and it will almost certainly be the case when classic comes out. There is a reason it's always like that in private servers.
---
Rolling on gear outside of the specc you are using this run is considered ninja outside of a prior agreement.
---
i'll hit you up!
---
Yep they had PVE (it was called Normal back then) and PVP, then they had RP which were also PVE. This page has a picture: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Realm
---
Lol
---
Fantastic
---
best combo is bubble then demonic rune afterward.  free mana pot as you don't take damage during bubble.  Unless thats only a pserver thing...
---
WoW still exists only because of sunk cost fallacy. Players that invested hundreds of hours into the game are very unlikely to leave even if game becomes shit.
---
And btw, playerbase changed BECAUSE WoW changed, not the other way around. Millions of people quit between WotLK and Cata BECAUSE of changes made to the game. Much much more than sub drop indicated because a lot of new players replaced them. 
---
You also have no way of knowing what "new players" are looking for. You can only know what they will find. You can easily find a lot of new players saying how they enjoy current WoW. Too bad we can't hear those who try it and quit almost immediately because they dont like it.
---
The dude was a bro. He charged no interest.
---
For anyone looking this is an edit of SnoxxtheFox's map.
---
Whole guild comming to 39s bracket here! about 15ppl already in :) that will be the end game for us  
---
Not sure if we all want to spend grind to 60s so maybe only a few to farm for community and others will sit on 39s as main + alt 29 probably too   
---
CANT  
---
FCKIN  
---
WAITTTT
---
Yeah, it was pretty serious last game lol. It's been a good series.
---
Um... all of them? 
---
I mean, part of the game is doing the adventure yourself and discovering everything you can.
---
ps: reserving the "STVIetnam Again" guildname on realms :P
---
Thats how Ive been playing PvP in the last few expansions of wow.  Playing as a tank spec and just trying to be annoying as possible.  Lets me use my Thunderfury without feeling too bad about it, as well.
---
I just straight up told my wife that I want her and the kid out of the house for like a week so I can binge WoW Classic.
---
She's looking for places to go on holiday. Any suggestions for the UK (spawnling has no passport)?
---
Imagine that poor fucker, asking where Mankrik's wife was and no-one has any clue.
---
Holy shit that's how the joke started :o
---
Lmao you had to ML the horseman mount?  That shit was soloable iirc
---
Thanks for the video, I started with a tauren druid way back right before tbc came out, now I've decided to roll another one and actually try to do some raids this time around... video was great!
---
it's especially funny watching 2 opposing faction players trying to kill you. i mean they do it eventually, but i just find it funny how long it takes them.
---
So live strat for every caster really hurts my righteous orb farm.
---
How would you rate them vs Mage? 
---
I think hunter and mage are fun but I feel like as a main, the mage might get a bit boring possibly... I play somewhat casually and not really focused on end game raiding. I like flavorful classes. My main from WOTLK and on is a druid which I love as well, but I've read they're a little weird in vanilla? 
---
But my main goal is: good main, great/fun/rewarding pvp, decent pve, fun flavor and leveling.
---
That was fantastic. Also, it's crazy seeing the date listed as 9/6/05. Almost 14 years ago.
---
Theme park mmo's all have this problem. It's more about our on demand society than it is about the social aspect. More players equals more people wanting different things in their own vacuum without having to grind totally different aspects of the game.
---
Gravestone Scepter from the BFD quest replaces the GMW pretty easily.
---
Getting Robe of Power in the mid 30s.
---
Other than that, you may as well just bank all your cloth till you hit 60 and keep skinning to give you extra gold.
---
haha. that's awesome
---
yeah I got the original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/am6owg/labeled_classic_wow_map/
---
Missing Thorium point? Or was that place not in vanilla?
---
if you are planing on PvP, you NEED engi
---
we should form an all pally guild. lol
---
&gt; **Did I make any mistakes?** 
---
Having a friend on Alliance. Gross.
---
I remember an Alliance 39 Nelf druid causing insane mischief in Warsong, not sure what build they were but they would throw a rejuvenation on themselves and moonfire people to death. Thinking it was a mix of balance and Resto...person's name was tort something on the firetree battlegroup...he would take on 5 people at once and still come out on top 
---
Maybe I'll try something similar
---
Plot twist: stolen account.
---
On the private I recently used to play it was common to lock some items, but if said item dropped, the person who locked it usually gave out gold rolls. Never saw a raid with locks without gold rolls be filled. A common one was 1x25k for kael mount (tbc) or 5x1k for vashj belt.
---
Other than that the server has established "only-rolls" as a common loot system for pugs. I personally liked this a lot and will be using it on my classic pugs too.
---
The basic idea of "onlys" is that you may set your "only" on one specific item. You may then /roll 101 on that item, but in return just /roll 99 on all other items. However, if you decided to not set an "only", you may /roll 100 on main gear and /roll 99 on 2nd gear instead. 
---
101 rolls always beat 100 rolls (standard) and 100 beats 99. So even if someone rolls a 1 with 101, he still beats a 70 roll from /roll 100 and so on. 
---
Also some items (usually BiS stuff), were reserved as "last item only". Meaning you may just set your "only" on this item if it's literally the last upgrade in this raid for you. 
---
I always felt like this system was very fair to both, over and undergeared players. Those who did not set an "only" usually got a lot more items, because they could roll 100 on everything and thus always beat out the only rolls (who were limited to 99 on non-only items). While those who were just missing that 1 item wouldn't get frustrated by some slacker getting it. 
---
It was also very flexible, as in you, as the RL, being able to set different requirements to "onlys". As for Hyjal/BT pugs it was usually something like 4xT6 minimum in order to set onlys. Or max 2-3 items missing from the instance and so on. I really liked that because it felt like you were rewarded according to your contribution to the raid. (Onlys were usually also coupled with performance. If someone failed multiple times I often removed their only. Forcing them to /roll 100 on their item.)
---
I hope that WoW classic leads to WoW2. Ideally it kill retail, Blizzard can realize their mistake, also realizing they can't just add new content to classic so they need to build a whole new game.
---
Healer vs Pure DPS vs Support DPS. :)
---
Using this as my new wallpaper.  Thanks!
---
I live in oce area we are one of the last people to get a server so I assumed most places would have better then 200ms by now no need to get on the defensive just asking a question about why you have 200ms
---
Okay, lets get some good footage in here so we can cure the brain cancer this video just gave us
---
[https://youtu.be/LftVFbJ4iO8](https://youtu.be/LftVFbJ4iO8)
---
I actually have no idea what he is talking about; if anything those differences are reversed, especially as it pertains to PvP (due to WotF on all Undead). Horde Warlocks are better, but Ally Warlocks are probably more in-demand for raiding since there are less of them on that faction.
---
I don't think you know what a loan shark is.

Worth every damn penny.

I'm beyond hyped for Classic, but there's no way you'll catch me seriously arguing that there is "no way" that Classic can't be bigger.
---
This is what I wanted to try, or a 39 Ret Pally.  Pendulum of Doom either way.
---
Not only that, but I have shown with actual evidence, that there were some really OP items pre 1.4/1.7 that were rebalanced.  They whine about the Blue 60 set getting blue'd and some defense, when there was level 40 greens that were better.
---
Was there a struggle continuing 40 man raids? I noticed they started to move away from it. Molten Core, BWL were some of my favourite times of my life!
---
I will be laughing my ass off every day at people using wrong info and pserver experience.
---
it is not if you sort out all the gear on 27/37 levels and open all walk paths you want in advance for wpvp etc :)
---
Expensive as all hell as I remember it but so fun. Especially shaman with ghost wolf to run people down
---
Blame blizzard for not making the book bind on pickup, it's worth hundreds of gold and if it's not reserved you can't really expect pugs to just pass on it for you. I have alchemy but wouldn't expect those without it to pass on flask of titans recipe or something.
---
How thicc is it?
---
Learn to use Discord. Its the new Vent. Guilds meet and can post info and do voice chat
---
hahaha why's that
---
Most pservers use the 3.0 client, and some recently got a hold of a 2.3 client iirc.
---
You don't know what you are talking about.
---
Hi, /u/2soonexecutus
---
29 was always my jam. Had all classes, but enjoyed rogue and hunter the most.
---
I dont understand any kind of argument against this, it would be like wanting auto run removed, it's a choice and in no way what so ever affects game play. You want to click on EVERY. SINGLE. STUPID. FUCKING GREY ITEM? Do it, no ones stopping you!
---
Same for PvE players.
---
I fucking love battlegrounds, but when im in the open world im honestly just trying to level/farm/get shit done, and ganking is just a hassle, nothing more. We enjoy doing what we want, when we choose to do so.
---
'War' can be found in those BG's, it's fine.
---
Haha this story is great. I had a similar experience (mage in Beta, Paladin randomly in Classic). Played thru Ony to Naxx totally regretting my class but living with it. Switched in TBC
---
Death wing global warming
---
Did you know Tseric?  The situation that lead to him "pursuing other opportunities" is something that still comes up from time to time.  Were you around for that event?
---
OK cool I will look at these videos now
---
Oh she does. Just different games. I dont think she would like wow. I might try to get her to play.
---
It really shouldnt be confusing. In order to prevent "QOL-Creep" most of the community goes by a simple rule. No changes. If it wasnt in Vanilla, we dont want it in Classic. The second you start making exceptions for little stuff like "Autoloot because its purely convenience" like you said, a line forms behind you with people saying the same damn thing for Graphical Changes, Guild Banks, Sparkling Quest Objectives, Summoning Stones, and yes... even AOE loot.
---
People asked for Vanilla WoW as it was back then with as few exceptions as possible. So... yeah.. Just hold shift to loot, its not going to kill you.
---
Indeed it has! Let‚Äôs just hope both sides can keep it cool and avoid injuries!
---
These are Brilliant thank you!
---
Do you really think there will be a lot of new players? I feel like only people who played before wrath will play classic
---
I'm aware and its awesome. My plan was to skip all the dungeons except Wailing Caverns and Scarlet Monastery. The quest rewards from Wailing caverns are too goo to not find a group. Blue Crescent Staff, green Gloves, 10 slot bag, and green shoulders. That is not counting drop loot. Scarlet Monastery has the Hypnotic Blade and Prophetic Cane combo to last to 60. I'm still trying to find a balance on leveling speed because I'm want to farm some other areas before anyone else.
---
You don't tell her. Here's the steps you take. 
---
1) Go to the store, buy an air mattress for casual sleeps
---
2) If you don't have an office space to yourself. While shes out running around you move EVERYTHING out of a room in the house and move computer equipment in.
---
3) Go to lowes and buy one of those combo electric door locks
---
4) Install door lock on newly acquired office door
---
5) Play forever, never leave your office. 
---
Some may say "Well, Boosh there's a flaw in your plan, what about food or going to the bathroom?" Don't worry there isn't a flaw in my plan. 
---
Food: Order take out and in special instructions say "Deliver to bedroom window #2, DO NOT KNOCK ON DOOR" 
---
Bathroom:  We bring back the poop socks. When the smell gets too bad you wait until late at night and throw them across the street into your neighbors yard. If you run out of socks... God speed
---
Once no-life is semi complete and you are allowed to take a couple minute break, you unlock the door and deal with your wife and responsibilities. Don't worry though, that's for future you to figure out. Past you just had a shit load of fun in classic wow. #worthit
---
Srsly, he doesn't need his own account. 
---
Make one character and play together with that one character. 
---
Like we did it back in the day.
---
somewhere there, more added later. also missing the 2 NPC quests below + the Shitter quest line.
---
Oh not enough points because I need stuff in the affliction tree I assume?
---
Ok i see what you mean about the succubus. Does immolate or searing pain cause nightfall to happen? I only see corruption as the cause for nightfall to proc.
---
Nice yea I seem to recall the name, probably from pickup raid groups we ran in Wrath.
---
Dont know him
---
Warlock.. too much like shadow priest except a crap version, ugly pets. 
---
Mage.. one spell spammers never looked interesting. (Imo only, many of my most skilled friends played mage and loved it!)
---
Druid.. Forms are ugly and I like looking at my pretty characters.
---
Druids. People say they‚Äôre a jack of all trades, but not really. I‚Äôd rather master one role than be garbage at all of them. They do have some great utility though, but it doesn‚Äôt really compensate for how underwhelming all their specs are.
---
LOL but fuck off doesnt get removed and all I said was maybe the truth wont hurt when your older. Amazing mods good job!
---
Yeah sure except that it's not like I can't do battle grounds and all that stuff too it's just weak sauce playing on PVE server
---
Keep yer feet on the ground.
---
Some people have to be against and hate something.
---
I like to watch his vids. Its about classic afterall.
---
If the serrar book drops in a pug and it's not reserved you'd be a fool to pass on it. It's like passing on flask of titans recipe because you don't have alchemy. Items that are worth hundreds of gold are free game unless reserved in advance.
---
Ok good point, I will try to get engi for sure
---
I met a troll rogue in the barrens who had fancy engineer glasses. I had never seen a helmet before, so I asked him how he got it. He then told me that he crafted it himself and offered me that he could build one for me aswell. So we grouped up and searched the barrens for the required materials. About an hour later we had everything and I was super excited. Well... turns out you need engineering skill to wear that shit. We laughed our asses off and were friends since then.
---
Low effort troll gtfo.
---

Vanilla
---
Yeah blizzard having some old items with 1.12 stats is gonna be weird, really without full progressive itemization most of early vanilla content gets fucked
---
You didn't get experience from BGs in classic. This became a thing in Cara.
---
Eh, I can live without sexy times...
---
Ok, I'm gonna take the time here, and say thank you.
---
I'm a lifelong Horde (Vanilla beta to bfa) who's going alliance in Classic to try and get as fresh and experience as possible. My main concern was the zones and leveling. I know how good horde leveling is and which zones I like, but had no idea of where any camps or quest hubs were as an Ally. Whilst I was prepared to just 'find out' I was not looking forward to all the great zones I would miss, or being stuck to the southern half of the eastern kingdoms.
---
Your map shows the quests hubs and camps for the alliance and as such, has shown me that I can (and now will) quest in a great number of areas I thought were Horde only.
---
As I look at this map I find nostalgic memories of alliance camps I once raided, and I cannot wait to see what certain areas feel like form 'the other side'.
---
I'm now going to plan a rough leveling route where I put down all the zones I wish to see as an Alliance and at which level. Whilst it will no doubt still change and be a huge random adventure, at least I know I'm not limited and I won't miss anything I want to see.
---
Huge thanks from a horde guy who knows very little of the alliance side.
---
Who?
---
This is why you don't get a gf/wife in the first place
---
Look at Mr Responsible over here!
---
Meanwhile I was running around in ghost wolf well past 40 :p
---
If you are serious, he is very very ignorant of most classic content. He himself has stated hes never gotten a maxed character in vanilla (or pservers). He says stupid shit like "Why is the Undead not using will of the forsaken to break out of polymorph" things that are just blatantly showing how he doesn't know the ins and outs of vanilla. He makes videos purely for money or exposure and adds nothing of value to the information he presents. He isn't bright, and spreads misinformation, ergo not a good addition to the community.
---
You look stupid my dreadsteed was huge and looked like it was running in slow motion and my stupid beard bled through every damn helmet

My playlist LUL. My taste of music literally comes from classic/tbc pvp videos.
---
BFD has that staff that has a pretty good drop chance and a gauranteed 29 dps wand that you could get in your low 20s that would bridge the gap to the wand you're trying to get at 40
---
All of those criticisms could be said of PVP gear, and that releases in phase two. Compare the rank 12 rewards to bloodvine. Same slots, Bloodvine gives 83 damage, 35 int, 4 hit, and 2 crit. Mage General set gives 84 damage, 97 stamina, 51 int, 22 spirit, 1 hit, 2 crit, and a better blink cooldown. So during the phase when MC and Ony are on farm and raiders have nothing else to do, they'll be setting up HWL-factories and getting PVP gear to trivialize BWL. I don't see how releasing ZG at the same time as BWL can be worse than that.
---
Running from an argument nah i just don‚Äôt see the point in going in circles. You can‚Äôt separate an online event from a real world event, you‚Äôre also still getting triggered from a video over 10 years ago. You‚Äôre the sort of person that cries griefing when you roll on a pvp server and get camped at neswingwary‚Äôs.
---
I did this on my tanking Druid, I would get jumped by a rogue, my armor and health would out last his initial stun locks. I'd tuaren stomp, throw a HOT, shift back into bear form and frenzied rejuv, maybe faerie fire him. I'd wait till about a quarter health, bash, cheetah my ass a 20-30 yards away throw major heals and start the entire process over.              
---
              
---
Sometimes he would interrupt me with Blind or Kidney Shot and get me, sometimes he would get bored and fuck off and a few times I'd last till backup stumbled on us or he would screw up and aggro a mob but at the end of the day I know one thing he wouldnt do and that was camp because who the fuck wants to deal with all that bullshit when juicy mages and priests are running around out there.
---
and you also dont really need tailoring until ZG. i would go with Skinning/Mining while leveling, Drop it for Engi/Herb then drop Herb for Tailoring when ZG comes.  
---
That way you have money while leveling, and be able to farm mats for pots and stuff needed for PVE and PVP.
---
No. Its not bannable to not pay back money someone gives you (I say give, because there's no such thing as a loan withing the games mechanics)
---
Well he's a desperate content creator/*influencer*, and a private server neckbeard. So yeah, it's not that hard to understand is it?
---
Only corruption procs nightfall
---
That's some expensive beer mate. I get miller high life for a $1.50
---
Thank you for the info. I played late classic I was probably late level 20 when BC came out so I didn‚Äôt play much of classic. I found his videos informative but didn‚Äôt know he was wrong on his stuff.
---
Why do the other classic players/content creators make videos with him like classic cast?
---
I‚Äôm not trolling.
---
Ye u go 20/0/31 to get both NF and conflagration
---
A true no changes fan right here. Mum jokes must v√™ included
---
What did he say ?
---
MMMMMMM ISHNU‚ÄôALAAAAH
---
He makes YouTube videos about classic wow.
---
I don't believe I ever met Tseric.  If I did, I didn't connect the person to the role within the company.
---
If I recall correctly the community managers were in the Dev building, and I don't recall ever knowing about any of them operating where the GMs were working.
---
Illegal gambling lol.
---
Its fake virtual money inside a computer game. If people want to throw it away on gambling why not lol.
---
He‚Äôs a YouTube creator making classic videos.
---
Well maybe consider running a free 1-20 lvl account on retail wow and level in all the areas to show him the beatu of WoW :) or buy a real lego and let his creativity flow for life!

naxxramas the movie. Gives me chills everytime

How it would work is that you'd first have to get some starting capitol, at least 2k. Then you advertise in trade that you are offering loans for mounts and such at a reasonable 2% interest. 
---
Once someone takes your money you give them 1 week to pay you back, depends on the amount that would either be easy or impossible for the loanee. Then once the deadline approaches you announce that you you are increasing the price due to principle. They tell you to fuck off, what else can you do to them? Report them to Blizzard haha... Well, here's when your buddies in the opposite faction come in to play:
---
They doggedly follow and harass the loanee, ganking them everywhere they go and camping their corpse for hours until then log off. Eventually they will get so sick of it they either pay up give up and quit the character. Either way its a good outcome for you because people will talk "Did you hear about X? He couldn't pay his loan and got viciously ganked, now I don't see him around." People will know not to mess with you.
---
And if the person who got ganked off the server complains to Blizzard, what evidence does he have? That some Horde/Alliance ganked him too much? Yeah that sucks but it's not against the TOS. And how does he know the Horde/Alliance colluded with the opposite faction? There was no evidence in any in-game chat logs.
---
Though of course once word starts to spread that you play dirty like that nobody would want to accept a loan from you. But that's when you simply stop advertising on that character, wait a few months then start again on a fresh character.
---
FOR THE WHORES!
---
checks out.
---
Funny way to spell troll.
---
If you think what's popular on twitch isnt relevant than you are so out of touch with reality in this current day and age..  I see your so hung up on the under 21. I never blamed them for anything you are making shit up now. You are literally making shit up its great! All I said was I think its fair to presume the younger generations want instant gratification, you literally are going on your own made up tangent. Get help
---
Considering people are spending hundreds of dollars buying gold on private servers still even though they know for sure the server will disappear in just a few months makes me think the market for gold in Vanilla is just too bottomless for this not to be a thing.
---
What is pay to win?
---
Ya its a good dungeon. I definitely wand to drop a staff and go for the blade combo. I also want to use herbalism and skinning in Wailing Caverns and farm cloth in Scarlet Monastery for my bank alt tailor.
---
oy vey shut it down
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Classic will always have its loyal followers. It will never get "stale" there will be playing on these servers until the day they get turned off. 
---
People have been talking about this since classic was announced. Just another repeat thread =)
---
[Cry some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfrTAt_m1po)
---
I would eventually also want a progression server with the option of copying your character from Classic over however they should also leave the Vanilla server up as well and just leave it as an option for you to carry over your character to another progression server. Is it possible? Sure. Is it guaranteed? No. It all depends on how successful classic ends up being and how much effort/money it would cost Blizzard to do so.
---
:'(
---
Yeah, proper day/night cycle would be awesome.
---
You can put out great numbers as a 2h fury warrior as well. You don't have to dual wield exclusively. I'm not sure how well that translates into anything past BWL though because my guild lost it's 2h warrior at that point.
---
Amazing work!
---
Increases suspense. Monday they will announce Beta is going live on Tuesday. Not really. This is just a joke. Don't cut off my pee pee please.
---
Haha oh man, my long lost love the 40 man.  Can't really say much as an employee as I wasn't in on any of these conversations, but this is the common thread that came up everywhere I went when I spoke with WoW players.
---
It was really hard filling a 40 man raids consistently.  I think a lot of guilds fell victim over time to starting late because 30-35 people showed up and as more of the core players dropped off it became more of a problem.  Then factor in realm transfers and if your situation slowed down one place you could move somewhere else that was moving at your speed.
---
If I had to make my best guess, a lot of research went into finding what the "sweet spot" was for raids with a lot of people, but not so many it became hard to muster that many people.  A huge issue that kept coming up in my guild as we progressed further was that it was hard finding 40 people as good as our best 25, and that seemed to be the case for a lot of groups as progression went on.
---
Having some loyal followers =/= it wont get stale. Eventually they will lose a lot of the playerbase and Blizz will either have to try and get them to move to retail or do something like a TBC server to keep them.
---
That‚Äòs far-fetched because getting rank 12 rewards is extremely hard work. Talking about rank 14 rewards is completely pointless bcuz only a few people per server will get them until BWL releases. HWL-factories during phase2 when no BGs are out is impossible because honor gain is completely random in Wpvp how do you want to coordinate that?
---
Tailoring takes a bit to get to 300 so I don't really feel like dropping it before getting better than Bloodvine. Skinning however is very easy to drop whenever and pick up at a later point. 1-300 is very fast and not to mention, free.
---
That was a wild wild, my chinba
---
Go look at Project1999 the Everquest server that has had a BOOOOOOOOMING population since 2010. We got a long time before it gets stale =)
---
If they do it, I'm sure that's how they would do it. However, it would risk diluting their playerbase and resources.
---
If you're a sword user, there's a quest chain involving the Razorfen dungeons that gives a pretty nice sword, and if you're not a sword user I think it sells for a gold or two.
---
wat is a chinba
---
I remember in vanilla for some reason someone had sent me like 240g through mail which was odd because i didnt know or play with anyone that had this amount of gold to give away but i was about level 20 and my brother had just hit 40 so i loaned him some gold for it... never got it back.
---
Any good /accurate resource you can direct me to to learn more?
---
Again, a single server of dedicated players is not the same as not going stale for the majority of players.
---
It‚Äôs been a point of speculation, but I see maybe a split down the road depending on the success of Classic. Possibly opening up TBC servers and allowing transfers so characters can migrate or stay in Classic if they so choose.  
---
Personally I was an OG Vanilla player but really hit my stride during TBC as far as raids, PvP(arenas), etc. Plus Kara was just a damned awesome raid. I also love Blood Elves as a race so I‚Äôll go as far to say I‚Äôm biased.  The #nochange crowd seems to be pretty against TBC/Lich drops but personally I wouldn‚Äôt mind. 
---
The real issue is if Blizzard does drop TBC and it‚Äôs a success, then Lich and it‚Äôs a hit...where does it stop?  Are we going to just repeat the same game over and over?  That‚Äôs a question I don‚Äôt really have an answer to.
---
Ain't no Mongoose Bite at this level range for Hunters though. I think you meant Raptor Strike :)
---
From what i gather you really dont want to use mortal strike in raids ever. As it has a fairly high priority as a debuff (above dots and item procs)
---
Given a reasonable raid composition for debuffs you got:
---
2-3 mandatory curses (tongues in certain situations?)
---
imp shadowbolt
---
sunder
---
thunderclap
---
shadow weaving
---
faerie fire
---
hunters mark
---
That's 8-9 debuffs, or half your raids total debuff slots on mandatory effects.
---
Then you got 7-8 slots remaining,
---
You want your warlocks to have nightfall procs if you can, so thats 1 corruption per warlock. (minimum 2-3 since they will be in the raid for cursing)
---
warlocks that dont use mandatory curses, could benefit from using curse of doom, that's another debuff slot per warlock in the raid after the first 2-3 mandatory warlocks.
---
Hunters might want to serpent sting at low gear levels, 
---
but at this point we're already reaching a critical amount of debuffs 12/16
---
if you also want thunderfury and other low priority proc effects to show up ever.
---
Might be too late to the party but I will submit mine.
---
When I first started playing I was 10 and awful at the game. Leveling took me forever so I asked my guild mates for advice on how to level faster. Someone mentioned that I should log off in a major city to gain rested experience. My 10 year old brain did some wild gymnastics and responded with, "But I live in Denver so I am always logging off in a major city!" 
---
Still look back on that and laugh.
---
Which equipment pieces (including weapons) do you think were kept the most amount of levels?
---
Gravestone Scepter?
---
Whirlwind Axe?
---
Herod's Shoulder?
---
Shadowweave Set?
---
Seal of Sylvanas?
---
Country? City? Time? Shift? Security holes?
---
Psh, New Yorkers aren't a race.
---
I loved vanilla, but I might have loved TBC more. I think itd be super interesting to see Blizz treat this almost like an alternate timeline and see what they would do from vanilla on given the information they know now.
---
You don't spam hots in vanilla, they just aren't manna efficient. You are usually spamming 2 different ranks of healing touch or using regrowth for a burst heal and hot in emergencies.
---
Yep soloing in Everquest from launch to Velious was the exception. Only a few classes (mainly casters) could solo efficiently unless they were twinked. There were mechanics put in place to incentivize grouping. Pet classes for example had to do more than 50% of the damage to a mob than their pet or they would only get half the experience.
---
I always loved the idea of a warrior but they're boring as shit.
---
I think it's very likely we will see legacy TBC, WoTLK and maybe beyond. As much as I love the idea of adding new content to vanilla, I see proceeding to TBC as the obvious choice for blizzard since it requires the absolute minimum in investment and development. I would hope that they keep standalone servers for each expansion if they go that route though.
---
Strongly leaning towards a Tauren Warrior. Mulgore is so tranquil
---
Hard disagree with basically everything you said, and as advice, before runs you're going to want to communicate with your groups about this when you're pugging at higher levels, since a lot of other people will disagree with you too.
---
&gt;its ninjalooting and its private server mentality.
---
Lol, come on.  Everyone needing on boe drops unless other loot rules were discussed and agreed upon before the run was a very common thing 14 years ago.  This is the first time I've seen someone say that something is "private server mentality" just because they don't like it and I'm already over it.
---
I don't think your numbers are at all in the realm of possibility.
---
&gt;Let's start with Vanilla Veterans.....Now, this is the group that is going to have a higher percentage of returning than the others. I'd say a 50% return rate? So, 4 million players from that group alone returning.
---
I'd argue that conservatively, 50% of Vanilla Veterans are even aware Classic is a thing. Of those, I'd say 25% will initially give it a try. 1 million.
---
&gt;Next we have WoW Veterans.....Let's say 25% of this group returns and we are left with 1 million returning.
---
I don't disagree. That's 2 million total.
---
&gt;Bring on the Newbies!..... What's the number on this, we really don't know. Let's say 1 million? Why not.
---
This is a hard one to gauge, so I'll go with 1 million, though I think this group will ultimately be the quickest and largest group to quit. 3 million total
---
&gt;Newbies that watch streamers.... 5 million? 10 million? 15+ million?
---
I don't see streamers doing anything for Classic. Streaming killing 10 boars in Redridge? Good luck. Let's say the most popular streamer gets the highest views running around in raid purps or BG blues, wrecking people. Awesome! Newbies want to do that! Sign 'em up! Oh wait, they can't instantly walk in to any relevant content to their streamer. In fact, they have an arduous task ahead of them that they had no idea going in. I'd say there will be well below 1 million around release from streaming, and I don't see how it could ever break much over 5 million later on, even best case scenario.
---
So in my mind, at release, it is likely there will be under 4 million total. If they ALL stick around, that would still be pretty underwhelming. I think there is certainly a case for Classic to exist and I'm glad it will, but these delusions of grandeur are part of the reason this community is seen as a bit of a joke.
---
What???
---
Easy answer, they will keep producing content for current wow and hope to bring back players. If classic has a huge impact on that, hopefully they look into slowly bringing it back to the classic play style. 
---
They'll probably make progression servers later on. Like its pretty straight forward, if classic makes them money and it was worth re-creating, they will try and re-create TBC to see if that does just as well. If it does, theyll go to wrath more than likely. 
---
As much as I'd like to see an alternate timeline, I doubt they'd do that. You're getting into a realm of even more haters than BFA has right now if you screw something up or take something in the wrong direction. 
---
But again this is all speculation, nobody knows until Classic is launched. They'll probably announce it Blizzcon of 2020 if they're going to do anything additional to classic.
---
Discord, you need the text channels for moderation, classlead stuff, mdps rdps healer chats, guild announcements, raid assignment sheets, and so much more
---
If you are genuinely a fully grown adult, you are literally the most immature adult that I have met in a *very* long time. How about you stop trying to insult the people who tell you that you're wrong and address the points. 
---
You *did*, absolutely, say that they can't handle things that require patience. You did that. 
---
&gt;Anyone under 21 wont be able to handle classics slow paced progress. It will take time to get anything done. New generations are accustomed to instant satisfaction.
---
That was you. Verbatim. 
---
You then defended it...and just repeated it. You must either be confused, or I imagined it *so well* that it changed your post as if you *actually* said it.
---
try harder
---
If they keep standalone servers they would be reducing the pool of potential players for the new project. It might work for TBC or something, but I cant imagine they'd ever consider doing more than that while maintaining standalones
---
Look at the side bar ------&gt;
---
The only place you could risk getting XP in a BG was AV because of all the extra mobs.
---
Probably, but considering wow classic is a much less computer intensive game, they might be looking for people who use shittier computers to see how it runs. Who knows, though.
---
My favorite was the Jir and Enitsu videos the first one is the reason I respecced and tried out blastwave never the same again after that.
---
Vanilla probably won't eat into live that much, being so drastically different at its core. It excels at its strengths as a 'traditional MMORPG' but it doesn't have what retail players want from Wow. If and when they release BC servers though, that's when retail Wow's days are numbered. Not because of BC, which is admittedly a bit niche, but because that'd confirm we'll inevitably end up with Wrath of the Lich King. 
---
That is when half-ass non-content collectathon retail Wow's reckoning will come, when players can waltz into a version of the game vaguely comparable to live, at their leisure and at no extra cost to them, that blows whatever pisstake rehash expansion they're playing at the time straight out of the water in every single facet of content. 
---
I'm not even the biggest fan of Wrath, personally I prefer Burning Crusade in everything besides PvP. But if and when Wrath Classic servers launch, live Wow will completely implode.
---
And what if 5 years from now, classic wow as dwindled to ~2000 online pop and retail is still declining?
---
I damn near burnt out my copy of crisis in my car when I was 17 what a great album that was.
---

I never go out of my way to gank anyone that doesn‚Äôt give honor.  Or is fighting something, I want that good duel.  Hunters and Warlocks rarely follow this line of honor I‚Äôve found.
---
During the whole Serenity Now funeral crashing event, what was talked about in office related to it, if anything?
---

Why does there need to be a lore explanation for what‚Äôs essentially a remaster of the original game?
---
 I'm confused, what are you trying to accomplish? The day/night cycle has been real life timezone based forever.

I thought we had already established this is an alternate universe that the gnomes got us into by using the time comobobulator thingy
---
Some people have fuck buddies, he's got a gank buddy now.
---
Definitely, but 13-year-old didn‚Äôt know the difference. Lol
---
This is something that FFXI did better than any game I've played. There were items in that game that were BiS for like 50 levels.
---
Well to be fair you can't expect a game to keep people playing forever. Also people left along the way all the time, nothing to be surprised about i guess. More people joined in vanilla BC &amp; wotlk than left, that's it.
---
And although i somewhat disagree with changes leading to a change in playerbase, i was more thinking about long term playerbase changes, like how some of the players are currently outraged for things which were seemingly accepted back then.
---
Not all people today aren't looking forward vanilla design. I'd say most don't but that's just how i see it. 
---
At the end of the day blizzard is a business and its goal is to keep players subbed. 
---
Each of their changes were made with that in mind so it shouldn't be wrong to assume the current situation reflects a part of the current playerbase.
---
Try to make you stop calling people "snowflakes," telling them to "get help," and that their "brain hurts because you tell the truth?"
---
I'm just making an observation. It's ironic that you're sitting here telling someone to "grow up" while acting like a middle school bully.
---
Just do them all. This isn‚Äôt like retail where you‚Äôll level faster than the zone content. 
---
There isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äúmust complete‚Äù list. Just level through the zones and do the dungeons. 
---
I really, and I mean *really* do not understand this min/max mentality. Everyone has become so scared into trying it by the pserver idiots.
---
Obviously then their dev team and the people in charge of dev need to be fired and they need to take the game in a whole different direction. 
---
Having a old version of your game being requested because people think its better is one thing. But if you continue down the path you're going and continue to keep ignoring your player base and have your numbers continue to drop then you're just a fucking idiot.
---

The great box of classicism is an unrelated item to this set
---
i liked tbc waaay more than vanilla 
---
it had all the good stuff about vanilla but i feel they improved on it a great deal
---
def my favourite version of wow
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't it been bound to some universal time exclusively to Warcraft universe for some time now?
---
But that is my point. Many people will see it as stale if there isnt development. The population for classic isnt going to just thrive at a huge scale forever.
---
Wait what.. How does anything I said translate to blaming people under 21 for anything? Does that sentance really mean to you I am blaming them for something?  Saying people under 21 won't be able to handle slow progress is blaming them for something? I am concerned for you. You are so obviously passionate for WoW classic and I see you are projecting, you are getting upset at the thought of classic being unsuccessful because of the younger generations.
---
That meaningful equipment can actually be acquired while leveling?
---
Ahh gotcha. Edited my last thing not to use it. My bad for repeating. I dont think theres a PC way to say that word sooooooooo oops.
---
hopefully not as it removes a lot of skill required in PvP.
---
I will definitely miss the extra tier of talents
---
Please quote for me a single post where I used the word "blame." I'll wait.
---
I wouldn't say I look forward to it. Drama between people of the same faction usually just involves a group of people shit-talking each other back and forth. However when there is drama between alliance and horde guilds or pvp premades, that always spice things up a little (and can be fun). For example I can't wait for guilds to start ambushing each other in BRM on MC/BWL raid days, etc.
---
Ahh I see, he is Horde scum.
---
You luck son of a motherless orc.
---
Oh, I love it. I will definitely be looking forward to making some entitled Fortnite/Retail Kids ragequit. 
---
This game rewards patience; it won‚Äôt be what many new people expect. Drama over who‚Äôs flirting with the 1 chick in the guild will also be hilarious.
---
it came pretty late, so it'll probably be in phase 3 or 4, maybe 5.
---
Haha yeah... From my experience Allys only attack if they outnumber you, heavily outlevel you or you are already fighting multiple mobs/an elite.
---
Good question! I don‚Äôt think I had anything that good back then. LoL Although a guildie bought me a Fiery War Axe and I kept that bad boy forever!
---
I seem to remember having items that I couldn‚Äôt equip yet. Must have been crafted? And counting down levels til I could equip it, then forgetting, because a fair amount of time had past. LoL
---
Oh s*** sorry man. I forgot this is a Christian wow server! üò©
---
That was more semi-auto loot due to the need to use the shift key.

It's a patch you apply to a rom. You can find more information on ngplus.net

Don't forget to ensure that your target is level 25 or below

Oh wow, really! What was max level? I have actually never played a FF game.

I live(love) to hate you.

I will spend my adult life in Classic on the other side of your edginess: female night elf hunter. On the same server as you.

First time my buddy and I ever played, we were running around elwynn forrest having a blast thinking this was the best game ever. Then someone randomly traded me 10 silver out of no where. I felt like I won the lottery and thought I had a whole lot of money. I wouldn‚Äôt share it with my friend.

As a new Forskaen player, a buddy of mine tricked me into running to Scarlet Monastery. Had no idea what hit me when I just fell over dead.

The human /gloat is BiS
---
Maybe I‚Äôm cheap but if they doubled the cost I would just play p-servers to my hearts content.
---
That yogg saron book looks fuckin awesome. Man I miss that content patch
---
It was very similar to the dialogue you may have heard on the WoW forums, in terms of stance on the matter.  Personally after hearing all the sides, the fact the player was a big PvP fan, I fell on the side of PvP on a PvP server, leave it alone.
---
I was off the GM floor by the time that happened, but if I had to make my best guess, there was probably a flood of tickets on the issue when it happened, got spotted in the queue and passed up to the Leads to make a judgement call on.  It wasn't uncommon for a few higher up GMs work through an issue to determine what they felt was best for the players in situations we didn't have a precedent for.
---
My very first character was a mage. Played for about an hour or so and got to level 4 (maybe 6?) to learn fire blast. I was reading it and comparing it to fireball which I already had and it did less damage so I thought ‚Äúwhy would I ever use this instead of fireball? It‚Äôs strictly worse‚Äù.. never realizing it was an instant cast
---
20 Hours a day, everyday week 1.

Chromie explains how we ended up back in Classic in the announcement cinematic. Dragon time magic.

---
My man!
---
&gt;I have no number avaible but there could very well be more subs today than there was during TBC or vanilla.
---
Then why didn't you spend five minutes googling it?
---
The subscriber count of WoW has dropped drastically.
---
Vanilla and TBC saw WoW breaking 11 million. Now, in BFA it is below 2 million.
---
Im surprised how quiet they are if the beta is starting any time soon
---
blizzard is a hype and marketing machine im surprised they dont want to hype it already
---
Retail had an update recently i think maybe they are worried for some reason about that
---
Well, we can be seen as the crazy ones. Like I said, I‚Äôll be there so that‚Äôs one.
---
Just don‚Äôt be surprised if this thing explodes. Much crazier shit has happened in the gaming community.
---
Max level was 50 originally, then 75, and now it is 99. Items like that were very expensive or hard to get. Another awesome thing is that most of the items could be sold on the AH even after being worn. It made money far more valuable than it ever was in WoW. Could be a good or bad thing.
---
" "under 21" people you blame" That is a quote from your comment above. I am concerned for you
---
I usually work on professions when I'm burnt out on leveling.
---
Source is friend that works for blizzard in the WoW division.
---
Dude.. every quest is a must. There legitametly aren't enough quests to get you to 60 naturally.
---
Western Plaguelands quest hub and FP are further down the road southeast I believe.
---
I seem to recall azshara quest hub and FP being just across the bridge from Ashenvale to the south, but not entirely certain.
---
Burning Steppes quest hub is to the right of the road and wasn't there a FP there?
---
I'm pretty sure it was end of WotLK because I remember there being an exp toggle before Cata dropped

---
I have a death knight friend that I did arena with.. hasn't logged on since cataclysm released. Where are you?
---
Yeah from that description, it sounds like having the SM/Ruin locks (of which you'll want at least 1 for blood pact, no?) put up corruption would be beneficial for the added dps and nightfall procs.
---
Yeah it was the cata pre-patch iirc
---
Thanks man, that means a lot to me :) You're the first to say that, but who knows if I'll get more fans in the future who share your thinking! :)
---
Except that isn't a quote at all. It's literally you just making shit up, which is WHY you cannot quote it.
---
Yeah they probably just dont want to take away from the 8.2 hype.
---
The only things I can see not making classic a complete success would be how they handle sharding, they still have only given us their "idea" of how it will be put into classic; do not forget they did say it is their greatest asset in terms of server stability.
---
And to add onto server stability retail servers are complete garbage every do a world boss with 30+ people around?  You can hope for something but do not hold your breath these are going to be the same servers running classic that retail uses.  2-3 raids of people in world pvp will crash the current servers.
---
Either way I am super into playing classic but I have to be a realist when it comes to server stability and how Blizzard has handled them so far; retail is a joke compared to servers from 10 years ago.

No. Just something that lasts that long. You have nothing else to loot forward to for soooo long.

Wow was designed that way for a reason. Maybe 10 or 15 levels at beat before you start getting random greens that are better

See this is where you are wrong. You should not try and chase a more mobile class, you should force them to close on you. Bubble and run to a house if you have to, use bof, use your stuns. Never fight them on their terms, make them choose between coming close to you and getting gibbed or not bothering you at all. There should be zero middle ground.
---
OK, fair enough. I did use the word "blame" in that post. It wasn't my original point, but it was in response to this:
---
&gt;I get it, its not a fair presumption to many but seeing what the gaming industry has turned into with all the p2w features etc I think its a fair presumption.
---
So I guess I'm not sure how that isn't implying that they are responsible for p2w mechanics, since that's what you were saying. 
---
And you can drop the "I'm super duper concerned for your mental health!" shtick. It just makes you look like a child. People make mistakes. Adults understand that.
---
We know they'll have them
---
King's on her, friend.
---
I can't make a shaman come to me. They'll range me down. If I run, they'll go ghost wolf, and chase me down with frostshock. I can't do anything.
---
Im the type of guy that will get to lvl 60, then instantly regret that I didn't mine/herb while leveling because I "suddenly realize" I have to run around in every low level zones again, for hours, to level my professions.
---
Well we have addons now for most of those issues...
---
No they didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs client side
---
Came here to say this. Bwahah.
---
Warriors are the kings of group content.
---
Its funny how you think I havent played classic since 2004, trust me human kind didnt drastically change in a decade. 
---
In classic you need to cooperate which in turn lets you get to know people.
---
Oh but I do, I‚Äôve played multiple 10k+ releases fairly recently and I love it.
---
This is literally not a problem.
---
If hes a dog hes not casting despite how much faster he can move. Keep going until they either give up or you find a confined area where they cant out-range you.
---
Yeah, by all rights and means it was fair game, sure it was disrespectful; but in my opinion I could feel no higher respect than if my funeral was crashed by the opposite faction in a game focused around such a thing.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
it's called a temporal discombulator. sheesh, level up your gnomish engineering, noob!
---
He'll catch up, my stun isn't on cooldown, now what. Run with him hitting me in the back? Nothing to do in places like desolace and shimmering flats.
---
&gt; I have to run brd 100-300 times and during every last boss fight I have to switch to masterloot for the purple i've reserved
---
Literally going to level 5 toons to 60 so I don't have to deal with this. Pretty sure I'll actually save time on the Ironfoe grind even with the extra time leveling and gearing 4 other characters. You can do fast repeated BRD emp runs, vs. having to fill groups, wait for people to get to the instance, fail runs because some dumbass fucked up the lyceum or wait around because they died in the lava, etc etc
---
1.12 stats on items trivialize a lot of BWL loot anyway though, especially the pvp gear.
---
No when someone says quote me and you quote them and they say you made that up.. that's concerning.. and you are saying I look like a child.  This has been fun!
---
I've been saying yes to everything mine wants for over a year.. She is currently in NY with her mother while I'm gone with the kids.. I'm taking 2 weeks off from life at launch
---
‚ÄúDEAR POWERFUL SNOWSTORM‚Äù
---
Precisely what I‚Äôm hoping for!
---
there are lots of impassable spots, thats just one of the more visible ones
---
If you ignore all the people not playing private servers for a thousand different reasons then sure.
---
Be prepared that you must do this every time you want to raid, especially Naxx
---
[Confirmation Bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)
---
In this case it is :P
---
If you've been in past betas for games and give lots of feedback they're likely to give you a beta invite.
---
As horde switching to alliance, I will miss the Barrens most.
---
You say yes as you would like the release date to be later than earlier but then say ‚Äúsooner the better‚Äù and if your tired about pondering your decisions you would want the release date to be earlier rather than later, summer as opposed to a September release
---
Yeah, you run. And you keep running until you can do something else. If that means running him from Shimmering Flats to Tanaris, then get to it. You will survive that run.
---
They will be used by Blizzard to determine which product to focus on though.
---
If your fastfood stand sells two different kinds of hotdogs, and your official sales stastics says that 50% of customers buy hotdogs, but your internal numbers show that only one type of hotdog really sells, then you wont invest so much into the second type.
---
I'll die though. He'll give me no oppertunity to heal.
---
Africa doesn't have a server yet. It sucks.
---
This is the best scenario, except the seasons should be overlapping and all completed season servers feed into permanent static servers.
---
When the fire nation attacked.
---
i dont like discord's data mining bullshittery but id tell that guy to fuck off
---
As a Horde player, it‚Äôd be cooler if the Alliance used that as their battlecry instead of copying the Horde‚Äôs.
---
Just /wave at them and let them know you‚Äôre friendly.
---
A friend of mine has been advocating that anyone with a WoW Classic itch should play Diablo 2 in the meantime. The talent trees and a lot of other mechanics come straight from D2.
---
My favorite PvP instance was where I was questing out in Stranglethorn as a druid and I was working on the quests in the bay... and then the Alliance tried to gank me underwater because they greatly over leveled me...
---
I've never seen alliance try to swim towards the surface away from a lowbie as much as I had that day.  Nor have I ever seen a gank fail that badly.
---
I went to rank 8 in vanilla on a Paladin and I was not even all that good back then but I literally never had this problem. Only time I ever died to someone who was faster than me was when I was stupid and tried to fight them on their terms.
---
You seem convinced that you are helpless though, despite the fact that you are not.
---
most broken early game consumable tbh
---
I mean we're talking lvl 30-40 here though. It's different at max level.
---
i just had to google what auto scaling is
---
so mobs in vanilla content all scale up to 60 now?
---
that sounds so crap 
---
so can you just run dead mines or stockade to 60 now? that sounds lile a terrible change
---
I literally just admitted that I did say it. And, yes, you do look like a child. Hence the "this has been fun!" like a 12 year old. Now, would you like to explain how the quote I cited does NOT blame the young?
---
and also they said "prepare for a classic summer", implying we will spend most of the summer playing classic so it can't come out at the end
---
10% hp... stun and heal... 10% ... bubble and heal... 10% ... lay on hands ...  10%, mana pot, stun and heal ... 10% Blessing of Protection... rogue says fuck it and goes back to killing warriors.
---
Did the exact value really matter since current sub number for bfa isn't known ? No proof bfa is down to 2m no although i though it rised slower than it did (Peak at 8m for vanilla, 11 for BC)
---
Since you're so adamant about numbers, legion was close to wow sub peak, at worse WoD at +5M so 2m for bfa is out of the picture. 
---
Gotta admit i was wrong about TBC and vanilla subs tho, i though it was something along the lines of 6m vanilla =&gt; 9m BC =&gt; 12m wotlk but even then it would be hard for bfa to reach TBC peak.
---
Getting new ranks of skills is also something I really enjoy. In retail you don't really ever feel a powerspike any more, whereas in Classic when you get a new rank of Fireball you become god for that level and it really makes it feel like you're getting stronger and stronger.
---
Nice man, remember to also add the horde zeppeline routs :)
---
Didn't blind count as a charm?
---
All I can say is that I basically never got attacked by an Alliance player in a fair setting and everyone I know had same experiences. It was a common joke back then. I didn't personally attack players who didn't have a proper chance to fight back, well other than on my ud rogue alt. Somehow playing ud rogue just makes you act like an asshole.

WW axe lasts 30-51, so that's my bet. I'd say Herod's too but you don't get that til mid 30s and you can replace it in your 40s.
---
Literally everyone who has played WoW at some point and never experienced classic will at least try the game out. 
---
All people talk about are the good old days and someone who didn‚Äôt get the chance to experience classic will be intrigued for sure.
---
i think you will find wow lore actually stopped at the end of wrath
---
nothing after that is canon
---
I'm extremely excited, but a little nervous cause I'm so used to being good on BFA haha, it's going to be crazy
---
How did you have your mount on water? :o
---
But 7 billions people are gonna download bnet to play classic wow
---
I remember being hyped for this game way back in the day. Do you know why it was never released?
---
Purple skeletal warhorse üíú
---
works in 1.12 client
---
It probably doesn't help that they are playing a role that is grossly over saturated in both Retail and P-servers.
---
As a DPS you are pretty much expendable, don't like how things are handled in the group formed by either the healer or the tank? They kick you and pick one of the other hundred that wouldn't mind playing with the loot reservation.
---
Either play a Tank/Healer or accept that Loot will most likely be locked in higher content.
---
This scenario is exactly why I'm excited to main a Druid. Much like OP's story above, except Druids can actually kill unlike a Pally, heh. Takes time, but not as much time as them. What I like is that no one can run away from a Druid either.
---
real skill is clicking or being good at tab targeting over to the person you wan't to cc etc.
---
Blizz, pls nerf into Sligtly Sticky Glue
---
&gt; imp slam is good but hs spamming is better
---
wrong
---
Nope, new content does that only for their new leveling zones.
---
2h fury
---
Cloth wearers of any kind. I don't like have to stand in place at all times.
---
wrong, BRE is incredibly strong if we have the 1.12 version
---
only MS
---
Literally every player on a pvp server regardless of faction had this exact same experience. It‚Äôs universal.
---
I honestly can't remember how it happened! Didn't shamans have a "walk-on-water" spell? I forgot if it worked on mounts or not.
---
Say "babe, play it with me".
---
I mean it won't work because my husband isn't gonna do it either but it's worth a shot.
---
Poison. [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=2094](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=2094)
---
Spent a week viewing castles around Nothumberland last year - Alnwick especially. Depending on the age of your kid, may be worthwile to at least look around, I had fun.
---
If your guild cares only about boss fight numbers then yeah you will start to fall behind in BWL as 2h alliance, but don't forget that there is a shit load of multi mob trash in there, and 2h can do great dps when clearing those goblin packs
---
What's 8.2 and why does anyone care?
---
He's correct. The whole world scales like this now in retail.
---
You should just AoE farm along the way and during quests, from level 14 (Arcane Explosion) you can AoE 6 mobs at a time (obviously not ranged or mobs with CC), so in the Barrens i can gather up all the Prowlers that clump together in the bushes near Harpies and near Ratchet and AoE 6 or so mobs at a time, this is possbile as long as you're good enough to not get dazed while kiting them and rely on the Frost Armor slow to keep them just out of melee range, group them all up, let them smack you together then kite spamming AE for 5s, let them all smack you once and kite etc. I'd do this on my way back and forth between quests, there's even more packs in northern barren at the Echeyakee quest
---
What I'm trying to say is the if you see an opportunity to AoE grind some mobs along the way you should do it. However, once you hit level 44 you Should try and AoE grind the pirates in Tanaris until like level 51 then go to Western Plaguelands which has many AoE grinding spots the best being Sorrow Hill these will take you all the way to 60. You should be looking for BRD runs during your 51-60 leveling, to start getting those quests and attunements out the way and getting some pre raid BiS gear
---
IIRC it took the buff off if you tried to mount, but I could be wrong
---
Care to elaborate? If I am mistaken then I would like to learn and correct it simply saying wrong isn't helping anyone.
---
Warrior has TONS of options in open world pvp 1v1. Most people don't want to exhaust or don't know their options so just accept the gank so they can go back into doing whatever it was they were doing.
---
Don‚Äôt let it overshadow her. She will resent the game for even existing if it Takes your attention from her.
---
i always liked the idea of healers down ranking spells for some reason
---
i guess because its adds mana management as a job for them, you want to heal big or down rank and heal for a long time
---
Despite what people say, there‚Äôs elements to *both* that people like, so I think having a conjoined sub is a great idea.
---
For me, I really like arenas and BGs in retail, and will definitely occasionally play them to have a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from Classic.
---
TBH even in wrath people were calling for vanilla
---
I remember making a petition on the official wow forums in 2005 to make in-game beggars attackable immediately. There really were so many.
---
I usually play alliance but im rolling horde for the first time when classic drops. Im gunna smash every alliance i see like there's no tomorrow
---
You are not prepared for my 39 Tauren Balance Druid.
---
Hahahaha I remember that
---
‚Äú listen up babe, I‚Äôm only going to say this one time and one time only. I will play wow classic and I will no life it and if you have a problem with that, then get the f*** out‚Äù 
---
or something along those lines? 
---
It‚Äôs got a 0.01% success rate but I‚Äôd definitely recommend it.
---
I believe the world record is just under 4 days. That‚Äôs on private servers though.
---
We had those back then as well.
---
The game now is great fun BTW. I go back and play a fresh season every now and again for fun.
---
And then... the game dies? It's kind of hard committing to an MMO without any actual knowledge of whether or not they plan to pursue other expansions afterward (if it is successful). 
---
It's bizarre that Blizzard has been so quite about this. Of course, what I would love is if they went the Old School Runescape route and actually just deviated from WoW's set history with knowledge of where they went wrong every expansion, but I feel like the "muh nostalgia" crowd would hate that.
---
Make her play it independent of you, most of the time. Otherwise she's just going to follow your "story" and not make her own.
---
My personal answer is Seal of Sylvanas. Even WW gets replaced shortly, unless you got it at 30, within Ravager or something later.
---
But I‚Äôve had Seal of Sylvanas until my 40s... I‚Äôve had that item and wanted to replace it so many times I‚Äôve memorized it‚Äôs 8stam3str attributes.
---
Well, it‚Äôs a bad MH. No problems from this warrior.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but that's not vanilla.
---
If you have trouble paying 30 dollars a month then you shouldn't be having kids
---
I don't give a shit about auto loot, but I understand that there are people who fear that any changes starts a slippery slope that leads to LFR (overly simplified argument). If you're afraid that the modern design team will fuck it up by trying to fix it, then even meaningless changes are concerning. At least that's my understanding of arguments like that.
---
... you failed then. You didnt stay together at all !
---
lol wut?
---
Some weird version of our beloved game
---
tbh for retail auto scaling makes sense and is welcome, there were zones that hardly saw any player that was leveling there because some level ranges were quickly done by a few dungeons and a couple of quests in a single zone
---
he said back in vanilla so he means that a gm turned him into a chicken in vanilla and it still retained to today
---
all the good mages go  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0Ab0bZZVAMhsbtho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0Ab0bZZVAMhsbtho) for leveling on pvp server
---
This is sadly true. No lore lives forever my friend
---
Paladin because permanent Horde and Priest because I generally don't like healing and don't want to be limited to just one dps spec in that scenario.
---
Theres a video of head devs saying they were going to make it a 16 debuff limit at blizcon
---
Leaders of the Fang https://classicdb.ch/?quest=914 for the Wingblade. (Wailing Caverns)
---
Baron Aquanis https://classicdb.ch/?quest=909 for the Outlaw Sabre. (Blackfathom Depths)
---
Into the Scarlet Monastery https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1048 for the Sword of Omen. (Scarlet Monastery)
---
Bring the End https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3341 for the Vanquisher's Sword. (Razorfen Downs)
---
Corruption of Earth and Seed https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7064 for the Thrash Blade (Maraudon)
---
Those are pretty much the best swords to get without any RNG around their level.
---
I could sworn there was an item I used rogue v rogue
---
What is this thing?
---
first time I played I didn't know how to leave the night elf starting zone. Somebody helped me to the flightpoint and my mind was blown when I figured out there are multiple zones in the game. I genuinely believed Teldrassil was all there was to the game.
---
Correct, I am still a chicken to this day
---
It's the employee only alpha currently. That's why it got uploaded. They probably want to get as many bugs fixed with employees testing before letting in outside beta testers.
---
Curious - whats complicated about the aoe rotation in classic raiding?
---
fish :D
---
It‚Äôs a love/hate relationship. It‚Äôs great to get that new item, and see your damage, mana/health pool spike up. But then you have to pass on item after item that is just *slightly* worse, even though it‚Äôs much higher level. 
---
So you find yourself at level 40 wearing Robes of Arugal and Gravestone Scepter... I mean cool, but I always feel like a nub sporting gear 20 levels lower than me. It‚Äôs great when I get it though!
---
Cornwall or Pembrokeshire.
---
Holidays are going on atm, they are people too and need free time just as you and me
---
Why tho?
---
id say they have an internal cdn for alpha clients
---
find a pillar/tree anything
---
That's a weird way of saying raptor.
---
You clearly don't know how much time is required to grind those ranks.  Serious no life status to farm raids and rank like that
---
\&gt; This is the first time I've seen someone say that something is "private server mentality" just because they don't like it and I'm already over it.   
---
It is, altho knowledge existed bis lists was not very established in vanilla and epiq drops like wardens staff was way more rare compared to private servers.
---
Oh boy, you would love destro in mop, chaos bolts were like a tactical nuke
---
I'd be careful about being in a city, someone might get a gms attention and knowing Blizz they'll revert it.
---
Could mean we spend all summer playing the beta!
---
LMFAO
---
Time to go apply for a job at blizz!  /s
---
There's this place in Greece called [Meteora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_aeFn27_a8) that I've always wanted to visit. These are ancient old monasteries suspended on these unique rock formations. 
---
I'm not a religious man, but this post has finally made me realise why I've wanted to visit this place so much. It's like Thunderbluff, but IRL.
---
Roll alliance because she won‚Äôt want to play any of the ugly horde models
---
Thanks! But I meant to refit the line without the outliers. The coefficients (6.9289,-301400) are the same between the two plots. You would expect both to be smaller without those large spikes. 
---
The other thing to look at is the distribution of the "subscribers" count i.e. a histogram, and see whether it symmetrical like a normal distribution. These things typically grow in an exponential fashion, which would result in a skewed histogram. In this case it maybe worth regressing log(Subscribers) vs Date (days). The coefficient in this case can then be interpreted as a growth rate i.e. % growth in subscribers per day, versus now which is raw subscribers gained per day.
---
have a second character you only level with her make it a social thing
---
let her pick a class then pick one that compliments her choice
---
Inquiring minds want to know!
---
Unfortunately we still don't know about this.
---
Idk, I just know that I was told by my friend at blizzard when I asked about getting a beta key, that currently it's an alpha for employees only and they will be getting keys to give out sometime soon.
---
or not suck balls if that's what you're into.
---
Uhhhh just plug an iPhone up, or an android if you want to use a mouse
---
Not vanilla but i did the same in TBC, i got hooked on making the toughest kill in pvp with my pally. It just feels good somehow knowing that you arent gonna be able to be ganked under 20 seconds :P
---
I can't hide who am any longer. I am officially coming out of the coup
---
Here's a SUPER nooby question. But for the life of me I cannot remember those two islands off the coast of Feralis there. What's going on there?
---
I agree completely. But it‚Äôs so sweet when you get a new piece of gear! 
---
I guess what I like about it is that things can be viable for a while, and it‚Äôs not the constant swapping of new gear every 10 mins. You had to think about it, weigh the pros/cons of a new piece of gear or think about the fact that even if it IS an upgrade is it big enough to equip it instead of AH‚Äôing it.
---
Indeed, mine would rather spend family time or go out and party the minute we don't have the kids.
---
I'm gonna have to grind my way to grinding my way
---
with 41 yard range and aspect of the cheetah the warrior literally cannot even get into charge range unless you are backpedalling or they catch you unaware.
---
If she likes reading introduce her to one of the books
---
If she likes lore videos, show her videos like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TploBAj5XQ)  
---
Start as a nightelf, also make sure you dont hurry along, stress or the likes but take time to explore and enjoy the world.  
---
Make sure she knows its ok if the does not enjoy any of it and that you really appreciated her giving it a chance anyways, low pressure and low stress is what you are going for, the world will sell itself once she is in it.
---
Will it be an open or closed beta?
---
if it can run retail wow on max you should be good
---
in the EU it was a bannable offense and against the the ToS. I am not sure if they did police it back in the day but I am sure it was against the rules.
---
I'll eventually rock a 39 Druid again. Wanna have some fun as a new class first though. :)
---
You're wrong, but ok.
---
As for your above edit, you can call anything you want logical, but that doesn't make it so.  If a person wants the item, *they can buy it.*  I'm not going to convince you, so have fun getting heated when people roll against items that you inexplicably feel entitled to!
---
Just some quick hubs I might consider: the mine in DunMorogh, the dwarf tower in southern LochModan and the pirates in Arathi
---
It actually was. I had this paired with a Doom's Edge
---
Naw, it's not too bad, especially not at 39.
---
Thank you for the report, we will look into it and implement a fix ASAP.
---
Although there's nothing wrong with finding like-minded individuals, you should know that designers and programmers get an immediate brain aneurysm when they read a proposition that contains the term "ideas guy". Diversify your bonds if you want to increase your chances.
---
Pretty sure at least one of the islands had something to do with some quest elite that rewarded a chimaera-ish food recipe that was either really useful or somewhat meh. It‚Äôs been awhile but I know that much!

---
I think they want to avoid it because it creates a fair bit of complexity
---
they would have to find every item that got changed then decide what patch it needs to get cyanged
---
then if they missed any items they could need to change items people have during the game etc
---
Logical in the sense as in we all follow the same kind of logic that applies to most loot, like your mainspecc before my offspecc and if you are an alchemist you roll need on recipies. And while that logic might not hold when it comes to flask recipies as I've stated I think it definitely holds on bis items like edgemasters handguards if you have a fury warrior in the group
---
Blizz is more than aware that leveling in general needs some attention and revision. But then they double down on the direction they‚Äôre going in, and make the world an evershifting tangle of ethereal stats and values. 
---
You don‚Äôt NEED to get stronger, because there is always something doable. LFRs only barrier to entry is having the ilvl. 5 man normals are straight up jokes, or they were when I played. And questing is engineered to never be too hard. 
---
I really hope Blizzard gives a hard look at their philosophies. WoW doesn‚Äôt have to be like it is. It doesn‚Äôt have to be like how it was either. But this whole AP/Azerite, legendary clusterfuck, 10-million versions of everything system... 
---
Unless their subs are up again, which is incredibly unlikely and hovering between 2-3m, why do they keep pushing in this direction?! I‚Äôm going to love every minute of Classic/TBC/Wrath, but it‚Äôd be nice to have current material that resembles an mmorpg.
---
Wow you're so smart
---
Wait wait wait... why cant you eat pizza every day?
---
damn this was a damn good r/unexpectedrunescape comment
---
I think it‚Äôs to be inclusive of WC3 remastered in the future
---
Because he never right-clicked the buff to remove it.
---
GMs back in the day could turn you into several creatures, including a dragon. Modify your size, speed, give you flight, teleport you, etc. You right-clicked the buff to remove it like any other buff.
---
It's how you see lots of these Vanilla videos that talk about classic or vanilla - folks use the 1.12 client and run mangos or their own core then give themselves GM privileges.
---
There's literally spell icons, most of which are dude's face.
---
Makes total sense, just wanted to make sure I had the right thing selected :)
---
I totally understand this, sadly it just takes quite a lot away from the game as well regarding depth and theorycrafting
---
&gt; Because now we would know what items change in what ways and would thus farm certain items because we know that they will be better later on.
---
I don't really get this argument. Wouldn't you be farming that item anyway?
---
This is what [lowbie LFG looks like now](https://i.imgur.com/isa26ht.jpg). You are correct, you can run lowbie dungeons all the way to 60 and enemies will scale with you. 
---
However, while dungeons used to be awesome for leveling circa Pandaria and Draenor, they've been adjusted to slow groups down a bit, so they're not as great for leveling as they used to be.
---
Shameful, suicide is the cowards way out.
---
Yeah, nothing at all in the game to get them into range... A warrior has never killed a hunter before.
---
Drakedog is a fucking legend.

Painfully true

Leveled to 70 on a PvP server.

Again
---
I like it! But I have a question: why is the Deeprun Tram curved on this map? Isn‚Äôt it a completely straight line?
---
What is a "Support DPS"? And why would a hunter be more "support" than a mage?

They're waiting for wow subs to reach an all time low before announcing a release date for classic.
---
get swords from quests in wc, bfd, sm, rfd, maraudon
---
i have fond memories of friends dungeon power leveling me thats a shame
---
I'm mostly looking forward to all the pserver kiddies who find out their data is wack and their advantage is now gone.
---
Hmm, I dunno, kinda a toss up. Dwarf helps with rogue, and warrior matches which is welcome as a rogue. Gnome helps with mages, and other immobilizes( hunters have a few I think). I feel like dwarf probably helps rogues a bit more than gnome overall, but it depends on who you want a bit of help against. IMO pick what you like better style wise, you gotta spend a lotta time of this dude, make sure you like them.
---
Wash her back
---
For Azeroth!
---
I would assume Blessing of Salvation.  It's hard to find enough shamans to get your locks tranq totem and it's only 20% compared to salv's 30%.  30% reduced threat is basically 30% increased damage.
---
I miss having actual rpg stats on my character screen.
---
quit the wife
---
Everquest has been doing it for years and people still keep coming back and starting over and over, and that game is at least 100x more tedious to play through.
---
I remember in tbc a guy power leveled my bloodelf for me to help get my paladin up to 70 so I could offtank trash with it.. then I found out he had a level 50 alt. I walked stratholme backwards so many times for him.
---
Yeah coup is great for sitting around with friends it's easy to setup and fast games. Resistance is a bit more complicated to learn but games are somewhat fast and after one game everyone will get the hang out it. Everyone's a hidden role you have the spies and the resistance and the spies know who each other are and the resistance are blind and it's a best of 5 rounds and the resistance have to figure who the spies are before they lose the game. But it's super funny cause the resistance don't know the other good guys so no one trusts anyone each game. It's more a social game than a game with a lot of pieces.
---
Make Murloc sounds.  Works great as a mating call.
---
Leg snare probably more effective than a lasso imo.
---
you dont need *anywhere near* the HK counts listed above to get the respective ranks. if you were master sergeant, you probably had around 500-1000 HKs
---
Mainhand sword was trash for rogues because it was too fast so meh. Offhand was the shit though, and it sheathed on your back making you a ninja assassin.
---
That still cracks me up! ;)
---
yeah my first 60 work friends talked me into playing wow because i didnt want to play so they like boosted me most of the way
---
fun times
---
I really hope that Classic shows blizzard what the players want and they build the next expansions based on what drew players back.
---
my suggestion actually has nothing to do with the map, it looks awesome friend(: my suggestion is a rubric, with lvl, quest giver, etc. for blue gear. for example u could show sword of omen level 37 undercity, or vanquisher sword level 40 undercity
---
But what if my fetish is polygons?!
---
It's is pretty awesome...though I am partial to the pink crystal power ranger set.
---
People just want a good game xoxo
---
I think they should have done this in the first place. I loved Lich King but did not like Cataclysm. Why should I be forced to play the new expansion? I own the game and all previous expansions, but now I can't play the one I want? Doesn't seem right. I'm glad they are finally doing this.
---
I know. Adding new content, new bosses, new raids. It could be great.
---
Stop playing private and just get your mind off of it, watch shows or something
---
Only a few more months ;) But im in the same boat someone help pls retail sucks ass
---
If she has never played before don't party up with her at the start. You'll want to rush ahead because you know all the quests and she will just be following. She would enjoy it more if she could take her time at the start.
---
Maybe leave a toon at level 25 for when she catches up then you could run deadmines together (or horde equivalent).
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a huge sucker for buying gear on the AH. Especially when I‚Äôm getting close to 40 and should really be saving...
---
I expect a full copied pdf in the comments soon.
---
She wouldn't say I couldn't play. 
---
It would be more like "you better get something else done during your vacation"
---
Or "you better not get too fucking sucked in or will have a problem. 
---
I only thing that really surprised me was her having absolutely no problem with me no lifeing it during my vacation.
---
Amazing
---
So what level is your chicken at?
---
Don't start a new one. Just keep going. 1-10 is a god awful range to judge a class by. Some classes feel like shit early on but really take off later down the line.
---
HORDE LOWBIES NED! IN STONETALON MOUNTAINS!
---
I used to powerlevel so many of my friends through lowbie dungeons as well, everything from Stockades to Zul'Farrak. Even got one of them their first epic, the two Sul'thraze pieces from ZF. Good times.
---
And here I am in BfA switching back and forth between holy and disc basically every few dungeons...for free, without visiting a class trainer of course.
---
I'm pretty sure they're using wow classic as a springboard into WoW2 to check out how receptive modern audiences are to the older design that got them on the map, contrasted with the convenience design differences in retail.
---
They want to find a balance between fun for casuals who can drop in and play a quick dungeon or quest and still expect character progression, and the more 'difficult' somewhat grindy original game design.
---
Something we forget here is that even vanilla wow was, at the time, the mmo for casuals. "Wait, you're a ghost when you corpse run? You don't lose xp when you die? Pvpers don't loot your gear?" Etc. The game got popular because it was accessible. Unfortunately over time by expanding on that accessibility they also lost a lot of what made mmorpgs of that time unique.
---
I must be out of the loop, how was that racist?
---
&gt; one simply does not speedlevel a paladin :o
---
My last paladin speedrun was 112 hours.
---
Sorry, I realize that my comment sounds very ‚Äúwell acschually‚Äù
---
im out of mana. i need more mana to cast that. im all out of mana
---
&gt;the same kind of logic that applies to most loot
---
Boe items have the exact same value to everyone; they are worth the price at which you can sell them or the gold you save by not having to buy them.  Bop items are very valuable to the classes/specs who can use them, while they are only worth the value of the disenchanting materials (assuming you're an enchanter) or the 1-10 gold you can vendor them for, and in either case, this is *much* less than the value to a player who can use the item.
---
They're totally different situations, and that's why it's illogical to pretend they should have the same loot rules.  If you can't see, I don't know what to tell you.
---
i really miss classic warrior combat animation, this made my day
---
Unfortunately, aoe healing isn‚Äôt great as a vanilla priest. If you want to heal multiple targets roll shaman for chain heal.
---
Prayer of healing only effects your party, and holy nova is both mana intensive and doesn‚Äôt heal for a ton.
---
"from my experience allys only attack if they outnumber you, heavily outlevel you, or you are already fighting multiple mobs or an elite, I would never do anything like that"
---
(except on my UD rogue alt because WOTF lmao I don't want any risk at all while seal clubbing)
---
Hah, yeah. Can‚Äôt blame you. Only reason I did put some time into figuring this stuff out was my guild full of dps players obsessed with doing more damage and constantly trying to theory craft better ways to do so. That rubbed off on me, to a point where I probably was too obsessed with healing numbers
---
Ice
---
You will never usefully use PoH in PvP so this build really doesn't make any sense at all. PvP is 95% targeted damage at a single player. Having a whole group take even damage in range for PoH will basically never happen.   
---
The only useful pvp healing like that is chain heal because it will bounce to other groups in a raid. As a priest you're far better off spamming your single target heals.
---
This is what I thought they should do if Vanilla us a success. Release TBC and Wrath alongside. And if you reach 60 on Vanilla and want to move forward, you do a character transfer and cant go back. If you just want vanilla you stay there. Same goes for TBC to Wrath
---
People feel entitled and think that they should be allowed to get into a group regardless of what the other player (The Groupleader) may want.
---
Because I already basically do.
---
This seems...unlikely.  How have you been able to remain a chicken for this long?  Do you not play the character at all or something?
---
The vanillamage website is pretty good for mage builds and lists. I think it's vanillamage dot com.
---
Chicken Diplomacy
---
I'm doing the in-depth Skyrim playthrough I always wanted to do in the meantime.
---
You must ask yourself *why* you feel the need to roll new characters at level 10.
---
 * Does it feel too slow to level?
---
 * Too much downtime?
---
 * Not enough damage?
---
 * Dies too easily?
---
 * Not enough active abilities?
---
Once you discover *why* you keep rolling new characters you can then address a solution.
---
Gamon?

Good, i think it is important to kill the horde skellingtons and mostly filthy and stupid orcs. Dwarfs are coolest
---
luckily (or unluckily depending on how you look at it) i have had to quit my job to become a full time carer for my wife.. i'm using classic to say this life situation is a benefit as i can pretty much sit in my lounge with my wife ,while she watches TV and i have my headphones on playing wow pretty much all day give or take . I am however trying to talk her into playing it with me but the last videogame she enjoyed was doom on the ps1.for
---
Items are stored in a database and they‚Äôve certainly not connected to Blizzard‚Äôs.
---
How are you supposed to distinguish flight paths from quest hubs?
---
Based on an interview with game designer Kevin Jordan, he said this guide was out of date with a lot of the content released at launch. He said Brady games had to base a lot of it on either the beta or from pre release information due to the timeframe needed to publish and print it. I guess one of the most out of date sections was around Paladins because of how unfinished their systems were right up to launch. 
---
I think stuff like this is interesting and makes the book more valuable IMO.
---
Do you blizzard has like surveillance cams looking at the cities or something? They don‚Äôt monitor things like they did in Vanilla and just visually looking at certain locations would not be efficient.
---
It's great to counter an enemies CD usage. Deathcoil/Blind/PoM Pyro/DevPlague.
---
I remember running around tanaris sometime after I hit 40 on my first character. A lvl 60 rode up and asked me If I had a mount. When I said no, he opened trade and gave me 100g right there and then rode off. That was one of the nicest things anyone‚Äôs done for me in a video game.
---
My Vanguard brother. 
---
I miss that game... the opening music still gets me.
---
it only takes 7 letters.
---
Saving for myself. Have an upvote. Can't wait to try alliance!
---
Makes sense guys.. i actually thought PoH was raid-wide.
---
Dude I'm in the same boat as you. I'm all for spending $15/mo for Classic WoW, of course. Hell, even more if it turns out to be exceptional. But I don't want that money to be misconstrued in any way as support for the direction that current retail WoW is going.
---
I had this experience as Alliance *constantly* in Argus on a Horde heavy PvP server. I‚Äôd be minding my business doing WQs or killing rares or whatever with 2-3 Horde nearby doing the same. We‚Äôd have this nice unspoken truce going, but then Xxillidankool would swoop in, start attacking me unprovoked, and the previously peaceful Horde would jump on me too.
---
And I‚Äôm a mediocre geared fire mage for Pete‚Äôs sake. I‚Äôm dead meat if practically any class gets the jump on me if you‚Äôre gonna attack just do it, no need for opportunistic dogpiling‚Ä¶
---
Withold sex. Only give it her once she reaches 60. Worked for me. Though it was the other way around. I'm the husband.
---
Oh wow, did they remove the ability for people to report other players for cheating or filing tickets?
---
Ulduar and Karazhan are still my two favourite raids to this day.
---
I'm pretty sure that is pserver behavior. IIRC self damage can't be prevented by immunity, although that may have been a change added after vanilla.
---
i need this in poster form
---
Not loan sharkin if he only took 100g repayment, sounds like a bro.
---
Welcome all new people. May this game take away years from your life and ruin friendships, and you'll still say "worth" at the end of the day.
---
The main one is the Devilsaur Leggings pattern off the slimes in Un'goro. The gloves pattern is a limited supply purchase from a vendor at Marshal's Refuge. Once DM opens, the Hide of the Wild pattern from the goblin's cache is quite useful to make for healers.  
---
Corehound boots and Corehound belt from Thorium Brotherhood in BRD isn't really needed I don't think unless people are in dire need of fire resistance. I don't think the Ironfeather set is that sought after either.
---
I like everything to look the same for everyone, otherwise it ruins my immersions haha
---
Yeah, I am aware of the recipes available to tribal leatherworkers, I looked that up. What I want to know is how much grinding is actually required to obtain the recipes.
---
No way in hell. I see no fun whatsoever in crushing less-geared people. No skill = no fun. 
---
I prefer to pick on people my own size or larger.
---
If the first year of OSRS is any indicator (they kept the game the same for the first year and the playerbase dropped from 90k to 20k until they started adding new content), Classic wow could potentially become a new hit if they follow the same route, or at least avoid the big dip that might happen after the first 2 to 3 months.
---
You should get the Bestiary and Atlas
---
They might realise that to keep making money they need to make a fork from the expensions. So the players who like the Classic style of game also can enjoy new content without slowly going to BFA.
---
If you have lfg why do this at all?
