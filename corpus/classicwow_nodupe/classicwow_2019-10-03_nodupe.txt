That's the downside of having the game mined and analyzed over and over; I was in a semi-HC (raid 3x/week, killed twin emps/raz, MT xferred cos we weren't really getting anywhere/people were burning out with BC coming out in 3 months) and the 3-4 dps warriors we had were arms because we all pvp'd too much. Nobody cared about min/maxing.

---
As someone has levelled to 60 as a hunter in classic, PvP is hard. I need to get way better at it. Every single mage knows how to just sit right in your deadzone and nuke you.
---
And of course you are outside playing in the park with butterflies and puppies while writing that right?
---
Yet one of your latest posts on reddit is "Gay people don't deserve a whole month".  Guess there are good guys and shit people at every organization. The fact you aren't there anymore is probably a good thing.
---
You said you were close... Maybe you don't know what close means.
---
ilvl has always existed
---
It makes sense they drop when you move but that's pretty drastic. Have you tried anything to fix it? Disable addons, change various graphic settings etc.

What spec are you?

As a wow vet of 15 years and a person who has battled depression a good portion of my life. Never stop doing this. If someone, ANYONE, you care about is acting strange to them. Always check on them. Sometimes they just need someone to reach out, sometimes they want some space. Both are fine, but never stop caring.
---
Literally every single mage I have fought has done it to me since the first one in Ashenvale at level 23
---
It's pretty weird that you didn't mention that, especially since it would help you find him.
---
Definitely as long as you keep a set of caster gear, though the lack of normal rez if you don't have a shaman/pally/priest in the group is annoying if/when anything goes wrong.
---

---
But you'll probably be asked to tank more than heal, since bear tanks are great for most 5 mans and you're the only other decent tank besides warriors (paladins can do AoE tank well but struggle otherwise especially with the lack of taunt).
---
You offered nothing but insults and no evidence to back up your weak claims. I gave fact and lore examples to back up my point that the forsaken are a terrible race and should not be in the horde. Get off your fake high horse, pull your head from your ass and learn to read an opposing opinion before you spout more nonsense
---
Why did you record this in your phone :|
---
Bc it’d be worse without it
---
Lot of people who don’t know how good RoA is for mage and how long it’s total BIS responding here.
---
Pretty easy to indicate that, so people don't try to track you down.
---
Where does this one command, one action rule come from?
---
Well, ever since citizens united, corporations are given the rights of people. So I would say that I generally agree, the non-human people are the ones you gotta watch out for.
---
No shit....... Try farming for years. Not days. Years.
---
Classic's talent system is more engaging and more fun to level with, but retail has WAY more viable builds. Furthermore there are different builds for different situations. It goes beyond just talents but things like gear too.
---
Ever heard of a Metaphor?
---
Last time I did it I was arms and still did well with def stance and shield. As I got more plate gear I even tanked with 2h and an armor potion. Obviously not tanking raids, but 5 mans.
---
Free money for blizzard, so they don't touch it. Even when the multiboxer on tich was blatantly griefing on multiple occasions...
---
Does hating retail players get you off?
---
Adrenaline Rush my dude.
---
Just type it to them, hit enter, unplug internet.
---
Same at the goshek farm in arathi for alliance
---
You have no idea.
---
Did you jump off the diving platforms?
---
I'm not sure what your point is here. I added it as an afterthought because blink is a 15 second cooldown, which is significant.
---
Mufasa definitely wasn't immortal
---
nicuu
---
&gt; field because I need a break, letting down my ream
---
Why do you think substitutions exist. Terrible analogy
---
Remindme! 1 week
---
Yes retail sucks as far as having a lot of talents to pick from. But classic sucks as far as having talents that actually do stuff. You get to pick 51 talents that barely do anything vs like 7 in retail that mostly all have a big impact on your character.
---
There is a big argument to be made about limiting choices and blah blah blah in retail.. but using vanilla class design as a base for what it should be is totally wrong. vanilla's class design and balance was total garbage. Most of the specs don't work or are so broken they aren't worth playing. They designed a tank spec that can't taunt. The 31 talent for paladin's dps tree is a CC. Paladins don't press buttons during their dps rotations. Druids have a choice of being a healer or a tank. Most classes optimal dps rotations are boiled down to pressing like 1 button over and over again. The list goes on and on. At least in retail, each spec functions the way it is meant to, lol.
---
25 minutes exactly from when the last person started it.
---
What level did you start soloing her?
---
im a druid level 47, at the current rate i have to be grinding mobs for another 60-70 hours before i can get to 60.
---
While I obviously don't know if its true or not I would imagine it isn't entirely unlikely that your connection to a certain website which is sometimes used for rwt in different games could be what might have triggered the flagging of your account aswell. Glad you got unbanned though, I always thought you were a nice guy even when alot of people didn't.
---
Nothing but insults? I claimed that you never even tried to see their perspective (which everyone can tell from your post) then gave an example of said perspective, put it in relation to the orc's perspective and then spiced it up with a little banter. You decided to ignore everything but said banter so you can claim I am the unreasonable one but you are doing quite the bad job of convincing anyone
---
Actually it is possible, it's called you actually pay a human to review automated bans before they go out.
---
IMO you can go 0/31/20 and tank pretty dang well, so long as you take Imp Shield Block and 5/5 Defiance. Did that back in Vanilla and I think it works well now too - tho I'm not playing a warrior in classic atm.
---
I once protected an afk guy in shimmering flats until he safely logged out. 
---
He never even knew I saved him a death.
---
It would be bad and you should feel bad for even asking this question.
---
Honestly it will probably make me quit the game before i reroll.
---
There's usually a break
---
1 000 000
---
It is the responsibility of a dps to control their threat level.
---
The debate here is that it should be against the ToS. Bringing up the fact that it isn't against the ToS is irrelevant.
---
Cool
---
Honestly I would worry more about your well-being in the next few moments but okay
---
Good guy blizzard man kudos.
---
I had 10g at 24ish. My main (27 sham lul) paid for 4 10 slotters and that was the only head start I had on my lock (new main). Made a huge did defence n questing speed and income. 
---
Spent some on cloth to lvl tailoring. Went down to a out 6g. Then back up to 12 at 29. Just hit 30 last night and didn't freak lie questing after training so I spent another 6g on silk. Planning on making my own shadowweave set as the lvls come.
---
And yeah just read the last part of your last reply again after my reply and treat as if I wrote that to you since it's kinda the truth you are projecting there
---
We will see what happens but, judging on Alliance performance in PvP on my server so far... I am not optimistic.
---
You need to stop thinking of multiboxers as one player. They are exactly however many players they are playing. It's not a 1v1. It's a 1v2 or 1v3.
---
&gt;If you have a 1v1 fight with one person using multibox and one isn't, who is going to win?
---
So instead, ask yourself, if you are in a 3v3 or 5v5 vs multiboxer, who's going to win?
---
Legit or quit!
---
It's not that Spirit is useless, it's that all of the other stats are better. Maybe it's better than Stamina on PvE servers.
---
I agree that the talent suggestions are terrible. Shield Spec is close to worthless even if you're actually using a shield because block values are so low. Like, look at Marbled Buckler, a shield you can get as a quest reward in Razorfen Kraul at a minimum level of 29. It has a block value of 17. With no additional block rating, 5/5 shield spec raises your block value to 21 and your chance to block to 10%. Before shield spec: average mitigation per hit from block is 17 * .05 = .85 damage. After shield spec, average mitigation per hit from block is 21* .1 = 2.1 damage. Looking at it one way, it more than doubles the efficacy of your blocks... but in absolute terms, having the talent makes a difference of less than 2 damage per hit. Most of the extra mitigation you get from your shield actually comes from its armor value, which has jack all to do with Shield Spec.
---
Improved Lightning Shield: Lightning Shield is a tiny portion of your damage even if you are hitting it every time it falls off, which will basically prevent you from ever regenerating mana. Increasing it by 15% is useless.
---
Not taking Improved Ghost Wolf: With a 1 second cast, Ghost Wolf is a flexible ability that can be used as an escape or gap closer in addition to a travel power. With a 3 second cast, you will never want to cast it in combat.
---
Also what the hell is going on in the Resto tree? We're skipping Totemic Mastery to take... what, that third point in Improved Lightning Shield? Tidal Focus adds up to one extra heal per 20 heals you cast, and they took it over Improved Healing Wave which shaves half a second off your mana-efficient heal.
---
That’s the best part
---
I genuinely think you should talk to a professional. This comes off as innocent at first, but it's abnormal to have this kind of apprehension and indecisiveness in a video game to the point you're worried about your experience.
---
People will flock to downvote me and call me names, but surely you understand it's not "normal" to level every single class simeotaneously WHILE BEING WORRIED this behaviour is holding you back from something. It's not an issue until it affects you negatively and it clearly is.
---
It's crazy this was posted today.
---
I am a guildmaster of a small guild of maybe 30 people in a classic server.  
---
One of my officers who has been more of leader since the guild was made, someone I was willing to purchase their mount for when they hit 40, completely vanished from my guild and the server today.  I am completely confused what happened, they showed no signs of this and are a 51 year old adult with a stable job and life.  They aren't on my friends list anymore, they aren't on the server if i type /friend Qbal, completely gone.
---
I'm so heartbroken to be honest.
---
Possibly a game master? Basically a moderator of wow that works for blizzard. But I have a hard time seeing a scenario where you would threaten to kill yourself in front of a game master since you really never see one.
---
That's kinda shitty. If someone I played a lot with told me they had to quit because it was affecting the rest of their life, I'd say goodbye and sincerely wish them luck, I guess some addicts need to drag other people down with them. I've heard similar things from people who have been addicted to drugs and their friend groups
---
What is osrs?
---
I've spent hours watching swordfish about 15 seconds at a time...
---
Take my fucking money
---
Sounds like those people aren't true gamers
---
I have 8 days played. Although that is quite signicant chunk of time IMO it was well spent. I haven't felt this happy, passionate, or(oddly enough -sociable-) in a very long time. I did not ruin my life at all by  playing this much. I still eat well. I keep to regular routine. I exercise. I am running multiple high profile projects at work. Its not like played time is a direct correlation to a an issue. I think its dependant on the person and where they are at in life. They can be the judge to when its unhealthy. And its their responsibility to fix it if there is.
---
Now, do I consider myself casual? No.
---
Do I consider myself hardcore? No.
---
I'm a good mix. I don't mind being silly and having fun. I'm not all about min-max life. I like to do things naturally efficiently - But that alone doesn't stop me from playing the game for the FUN of it.
---
People need to realize its a game and that there is a life outside the game. You can't rely on a game to solely support yourself and your well being
---
For sure it exceeded their expectations but for what the future hold , other than the announced phases , who knows
---
This response is exactly what people are saying as to unhealthy behavior. You right away are trying to nickle and dime your life to maximize gaming time. You would chose to clock our of work at exactly quitting time, eat unhealthy and then get 6-7 hours of sleep just so you can have more time to game?
---
Im from Firemaw-EU , tried to farm some leathers just now and the same two guilds you mentioned are still doing this. They would call a warlock named Attom and his buddies to gank everybody else.
---
Well people better get used to it. Layering will be removed from the game, sooner or later.
---
The only way they should add things is if they add new servers that are forever locked to a given expansion. 
---
Let classic get to phase 6 then open up some TBC servers and let those get to the equivalent of phase 6 and then do the same with WotLK. 
---
The point of classic is to reexperience old content as it was (more or less) when it was fresh and relevant.
---
Old School Rune Scape
---
The real difference: most European cops don't carry guns.
---
&gt;You're not the type of person that does well with reason
---
That's an ad-hom attack and not a response to an argued point. Hypocritical as all hell, too.
---
I'd be overjoyed if you could put together literally **one** rational response to justify the personal attacks you're throwing around because you're seemingly incapable of defending your position.
---
&gt;Luckily, I've never been with... any group with you're [sic] ignorant position.
---
You haven't, because I make loot rules known at the start of the run and ninjas generally leave when they see they can't waltz with free patterns they can't use and BiS items they can't equip that people in the group actually need.
---
Imagine being so terrified of confrontation you fling shit online but absolutely refuse to stand your ground when asked to explain yourself and your position.
---
I've been nothing but open with my views and you've done nothing but act like a twelve year old lmfao.
---
Have fun, ninja.
---
There is a spot where a huge rock keep wiggling on top of a stone pillar. A short video clip recorded at that place will work much nicer.
---
Most of the mitigation from your shield comes from the extra armor though, block values are so low on leveling shields that buffing your blocks is almost meaningless.
---
Keeping up shadow weaving is extremely easy without mp5, you can use rank 1 mind blast on CD if you start the fight with 0 Mana. In general priests don't really want mp5 that much since they regen Mana while casting thanks to their talents.

Story goes, in order to hide the height difference between the two actors (Diesel at approx 5'11 and The Rock at anywhere between 6'3 and 6'5), they shot this scene with the actors standing next to eachother, while angling it to attempt to give the impression of the characters being face to face. It ens up with two scenes where whichever actor is closer to the camera ends up looking abnormal, especially if you look at their heads in each shot
---
They look like crab and walk like ppl...we ducked!!!!
---
The min/max mentality will be on every server.  Can you find a lot of good groups on an RP server?  Yes.  Grob has amazing RP.  We also have great pve and pvp groups (most guilds do both.)  As a member of Grob and a life long RPPVP server player who has never actually seriously RPd I feel like we bring the best of both.  If you want more info check out r/grobbulus
---
Maybe he wanted u to get a mount really bad
---
Taste like crab, talk like people
---
You macro character actions on each account: 
---
Ctrl + 1:
---
Main character - Whatever spell they have
---
Character 2 - Target leader focus, cast frostbolt
---
Character 3 - Target leader focus, cast Smite
---
Character 4 - Target leader focus, cast Charge
---
etc etc
---
Then you use a program to mimic your keypresses on each instance of the game. You press ctrl+1, its inputs to all wow windows
---
I’m not sure why they say I’m wrong, I’ve multiboxed myself a 2nd account when I got the game again for my birthday from someone.
---
I never found the quest... I'm sure I had all the pages.
---
Tween?  That's exactly the type of person I'm imagining would post what OP did.
---
You can do what you like as long as the emp dies before her.  She can’t be CCed though and she will try to heal him so have interrupts ready.
---
All I know is the population will be big for a good while. I have no plans on stopping. Taking forever for me to level with just an hour or two a day. I know there are many others in the same boat.
---
Get to level 10 pretty fast but then it slows down for me. I must be doing something wrong. I’m sure there’s a more efficient way of leveling haha
---
In retail like 90% of talents are either never used or only have a single use case.
---
Also most of my point was that they actually restrict abilities that used to be defining for each class to only be accessible in a certain spec. Like how we used to have all our abilities except some talent abilities. Now if you’re a resto druid you don’t get all the abilities for feral or guardian or balance. At best you can get a watered down version by taking 1 of the affinity talents.
---
So just my two cents but in the middle of wotlk I got sick of my dk and tanking, sent all my gold to a friend, deleted my char and stopped playing for 3 years. So it could be that your guildmate decided that wow is dumb the way I did.
---
Because its allowed, a non-issue and you guys are whining about it.
---
That is not core strength man that’s rigormortis
---
We're talking about a general break here, getting that in depth about it is just weird. If you want to go down that road you can quite as easily just say "hey guys need to go" and log off. 
---
The lengths people will go to to sound superior about this game is just odd.
---
It started with all the posts about people demeaning anyone who wasn't taking their time to get to 60 and if you're a certain level you must be a loser with no life, while the people saying that were supposed winners.
---
What I think happened? He probably realised that all this was getting out of hand like it possibly has before. But I hope you get an answer so you don't have to worry.
---
This wasn’t changed until one of the more recent expansions (wood maybe?).
---
Just a thought, and apologies if anyone else has raised this, but when you click on the link to report a 'real life threat', the language on the page doesn't lead me to think (had I not seen the above post), that this would be the way to go about raising a concern. Maybe an extra paragraph might make it clearer?
---
Shots fired at Ghostcrawler?
---
the fact that you think this is a D3 demon hunter is really funny lmao
---
What's with the insults? I'm trying to bridge a gap and you're trying to destroy it for what purpose? Once again, you're going on a technicality that might not even be true. Even the dictionary definition doesn't agree with you. 
---
Automatic: largely or wholly involuntary.
---
If it isnt cheating why do people get banned for it
---
It seems like you’d have to be a weird mental state to assume that someone is in need of help based on one post and telling other people with more realistic explanations and reasons to fuck off, but that’s just me.
---
This post is going to stand the test of time.
---
Almost everyone naturally hates their jobs and school, people who work too much also "sabotaged their own life" by the exact opposite of playing any game or other entertainment activity.
---
In order for something to qualify as a addiction, it requires that the person is physically incapable of ever at any time becoming bored of the activity or ever voluntarily doing something else for awhile, aka it has to be a compulsive problem.
---
If someone is just naturally looking for entertainment and stress relief from work/school it doesn't qualify as addiction, but it's definitely an addiction and real problem for people who are prone to becoming compulsively hooked on something.
---
&gt; Then **you use a program to mimic your keypresses on each instance of the game.** You press ctrl+1, its inputs to all wow windows
---
^ That's. Botting.

fake and gay

Maybe he doesn’t view the game and his guild as that important, I realize that people become close with their guild mates but maybe he just didn’t

Go find 3 mages and a priest and spam SM. 33-42 goes by so fast!
---
Man.. I've never played a Blizzard game (here from /r/all) but this makes me want to go out and buy one.
---
I’ve been doing it for years.  I do it BECAUSE it’s hard.  I get little joy outside of pain.  A heroic raid is dull.  A Classic five man (not boxed) is just easy and dull.  I feel alive in Mythic and boxing when I’m on the edge of my seat.
---
How should I assign my warrior talents? I was going full protection because I like to tank dungeons with my priest friend. However everyone tells me it’s not worth it and to just wear a shield thats it. So I’m guessing that leaves fury and arms? How should I do it up while leveling and remaining good to tank? I’m lvl 23 now
---
&gt;Why can't it be thought of as a keyboard with a 5 way splitter. 
---
Because that's the problem...

Y'all bitch year after year about how shit retail is and now you get pissy when people bitch about what they dislike is classic? Tsk
---
I’m so confused right now.
---
they will get 1 banned month

I seriously doubt "every way I know to reach him" means messaging through Battle.net and nothing else.

I mean you did also come back and keep trying 10 times

All's fair in pvp my main man
---
This is super cool!  The crossbow definitely looks like the Buriza, which is a nice detail if thats the case.  Good on your friend!  Do they have an insta or somewhere with more art?
---
Maraudon is a three winged dungeon with the purple section, the orange section and the inner section. Purple and Orange have separate entrances, but both led to the poison falls where you turn in the scepter quest. Although it's connected with the other two, the inner wing is considered a separate section because if a team is after the princess they will open a portal and go in directly. It could've become a separate wing if the scepter quest had been designed to turn in to the dryad npc where you accept the quest.

Does nobody find it funny when you run into one? My friends think it's funny as hell trying to plan coordinated attacks so one of the accounts dies.

For tethering you should check out an app called pdanet. It will hide your tethering usage from your phone company so you dont get charged extra. 
---
As for the connection, you're not going to see much difference tethering over wifi or through usb. It all depends on your phones data signal. Getting an LTE router wont make that connection any stronger or more stable.
---
Rock paper scissors... is balanced though.  Balance doesnt mean that every spec of every class is equally likely to win 1v1, but rather than (realistically) most of the specs in each class provide roughly equal value.

I may be stupid but isn't it interesting to actually compete and do something challenging and not camp low level players? I just don't see why you would camp except for making people salty. I am salty but not like it's ruining my day. He made me swithc, so good for him. I guess.

Sounds like what you're saying is that what they're doing is ok.

Another "warlocks life tap" thread.  Is this the new meta?

Spend money to make money. 40% increase in speed should result in better gold farming, whole the pants will probably only marginally effect how fast you can kill stuff. I'd go mount.
---
Don't bring shit DPS ?
---
Shamans should know where to put totems. Hunters should know when to put a pet on passive. Mages should know when not to AOE.
---
This is like tanks knowing when to use a shield.
---
I’m playing a firemage and getting the same sort of banter.. like don’t you get that some people wanna enjoy the journey
---
I honestly don't.  I only first noticed it while in Ironforge smelting, but I had done instances a bit before that.  It's very possible it's related to getting MC'd like you say.
---
I have a low tolerance for stupidity and / or people who feign ignorance to progress their arguments. Your either playing dumb or you are dumb and I want neither part of it.
---
If you’re using multiboxing to quest, you’ve got the patience of a saint.  Every PVE boxer I know jumps into instances ASAP.  Questing is insanely dull multiboxed.
---
Well, this is potential for a great ClassicWoW AMA!
---
I hope you find some answers and your friend is okay.
---
I fully agree. I even notice my own gaming habits adjust over time based on how other aspects of my life are going. I took a 5 year break from WoW (Early Cata-&gt;Late WoD) to spend the time I needed to sort other stuff out and build new habits. Gave away over a million gold (before all the inflation expansions) split among a few game friends who were kind to me over the years.
---
&gt; In retail like 90% of talents are either never used or only have a single use case.
---
This is the exception rather then the rule. For some classes this can be true, but for a lot of them half the talents can change depending on the fight.
---
Talents also interface really well with the Azerite Gear, which means different talent builds become more or less viable with different azerite gear. This is also compoinded with the 8.2 Essences, which have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the encounter.
---
&gt; Also most of my point was that they actually restrict abilities that used to be defining for each class to only be accessible in a certain spec. Like how we used to have all our abilities except some talent abilities. Now if you’re a resto druid you don’t get all the abilities for feral or guardian or balance. At best you can get a watered down version by taking 1 of the affinity talents.
---
You wont really see defend this. Retail class design, while not the all time low, has been pretty bad this expansion. The game feels more like it has 36  classes rather then specs.
---
No, but I can see how an Alliance player might tolerate gnome or of these observations.
---
I love seeing other people’s hot keys.
---
I never seem to be happy with mine.

That's why we shit on the company as a whole and mourn the loss of the mod staff.

Gave me a laugh, friend. Haha and good on you not kicking em that was nice.
---
&gt;While MC'd, my group of friends of course decided to nuke me down asap, but for some reason when I died, my pet just stuck around and kept DPS'ing, even though I was dead. 
---
If this is true, I'd like you to report this as a bug. If this **really** happened, the encounter itself is bugged, and that might have been the catalyst for what happened. If you're unsure why, **you are not supposed to die to the mind control, no matter what**. When a player hits 50% health while possessed by her, the effect ends, and **you receive a full heal**, this is the correct behaviour, and I personally have never seen anything different happen before. If you really died while she was possessing you, that might have somehow confused the game since your pet was out, and you were technically a hostile unit while dying.

Lvl 52 here haven’t grinded a single mob yet. I find that most people are just too lazy to travel from different zones. There are plenty of quest to level you. I’ve also yet do a single dungeon more then twice and I really only ran them to do quest. Play and explore if you don’t wanna grind mobs because you don’t have to grind mobs outside of questing unless your lazy.
---
Hey Araxom, thanks for being amazing.  I see you posting on more then half of all these threads.
---
Yep, I hear you. I’m a software engineer, but a company I was with a few years ago had team members do CS rotations. (Tangent—this was so that the CS team would always have one highly technical member who could dig into the deeper issues. The company had finally adopted these rotations after the 100th engineer inevitably lost his/her mind and delivered the “get me off this team or I quit” ultimatum.)
---
The root cause always comes down to [Goodhart’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law). The support backlog begins to get a bit too large for comfortable operations, so the COO/VP of operations comes up with metrics to track the efficiency of CS staff. Now the CS staff has been incentivized to do their job poorly and the problem is only exacerbated.

**Goodhart's law**
---
Goodhart's law is an adage named after economist Charles Goodhart, which has been phrased by Marilyn Strathern as "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." One way in which this can occur is individuals trying to anticipate the effect of a policy and then taking actions that alter its outcome.

It's a good thing you're taking this seriously, but as someone who's dealt with a lot of mental illness and have a lot of experience with it in my friends, a very common way of 'lashing out' with depression is self-destruction. Whereas someone with anger issues might punch a hole in a wall when they top over, a person in a particularly bad depressive episode will convince themselves to delete all their friends, or delete the project they've put hours into, or throw away their entire sketchbook. And you almost never tell anyone beforehand, because you don't want to deal with people over it. I've done it myself; there's something weirdly cathartic about it. Destroying the things you care about feels good in a way because it's like you're letting go of all these people you fail and all these things you can't do. Then of course, you usually regret it later.
---
This seems to match up pretty well - again, it's good you're taking this seriously, but there's a fair chance that this is what's going on. Hope things end well for you.
---
They are evade bugging guards.

Thanks!

Doing the Gurubashi Arena chest is really weird too. My friend and I will walk over there and check out who else is waiting.. we saw a level 60 mage. Whispered him, 'hey, going for chest? :/' because us lowly level 45s wanted to get it too. He says yes, so we kind of just sigh.. oh well, not this time. My friend says 'hey im almost to the arena, inv', so i invite them. and bam, i change layers and that 60 mage is gone, and now we are by ourselves. It's honestly really, really stupid if you ask me. It destroys the entire purpose of the game. It's one game world. That's why I like to play.
---
His name MUST be some variation of "Legolas", this is crucial!
---
&gt; The definition of automated is having the program play the game FOR you
---
&gt; You use a program to mimic your keypresses on each instance of the game. You press ctrl+1, its inputs to all wow windows
---
That's a program playing the game for you. That's botting. You did not send 5 commands to result in 5 actions. You sent one and it resulted in 5 actions. 
---
You're justifying the use of third party software to gain an unfair advantage by allowing one input to result in multiple outputs instead of a single output as is developed for and intended by the game developers. 
---
It's cheating. End of story. Twist it however you want to try to help you sleep at night, but you're still cheating.
---
Shishimo the mage on Skeram hordeside, we're looking at you.
---
Joins an arena to emp run, gets the benthok belt from arena and magically disappeares after coincidentally asking the question "how many bosses are we doing?" Only to magically resurface approximately 12 minutes later in LFG looking for a UBRS Run. Only to respond with "I dcd", to which we enlightened him we didn't kick him for almost 10 minutes, to which he responded "you mad?"
---
As long as blizzard hides poll results it'll be great lol

This is honestly my favorite RTV spawn point, unless you're a mage/rogue it can be tough to get there without items and you can usually find a few skeletons around from brave players that have made the attempt unprepared. It's on the main path so anyone with mining will notice it and take interest, but not a lot brave the attempt. 
---
I've slow fallen down there and found people mid-mining, and I honestly can't imagine their reaction when they get instantly PoM sheep'd from a gnome mid-air, and have the node stolen right from under their noses. 
---
On the other side I've gotten down there safely, and had epic fights with Rogues/Hunters that can FD/Vanish and have 2-3 giants smash me to bits. 
---
That one spawn point has given me so much fun in this game.
---
Higher level tigers have higher drop chance. I'd probably just level and save, you'll get good cash from quests 33-40, then worry about gold farming once you're 38 or so.
---
I struggled with the same stuff back in vanilla. You gotta pick one character and stick to it all the way through. The longer you spend leveling alts, the less time you'll have to level your main. 
---
When you find yourself wanting to switch to an alt, try changing up your play. Go run a dungeon or switch questing zones. Try to sell some stuff on the AH. Any time you spend on your main is more valuable than time you spend on an alt.
---
&gt; Could it overtake retail? 
---
Only in the minds of the retail-hater cult.
---
Classic is fun, to a point. Populations are already dropping, as layering is being reduced and queues are less common.
---
Classic will have its niche (and be something for Retail players to do during content lulls), but it won't ever be the mainstream game it was again.
---
No its not Blizzard stated this so many times: One input, one action PER client..
---
Unrealistic image, devilsaurs are perma spawn camped so you will never get chased by one.
---
I modified it for Sacrifice, everything works except when I get damage from spell/dots the absorb bar disappears instantly.
---
I biomassed two accounts worth of characters from 2009 last year. I had to rip out the needle. No regrets. 
---
Gave all of my ISK to my corp.

Being outnumbered just means there's more targets...

Does the trick work with mobs? Like if I FD and my pet is passive but being attacked it presumably stays in combat yeah?
---
You don't get honour. And yu are literally doing nothing but waiting for someone to respawn. And you are not running SM as you are too high to profit. And you are nor famrimng as you are standing here. Isn't it just... boring? Like twinking in dark souls?
---
I’m in the same boat! Also a warlock looking for alts and trying to decide haha.
---
My plan is to just play Druid, mage, shaman, and priest for a while until I get to about level 20 and decide after getting some experience on the class. If I decide to go farther then I’ve gone my pick.
---
On behalf of all of us struggling with this, thank you.

I'm still waiting on my dopamine fix from getting the Warglaives of Azzinoth despite raiding BT religiously on my Rogue back in the day...

Yeah, I’m admin of a film forum and one of our members a few years ago suddenly asked who wanted all his bonus ratio on a private tracker site. Everyone started grabbing for it until one guy asked why. He casually replied he was going to kill himself. He never posted or came online again, that was in 2013. This kind of behavior really scares me, but I hope it turns out ok in OP’s case.
---
Lmao you people need to either get lives. Or end them!
---
No.

You missed the bit about 'Be aware how much threat I generate, so I stay under the tank's aggro limit'.

Or are you not looking for a guide for a *good* fury warrior ?

I think it's fine and I switch builds 3 times a week so I feel the cost but as others have said it's an important gold sink otherwise this time next year, we'll be millionaires Rodney.

I have spawn of hakkar, the rake and deathmaw. Can't abandon any really.

And I think some of the actual "achievement" sets are ugly as hell. Giant axes on your shoulders is a joke. I'd love to put the same stats on something that doesn't make me look like I'm some circus side show reject. *For my next trick I will juggle onions and chop them with my shoulder axes!*

Suggestion: use an appropriate day each year, maybe if a “Suicide Prevention Day” exists, or just make one up yourself, and broadcast the fuck out of this message to your users. Reading this made me realize as nothing else could that blizzard is nothing but a building full of sympathetic human beings who have the ways and means and intention to help their players. That’s a very comforting feeling.
---
Hey man I wasn't assuming anything.  Just letting you know it's usually considered just fine to reach out on reddit if you just need help.   But honestly it just seems like taking the time out of your day to type up that whole thing just to try and shame op would be a waste of your time.  It comes off as a bit of a cry for help and you're in a thread full of thoughtful redditors who just want to help.

You're the kind of guy who has multiple reddit accounts to downvote someone several times

Don’t forget to check train your pets. I meet a lot of hunters that don’t know they have to train other pets to leathered abilities.

This.  I have like 5 people I talk to all the time via text, fb, Instagram, whatever it may be, that I met playing online and never in person.  We’re very good friends despite no face to face contact.

Obviously since I said its a pain in the ass for me and id rather quest.
---
Had some warrior trying this in leather/mail to “maximise his threat”  full drink every pull, first boss in udstrat took 30mins to get to.
---
Hearthed my ass out of there, felt bad for everyone else but fk wasting 3 hours in a single ud strat run.  Make sure your in full level appropriate plate before trying this.

In phase 3 when battlegrounds come in yes of course it will be possible

"Chandler , oh no, have you seen Marcel? A hunter is nothing without his pet!" "Marcel? Marcel? Gooood monkey! " "oh Marcel why'd you leave me!?"

Good point.

Blizzard. Multiple examples of it, but basically the GM's have clarified that Blizzard's official position is that 1 human action = 1 character action in game. [For example.](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2723273724)
---
It has never been reconciled why multi-boxing isn't considered a violation of this rule, officially.
---
Remember the BC "I'm painfully level 61" look? Ah, those were the days. My lock had a damn sombrero for awhile. Then I think I "upgraded" to a pimp hat for a short while.
---
Yeah, it’s a form of balance. I agree. Classic has a form of balance. I don’t like retail’s balance. It’s just making everyone the same and everyone does roughly the same damage etc.
---

All of them? Most classes can handle a single elite of their level without close to BiS gear.
---
So you can pay more to make you be 3v1 in a 1v1 situation against an enemy player, this is literally pay to win.
---
Incorrect, it’s an intended game mechanic. The guards are resetting as per usual. 
---
I understand your frustration but nothing that they’re doing is against TOS. They’re not even doing anything that you couldn’t do. 
---
You can ignore it, remove yourself from the situation, kill them, or reroll on a PVE server.

This is pure

Yeah, that part irritates me. I don't want to heal. I'd like ret for PVP, and prot for dungeons and off tank raiding. :/
---
This was my first time finding it (finding thorium is absurdly hard), but as you say it was very interactive even on the first attempt.
---
For once I didn't get robbed by fellow hordes and could actually do something about it.
---
Notice how I didn't say "WOW THEY WERE ALL PROBABLY RIGHT"? I'm not a child, I'm a grown ass man who can think logically. I figured blizzards professionalism wouldn't allow a mistake THIS silly to get past, so my mindset has changed.
---
Simplest explanation is that it's just a target identifier for a spell you intend on casting.  I can make a macro that says "/cast \[target=supafly208\] Regrowth" and regardless of what I'm currently targeting it will cast a Regrowth on you.  Focus, in post vanilla content, has it's own identifier.  I can set you as focus by having you targeted and hitting a macro "/focus" and now you are my focus target.  We can take the macro I used earlier to cast regrowth on you and change it to "/cast \[target=focus\] Regrowth" and it does the same thing because YOU are now FOCUS.  Focus adds the benefit of... say you're not main tanking the next dungeon I do so I just /focus the new tank. Now I don't have to change my healing macro with the new tank's name, I just assign him as FOCUS.  The most common uses of this is for CCing mobs. as a mage I might set my focus to the Polymorph target I'm assigned in the Domo fight to re-poly it without dropping current target. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In vanilla you could do the same exact thing with a few extra steps.  There was no default /focus, instead you created it with scripts.  You didn't have to name it focus, and you could create the same functionality with multiple different names if you wanted.  When they changed the way this whole thing worked, it was because they wanted to eliminate automation through scripts that could choose what spells you cast based on conditions.  HOWEVER - they added focus functionality because the anti-automation changes they made broke the ability to use these focus modifiers and they wanted us to have it.
---
Is there some addon to make the Pets energy management smarter? For example so that it prioritizes Bite over claw? After the first bite, My pet keeps spending all energy on claw, so that when bite goes off cooldown, it never has enough energy to cast it 2nd time.
---
 Incorrect again. 
---
Nobody in 15 years has ever been banned from jumping on boxes and pvping.

You can have a fear button and put the curse castsequence on shift and you get the best of both worlds.

Odds of two people rolling the same number twice in a row is 1 in 10,000. 
---
Odds of specifically rolling 1 &amp; 2 is 1 in 5,000
---
So combining that we get 
---
1 in 50,000,000 for 2 people to roll the same number twice in a row and then roll a 1 and 2
---
I haven’t, but noted! Haha

A bot is an autonomous program that can interact with computer systems. Autonomous systems have an AI component that function without the behest or input of a human operator. You are making a long leap going from an artificial intelligence making autonomous decisions and 'I press a key on my keyboard and multiple windows see it at the same time'.
---
Pressing one key on a computer and having it land in two windows is not an autonomous system. Commands are not being sent, keystrokes are being sent as they are pressed by the human operator. A key is pressed on the keyboard, and the client is responding with whatever macro you wrote with the in-game macro API. You understand how this is different, right? The in-game macros being run are local within the game client's API and follow all of the restrictions imposed by the client. There is no orchestration of keys from any software arbitration layer. The control is 100% in the hands of the player.
---
If your argument of what constitutes a bot comes down to the the ability to press multiple keys within a short period of time, then what happens when I take a plank of wood with three standoffs on it and sit it across three of the laptops. Now when I press that plank, all three keyboards press the same key at the same time. Have I developed a wood-based artificial intelligence system?
---
I mean you understand where I'm going with this, right? No matter how fast I send a command, I am still the one sending the command. I am making the decision of which key to press, and I am pressing it. A bot is an autonomous system that is making decisions and generating input without the behest of a human operator. Having one key press land in three separate windows, be it from one person with an unusually large hand, three close really small keyboards, a piece of wood sitting across three keyboards at the same time, or a piece of software making that keystroke land in three separate windows are all functionally the same concept. And none of them are autonomous.
---
You can dislike multi-boxing. I don't like it when I get ganked by 5 shamen with sequential names, and I also don't like the overhead required when doing it myself (again... months ago on a private server out of curiosity). But none of this makes it a form of botting. You can argue that it's not fair, which could be argued more objectively. The arguement that this is a form of botting doesn't hold water.
---
The same command to multiple programs.
---
Why is it a stretch? The comparison started because he claimed spending a lot of time in WoW is insane because you can't take a break. I pointed out that that's untrue and the only time it's tricky to leave is if you're doing group content, but there's group activities in real life like Sport so I don't see why it's a big deal.
---
What are these endless dailies in Classic? All these mechanism in place to keep people logging in each day are absolutely in retail, but this is Classic. There's barely anything aside from getting to 60 and getting some gear. 
---
If someone actually feels they're missing out and can't cope like you say, that's on them. It's a 15 year old game, everyone can look up and see exactly where the game is going to go and where it's going to end, it's not 2005 where the future is a mystery, hence there's no reason to feel like you're going to miss out.
---
Wait how much gold?
---
They usually seem to like it.
---
Ofc there was that one tauren who started spamming /gasp and /rude while punching me, made my day.
---
What's the difference?  Just not counting overheal?
---
Huh, haven't considered that in terms of gearing. I guess I've been thinking of it from a PUG perspective, but if I were to raid with mostly guild members, that's true.
---
And you’re not only stupid but wrong
---
They deployed a hotfix for that didn't they?
---
You can make your own private server to dick around on and they have target dummies on GM island.  This is using the 1.12 client.   Not sure when they made them available to regular players though.
---
Uh oh im gettin flash backs from that skyrim story its all going black no no NOOO
---
So it's turning one input into multiple?
---
Really? I went through all of vanilla not know you could do that. That's actually really cool.
---
I already have haha.
---
Builds brand recognition.  It's the same reason radio stations constantly stop to call out the name of the radio station you are already listening to.
---
People that are there purposefully don't need to be reminded who they are watching but those that are flipping through streamers or who catch a replay like this get to see that name recognition.  There's a marketing addage about "if your name is seen in 3 places before someone visits your (shop, stream, channel) they are X times more likely to stay/buy/invest".  I might be slightly butchering that but anyways it's just a proven marketing scheme for brand recognition and retaining new audience members through familiarity.
---
It’s cos these drops are not for virgins
---
!Remind Me 7 days
---
Sure it’s a dick move, but it’s not cheating in any regard. You’re more of a dick for spreading misinformation, and also wasting GM’s times with a report.
---
It’s like going to the police because someone didn’t smile back at you.
---
Maybe you should leave the guy alone instead of making a huge event out of it. Jesus Christ. Respect your friend's privacy.
---
2 pulls into an ST group our mage says "sorry guys baby aggro" and drops group. 5 minutes later he's running BRD...
---
This is so incredible to read, coming from a brand new WoW player. Knowing that the game developers not only care for and love their game, but also their players, is amazing. You're a good person, /u/Araxom.
---
I can't tell the difference between a dwarf and a drunk gnome
---
Yeah, I like farming those Hederine slayers in Winterspring and that node spawns very close to them so I usually see a bit of action around there. 
---
I swear there must be some guide/streamer advertising that area in Winterspring, because every 10-15minutes a level 60 will come by on their mount following basically the same path the others have, and I can only imagine they're looking for ore since the NPC spawns down there are a bitch to kill.
---
No wonder she is your ex, no way you could ever compete with that alpha chad. You probably piss in a toilet and wash your hands, FUCKING LEL
---
This was exactly my thought when I joined the server and I had it at 35
---
Same. Opening up Q and E as key binds is so much easier on the left hand, and gives you so many more options for quick abilities between alt-Q, alt-E, shift-Q, shift-E, etc
---
Literally the first time i've heard chud, you're so much better.
---
Every "guide" is bad and they all have tons of copy/pasting cause the same people always make 20 different guides.
---
Then tons of people blindly follow these guides.
---
It's disgusting.
---
This is very nice. One of my favorite parts of the game is the nighttime and grey rainy days.
---
Awesome, it suppose to be awesome for battleground because it can confuse your opponent on what form you are on.
---
Ain’t nobody paying 5-10g for a SM tank when they’re all saving for mounts bruh.
---
Each client has one keyboard interface and a single action is taken as the result of each individual key press seen by the client. The action taken is typically a macro involving multiple lines as allowed by the client's macro API.
---
I definitely watched multiple streamers tanking with fury prot dual weild in rag and ony with no problems hell, I'm level 40 and doing it with no problems
---
Feral's actually a god-awful 1v1 spec.  You can basically only kill rogues and warriors right now assuming the opposing target isn't drastically lower than your skill level.
---
Here I my brief thoughts:
---
If the player didn't write anything indicating self-harm, people need to mind their own business. People's privacy need to be respected.
---
This is how Etika got random wellness checks that literally pushed him over the line. 
---
Respect. People's. Privacy.
---
What an elitist tool, must be salty about playing as a plate wearing magic warrior that uses two healing spells all raid
---
You must be a lot of fun at parties, if you are ever invited to any that is. Have fun rotting in your bedroom :)
---
I did the same thing. I was playing for 12 hours a day and it really started to effect my social life and grades.  My body turned to shit and i fell into a huge suicidal spiral. My guild was the best horde-side on the server though.
---
Now I'm married with 3 kids, stopped smoking, I have and use a gym membership, I run a successful farm, and might spend an hour every other week playing video games now.
---
It's a mechanic. You have to play to the mechanic. Classic WoW was not a forgiving game. It's coded as intended.
---
It will get better, but most likely not until battlegrounds come out
---
I actually did something similar with my guild on Saturday. It was a 60% mount race from Booty Bay to Undercity. Weapons and trinkets only, class speed boosts and potions allowed. The spirit res trick was by far the best way to get ahead.
---
well then you haven't been following this sub very closely, ever since classic came out griefers have been complaining that GM's are banning them for terrain exploiting for jumping on thongs and using them to evade guards.
---
Trust me I know the feeling. The only reason why I rolled pvp was because all my friends did and they all quit...
---
I saw this on all, never played the game, but this is magnificent to see. I hope everything works out for everybody.
---
haha thanks for the trouble!

Your premise is generally right.  It’s not like there are no benefits to boxing.  However, it’s also a matter of “don’t knock it ‘til you try it.”
---
Do you have a derpy DPS PUG sometimes?  Sure.  I’ve got a derpy rogue every time though.  He has no clue he needs to be behind his target.  I cannot just leave that part of my mind on autopilot—unless healing through cleave damage won’t matter.
---
Do I ever have to wonder about the tank pulling when the healer is OOM?  Not generally—we won’t talk about what happens when I’m tired.  However, I know few tanks that would be slow to maneuver a mob because the healer is moving their cursor to heal another target.
---
I further spent easily a hundred hours over the past year on macros, setup, addons, etc. to make multiboxing in Live and Classic work.  Thankfully, the macro UI was hijacked from Live, so I was able to “steal” some of that work for Classic.
---
In short, I am utterly convinced that if your goal is to get to 60 and raid/PVP or anything at a world-class competitive level, multiboxing is a bad call.  If you’re looking to level alts AND are good at boxing, yea there is some upside there.  
---
If we could just get multiboxing broken in PVP, the only upside (besides the intrinsic goal of multiboxing because multiboxing is fun) would be the super casual element of leveling, and to be clear, it’s more stressful to do instances than solo play even the worst classes (Warrior/Rogue).  So multiboxing just becomes a way to arbitrage stress for time.
---
Given how much fun I like farming, making gold, and all that. Is it really just worth it to go mage/hunter?
---
Happens to me pretty frequently as well!
---
Wow I just read the most cringiest comments on the most cringiest subject ever. Someone you don't correspond with AT ALL NOT EVEN ON DISCORD isn't a friend. Dude probably dipped on the game. This is insane breach of privacy, I'd be actually upset if people dug into why I quit a game. Guess what? If anything serious was going on, even if it was mental related, someone who I correspond with outside of the game would likely and/or notice me missing. This is so weird that this is a concern. I bet if I clicked op's history, this is the first time he's had a friend delete an online account and probably isn't too old to understand how these things work. It's a bit socially awkward, this.
---
Now cue all the fucking angry people telling us realistic folk I'm a heartless toxic person for differing opinions on someone's privacy.
---
I get that you can be worried about someone but I see no reason to be worried about this person. We are moving goalposts here if deleting a toon is weird. did the dude say anything weird or do anything else weird or do we know if he has moved accounts or servers? Seriously.
---
Random people walk up to me, and give me armor and bags, buff me, and talk. Idc how much harder it is, as just having a sense of community back has made my time in classic great. I wish it the best.
---
I love this so much. I guarantee your friend values the action you took much more than you'll ever know.
---
I played on a pvp server from vanilla all the way on. If youre really into pvp i guess it could get fun but most of the time youll just get so resentful that youll do the same at 60. Personally i hated it so much, but it wont stop you from getting 60 or anything just keep at it if youre having fun with your toons.
---
If the group wipes, then everyone runs back.  If a DPS dies because they pulled aggro, but everyone else lived, let them run back?
---
seriously thought IBB was referring to your guild
---
Inb4 neither of them proc...ever. jk, grats dude
---
What feral druids want from MC? I guess they don't let you roll on dps feral gear but that goes to rogues/hunters etc ? (I mean its not like everyone needs to be optimized 100 % for old nerfed raids )
---
all that...one ore
---
When enough people see it.
---
Is your weapon skill in crossbows significantly lower than bows?
---
Do you take durability loss if you died using the gnomish death ray?
---
&gt;of each individual key press seen by the client
---
Ok so if I have 10 accounts and I want to move all of them forward one step do I have to press W once or 10 times?
---
I haven’t been able to find anything online about it so I figured I’d come here. Do you just have to reboot your game too?
---
&gt;Has anyone else been in a similar situation?
---
Yes and I absolutely love it. This is what draws me to world PvP and why I'll always roll on PvP servers. 
---
But if it's not for you, you can always reroll on a PvE server, even though 36/30 seems like a big investment, it will only get worse if you grind it out on a server you dislike.
---
you have to spend a lifetime grinding mobs to get to that point, most people don't bother because just doing all the quests there don't even get you halfway there.
---
Played with an Inlè on Hyjal back in teh day.
---
Ten days played and I work full time, averaged 50 hours a week since release....
---
Your very selective definition of botting doesn't float, sorry. Your bot software is autonomously creating more than one result fron a single input. You coded it before hand to do so. It's a bot. 
---
&gt; Pressing one key on a computer and having it land in two windows is not an autonomous system
---
Yes it is. It's literally exactly that for one instance and a passthrough for another. Add three more characters and you're botting 4 accounts with one master. It's **still botting.**
---
&gt; There is no orchestration of keys from any software arbitration layer.
---
You literally just described how there is. You're creating multiple outputs from a single input. That's **botting.**
---
You're twisting your logic in circles to justify botting. Sorry Charlie, it's botting.
---
I think it's been like 12 years since I've seen this... Anyone remember the warlocks name?
---
Yes. I got feared by a priest and couldn’t do anything
---
&gt; I have 5 hunters as well. It’s not hard.
---
So, is your argument that just playing 1 character is hard then? Because my argument isn't whether or not playing 5 characters is hard. It's that it's harder than playing 1 character. Because overall, WoW is a casual cake walk.
---
I agree that giving away your possessions is a sign that you might be planning to take your own life. But deleting your WoW AND discord account seems like you just want to stop playing the game. Maybe I'm being optimistic here but I'm leaning towards agreeing with the people saying he just wanted to quit the game. That behaviour is more in line with cutting off people who enable you in your addiction.
---
Yes I have to reboot
---
Dang I gotta look into this. Thanks for the tip!
---
As someone who has tried to kill themselves before, go fuck yourself
---
I cut my family because I thought it would stop them from hurting. I cut them out because I loved and cared for them. Your opinion just makes you look like a twat
---
Always played on PVP servers, so ofc i rolled on a pvp server in classic
---
got my warrior to lvl 30, got spawncamped ganked annihilated an entire weekend, got about ½ a lvl that weekend.
---
Rerolled on a normal server, best decision ever!
---
I wish my guild would allow a shadow priest to raid. I’ll never get my dream weapon :(
---
Gz to him.
---
I’m a lady, but thank you!!! 😱😊
---
Gathering shellfish in desolace was my jam. I think I hit 39 with about 25 gold and grinded out the 70 more I needed for mount and level 49 talents in a day and a half.
---
Lv20 Mage here in the new EU Spanish server - And feeling like I will never reach 22 for some AOE leveling.
---
Semantics.
---
**Its allowed**. Its still botting. You aren’t directly inputing to each individual screen.
---
People don’t like botters.
---
So people don’t like multiboxers.
---
Its ALWAYS been looked down upon by players. Just because blizzard allows it doesn’t change that fact. People hate multiboxers. This thread explains why. They can “solo” party content, they get ALL the loot from x accounts (which in turn leads to people like the dude who got banned and then unbanned who “only” had ~5k gold from multiboxing.), you have a shit time in wpvp, and hell even BGs with pugs. Nothing about multiboxing is a positive for community, it only serves to benefit blizzard and the multiboxer.  No amount of co-ordination can match instantcast 5+ on target, with the ability to change targets with absolutely no party communication, and once again instantly cast. It won’t ever be “fair” to play against multiboxers.
---
yet not in classic.... (yet?)
---
The feign death fake out fail lmao.
---
a big problem a lot of people are making on this thread as they are treating someone deleting a toon like the statement your friend made when all we know is they deleted a toon. this person didn't correspond with this person outside of the game or even on discord apparently, or Bnet IRL, so dude could still be playing the game. Lol
---
There is so many times when mining shows me bright yellow but I CANT FIND GOD DAMN NODE .... Its like its in the mountain or something smh
---
I'm dual weild tanking in my 40s right now with no issues. I've got the sword and board macros on standby just in case and always communicate with my healer and tell them that if I don't notice they're going oom trying to keep me up to whisper me and I'll swap to sword and board. So far I get added to friends lists after almost every run because I have no trouble holding threat and they have no trouble keeping me up
---
I have no idea what point you’re driving at, have a terrible day
---
I've been grinding away in Tanaris on Bigglesworth, and only twice have I met with lethal force from the Horde. Everyone seems content to let the poor Gnome warrior do his thing. I've even helped Hordies, in hopes that they help me back. Some have. It's been a great time.
---
I tried a friends superbike and hit some ridiculous speeds... I wanted one so badly after but I had to resist because I would have died 100%.
---
If it was, it failed.
---
Is that an orchestral, slow version of the GoT title song? I love it, matches really well with WoW.
---
Go fuck yourself dude. It's a game, and this is Reddit.
---
This is my concern, how fun can world pvp be if its 5:1
---
Good bot
---
Thanks! Finding conflicting info on this through google so it’s frustrating.  I guess I just miss a lot because I’m level 14 and a noob =]
---
Bit of a generalisation, I think we have a vocal minority of people who actually care. I've never multi-boxd past lvl 5 to see what it was about. It really doesn't phase me..
---
If you think playing 40 hours a week is not wrecking your life no matter what you're doing (beside generating money from playing, granted), then ohhh boy.
---
Depends.  I don't really need innervate to spam r4 HT on my tanks, so I give it out to a priest.  That priest will usually destroy me in overall healing and that's fine.  
---
I had a situation where a shaman healer died on pull on Domo, I Brezed him instantly had to NS + max HT heal the main tank and follow it up with a regrowth as a fast, high throughput heal.  That left me with like... half mana at the very beginning of Domo and I was babysitting the MT.  I use innervate on myself because I absolutely need it and crushed everyone on the healing meters at the end.
---
Also, you’re not going to have any material market impact from multiboxing.  You’re talking about less than one percent of the WoW populace.  We don’t move the needle of the market.
---
I've solo tanked rag &amp; baron as a feral druid multiple time, main tanked golemagg etc.
---
It's the mentality and toxicity behind it. I don't give a fuck about what you choose to do in groups you've set up specifically and clearly for whatever crazy stuff you want to do. As long as everyone is in on it, fine, go nuts.
---
But it's the drooling masses who latch on to whatever "meta strat" is popular in Twitch and refuse to do anything else *even when they're obviously doing it poorly* and who just use and abuse PuGs who aren't part of their little clique that drive me up the wall.
---
you need to have it on MT, but otherwise it's pretty useless. It's just here so you have time to use heal rank whatever.
---
Nice. I think you just sold me a razor naga
---
Oh boy, this one again. It's been against the rules since 2005. Blue post from Caydiem
---
&gt;There has been some confusion in regards to whether or not the act of "rooftop camping", or killing players while using geometry to avoid the town guards, is allowed. We will no longer condone this act in game. Players who participate in this method of PvP will be given a warning and educated on this new policy, and further action will be taken as circumstances warrant. We wish to provide a fair playing field to our customers, and this abuse of game mechanics has been hampering that effort.
---
    &gt;Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

---
and then you get to 60 and realize that you have huge competition for gear, raid spots and become a worse dps as the phases come out.
---
Yup your right!
---
So fury prot actually generates more threat than deep prot, deep prot just has better damage mitigation. If you have the gold, go fury prot and see how you do, if you're taking way too much damage even with the shield equipped and your healers are having trouble keeping you up then go deep prot until you have better gear
---
Wait for them to leave or ask for help in the chat but it's one of the downsides (or upsides) to playing a pvp server. It gets better. 
---
I have this memory of players gaining dishonor points for killing other players much lower than them in vanilla... I could be mistaken.
---
No, it won't get better.
---
It was always like this.
---
If you don't like i, bite the bullet and reroll on a PvE server.
---
They didnt like becoming mounts. Now they are even more dangerous.
---
For what it’s worth I’ve taken out two elites at level 25 as a warlock, one was level 22 and I didn’t even get touched, one was level 24 and my pet nearly died and it got a few shots on me.
---
You don't have enough talent points in classic to get both SL's. You have to pick one.
---
It's really not that bad. No talent tree or spec makes it impossible to do level some just make it easier. If you wanna switch up specs alot you can it's really not that much gold until you respec 3 or 4 times which honestly you shouldn't be doing pre 60. First respec is what 1g so basically free, then 5g a little pricey but still not bad at all, then it's 10g at this point you should have a spec you want to play figured out that will keep deep into the 40s or all the into 60.

Educate yourself.
---
I’ve played with at least a few hunters who have no pet spells except growl at level 30...
---
*Doesn't let the tank pull and gain aggro.* Yea, the mage is at fault here.
---
probably could have been clearer, but yeah you definitely want a fast pet. Outside of a 1v1 that drags out though the difference between 1.0 and 1.2 barely matters and same thing with claw vs bite. Most of the time your pet will end up cc'd before the second or third claw would have gone out
---
Maybe he just doesn't want to play the damn game anymore. Gaming addiction is real.
---
I too believe everything I read on the internet from random people 100%.
---
I did on WoW. Twice. One time I undeleted a character and had to rebuild him from scratch because it was a mistake. Giving away gold ajd deleting a toon, with no explanation, does not equate to suicidal thoughts or a warrant an investigation or press, as this thread cringely would have people believe.
---
He wasn't his battlenet friend he didn't talk to him on discord. The guy didn't say was suicidal the guy didn't say anything at all. It's early in WoW classic so I highly doubt the dude deleted a level 60 with a million gold. This is super overblown
---
Likewise man.  Hope you get closure as well.
---
Im a hunter as well, what stats do you prioritize in order? If you dont mind me asking.
---
/r/leaves seems like a weird subreddit. Reading it you'd think these people are trying to quit heroin or something. It's weed... It's not physically addictive and isn't really bad for you.
---
I'm lvl 58 and i haven't experienced much ganking, STV was pretty calm. I would say that Lights Hope Chapel has been the worst place for me and outside of BRD but it has never been spawncamping. Although i do have 1 nemesis already which is super fun.
---
&gt; and it seems like everyone's beef is with input broadcasting, not multi boxing.
---
They're synonymous, but yes. If you want to be particular about it, the fact that more than one command is being processed from a single input is the crux of why people considering it cheating and botting. A human isn't controlling each character, they're controlling one and master/slave software to control the others. 
---
If they had to tab between windows, or otherwise provide a single input on a single toon, people wouldn't mind it, because it offers no unfair advantage.
---
I love exploring so much ❤️ and that it could
---
Quiting rl cold Turkey is quite the euphemism
---
&gt;Or, in English, a third party bot software detects an event (physical) and automatically sends a string of keystrokes.
---
Or, in *ACTUAL* English... Definition "Automatic":
---
Google: *"(of a device or process) working by itself with little or no direct human control."*
---
[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/automatic) - *"having a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism "*
---
[Oxford](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/automatic) - *"of a device or process) working by itself with little or no direct human control."*
---
[Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/automatic) - *"able to operate independently of human control"*
---
[Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/automatic) - *"An automatic machine or device is one that has controls that enable it to perform a task without needing to be constantly operated by a person. Automatic methods and processes involve the use of such machines. "*
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
By definition, multiboxing is not automatic. It is not self-regulating. it is not working by itself with little to no human input. It is not operating independently of human control. 
---
It may be 3rd party, and it may be an advantage, but it's not automatic. It does not fit the definition of automatic.
---
It's not automatically sending a string of keystrokes. It sends a keystroke that a person presses. And it doesn't send strings of keystrokes unless a person inputs the same string of keystrokes themselves. 
---
&gt;That's a program playing the game for you. That's botting. You did not send 5 commands to result in 5 actions. You sent one and it resulted in 5 actions.
---
It's not playing it for you. You control all windows. If it plays for you, then it would play without you there. So by fact, it is not playing for you. It is aiding you play, but it is not playing for you.
---
&gt;You're justifying the use of third party software to gain an unfair advantage by allowing one input to result in multiple outputs instead of a single output as is developed for and intended by the game developers.
---
I'm not justifying anything. I straight up told you I don't care if it's considered cheating or not. I'm correct one fact and one fact only. It is not automated. Something can be cheating without being automated. For example, certain exploits in games are considered cheating and will ban players, even though the player has to set up the exploit themselves.
---
&gt;It's cheating. End of story. Twist it however you want to try to help you sleep at night, but you're still cheating by botting.
---
Sadly, this is not true. Blizzard's word is law in the game, and they say it's allowed. It is by fact not cheating either.
---
Now, don't try and twist that to mean I think it's okay. Just that you're currently wrong. It can be viewed as cheating by thousands of people, but if it's officially allowed by the controlling body, then it's not cheating.
---
Also, I don't multibox. Never have and never will. I'm just defending the facts. 
---
To put emphasis on defending the facts, I'll explain. I'm only correcting the misinformation on the word "automated". Blizzard can say it's officially cheating and I still would correct the improper use of automated. That doesn't mean I'm justifying cheating, it means you and him are using the word wrong. Something can be cheating without being automated.
---
Livin’ off the fat of the sea.
---
It does change the dynamic, though. European cops can't kill you in half a second if you freak them out a little bit. That would make me less tense for sure.
---
What else do you expect us boomkins to do, raid?
---
Can you get loot from dungeon bosses multiple times per week?  If so, Is there a cap on how many times you can get a dungeon boss drop per week?
---
I long for the days when Hunters were Huntards. These metamages are making the class look so bad.
---
Okie dokie
---
Exactly, the healers job is to make efficient use of their mana.  If they're blowing their whole mana bar to heal idiot dps and then drinking every pull it adds a lot of time to the run.
---
Plus warlocks have ways to get their own health back.  And frankly, leeching off the healers drinks rather than using their own is kinda rude.
---
Unchained, the upcoming version which is marketing itself as having no p2w.

Playing wow is alot more fun playing with your RL friends

Oh that’s what they’re for! I need to get my wife one of those.
---
I don't have enough life to know this problem tbh.
---
I’ve played from original classic up to WoD.
---
No one has ever liked multiboxers in any guild or server I’ve been on, at least when its come up.
---
Well I was in an overpopulated server but i transferred and now I enjoy the peace and quite ;) what is this talk about overpopulated areas? ;P
---
ha 50 % for me ..Goblin Jumper cables XL should do even better riiight ?
---
Eyyy Biggie pride! I'll see you on the battlefield, Ally scum!
---
Just don’t - there is only so much I can take 😂
---
Considering nobody has any context, redditors could in fact be doing harm to this other person. That’s the problem. We’ve seen this happen way too many times.
---
It took 5 minutes to write my couple sentences putting a realistic perspective that is somehow being missed. Your bar might be a little low for “cries for help”. I’m assuming you’re not acting in bad faith, so no hate.
---
Maybe. Blizzard hasnt technically addressed blindspots from guard. They have addressed physically being unreachable by guard. I'll believe that being out of guard aggro range is bannable when I see a SS of a GM warning about it. ATM it's all rooftop screenshots
---
I ran it way more times than that. I ran it about 20 times in one day one weekend. I never saw a single drop of the ravager. Fuck that axe and that instance lol, will never do it again on my warrior or alts.
---
Paladins and druids are probably the best two for effortless mob killing. Caster mobs can suck as a druid, but anything that actually hits you is stupidly easy.
---
You're an mvp today.
---
All euro cops might not always carry guns, but they definitely have them. And they can still use their position to beat, imprison or kill you.
---
You trust who you want. But maybe don't involve people without their knowledge with those whose title is 'enforcer'. Especially if you don't know whether they live in your European fantasy land.

Hit 60 last night as a single target frost mage with about 10 days played (1 day of which likely was afk / city lounging time)
---
Damn lizards
---
2cent from a MDD sufferer: I used to to thing that were "final" that I couldn't take back all the time as dry runs up to the actual act... Closing accounts, deleting social media, small things to signal "no going back"
---
Just my experience
---
No, its not. You are making the key press not any automated software. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what botting is. Do you think macros are botting too? I mean you press a button and software sends multiple commands to the game at once.
---
Supposedly. Bans and warning so far have dealt with geometry not aggro range
---
Everyone will want you as holy. Ret is almost non existant in pve
---
Some leveling guides state that I shouldn't avoid mobs and "make my path" killing everything in between (unless is grey level which hardly will aggro anyway). In the long run you level up faster and makes traveling much simpler.
---
People are fucking dumb man. You can see who rolled on something and if no one else is in the list you know that no one else could have possibly ever looted it.
---
Ahh but if you go one side you are guaranteed to pull one and it will be much closer to you. With luck even pulling two mobs they won't catch up in time to hit you
---
I have no problem finding a person or two to play with for my whole session if I want it. Ask “does anyone need help or want to hang out/quest”.
---
Even if you have to help them do quests you have already done that’s no biggy.
---
I pretty much did all of Westfall this weekend with the same 3 random people. Was very fun.
---
Nope, no impact. But also no procs from weapons.
---
make friends with a good healer.
---
I’m glad that you posted this and I’m glad that Blizzard responded as well! I hope he’s ok, but yeah if anyone else has something like this occur, whether it’s in a video game or something else gives you indication somethings wrong, always reach out! The worst that could happen is that someone is annoyed you reached out, and you just might help someone get through something really tough!
---
That’s private server drop numbers. No way in hell is the ravager 25% in classic.
---
Haha, I get you, but in this case it’s some guild named Shadowmelded Moonkins. They’re really (really) aggressive with their guild invitations and won’t stop until you disable guild invites or block the person.
---
You can also just go to something like a low lvl moonkin area and farm them super fast if you don't feel inclined to buy them off the AH. I absolutely always carry around a full stack of light feathers, if only to use them in AB. Without them you can't do the jump from LM straight into BS, and if you're at all worried about rogues or some such at GM you can't jump down into it either as that'd put your blink on cooldown.
---
There's also cases like jumping off Tanaris into Un'goro, where the cliff is too big to make it in a single blink jump. You end up having to take a lot of damage from minor falls, or waiting for another blink cooldown. Just jumping off and crossing the first bit with a slow fall, then falling down onto actual flat surface and blinking.
---
And in PvP you do have the rare case where you just need it. Like being chased, and you need to use blink to put distance between yourself and the enemy, or maybe it's just on cooldown already. By not carrying around a light feather, you're restricting your options of countering fall damage to an ability that also happens to be a core part of your PvP kit.
---
I get that people value inventory space differently, but I definitely notice it sooner or later when I'm without light feathers, and I'll be slapping myself for not getting them.
---
Game Master or Game Moderator
---
Maybe don't broadcast when you intend to go kill players or they'll avoid you lol. Even if there wasn't layering people would just leave the zone
---
I saw Rexxar and Misha while i was roaming in desolace and almost had a heart attack.
---
Alone. Frostbolt + running works well against the slayers since they have no range.
---
I've seen Hunters, Warlocks and Priests solo them as well, but I'm not sure if other classes can. You may struggle more as a melee class like Warrior/Rogue since the slayers hit for like 1K then instantly follow that up with a Mortal Strike for another 500-1k damage. 
---
They drop good loot (5-40silver, runecloth, tons of greens/greys, Demonic Runes, Felcloth, and even a 16-slot bag), but most importantly they drop the Eye of Shadow that can be sold for like 200-500g depending on the server. 
---
It's a relatively quiet spot, and other than miners or people farming (usually guilds) the Eye of Shadow, you usually have it all to yourself.
---
Oh wow, hi. Small world. What was your in game name?
---
Using geometry is specifically stated by Blizz reps as bannable behavior. Causing guard to 'evade' by getting somewhere unreachable is an issue
---
Dad a chum?
---
Generally im of the opinion that the old trees are more fun for leveling but the post-MoP ones are way better for endgame because they allow for a lot more flexibility.
---
&gt; And I hate the way mana functions in classic with the small amount for “hybrid” class dps specs and large amount for healers/caster dps.
---
I sort of agree with this, but my main issue was that this creates a lot of problems for hybrids. Specifically a lot of specs arent viable because of mana issues and they spent the better part of two expansions trying to work around the mana issue before actually just designing the classes different. I wasnt a huge fan of all the paladin changes in cata, but they absolutely needed to work with another resource because the way they handled mana was bad.
---
&gt; I wish your stats actually meant something again other than just how much damage you do. Stam is the only meaningful stat now.
---
I actually like that classic stats do more then just flat damage increases, like give you crit or weapon skill. Thats nice. 
---
Im not sure what you mean by stamina being the only meaningful stat now when its the exact oppasite. Primary stats mean very little compared to secondaries. Several specs have higher priority lists for secondaries then primary stats.
---
&gt; Also miss the old “x% to hit” and “x% to crit” and flat spell power values.
---
Sort of agree. I like how clear cut the crit and hit stats are. The spell power stats are neadlessly confusing by their "up to x amount" nature. 
---
Also im not a huge fan of the hit mechanic in general, just throwing that out there.
---
In general with classic i take a fairly balanced approach and try to look at things without any nostalgia breaking through. There are a lot of things classic does really well and some thing are really bad, and its exactly the same with retail.
---
Grind for bindings will eventually end. Grind for MCPs is forever.

This might be due to spell batching

This does seem like an unwarranted invasion of privacy to me. If the only method of contacting this person that OP has is the game and reddit and they didn't say anything to indicate they might self harm, leave them alone. Its not the responsibility or right of a company to do wellness checks. I'm not saying OP shouldn't be concerned for their friend, but its wrong for a company to use privileged information for this purpose.

Not of each of those right? Aren’t they both BiS for ages?

yeah but meanwhile you get tons of high quality fish which sells for good money .Farming is probably still way more lucrative ofc
---
Horde can get about a gold every ten minutes or 6g/hr depending on your luck.  Fishing traps off the coast of shadow prey village in Desolace.  Lobsters are 33-35.  5 shellfish get 55s.  If you can average a shellfish a minute, you can get 6g/hr fairly easily.
---
The mage asked for permission. The healer gave him permission. The mage dies. Reddit blames the mage.
---
I hate mages too but the anus is on the healer here.
---
Did this same thing back when I quit Wotlk and gave all my gold + mats to a guildy I was close with; just decided I wanted to spend more time in the outside world. Nothing to be concerned about, they're just making a kind gesture as they quit WoW either permenantely or temporarily. Pretty badass, just take it as a compliment and keep gaming.
---
Honestly, Deviate Delight isn't very RP heavy unless you're involved with RP guilds. Most of the people I see tend to at least act like any played on a non RP server, but I can say when RPing in dungeon groups, people have been very accepting about it. I believe people are more focused on getting to 60 first at least.
---
I also play late hours, so that might have something to do with it.
---
Yeah man, raid spec which can change every week depending what guild needs, dungeon spec where I usually tank or heal for fast groups and gold farming spec because respeccing 3 times a week costs lots of gold
---
Pretty sure this was like the first PvP video I ever watched (I was a Tauren warrior in vanilla). Don’t think I realized at the time that this was a 52pt build or realized just quite how many buffs and picket healers he had the entire time. Still a fun video.
---
The amount of groups that have rejected me because I'm ret is too damn high. The group's I can actually get into I have to heal or I'm 2nd on the dps meter with a heap of utility to support the group. 
---
People are too confused on min/max specs when the content doesn't demand it.
---
Shilla :)
---
I've ran into plenty of them, played since Vanilla aswell. It's about as annoying as getting ganked by a 60 at lvl 20, a minor nuisance to me. 
---
They won't really be in BG's this time around cause they disabled the /follow function.
---
Sometimes people don't talk about it. Trust your gut feeling. There's no harm done if it turns out he's safe. You did it out of concern for your friend. I hope he is alright and I hope you'll get in contact!!!
---
fish are really cheap atm ,even some good ones..whats up with that?Should i buy and resell some of the fishes later ?
---
I was 2nd dps as shadow in a uldaman run... one of the two dungeons I've actually been able to dps as shadow. 
---
Our multi DoT plus wand tactic is boring but pretty damn effective. And while leveling its not too different from most melee classes that are also largely getting their damage from auto-attacks. 
---
Let people play their damn meme specs, for most content max efficiency is irrelevant.
---
It's not like anyone's trying to dox this guy.  They're trying to give the post visibility in case he sees it.   I really don't see any reason to get so bent out of shape about it.
---
Look into their HP seeing they have 12-18k. Being a priest myself that sounds impossible to farm. I might look into it. thanks!
---
I paid for Joana’s guide and it’s been great. I don’t get much playtime so I try to maximize every minute and I feel his guide does just that. It’s a little expensive, but worth it in my opinion.
---
I've found a 10 man multibox shaman and a 5 man multibox shaman on Zandalar Tribe. Kill on sight every time and its so very very satystfying to see them all dead on the floor. Follow them around and root a straggler, or wait in stealth for opportunity to one shot the leader. Me and my partner play as a duo so we always fuck with multiboxers as long as possible, even if we have to corpse run. You're not cheating on my server if I can help it...
---
That's why they unbanned me after them knowing and saying they know I am a multiboxer.. Come on man.
---
IceHUD should be what you are after
---
Nah still busted
---
This one is the healers fault. The mage asked for permission. The healer granted permission when he wasn't ready. The mage dies.
---
Yeah back in Vanilla, one of the points (I think it was "LOOK IT OVER") became a huge meme at the time. The thread itself had a few hundred replies and was pretty famous. 
---
It's one of the comments you don't see too often like "qq" or "l2p"
---
Put that priest on a mage or warlock and he's just going to be more effective. Maybe they're allowing that priest more debuff slots because he's a streamer? Theres a lot of factors that come into play.
---
Taking a wow screenshot with a phone vs. print screen.  That's a worse feeling.
---
Yeah in the twitch app they have it for classic
---
How dare you. I can make water breathing potions with those.
---
You got me there
---
Most "normal" GMs just don't have the rights to access the logs and have to trust their system.
---
&gt;when you can bring 40 people
---
...then you don't always do it. If you can do content as 20 - your chances to get loot are doubled.
---
items should be going to wherever will improve the guild the most. this usually means spriest is last on the list of getting gear. sure if you have some truly braindead mages who cant outdps you or some guy who shows up once a month then by all means give it to your consistent spriest, but thats hopefully not going to be a common occurrence.
---
Not true, i have killed many enemy players who opened up on me without a problem. Pvp in classic is more like Rock Paper Scissors, aslong as both parties are same lvl and skill, than one class will always have a class they can beat and a class they can’t.
---
shut the fuck up.
---
Yeah man, Im not the player. I was just floating around Tanaris and reading that gave me a chuckle.
---
Frost is better for aoe farming and it does have good survivability.  Fire, fire has excellent survivability.  The mobs can hit you when their dead!
---
I see a difference. Not agreeing with the guy. But one is a hey if you're out there and still want to play because I left. One is you left me and I'm trying to find you.
---
Work work
---
Hey, I'm not saying they're bad. I love them as an alchemist since I can make free-action pota
---
We'll need to coin this Asmon's Law, a spin on the famous Godwin's law, it being that the longer any WoW discussion lasts on reddit, the greater the chance will be that there will be a comparison between the subject and Asmongold, after which the thread is beyond saving. =)

This is outright cheating. There is little difference between a botter and this guy. But Blizz won't ban him because he pays 20 subs.

Oh, well I have a job soooo.....

4 runs is not that. Its ez asf to run, could easily do it like 10 times in a 2.t hr stretch or so
---
If you did not correspond with him on real ID or on Discord or outside of the game, it's honestly none of your business. In live wow it was not uncommon for people to vanish and even give stuff away, most people don't put that much value on in-game shit, I know when I quit games I don't so it doesn't bother me. we need to consider classic wow is relatively new so what exactly is this guy giving away that is so unobtainable and cause for alarm? If he did not say anything at all to warrant an investigation, to be honest, you putting him on blast on the internet to the public is likely doing a him disservice, not unlike when anyone take someone's picture and puts it on the internet without their permission. I get that YOU feel he have away a fortune, I get that YOU felt close, but it's totally possible it's not reciprocated. It's not even a stretch to believe that he's probably still playing the game and just wanted to reboot as something else, somewhere else. maybe he just said fuck this game but didn't want to bring on bad vibes so you just said bye and handed you some gold.
---
Of course I hope the guys good but tbh of he is or not isn't our business or yours. there's a reason we have so many privacy walls in this game and that the GM's will never tell us what happened and honestly glad it's that way.
---
If anyone has read my comment this far and is disgusted with me because your perceive me as a toxic goon despite knowing even what toon I rolled for thirteen years or how involved in the community I was, that's on you, and I don't care to correct your inaccurate psychoanalysis. all I can ask the public is if someone quits the game and gives their gold away don't just automatically click to report someone you're worried about or take it to public forum unless they've given you a reason to, you know, like *saying something* or acting insane. Deleting a toon and giving away gold is commonplace in live and has been for years, I don't understand why all of a sudden today, in Classic, it means someone is mentally unstable. That's absolutely ridiculous, and just highlights how little people understand about mental health. It's not an answer in the absence of another answer, I do know that from experience. Secondly, you don't confront that kind of behavior in this way even if that was the case.
---
I'm actually baffled by a lot of the people cussing people out and talking shit to people because they're trying to point out some very real stuff. I haven't read a single comment or someone said 'fuck you and fuck your friend I hope he's NOT doing poorly.' Stop being a nation of overreacting dickheads
---
Odds are pretty good today. There was another post with 2 people rolling a 1 and 2 earlier. :)
---
Howdy! These are from us in &lt;BLaDE of KiLL&gt;, we spend our offdays wiping raids for a bit of fun. Enjoy your dungeon, always look out for us.
---
He probably got grounded by his mom.
---
Maybe is playing Borderlands 3 instead?  I quit WoW for now for BL3.   I'll be back though just not yet....
---
If you want to play shadow dps without being kicked, start your own groups. You have absolutely no rights in someone elses group.
---
I did this. Had to get my life back together.

Yeah at this time i settle for one and hope i dont get dazed
---
You're talking to people with no friends so it's hard for them to understand.

Yep! Joined this server cause all

Were full on opening day. Haven’t had a reason to switch servers yet.

Does only one person in the group need the Key To the City to access the side entrance of Stratholme?

Being able to drink during boss fights would be broken and no one should be able to. That's why Mages have Evo.

Yeah it wasn’t worth her quitting over. I probably won’t return to an RP server after that experience.

Also, I have a Colt Combat Elite. Just realized your name.

There's an instance cap of 5/hour, other than that you can visit dungeons as much as you want.

Raids are different, there's a weekly reset.
---
So don't go behind the bank? It's a shared town, they are always full of this shit, and have been for 15 years.....well, when world PvP was a thing at least. So maybe that's the lesson, ask for this kind of change and it leads to modern WoW.

A 2112 reference? Welp, I know what I'm queueing up next. See you all in 20 mins

You can get loot from dungeon bosses up to 5 times per hour.

Only raids have multiple-day lockouts. You may only kill bosses in MC once per week. You may only kill Onyxia once every 5 days.

That's how it worked in Vanilla.

Even though you are a filthy gnome, undead need to pay for what they did and will do.
---
( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
---
Yeah, guns for hunters are the one really justifiable AH expense imo.
---
Deadly Blunderbuss at 16 is solid and not crazy expensive, nothing has higher top end available at the level. You also get to turn it in for a quest later on if you're Horde. It's craftable so there's never a shortage. The bow comparable is Fine Longbow which is slightly worse, but available 2 levels earlier. Also a BoE, but as a world drop.
---
Silver-Plated Shotgun at 21 is also awesome and definitely worth getting for ally or horde hunters that don't get lucky with getting venomstrike. Again it's a craftable, so always readily available.
---
 Ranger Bow is the only available weapon that is blatantly better and it's a pretty rare blue BoE. Precision Bow is the bow equivalent available at 22, nearly identical.
---
"Mage-Eye" Blunderbuss is your next gun. It's not a craftable so a little harder to find, but still usually not very expensive. Comparable to Archer's Longbow.
---
29 to 35 you finally hit a bit of a dearth for guns, but there are a couple of quest guns you can pick up including the Blasting Hackbut from the Shady Rest Inn quest chain in Dustwallow or the Sidegunner Shottie from the Gizelton Caravan escort in Desolace.
---
You could also potentially pickup a Glass Shooter for not too much. It having a level 30 requirement means it's not desirable to twinks and can sometimes be found cheap despite being really awesome. Long Redwood Bow is the real standout ranged weapon out of the reasonably available BoE/quest weapons.
---
At 36 the craftable guns come back with a vengeance. Mithril Blunderbuss is awesome and Mithril Heavy-Bore Rifle is also awesome at 39. If you can find a good stat roll on a Sniper Rifle it's also a great BoE gun.
---
From there you likely get Verdant Keeper's Aim, which is insane, and use that until you settle into your pre-raid BiS Crossbow.
---
Found another rogue main lol

Woah! Super cool! I've seen that skele million times and never put two and two together. Fun fact, under the tree is a deep pool of water and at the very bottom is a rock with a crack in it and bubbles coming from it. These bubbles grant breath and keep you from drowning :)

is this the badland quest? if yes: fucking awful 😵

Damage caused by players from any source does not cause durability damage. If you kill your self using an item, the damage counts as coming from your self. Since you are a player, you killing your self does not cause durability damage.
---
Doesn't matter for me since I'm fury/prot I don't have tactical mastery anymore. It's the one thing I miss about deep prot
---
MMOs have this thing called an economy. We all share it. Think it over, genius.
---
Your so original
---
I dunno, on one hand I hate how layering is a part of the game and how people are using it to disengage with players and objectives.
---
On the other hand, I almost think the game would reach unplayable states with the number of players in one area and crash  the servers. And this wouldn't be once in awhile, it would happen pretty often if you play on a full server.
---
Did you even read the post? they are behind the bank using a spot where guards evade, attacking everyone out in the open that walks by
---
The fact is, it *does* matter that the program is getting human input. That's what Blizz cares about. It's not botting until a *choice* is being made automatically.
---
Hey, I just wanted to pop in and say that you're a really good friend. Going out of the way to make sure your buddy is okay like you have shows me that. I hope everything goes well, dude.
---
FWIW the hillsbrad spot is kind of tricky with all the trees and shit. I don’t die that much but occasionally the trees will fuck up a blizzard or one of the pats will get pulled in and cause issues.
---
I would think not, as it only mentions Arcane Shot.
---
Because one involves 5 real people coordinating together spending 5 people's worth of man-hours to do an ultimately pointless activity, while the other involves 1 person spending 1 person's worth of man-hours plus a multibotting software's monthly subscription to do the same thing.
---
Let me throw the ball back in your court: if you're bringing 5 different people on a single character, wouldn't it be even more efficient still to bring 5 different people each multiboxing 5 characters?
---
Thank you for sharing your experience. I hope that what's happening here is just a guy getting his priorities straight, and not a guy implementing a permanent solution to his problems.
---
I meant that stam is the only stat that changes a number other than damage. Like in classic agility was ap for some classes and crit, strength was ap for melee classes, int increased mana, stam increases hp, spirit increases hp and mana regen. In retail your damage overall just scales with 1 primary stat and then you have stam increasing your hp and spirit doesn’t exist. Every class is the same just with a different primary stat. In classic all stats were effective in different ways depending on class and spec.
---
Well the reason I like the hit mechanic is because it was just a little knowledge test that increased your damage if you knew what it was and got some hit% on your gear. Just that basic level of knowledge makes a difference between players who know and those who don’t. And it’s not a hard thing to understand.
---
This works pretty well, but it has some weird issues.  Like if you switch targets and then press this macro again it will continue casting on your previous target....
---
I'm level 41 and it only costs like, 100hp, the hp cost is trivial
---
1 Main warlock 29, and 1 alt (hunter 11)

Swamp of sorrows, kill adolescent and dreaming whelps. Good XP and 0.04% drop chance of tiny emerald whelpling, can sell for over 100G depending on your realm. I just got one yesterday.
---
I can say that it seems to be a big success. Realm pop is staying at high most days for a lot of severs, and while I have logged a lot of hours that's because Blizzard wasn't kind enough to get me exact dates for launch so I knocked my wife up at the wrong time lol. At least I got a lot of playtime in during beta, even if I didn't get to keep my guys
---
Pfffft. It took me 856 runs.  And asmongold ninjad 752 of those.
---
I too love the game at night so much! The mood is real nice indeed
---
Dude, I had like 20 really good friends on 360 back in the Halo 3 days. People I would play with everyday. Definitely people that I considered good friends. Sad thing is, I don’t have contact with 95% of those people anymore. It’s the beauty of online gaming. You can definitely become good friends with someone over a game without exchanging phone numbers.
---
I have no idea what a keyboard warrior is, but sure whatever make you happy bud.
---
I'd like to take my character from classic to TBC etc.
---
Lmao you must not go into barrens chat much 😁
---
Honestly, people get empowered behind a keyboard. Theres no telling what an individual will say or do. Although, Chances are they will be denouncing whatever another person types.
---
Maybe it bounced off it's teeth? These worms have teeth for sure so..That's probably how!
---
Lol losers just giving that turd free stuff. They are by definition even worse than he is.
---
Lol I ran Cath with two dps warriors, one told me the shield was mine, the other said he just needed quests. Well, as usual, the DPS fury warrior who was dual wielding charged every mob while I tried to LoS pull, and took all aggro immediately. Got us wiped once by pulling pally boss and like 8 mobs at once while we tried to clear extra mobs. And then when the shield dropped, he need rolled after saying he just needed quests and being a fury 2 hnder dps who is apparently unable to tank. I fuckin do not like having warriors in the party as a tank.
---
Absolutely this. Just mouse over your pet's attack abilities (should be claw or bite hopefully).  At your level they should generally be at rank 3 I believe, maybe rank 4 soon.  If it says rank 1 or 2 that's definitely your problem.  
---
As someone else also said, you're much better off going pure beast mastery into you get to Bestial Wrath. Your pet damage will scale much better AND he will tank way better, making it easier for you to unload on your abilities.
---
There are thousands of streamers in the directory, you could pick some other person to watch.
---
Personally I'm saving up all blackmouth oil I can (and creating free action potions out of them) before P2 hits. I also buy all cheap fish/oils from the AH for that reason.
---
Hey bud, I get ya. Your social anxiety causes anything other than ass kissing to be a bitter personal attack against you and your identity. Here’s a tip: lashing out turns something that could’ve been a joke, not even at your expense, in to a definite personal attack. Also exaggerating your experiences and seeking attention for being slighted tends to make people dislike you.
---
Maybe 3 hours, after that trade I got off, and the bans happened while I was sleeping.
---
Same here :( i went digging through photobucket trying to find my old account but no luck..sad day

No, it isn't. You can call it botting as much as you like that doesn't make it botting. Those other 4 clients do nothing without a human pushing buttons.

I’m on Old Blanchy on the Horde, and it’s great. Haven’t seen any of that stuff. If ya want, head over to the Horde side and join the guild Schrute farms, its a clan 500+ strong with friendly, mature players!

You're friend is probably fine, but you should report this because on the off chance he isn't you'd be doing a lot. And if he is, he'll appreciate the concern. (Sorry if anyone has addressed this or yknow you've done it)
---
6 hours sounds like an exaggeration
---
Play warrior. No mana.
---
Your not really worthy of that level of effort
---
I hope it all turns out well for you and your guildmate.
---
In other MMOs like Eve Online input broadcasting multiboxing *is* classified as cheating and is bannable. You're still allowed to multibox, but you have to send inputs to your clients one at a time.
---
Hopefully he is okay and just needed to step away from internet from a bit. I go through a cycle of removing myself from all social medias, and online gaming for short stints of time, it's actually pretty helpful. 
---
Here's hoping to you and your friend that everything is okay.
---
 I lost my best friend to suicide and had to break it to to our guild, that he was super active in, that he died. I happened to have his account info and logged in for the hell of it one day and was overwhelmed with messages from guild mates confused or thinking it was a hacker, was actually heartwarming seeing how much online friends actually care about one another.

sidebar resources
---
You forgot the, “Literally Unplayable” tag.
---
How difficult it is as a warrior is overblown. I picked up herbalism and alchemy and I always had tons of potions on me, so I never found myself dying. And that being said.. 
---
I tend to advise against warriors because they are just a really fucking boring (imo) class to level. I love a good melee class because getting a new weapon is amazing.. but that doesn't make up for it. Tanking until higher levels is no fun, no rage, can basically just run through everything.  Lots of autoattack. I made it past 40 and absolutely hated everything.
---
The exception is if you are truly dedicated to classic and are willing to invest boatloads of time to become a god at level 60. Then yeah, 100% go for it. I thought I did, but I didn't. Now I'm a mage and life is good.
---
I find that exceptionally hard to believe, and I am nearly positive this has to be wrong. If this were accurate, then almost every ban petition they receive would never be properly reviewed, ever.
---
Was done with 5 man back in the day so...
---
Unsure what gear they had but still
---
Rend is an absolutely trash skill past level 35 or so. It's your most efficient rage to damage conversion before you get whirlwind but after that it only deals like, 70 damage over 15 seconds
---
Well that's a 15yo games :D
---
What...he joined the group because they said he could dps as a shadow priest then they changed their mind. Yes, he could have left then but that wasnt the point to comment was making earlier. It was about saving time by having PCs that do slightly more damage, which I think is dumb especially with the circumstances that OP described.
---
Ok ok ok...I guess I'll give WoW a shot vs my FFXIV account

I will day that I felt WOTLK did world design well too. Some of those zones were amazing.

Does fall damage, drowning (out of breath), or fatigue-drowning cause durability damage?

Thats actually really bad. Other trinkets are just worse.

I was actually about to say something along the same line as this.

World chests are first come first serve. Those are the rules. Other players should expect nothing more than that. Getting into combat to try to get a chest isn't without risks.

Did this years ago from org to 1k needles, trick is to roll rogue, sell all your clothes and train stealth. It will give you a head start,. Won't work once you get to higher levels.

It does like, 70 damage over 15 seconds, sunder armor is a better ability due to the fact it reduces enemy  effective health if you're trying to get an overpower proc

Exactly, why was he upstairs? Also I agree that technically they should have called me a jerk or something instead of a ninja but I didn't think they were in the right state of mind to discuss technicalities.

Yes, you call it spellcleave despite the fact that it is obviously an aoe group.

No. It's still one input. The only thing happening is the other game clients are allowed to see the input too.

Looks like someone didn't read what I wrote. Is it really that hard to be decent to someone?

This is a big issue, though. It's a central mechanic to hunters.

Why else would Blizzard allow it?

Stat stick for rogues
---
It's not obvious how to do this, so definitely read up on it. Damaging pet abilities/ranks have to be learned from pets you tame, then you use the Beast Training to train those abilities to other pets you want to use.  Check out https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/

Depends on server... your prices are very generous.  I usually end up vendoring the mageweave bolts (and most greenies) since they barely auction for more than they vendor.

Classic WoW has it all, including drama that invokes traumatic memories from years ago.
---
That is a big assumption.  I work in IT, and plenty of people I have worked with over the years play games like this.  Most of them were above average at their job and lived on their own.  Many were married.   Hell, the absolute best support tech I have ever met did nothing but play games when he wasn't at work.  The guy also had a fuckton of money saved up, because he barely spent anything outside of food and his cheap rent.
---
Hunters have the ability to demolish SPs in a 1v1
---
These aren’t presumptions, these are possibilities. Possibilities because so many people are assuming every word is true. I don’t know the full context, you don’t, no one but OP does. So it seems kinda fucked to buy their story wholesale and neg anyone who doesn’t agree whole heartedly in doxing this person.
---
ah yeah the other BL quests went off without a hitch but that one I only had two of the gizzards by the time I had finished the others. Checked the AH every few hours, some dude was trying to sell them 2g a pop but some people would show up from time to time to sell for 50s. Definitely recommend.

But that doesn't work because stealth is a level 4 training

As someone who left Stalagg, I feel this. The PvP victories against gankers meant so much back on that server.

---
In a group, yes I expect free water.  If as a mage you don't agree with that arrangement you can find another healer.  You're the first that I've heard openly dispute the idea honestly.
---
Lvl 38 hunter with almost 3 /played hours
---
It's the easiest place to level cooking, what with all the braziers
---
Clearly, this is why it is superior
---
They respawn under 5mn...
---
Most AoE spots have quick respawn
---
Perhaps the same 15 seconds, over and over again?
---
Lolbye
---
This is greyer than being on top of the arena because the arena is an obstacle that is very difficult to get on top of and allows you area denial of the entire zone. These guys have a tiny sliver of an area where players are able to actively engage with them regardless of class ability and doesn't require any movement tricks; if they move, then the guards will zerg them.
---
There are blind spots in Ratchet, BB, Gadgetzan and Everlook that players exploit all the time. I get that guards being unable to aggro them is a bit annoying, but can you really not kill 2 players? If not, why not just... not go to the bank?
---
You mean with noggenfogger you have on demand.
---
My healers have been adding me to thier friends list because I keep a sword and board incase things get hairy, and I've only had to use it when I had a dps pull a whole room for some fucking reason. When I started dual wield tanking I would message my healer after every run to ask how I did and if they had any suggestions, I was always told it was no problem keeping me up and great tanking.
---
Hunter and warlock are the best bets.
---
Hunters can pet tank or kite forever. Locks can fearspam and dot until dead.
---
&gt; Is it the healers responsibility to have water available? Yes.
---
And I do.  I'd just prefer to not spend money healing, since I drink almost every pull.
---
Other races might have an advantage over you but the advantage is minimal at best. Play whatever race you like.
---
Things don't need AI to be automatic. It just means to have a self-regulating system that requires no human input to continue. If someone wanted to, they can create a bot that loops two inputs forever, requiring no further action from the human.
---
The difference is that telling a program what to do with a script is the fact that it's starting a script, and the game is being played without a human after the script has started.
---
Blizzard has a rule. One button press per action on a single game client. What they mean by this is if you press A, then it should only input A for a game client. As soon as you make a script that makes A do "A, then A again later" is a script doing something for you that you didn't input. You didn't input A again.
---
Multiboxing still requires the person to press every single button those other clients are doing. To explain, the basic concept of multiboxing is allowing all the game clients to *SEE* the input. It's not creating additional input. This behavior could be built into the operating system, but the reason why it isn't is because having the input pass through all windows would interfere with what a person wants to do with the computer. People want to switch to different tasks at different times on the computer. Multiboxing is one exception to that.
---
Or I could just leave it like a dick because fuck that next guy
---
I already feel so resentful lol. Im so glad my main is a rogue because honestly a large part of my motivation to get 60 is probably going to be so I can shit on some horde people so hard that they quit the fucking game. I don't really want to do that because that's exactly what I'm upset about but I don't know what else to do about it. I'll never know them in person, I'll never be able to interact with them in game, I'll probably never get to beat the people camping me on my current character. It just makes me feel so helpless and I feel like I  need to do something about it.
---
It’s 15% up from 5%. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
I just noticed this recently. But you might have noticed that details always showed talents of other details users when you mouseover their class-icon in the damage/healing meter.
---
sounds like you made it all up. wow didn't come out until 2004 lol
---
Just use Feign Death, Vanish, fucking Fade, anything you can use to reset aggro.
---
Then don't join those groups. The toxicity doesnt bother you I bet its because you want to get in those groups and cant. Or you just assume any group that doesnt waste 2 hours in a low level dungeon is somehow toxic to you. 
---
Drooling masses are usually the ones I see complaining about these groups and swear they will never join them but cant seem to get over other players using them.
---
🦀🦀$11🦀🦀
---
I like responsibility like that in game.
---
Outside of it, not so much...at least not for myself. I cannot seem to do much for me and enjoy it. I just want that time to skip on by and just try to fill it with some tolerable nonsense.
---
Someone else needs help from me? I will do everything I can.
---
This has resulted in many poor life choices and delay of typical expected life goals. I am aware of it and should do something about it, but I cannot as that is something for me.
---
I don’t agree. Etika’s situation was tragic, but MI affects everyone differently. Some people really benefit from/have been saved by wellness reach-outs. I’m in a much better place now, but it wasn’t very long ago that I was one of them.  It can be difficult to know how the person in question will react/what they need in those of times, but I don’t think encouraging everyone to ignore it is the right thing to do here.
---
Yup I chose the server because my mom picked it first, and now I brought my girlfriend to the same server.
---
To have a broken tooth. Focken hurts!
---
Thank. God.
---
This is amazing news.
---
What do you mean "buy the story"? The only thing being bought, is the fact that OP is concerned for his friend. Nobody is claiming to know why his friend left (except for folks like yourself). 
---
&gt;neg anyone who doesn’t agree whole heartedly in doxing this person.
---
Bit of a strawman argument there, this isn't happening.
---
Ha!
---
I wish I knew this guy
---
Any macro experts tell me if can I set up a macro to switch from battle stance to berserk or if I am in berserker to battle. Basically one button to switch between the two stances?
---
VMware has made multiboxing so much easier.
---
Number 3 assumes this isn’t real. What are you talking about?
---
You handled that straw man really well though.
---
So far off the mark, mate
---
This exchange got to you bad enough to go digging through my profile, but *I'm* sad. Cool.
---
damn. 
---
I remember listening to a story by that standup comedian Joey "CoCo" Diaz.  Something slightly similar happened to his mother: he was sneaking in late as a teenager and heard his mom call him, but pretended to sleep to not get in trouble. He ended up finding her the next morning and she was gone. (might not be remembering quite right, but it was something like that)
---
Idk why I thought you'd be interested in that story...maybe to know something similar happened to someone else....
---
No. Why would it do something it doesn't say?
---
The narrator was looking for a bloodbath.
---
I leveled as fury, and 15 years ago leveled as arms.
---
It really depends on your playstyle preference.
---
Do you like:
---
* Smoother rage generation?
---
* Being better at Dual wielding?
---
* Using whatever weapon you can get your hands on?
---
* Hitting fast?
---
* Having your lv30 DPS cooldown be called "Death Wish"?
---
* The class fantasy of BRUTAL CUNNING?
---
Fury is for you.
---
* Not losing all your rage when you change stances?
---
* Wielding a specific kind of 2-handed weapon?
---
* Watching your enemies bleed?
---
* Hitting hard?
---
* Having your lv30 DPS cooldown be called "Sweeping Strikes"?
---
* The class fantasy of CUNNING BRUTALITY?
---
Then Arms is you.
---
Since you're already Arms, it's probably not worth the 1g to respec Fury, or 5g to respec arms once you decide you hate it. So yeah, stick with it. When you get gear, it gets better.
---
No worries man. Thanks for sharing. Sounds like you can be a best friend and a worst enemy. I'm sorry you were ganked.
---
Well, we know why he wanted to leave the guild.
---
It's not a joke when its normalized and you are the butt of it. Even then I can't connect with people who literally dont give a shit about punching down on vulnerable groups.
---
I imagine he meant loyal/not flaky to the guild rather than the game. There were lots of hardcore and dedicated players in my guild, and typically they "flaked" after 3 weeks of wiping on the same boss with no progress for a guild that had it on farm already.
---
Also there are plenty of people who rushed 60 in less than a week and are burnt out.
---
I used to main mage, took a break, when I came back I only lasted a few weeks before I quit. I quit because retail has way too many buttons to push. I'd need a second keyboard to bind everything I need to push to play the game. Even when I quit (middle of cata) it was getting to be too much.
---
...I feel like being a former heroin addict would have given you some empathy here.  
---
It's generally not simply an "okay, guess I'll just stop" situation when facing addiction.
---
I mean, people were dual wield tanking Rag on week 2. Shields are sort of a meme right now when you can dual wield or use a 2h and do way more threat. Nothing that's in the game yet does enough damage for shields to be required once you have pre-raid bis or better gear on everyone.
---
But like in classic a melee class uses agility, strength, spirit and stam. Pallies use all the stats. Druids use all the stats. Casters/healers use mostly int and spirit, but they’re the exception.
---
Also I don’t have a problem with things like a fire elemental resisting fire damage because it’s made of fire... or a rock golem or skeleton not being bleedable because it doesn’t have blood.
---
&gt;Not your fault
---
Not the game's fault either, and if that was the server your RL friend played on, it's not like changing servers is going to fix that problem..
---
Once you hit the minimum recommended level for a dungeon, run it a few times with some pugs or guildmates. 
---
Once you upgrade some of your gear and gain a level or two, go quest in other zones until you reach the min level for the next dungeon. 
---
Dont go to town on your main unless you need to buy skills or bank soulbound items, mail all your auction house and bank stuff to an alt, travel is a huge time sink.
---
Also, get big bags as soon as it's affordable to do so. They're resellable and mailable, so they will always be usable or sellable. Thus, spend the gold. It's worth it.
---
I took the bait back in the day. Was not fun Got camped for a while. Good times.
---
What?
---
If you're playing mage and you don't have a stack of 20 you're not playing right.
---
Is that a sideways nutsack?
---
I'm well aware of that. If you can only make 2 water at a time, the previous tier is fine.  If you're 60, you make 20 at a time.
---
Oh hi Mograine horde player, just ran into a few of your guildies farming Crusader enchant (which I also wanted to farm) as an Alliance. Tell the hunter he's lucky he was being guarded by a lvl 60 warlock, wouldn't have left him alone otherwise ;P
---
It’s just a prank dude chill
---
Start trying out guilds. Find one you mesh well with and stick with them. What server are you on?
---
go to a capital city and look for guilds to join.
---
I waited until 4am to do it and I still had to do the log out and save my costume rigmarole because there were other parties there.
---
Or you can farm a stack in like 15 minutes if you need to. Or just advertise that you want to buy and the lowbies will come screaming to sell them to you. Yeah there is no reason not to have them.
---
You guys all look alike
---
Fuck Blizzard that’s awesome!! I always wondered about if something happened if my guildies would miss me.  Good job blizzard.
---
Dolphins?
---
There are passive combat pulses that are in raid encounters that we added during vanilla to stop the OOC rezzing so you need to feign and start drinking between them, sounds like your timing is off though, you could do this all the way through BC as well buy eventually it won't be needed.  Tell pallies to keep judgement of wisdom up!
---
I can't take a video game addiction seriously after going through actual withdrawals.
---
You know, like real physical addictions.
---
Give any wow "addict" heroin and I guarantee you they're going to cancel their subscription and spend the rest of their money on dope.
---
Should tell a friendly nearby Hunter. Hunters love broken tooth
---
I feel like this could also be on r/MaliciousCompliance as well. He was asking for it after all
---
I’m on thunder fury alliance, levelling a night elf.
---
Where can I find a guild?
---
Uhhh, well you can literally just do
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/cast Berserker Stance
---
It works because if you're in Battle Stance, it'll roll through the first line then just cast Berserker Stance. If you're in Berserker, it'll cast Battle Stance and then the GCD will prevent it from re-casting Berserker Stance. The only problem is that if you're in Defensive Stance, you can't go straight to Berserker and have to cast Battle first.
---
You could do this in TBC as well as vanilla, I think it was sort of a feature.
---
Surprisingly not. Small aggro range I suppose. I was all up on him haha!
---
As a mage I can confirm, people are the most  generous when you do it without asking a certain amount.
---
Playing a priest, currently at 58. Been leveling as Shadow and have loved the consistency and efficiency when soloing, and have been able to heal dungeons pretty well so far.
---
Question is: at 60 I’m considering switching to a Holy based spec to be able to heal endgame content more effectively, but am really dreading losing my soloing efficiency since I won’t always be in a group and swapping back and forth to Shadow isn’t viable cost-wise. Does anyone have any experience with tweaking a talent build that goes down into both Holy and Discipline while still taking Spirit Tap and other damage focused talents like Holy Nova and Searing Light in order to maintain a decent ability to solo out in the world?
---
This is what I’ve come up with so far: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVghsz0oZzxtccbVZx
---
I know that a full Holy build would obviously be more effective healing-wise and that this will be a bit of a compromise, but I’m also not planning on doing any cutting edge content and I’d be more happy with a build that allows me to both heal and efficiently solo while out in the world.
---
Best way is just to go around questing, and if you find someone doing the same thing as you /invite them and have a chat.
---
If you've had a positive experience with them, add them to your friends list and reach out every now and then.
---
When you start doing dungeons you'll interact with more people for long periods of time, and it gets easier to find people that are cool to hang out with.
---
Do I just join any that are advertising?
---
I’d love to know what you go with. I switched to prot at 45 and I lasted less than a level. The damage wasn’t there to improve the speed beyond what I was achieving with Ret. In addition, I could only manage 4 mobs max without needing CDs every pull.
---
The thing I found was that between consecration, shield spike and ret Aura, the damage just wasn’t there. It looked good on paper, but in reality it was simply too low. Your main form of damage was coming from your melee swings. Which in all those videos from private servers and back in 2005, were from exploitation of the reckoning bugs. Reckoning wasn’t proccing enough for me either to make using a 1h faster than a 2h with SoC.
---
Unless you’re fighting mobs 5-6 levels lower than you, I don’t see it being as easy as what all the videos show. If you’re fighting mobs 5-6 levels lower, it probably not close to just going Ret.
---
Let me know how you go though cause if my findings were wrong and it works great 55+, I’d love to switch back to prot.
---
Drop the druid and go warrior, the one true tank
---
My first ever char was a gnome warrior who I never capped in vanilla. Was super hyped about lvling him up, got the name I wanted, was guna go engineering was gunna be great. But then I got reading to much before launch and human warriors seemed a really good choice. Now like 220ish hours in and I wana reboot lol fuuuck
---
56, 7g. :’)
---
Aaaaahhh. That's neat. I can see how it would be useful.
---
I honestly feared I would make the exact same experience as you. I was really suprised I made it to 60 without a minute of doubt. Maybe it’s the class you subconsciously don’t enjoy.
---
Not enough content not to PvP in classic.
---
If number 3 assumes this isn't real, why are there 5 other scenarios where you assume that it is real?
---
I so badly want to know Ironfoe proccrate
---
I believe you need to be at the same level/higher level to tame a pet.
---
OP is level 36, BT is level 37, so he's a level off even attempting it.
---
Do you think he wants you broadcasting his personal problems to the whole world?
---
That was cata
---
From what I read in some forums, I thought SoR is better than SoC for a reck build. Since SoC doesnt multi-proc.
---
Or that for a level 38 is a fantastic way of getting .ount gold
---
It's the idea that you're payed based on quality of service (not saying it's a perfect system). When I visit Europe, the service is horrendous (again from the PoV of an American) because they're payed salary, etc and aren't reliant on me being satisfied to make money.
---
Each system has pros and cons
---
Legendary.
---
What if the Druid healer fucks up and the tank dies twice due to no fault of his own.
---
/u/DastyTheOne does this answer your post about screenshots?
---
It can be resisted.
---
What's bad is using your phone to take an off-kilter, potato-quality picture of your screen than, you know, an actual *screenshot*.
---
How do you do this?
---
Yeah I was trying to do that but most people I’ve come across are already grouped and keep going. The ones on their own will toss me a wave and move on as well lol.
---

Easy to farm solo as a hunter... u could even sell the runs if people use invis pots to follow you. Chek the videos on YouTube
---
What’s the addon for bonus stats on chat window?
---
Cronenbergs
---
&gt;I don't feel like blizzard made things right for me
---
They gave you 10 free subscription days, what amounts to 5 days if you take away the day you spent getting your account back. Also, they stated this has been forwarded directly to the devs to adjust so this situations does not happen in the future.
---
What more do you want? A GM to come over and give you a hand job?
---
Until someone makes a current video of how reckoning procs with SoC its up in the air for me
---
It should technically have a chance to proc with each attack
---
[Link for the uneducated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWJNu-IllU)
---
I found this out at level 24. Only noticed the train pet button then.  Doh!
---
The game has existed for 15 years. It's not hard to accumulate two of them over 10.
---
Completely agree. I'd take it a step further and say that trying to protect people from themselves is both immoral and also causes more harm than good.
---
Thanks that was a lot simpler then I was expecting
---
Go CLG!
---
Yo what addon do you use for those health bars? Super clean setup.
---
I hope everything works out for you both. I’m glad to see the GMs are active in helping resolve this.
---
Are Druids really not that needed in endgame? I was thinking of tanking but won’t mind healing or dps. I’m getting mixed messages from what I have read so far. Help me out guys!
---
I'd re-roll on a non-annoying server. Pick the ones that say "PVE". And then you actually get to play the game you pay for!
---
I never said to "believe everything posted on the internet". 
---
There is nothing to believe other than the fact that OP is concerned for his friend. People aren't claiming to know what happened and why, they're just saying that if he's genuinely concerned, he should keep reaching out to him. Because obviously, OP has a better grasp on the situation than posters like yourself who are making conjectures.
---
I’d say stick it out. Your pretty invested. When you hit 60 yourself pvp will be more fun.
---
Buying gf
---
One of my guildies have it and he says it's very low procrate, 3% something :(
---
This could be a personal resolution situation.  Forced removal of something he might find harmful?
---
cut him some slack, hes a hunter
---
Do you like being camped or do you like doing the camping so much that you're willing to get camped to make up for it? I'm conflicted right now, I want to get revenge on the horde and just go shit on people lower than me to show them how it feels. That's like the spirit of pvp servers right? But I would feel like such a massive prick. I don't want to ruin other people's fun. I want to pvp to get into fair fights that are exciting. But damn do I want revenge.
---
Doubling money
---
Def recommend playing a race focused around her, so she actually has fun playing. Warrior not a good one to go for her warlock. I suggest maybe play some type of healer, or go hunter for double pet tanking.
---
This is a great tip! Thank you!
---
Nice
---
Can anyone recommend a pacific server with reasonable faction balance?
---
This a new copypasta?
---
There's always the possibility that the player decided he would be better off away from WoW. Hopefully that's the case (instead of a worse possibility) and things improve for him.
---
I watched someone play 10 boomkins with auto aoe a whole mob area. One char ran around and looted everything. No idea how retail is working, but I think you can also mine ore nodes 40x 1
---
Go fuck youself, you waste of sperm.
---
No, worth switching to holy. And only holy.  This is coming from a pali player.
---
I ignore people like that. Eventually I’ll have a good percentage of them ignored and they’ll have one less tank to choose from.
---
It’s not much, but it’s honest work.
---
Check out PreparedWow to see one type of toxic multiboxer. Before anyone asks: I don't have the energy to try to describe his toxicity... It's easier to just to check him out yourself.
---
Yes, because by his WoW name everyone knows who he is and his personal problems.
---
You’d be upset for people you played with wanting to know why you quit a game? That’s a little odd. Probably more socially awkward than op being a concerned person.
---
Unless you are leveling feral, then all the leather you see has int/spirit :)
---
Go to Opposite faction zones, find the chests, Leave the cheese.
---
&gt;There is literally no point in asking that question
---
There's a huge point. The point is to make you agree and disagree with the exact same statement. 
---
&gt;So it's turning one input into multiple
---
&gt;So you're pressing one button, but it's doing things on multiple accounts with 1 button press
---
Are you having to use 3rd party software to run these accounts or not?
---
People are spamming chats all the time with their guild recruitments
---
&gt; To explain, the basic concept of multiboxing is allowing all the game clients to SEE the input. It's not creating additional input.
---
That's. Botting. You're absolutely creating the net result of an additional, computer-dictated input, multiple times, from a single human input. 
---
It's fascinating how you can repeatedly use more and more convoluted explanations about why the creation of automated output is anything short of botting.
---
camping only happens if they hate your guild or you personally lol
---
[But what about this?](https://youtu.be/TuBGAESIAMg?t=13)  Not trying to say you aren't right sir or mam..I just hear conflicting arguments daily and its hard to trust that this is for competitive reasons :/
---
If you are doing a kill quest in area and someone else is there, invite them without asking. Then you can say hi and wanna quest together if they accept. Most zones also have some party quests that you can't solo, usually you find people for them by posting LFG quest on general chat, /1 by default. Once grouped, again you can ask if they'd do more of the zone together if you have same quests. And maybe just join a guild of one of those people who seem decent. It's easy to /gquit later anyway if it doesn't seem right.
---
Mafiaaaa incomingggg!
---
Yeah, hence what I said.
---
Did you have dots?  Didn’t you have to macro or be quick to do it since you get put back in combat.
---
I don't see a disadvantage there. Even if you ruin their sync, it's still in the bare minimum a 1v1. Most of the time they instakill you anyway.
---
Do not go balance, only go balance if you want to be laughed at and not be picked for dungeons. I repeat. DO NOT GO BALANCE.
---
90% I don't mind being on a pvp server. I win a fight? Feels great! I lose a close fight? I'm hyped up and ready for another shot. I get one shot by a level 60 at level 30? God, it just makes me so angry because there's just nothing I can do about it.
---
You're an absolute dick and obviously don't know shit.
---
Just so you know, it is only going to get worse. If you're not having fun now, switch while it is still early.
---
&gt; "attack thing tank is attacking"
---
It is essential but it's not as easy as tanks think to pick the right target when the tank hasn't marked the one they're building agro on. A good tank will build a little agro on each mob so they don't go running after the healer, so if I F assist you when you happen to be hitting one of those secondary mobs, I'm going to think that's your target and smack the crap out of it. That's why we use the skull.
---
What UI are you using?
---
Good for him!! Are you surprised that someone was able to break the spell and get back to real life? Loved ones and adventures and a lasting sense of accomplishment are WAITING FOR YOU
---
Yeah man, and don't feel bad if it doesn't feel like a fit after a few days or a week. Just remember, people in the guild have their own stuff going on too so if you want questing partners you may have to travel more often than you're used to.
---
We just had a guild master in classic disband the guild, delete discord channel, and delete his toon.   Literally 11pm we were all talking, everything was fine.  By 1am, everything deleted.  That was over a week ago, and no one has heard a peep.  He ghosted everyone.  Didnt turn the guild over, no heads up, nothing.   
---
We were also worried, but since he physically deleted so many things, hes probably fine.  Just decided out of the blue to quit.   Weird.
---
Yea, I've been following Joanas guide (speedlevel record holder in vanilla). There is a lot of "grind mobs towards" and "grind mobs here until X level"
---
The dwarf hunters I've been mercilessly slaughtering for weeks would agree. They're paying for the crimes of their brothers in hillbrad. I kill their pets first.

nice old chubby beagle I have one as well
---
nothing prepared you? all the comments of spawn camping and high levels killing lowbies didn't warn you?
---
This just links to the photo in the op for me on mobile. Can anyone paste what they said here?
---
Jeez this hits home. My brother did this on WoW years ago before attempting suicide. (He did take his life a few years after that). This is a very real concern and thank you so much for your care and compassion, I hope your friend is ok.
---
Very good bot.
---
Literally the entire point of the OPs post was that he joined what appeared to be a normal group and then got booted when they could build a spellcleave group
---
1. Depends on how you look at it, for people that played the game only before Cata it will be but if you played after or only after Cata then it'll be a bit different overall since so much changed in the world when that was released
---
2. Yes, technically they are since every expansion changed classes somehow. Very prominent skills that classes have in retail might be way different or possibly even absent in classic
---
3. As far as I know, yes, there is no scaling raids
---
4. I think so, at least for a month to see how different everything is
---
I've been in that cycle and I am not entirely sure how to break it either. I think you kind of just have to sit down, really think about it and just push. You can't have the other classes on your mind if you truly want to reach that end game.
---
If I were you, I would play that Mage and get to 60. Only 14 more levels! Plus it is a strong class in all aspects of the game. PvP, PvE (if you do eventually want to get into it and it is usefully to get gear for PvP), Gold Farming, etc.
---
Hope you find which one truly suits you and you can always level the others as alts, we have a lot of time left in Phase 1 probably.
---
It is blizzards fault for not implementing something to balance the faction. They could put the horde players on queu or just not let to make horde characters etc but nothing was done.
---
Huh, literally have a pic of this when i was passing by. This is in incendious right?
---
Just try it and if you don't enjoy it don't play. Pretty simple
---
Interesting, would you happen to be maining a pally?
---
Yooo this is awesome! I’ve got violenceLevel set as well. Are there any other hidden gems like this? I’m all about that eye candy.
---
I'd like to imagine he is just roleplaying with himself totally lost in the world and the backstories of his alts
---
That sounds pretty miserable tbh
---
It is 3rd party software. Much like the drivers of your keyboard. And your monitor. And your mouse. Everything not owned by Blizzard is 3rd party software. Windows 10 is third party software. Third party software here is not relevant. 
---
&gt;There's a huge point. The point is to make you agree and disagree with the exact same statement.
---
That's not a point and there is no reason for doing that because you asked the question wrong to get the response you wanted.
---
This just in, wowhead is trash.
---
I've done well and enjoyed dps`ing, tanking and healing dungeons. 
---
In raids, doubt you will get a spot as tank, hots don't stack so unless you have the most heal power of all druids in raid you will be HT spamming as resto and dps is shred shred power shift shred shred bite which I find boring. All of the raid functions are underwhelming imo.
---
Solo it's a fantastic playstyle and PvP I think it's great too with the added bonus of being the star player in WSG.
---
Even 3% is decent. 3% chance to deal 3 times the damage with an Auto OR Ability. That means 100% damage output would become 106% and even that isn't quite right, cause hitchances work different in WoW. Effectively those 3% apply always, even if you only hit the enemy with 70% of your attacks. 70% to 76% is an effective increase of 8,6% damage output.
---
Are you just looking for a reason to be mad at me, or what?
---
It doesn't, but they'd probably never end up in that situation in the first place without the multiboxer. You'll very rarely see a party of five doing a random generic quest, so you're safe most of the time. When multiboxers quest, they can just roflstomp anyone they see instantly.
---
What's wrong with your UI? I've seen prettier trainwreck dude!
---
You’ll have to get freakier than that before you make a suggestion that I *haven’t* tried.
---
I think its cheating. Like you said yourself you have maxed professions on all 5 accounts that you leveled at the same time, where as a normal player would have to spend 5x as long as you to do the same thing. Also its super annoying to have them dd then insta kill you with a press of a button, where as 5 different players need to be on point to achieve the same thing.
---
Justify cheating however ya want. It's botting. Everyone with functioning brain cells says it's botting. A company that profits from it not being classified as botting putting out a strict, narrow definition of how they can excuse this cheating, botting behavior because it makes them money doesn't change the fact that it's botting. 
---
You can rephrase how using a third party program to computationally generate additional inputs from a single input is not botting all you want. The fact is, it's botting.
---
34 Alliance unsure where to go next. Got a few quests in Arathi and Alterac, but currently a bit under-leveled for those
---
Druid - level 24
---
Priest - level 21
---
Mage - level 20
---
I've been waiting for my friends to play more so we can run some dungeons, but the fact I have three characters at 20 while they barely have one each says a lot. I'm far more addicted to Classic than they are.
---
&gt;in almost no scenario have I seen that actually being used to take away enjoyment from another user.
---
Do you happen to be playing on a PvE server? Multiboxing is essentially a pay-to-win situation in non-organized PvP. Sure, a coordinated party will pick a multiboxer apart, but that's exactly what P2W is - make one player be worth 3 or 4 normal players because they pay the company more.
---
Weirdly enough it does, it's like having your best friend lose his personality and soul, and just be a mindless husk following you around.
---
And to the people that know what they're doing and actually give us constructive criticism, thank you.
---
As a new player rolling Mage, I like it when you give me tips and easy to understand orders that someone who's never played WoW can decipher. Because of them, I've learnt a few things like when and who to polymorph (I've saved quite a few fights with it so I'm guessing I'm doing something right), and some useful talents I should be working towards. I only wish more people would tell me if I'm doing something wrong.
---
Ah that might be it, I swear everyone takes the same path after the bridge and comes back almost the same amount of time after disappearing from my screen.
---
I'm having trouble with having my pet use all 3 abilities without being totally focus starved. I have a level 29 owl with rank 4 claw, 1 screech and ofc growl. If I leave claw and screech to autocast, they use up so much focus that if I pull aggro, my pet usually doesn't have enough left for a manual growl. What should I be doing with these spells to allow me to maximise levelling damage between myself and pet?
---
For context, I am currently doing one of two things while levelling - either I have ONLY growl set to auto cast with some manual claw casts, OR I use claw and screech on auto, giving my pet a headstart on the mob (usually 10-15% of their hp). The first choice means my pet has aggro most of the time (barring back-to-back bow crits), but obviously with less pet damage. The second scenario gives my pet more damage, but with no access to claw, and isn't much faster given that I have to hold off my own damage to let it generate some headstart aggro.
---
I was playing OSRS (albeit F2P) for a few weeks leading up to Classic release... I'd forgotten how much of a dogshit, awful, boring grindfest that RuneScape is.
---
You gonna tell your mom it is too hard?
---
Yeah it’s annoying enough as a lowly DPS trying to find a group. Now we got cock suckers who want mage only DPS on top of it. Neck.
---
Yes it is.
---
Definition "Automatic":
---
1. Yes the content is all vanilla content split into phases. 
---
2. Different from what? Everything in classic is the same as vanilla. Specifically it's all from patch 1.12. 
---
3. Yes the 40 man raids are back but there's always been 10 man, 15 man and 20 man raids. 
---
4. Do you honestly expect an answer to such a subjective question on such a biased subreddit? We are on this subreddit because we like it. Of course we are going to think it's worth playing.
---
he really is
---
Tits or gtfo
---
You are beginning to find your way lol.
---
".. motivation to get 60 is probably going to be so I can shit on some horde people so hard that they quit the fucking game.."
---
Stay the course, get to 60 and get retribution for the all the time that assholes took from you while you were leveling.  👌
---
Stick it out to return the favor.
---
Those 15 seconds is every nerds dream
---
Amazing job! You're very latented :) If you don't mind me asking, is your whistle in C or D key?
---
I'm basically looking at building towards a build just like this, except I think I swapped bof/bop talent for precision and I debated not taking holy shock to get up to 21 in prot and get the sanctuary blessing.
---
Still undecided whether my build will be 30/21/0 or 34/17/0
---
Ancient bone bow from scholomance :)
---
hoping he comes back!
---
Why is multi boxing not considered cheating
---
Anything you can do to Herod's shoulder you could do to the Wrangling Spaulders. They don't go a long way, since both get replaced as soon as you get into ZF and can get your Big Bad Pauldrons.
---
our tank has PTSD every time we run to MC now. 
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/EncouragingCredulousBatteryYouDontSay](https://clips.twitch.tv/EncouragingCredulousBatteryYouDontSay)
---
I will if he comes back lol
---
Yeah. That’s part of the issue, too. 
---
Are you just going gquit and spec ret once your guild has geared you out?
---
It just seems like a lost cause any way you shake it to me.
---
If you raid you will be last priority on DPS gear, get a lot of holy gear, and likely have to drop from the raid group if you want to spec ret at that point and people might be pretty pissed off at you. 
---
If you don’t raid, your gear will suck and your damage will be pathetic in addition to having no gap close, execute, etc.
---
I highly doubt this is the only case to ever happen, and I can also confirm and prove I have had 2 other prior RWT false bans occur to me, which were both overturned. This is again, not an uncommon occurrence. Claiming is it against a person who has been on the other side of it, not once, but three times is kind of laughable. I'm a single person in millions, I doubt I am just the highlight of uniqueness in millions.
---
It's not a huge hate boner, I'm just using third party software to duplicate a single contemptuous observation. /s
---
Sad to hear that. I thought exactly the same when I made my new char but then just started to lvl it very casually and on rppvp the community is a lot more mature and friendly compared to pvp servers so thats probably the reason Im still playing.
---
just find one that suits your needs.
---
You could, then if you dont like them just leave
---
Just looked him up, that 12 monitor setup is nuts lol
---
I thought the gizzards were ok, I gave up on the basilisk brains and AH`d them after dropping quest. These are good raid consumables btw so something you could be farming (or buy from AH) for the life of classic
---
It is cheating since GM will take action against you, it's called Terrain Exploitation which can get you ban.
---
I didn't write the rules.
---
Seriously thank you for your replies. I love your point about pve servers feeling like a single player game, I've loved the mmo experience of classic so much that I think that's one of the reasons I've been so hesitent to just reroll on a pve server.
---
I had a gentle experience in stv as well.  But I have to say that I wish I had a nemesis!
---
I know less than nothing about this game, but the fact that it can create as connection between total strangers makes me happy.
---
I hope you're able to get back in contact with your buddy and I hope he pulls through whatever BS he's currently having to trudge through.
---
This is how I feel too. I never got that sense of community cos I started playing just before Legion. 
---
The experiences I've had on Classic were what I wanted to have from WoW.
---
Love this community. Y’all actually care about each other
---

---
level a warrior... you'll either be determined to hit 60 cuz masochist or you will quit the game all together. Win win
---
Except that they do
---
Someone always does something first that results in spawn camping. I was running through duskwood last night on my 33 rogue and a ?? Troll Hunter atttacked me, I died quickly and he kept moving. 
---
If you're being corpse camped it's your fault.
---
I'm very sorry to hear about your brother. I lost my cousin a similar way a few years ago. Please know that it isn't your fault. I hope you are doing okay now. Thank you for the kind words about my friend.
---
get a friend who is not inside the dungeon with you to reset the dungeon while youre logged out

Lol it's like telling a chainsmoker that they should smoke in moderation instead of quitting cold turkey. Pointless and unhelpful if someone's got a mental or physical addiction. No shit their problems come from overuse, but with an addictive personality it's hard to safely maintain a healthy space between all or nothing.
---
Blizzard, need to talk to jagex amd help them improve
---
Terrain Exploitation will get you ban, I've seen plenty of cases like this.
---
is anyone doubting 5 players can beat a 5 man multibox? I think they are complaining that one person has no chance against one person controlling 5 toons, which is pretty much true. The only hope would be if you can one shot the toon the rest are following, perhaps possible, but I assume the multiboxer can just switch to another one easily and still have 4, maybe 3 toons left if it takes a few seconds, that will be able to melt you down instantly.
---
I'm a recovering heroin addict as well, and even though there isn't physical withdrawal I can still empathize with people addicted to games. Anything that hits the reward centers of our brains can become addictive. Tell me it doesn't feel good to win a roll on a BiS piece youve been chasing for a week straight? It might not be banging dope, but it still feels good. There's probably a reason former addicts play games like this.
---
Yes they will.
---
no, my tanks just aren't bad, i also lack WF totem.
---
Lol... Strikers Mark actually does less damage than the Carapace Spine Crossbow from Strat UD because of its speed.
---
Leave any guild that gives a Striker's to a hunter.
---
Reminds me of an old forum post, someone complained about Bears not being able to parry or block, but then some dude posted a funny reply, something along the lines of:
---
Don't worry man, Warriors are pussies, when you ask them "What do you tank with, Mr. Warrior?", they will reply "With my mighty weapon and towering shield". That's great and all, but I'm a huge Bear, none of this deflecting blows with equipment and shit, I tank with my FACE.
---
Yes they do, I see them all the time.
---
Yeah, I think this is the only way in default settings. 
---
It's probably better overall to just use a UI addon, though.
---
tanks are good till naxx, dps is trash
---
#NoChanges :P
---
Yeah griefing is an absolute riot. Not.
---
not true, some people just randomly do it because they think its fun to try and ruin someone else's fun.
---
Minor details. The key point here is that both are examples of third-party software being used to gain an unfair advantage over players who are not using that third-party software. I would be completely fine with multiboxing if it was strictly limited to running multiple clients at the same time and manually switching between which one you control.
---
Streamer privilege is very real.
---
Back in the day a guy like that could make thousands a month selling gold/farming mats/accounts.
---
Stuff like this doesn't happen outside of cancerous streamer/4channer servers, its your own fault for rolling with the type of people who play there.
---
How can people play without autoloot?!
---
My ret pally also has options for mana regen. Seal of Wisdom, Judgement of Wisdom, blessing of Wisdom. Gives plenty of mp5 and mana regen to fill up without ever needing spirit.
---
I mean a lot of classes bis lists have very little spirit on them. And the melee hybrids have almost no intellect too.
---
Some people literally have nothing better to do than try to ruin others' fun.
---
If this happens to you guys just report to GM and they will get a 1 month ban, its called Terrain Exploitation and ia not tolerated by blizzard.
---
Goodnight.
---
It's not stealing when your both level appropriate.   If I over level the zone and am farming, I'll invite people I see and tell them what I need. They get my increased kill speed. I get the mats I need.  Usually works out really well.
---
Griefing rofl

Copied text:

Hi all, just caught sight of this thread. @ u/NAparentheses I don't mean to cause any undue concern here, but I would like to put it out there that if you ever do think there's a situation that needs to be looked into, you can let us know. Although in this case there is no immediate indication from what OP has stated that there's any intention of self-harm, a related concern should be submitted to us via the 'real-life threat' category listed here.
---
Of note, we were able to identify the account and are taking a look. I will not provide any specific details in this situation, but you can be sure that if we ever find any indication that a player is having a hard time of things we'll want to make contact and make sure all is well.
---
Edit: missed a word
---
woah!
---
I'm 33 and played vanilla on a high pop back then. Def way more prevalent now than it was.
---
Heroin isn't an addiction, you ever sucked dick for Heroin?  Huh?  
---
Boo this man!
---
And yet...You're here. A part of it.
---
Here you go: 
---
&gt;multiboxer... whitemane...
---
naw fuck off stay banned
---
With the option to have a "hey dont autoloot this" key
---
Shit is whack indeed! Thanks for sharing got a good laugh out of that.
---
Does it tab you out of the game when this happens?
---
Can you tab back in?
---
Yes but they did specifically state you will not be allowed to play all of them at the same time.
---
That's been one thing I've noticed as I've been leveling a bit... Leveling isn't really hard, but it's a massive chore compared to other classes. I might just stick with my Druid. Fun leveling and a bit more of a unique endgame, especially with HotW spec
---
Is there a way to reliably turn off wand auto-attacking completely, without moving or jumping? 
---
I feel like there's some measure of timing at play, as I'm able to strafe between wand casts without it shutting off which is OK. That said, I'd like a reliable cancel so I can cast a spell without it deciding to do one more wand shoot.
---
Sorry about your friend but how do you get those profession icons and other things to appear on the right side of your screen is this a mod?
---
Wasn't it done with 3 man as well or was that WoLK onyxia
---
&gt;Justify cheating however ya want.
---
Not justifying it. It's fact that it is allowed by Blizzard.
---
&gt;It's botting.
---
Your word means nothing.
---
&gt;Everyone with functioning brain cells says it's botting.
---
This statement means nothing. *"Everyone with functioning brain cells says it isn't botting at all"*. You have no source and are arguing bullshit.
---
&gt;A company that profits from it not being classified as botting putting out a strict, narrow definition of how they can excuse this cheating, botting behavior because it makes them money doesn't change the fact that it's botting.
---
You saying a bunch of words doesn't change the fact that it's not botting. You have zero objective support that proves it's botting.
---
&gt;You can rephrase how using a third party program to computationally generate additional inputs from a single input is not botting all you want.
---
It's not additional inputs. It's one input. Not botting.
---
&gt;The fact is, it's botting.
---
The fact is, it's not botting.
---
In my opinion multiboxing is blatant cheating and should not be tolerated at all. Sure give a fair warning like 3 months ahead that this policy is coming but still. It's fucking cheating.
---
ah yeah? I dont have to be outside the instance to reset it?    
---
and it'll teleport me outside?
---
You are an awful human being. I've worked front of house for 18 years and my job entails a LOT more than "carrying a plate 10m".
---
However, I do think that the kitchen staff deserve a share of tips!
---
Video games aren't like nicotine or alcohol. They are a recreational activity and not a physical addiction. Presumably these people still have fun with some activity. Why single out gaming? What if they instead develop a gambling addiction or TV addiction or whatever? I'm just saying that video games aren't the real problem there and getting rid of a hobby doesn't seem like they're actually addressing the problem.

---
If this happens to my Broken Tooth that I spent 36 hours and tamed at 2AM to come into work the next day and drag ass for 8 hours for, well....
---
Why does everyone think their boring game play is worth posting? We don't need shameless stream promotion over every little thing people have happen in game.
---
I mean thats a 5v1, does anyone have a chance in that?  Multibox or not?  That would be a dumb comment to make.
---
Playing Warlock, lv50 currently. Looking up what to level next as alt; I'm mainly a PvP'er, but will do guild-raids too.
---
My alt current choices are ; Rogue, Hunter or Mage.
---
I love mage primarily as fire or PoM pyro spec. Heavily dislike frost pvp'ing and fire isn't that strong in the early phases.
---
I LOVE ROGUE open world pvp in general, leveling is a slog, end game dungeons are meh. Not as efficient for gold as mage or hunter.
---
Hunter is awesome. I don't have very high experience as a hunter in pvp, but they are amazing to level &amp; as a warlock, i really like pets.
---
So from a pure leveling/goldmaking ability / pvp potential, I'm not sure what to pick. Obviously mage is the best in terms of pvp, but idk. I just wanna have fun while use it as a great alt for gold/proffs/etc
---
I never said I'm trying to find him. I don't care if he ever talks to me again. I just want him to be okay.
---
A user isn't the same as somebody who voluntarily gives money to them.
---
Sorry, it's officially not cheating under Blizzard's TOS. You can call it cheating all you want but that doesn't make it cheating.
---
This is why i dont play on PVP.
---
I enjoy PVP, but in a controlled environment like Battlegrounds (Which im waiting for).
---
Not being camped while trying to quest, or stuck somewhere because the other faction has taken out the flightmaster.
---
So much rogue gear.
---
Maybe if you complain about how much you hate multiboxers some more they'll change the TOS.
---
Yeah the big thing with PvE servers is that right now there are no battlegrounds, so if people aren't flagged for PvP... You just won't get to experience it at all. And honestly, the PvP while leveling up is some of the best since everyone wears crappy gear, barely knows what to do, and generally involves some panthers/tigers biting a player somewhere between. 
---
You can always roll another toon on a PvE server and give it a go, but if you are looking for PvP, I honestly can't imagine you'll find much on PvE servers until they add battlegrounds. 
---
But take that with a grain of salt, I've never played on a PvE server so I'm not sure how many people actually flag themselves, I've just seen various screenshots/vids and it seems like most people keep the flag off for the most part.
---
MY CABBAGE
---
So I've been leveling my shaman with a friend to 60 and so far I haven't run into any issues with tanking dungeons with just whatever two-hander I have and I'm pretty confident a relatively new player could do it
---
Tbh I heal dps or tank depending on who I can get on quick notice by forming my own groups, though I prefer to find a healer, but I don't really focus on tanks because I know I can do it myself
---
Vilifying a single game - or any game - is missing the point. It's not WoW by itself, it's any type of addiction, incl. Gaming. You can loose yourself in games, especially in MMOs, and WoW definitely has a reputation for it. But that's due to their size and public visibility. The same you can say about any game, even fantasy football. I've also seen positive things happen in WoW. I still have some real life friends I met in the early days of WoW 14 years ago, and I also know people he met their significant other in game. I'm not a psychologist, but from my experience it comes down to personality types. Some are more unstable, and tend to be more prone to addiction, be it physically or mentally. They also tend to be more self destructive, and alienate others more. And then there a people who just find something in a game what they can't find in real life. That could be a friend or community of similar minded people, or just something to retreat and relax.
---
Looks like 10g to me
---
Escape?
---
Wait, they silenced you in WoW for something you did in Overwatch?
---
druid healers are the absolute worst for dungeons... if they are your only rez in the group and something goes poorly its the worst feeling in the world.
---
I’m ok, thank you. It helps to see that as a society we are learning.
---
5 v 1 is 5 players vs 1 player. 1 player vs 1 player with 5 accounts isn't the same thing at all.
---
Run SM Runs till 40 is my suggestion
---
I think it'd be hilarious if you could nudge teammates or enemies around slightly like you can in Overwatch. But it would be hella griefy

Just so you know—the FCC requires station identification at the top of every hour. The bit that usually reads like "You're listening to 94.9 WSUX, a Cumulus station" is there to fulfill a legal obligation.

---
Grow up, turd.
---
&gt;It's not that Spirit is useless, it's that all of the other stats are better. Maybe it's better than Stamina on PvE servers.
---
Strongly disagree.  The only stat I'd value over spirit leveling an enhancement shaman is Agi.  The amount of STR/ap needed to actually remove a swing from the hits per kill against a mob is on average a worse investment than just increasing crit.  It also gives you dodge.  Your base mana pool is more than enough so Int is pretty much worthless when you can just regen the mana faster with spirit.  Stamina is whatever - probably going to end up with enough anyways.
---
Isn't it refreshing to know that the ideal stuff has to be figured out in another way? People were worried about classic being "figured out", but there is evidently still stuff out there that you can't find with a quick google search.
---
I guess that's all that matters.
---
Most Bwl mobs have pretty high fr, too, iirc. I first switched to fire for raiding in aq40. Also, crit chances increase from gear making fire even nicer with rolling ignites.
---
Hold right mouse key and use A and D. It becomes strafe. There is no advantage to ever strafing with Q and E over this.
---
It never will be, no matter how much you complain. Suck it up.

Your operating system is literally a software. It is third party to WoW. Your keystrokes are input in the game through this third party software.
---
&gt;Installing autohotkey or some other bot software to replicate commands is third party software.
---
If autohotkey is bot software, then the keystroke input software you use is also bot software. And the software you use is also third party.
---
&gt;Hell, they've banned people for razer/logitech macros because it's, you guessed it, third party software. 
---
No, Blizzard bans things that allow you to commit actions in the game without your direct input. They ban things that lets you afk cast spells. That is what botting is according to Blizzard. Blizzard did not ban them because they were simply "third party".
---
&gt;You don't know what "third party" means. 
---
I do know what it means, you don't.
---
&gt;You're making absurd statements and expecting me to address them. It's like expecting a judge to accept that "sovereign citizen" bullshit. You're not making clever arguments, you're not even making an argument. You're making ridiculous, absurd statements to justify an indefensible position.
---
I'm stating facts. Facts that contradicts your opinion. This was your original statement: 
---
&gt;Is it possible without third party software? No? Then fuck off, it's botting.
---
Is it possible for you to input your keystrokes and mouse clicks without third party software? If not, then you are botting. And yes, the keystroke software that comes with your windows 10 from microsoft is a third party software to WoW.
---
I made a macro for dismount and stealth and it’s awesome.
---
At least they recognize the skills.
---
Funny, I had a level 18 druid that I stopped playing for same reasons. People here convinced me to stick with it till cat form, and I'm glad that I did. Level 26 now and the power spike is insane. Cat form is loads of fun, and it will only get better at level 32 when I get ravage and ferocious bite. Definitely stick with it!
---
I guess the downvotes speak for themselves, but you don’t find yourself needing to like, walk around, at all...?!
---
Thanks a lot! I was just reading this thread and your explanation finally clicked with me. I tried to make a similar macro and had given up since I didn't know what was wrong.
---
its the guy who publicly stated he's ok with his guild ninja looting as long as they ONLY do it to non-guildmates.
---
Or get a warning then banned, according to the ToS. Try harder or give it up.
---
For small group content and pvp, they're great. 
---
The problem is if by endgame you mean raiding. Not only did they got hit harder by the hybrid tax than any other class, they also are balanced around their disgustingly strong cooldowns. 
---
As a result, they're just weaker in any given role than a different class in that role could be. That doesn't mean it's impossible to find a group, because there aren't too many people who wouldn't bring you just for access to Tranquility, Innervate, and Rebirth, but it means that you need to be mindful that you fall behind nearly everyone else in terms of role presence.
---
Them being weaker in a given role also doesn't mean they can't do it. Druids excel in dungeons because of that versatility. The content we'll be clearing isn't so difficult that you need to have a highly-optimized group of 40 people to pass, either. 
---
In fact, there used to be a common sentiment that you brought the player, not the class or spec. If you go out of your way to be an effective, friendly player, the majority of people will happily bring you over someone who is statistically better but personally worse.
---
I suppose the tl;dr is, no non-Warrior class is needed, and even that statement will be disagreed with before long. Be the kind of player you'd want to play with, and you'll find groups.
---

From what I remember the 3 and 5 man teams started to be able to do it towards the end of BC.
---
Awkward...
---
Why isn't there a view distance slider ingame but there's add more additional grass and stuff?
---
1 thing I can 100% personally vouch for is that Blizzard has some of the greatest CS agents out there. They really go above and beyond for you and are incredibly friendly and human.
---
Always look at the sale price of a quest objective first especially these early cooking ones. If it's an alt, it is probably worth your time just to buy.  
---
Equally, some quests require materials worth dozens of gold, like the Blasted Lands one. I wouldn't trade 10g for 5k XP.
---
Got lucky and snagged him last week. Good luck OP
---
Yes, Ret is viable in pvp. It was viable 15 years ago. It's viable in classic.
---
People like PVP servers because of the risk. Getting killed by 60s sucks, but that’s part of the risk and adds that bit of apprehension when you’re questing in a contested zone. 
---
Generally this is where guildies come in. Call in some muscle and take those campers out!
---
I’ve always played on PVP servers and I don’t kill low levels unless we’re raiding a base or as vengeance for a guildie. I’d say most people on PVP servers do the same. But it isn’t for everyone.
---
I'm on a US server but based in aus. I'm a little bit concerned about my 200-odd latency for raiding. I'm hoping to be MT or at least OT for my guild but not sure if the latency is gonna be an issue.
---
on the oceanic servers, i have like 10ms, so it looks like there's a big difference - although i can't tell
---
IV is GARBAGE.  Do not use that website.
---
Undead is pretty much the go-to race for multiboxers, though.
---
Like the only decent comp that can't use undead is 4war/sham or 5sham and both of those have access to tremor. (Druid also, but 5druid, and druid in general is pretty meh)
---
I can't remember who it was, but there was a big WoW YouTuber a few years ago who was getting away with RWT for a long-ass time because Blizzard just never investigated him or something. There's definitely some sort of flag that makes people immune to the standard methods of detection everyone else has to deal with.
---
what a shame
---
Didn't say it was. But you're still part of the mechanism that keeps the site afloat. You're still a user, posting, arguing, one of the many that keeps Reddit consistently as one of the most popular sites on the internet. And that popularity = money, in so many ways.
---
This is false. Would ne worse luck had you rolled first

He saw 1 and knew he was losing.

But if he saw your 2, hes gotta think "no fucking way I lose"

THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAALLL
---
You should have taken the warnings about playing a druid. But will tell you the best way to get a group is to start one yourself. Or stop healing and start tanking.
---
I main a druid and the number of times I've had to tank/heal with a DPS Warrior/SPriest in the group is absurd. I'll do it, cus that's why I picked druid. But why are ya'll making me wait for a healer when there's a priest in the group?
---
Learn them from rogue trainer at certain lvls.
---
Love pets? Love pvp? Don't mind raiding? Gold making - well, the AH should be where you are at if you want gold, so any would do. Grinding mobs for gold, then that's a mage i guess. But Hunters can solo mid-level dungeons as well.
---
Sounds like you want a Hunter.
---
Works only some of the time, not all the time unfortunately.
---
like this comment
---
Im at the right level, but my trainer isnt showing me it
---
Was he in the military?  Many years ago I ghosted an account after dumping my player assets in a random passerby in the game.  Not supposed to discuss military orders, transfers and troop movements and the like.  I was getting deployed overseas and was going to be sans computer access for over a year.
---
&gt;The developers didn't make this game with multiboxing in mind.
---
If this were true, it would be against the TOS. You are so full of shit it's pathetic.
---
Realistically, you farm boe epics on the first week a raid drops.
---
this game is gay
---
That's a pretty shitty approach if you happen to be a hunter though. Technically an upgrade doesn't mean you should be needing warrior bis that's mediocre for you.
---
whitemane
---
That’s actually my plan - I made my warrior to smash Papercut to (nostalgia reasons, played whilst I had a warrior in vanilla running through Arathi highlands - _whirlwind inside of my head”._ )
---
I didn't doubt it.
---
Be honest, we’re you completely innocent when you got camped?  Were you killing anyone or getting too greedy pulling mobs?  Or were you in northern stv or hillsbrad perhaps? 
---
A lot of players don’t quite understand the “etiquette” of a pvp server.  Anything you do around the enemy faction is a risk.  If there are more of them than there are of you in an area it’s not certain death but you have to be more timid taking quest mobs and give respect.  And if there are more of you then you can throw your weight around more.
---
If you run up and immediately start killing people “because” you can expect to waste a lot of time.  You will also get killed sometimes by bored people who are usually on the way to do something else.  If you Rez and take it out on the others around who had nothing to do with it it’s just going to make it worse.  If you are getting camped you either call for help or do something else until they are bored and leave.  
---
A strategy I like to do is wait until I see an an enemy faction player extremely vulnerable.  Maybe they are even going to die to a mob.  Then I walk up and kill the mob.  It scares them but they figure out I didn’t mean any harm.  I don’t bother with emotes.  But in their mind they see my name and remember I could have been a prick but wasn’t.  They may mention it to others around asking.  There’s definitely bored high levels cruising through zones asking if they need help sometimes.
---
The only time I've DPS'd a dungeon as a Druid was running my low level friends through WC. I mean... I tanked and self healed too, but I also topped dps.  
---
My leveling spec is DPS Feral btw.
---
Blizzard CS went to downhill when they fired most of their CS staff and outsourced a lot of their Customer Service
---
&gt;Sadly I don't believe this will ever be a thing. Many guilds/players are withholding info/theorycrating results in order to get world firsts
---
wat lmao all this content has been done to death over the past 15 years there's absolutely no furhter thought needed how to do even naxx or AQ40. plenty of info is available because of the wide popularity of private server classic wow
---
Just tested this and seems to function in the same manner as Escape. Only works some of the time, not reliably. Possibly related to timing.
---
Well, you should probably talk to your guild...it may be that they can do that, just depends.
---
First aid is always allowed in a duel. Potions are the ones they should be mad at.
---
No it didn't lol.
---
The automated software(or lack of, in this case - you'll never get banned for input broadcasting unless someone manually reports you) doesn't care whether you are using a mechanical device or software, it all looks the same.
---
Okay? The whole point of this post was to tell you to *stop* needlessly healing us because we don't need you to be our mana refill.
---
They won't tell him either. Major liability issues.
---
What world do you people live in?
---
So I see tons of people recording clips, and apparently it's with some thing where they have the function to record the last 30 secs of their gameplay.
---
1. How can I figure out if I have this?
---
2. If I don't have this, how can I get it or something like it?
---
plot twist: That's an orc, and they can't be mages yet.
---
Yeah i don't see many other ally guilds actively enforcing the no entry without shoes dress code in the mountain. I guess they spend a lot more time clearing MC...
---
They prefer the term 'NPC'.
---
Getting to 10 is a couple hours. Getting to 20 seems to be close to a day.  I went over a day leveling to 20 this time around because I leveled fishing and cooking along the way but it definitely slows down a lot.
---
That guy got a pretty nice guildies and a friend I suppose. It's better to check him out though. 
---
It happened with my buddy as well, our main tank, when TBC was released he said, he is done with this game, all BS that blizzard do to ruin the game etc. So, after a short rant, he ended up sending all his gold to me, waved a hand and logged out, forever. 
---
Well, the game was everything for him, he had some health issues, I think he was disabled or something. Sometimes I wonder, is he okay? Although it's been \~12 years

Pve may as well be offline mode

People getting unreasonably upset about something isn't even isolated to games. So thinking about it for even a second makes it clear that the claim "it started in BC" is just silly. It's happened since before WoW even existed, why pretend it's some special thing that happens in the game and is caused by a particular mechanic?
---
Good points

Lots of Zerg guilds on Rattlegore horde who will invite anyone. Pony up.

Holy shit that is hilarious and sad. Hope that very few people fell for that.

For warrior macros, I created one but the icon isn't greyed out so I can't, easily, tell that it's procced so that I can change stances and use it.

I think it goes like

/cast battle stance

/cast overpower

if i remove the showtooltip, would that fix it? im at work atm
---
Thats an officer from his guild responding...
---
Don’t trade them then. I get it that it costs you nothing but if you constantly just give it away and take time away from farming or leveling then it impacts you. Which is why I tip. 
---
Don’t trade them if they aren’t tipping. Also when I ask I always use the word buy. “WTB mage food” “may I buy some food off you” etc 
---
Seems a lot of people in classic right now are huge entitled cry babies so don’t trade with them. I literally had another war rage quit a dungeon and then PM me for 3 days harassing me because I took nagle ring from him even though I stated I’m rolling on tank gear when I was invited to the group to dps. Bunch of shitty people on right now.
---
the addon for this is called letmecast
---
Does vertical space work the same way as horizontal space though? Sure seems like it doesn’t sometimes

I’ve been reading all of the quests and lore and whatnot because it’s my first time playing but I feel like I spend most of my time running between points. I just recently downloaded the Questie add on.

How is no one mentioning

&gt; "Y O u RE AN E vil KO RE AN"

They are used in world pvp to just blow people up.
---
&gt; How does laying work and how can I use it to farm things ? 
---
Basically there are multiple versions of any given area, each have their own set of NPC's/Chests/Quest items/etc, these are 'layers'. Players on one layer cannot see players on another layer, and cannot interact with the NPC's/Chests/Quest items on another layer. It's very similar to the idea of instances. 
---
The way that layer abuse works is that you clear out all the mobs on your layer, ask someone for an invite, then you get invited to *their* layer which is full of mobs.
---
You kill these monsters, then hop to a new layer, skipping the respawn process and immediately gaining the benefits.
---
It's the leveling experience man.
---
Wow dude your graphics are turned up way too high, be careful with that shit. Hope you got a 5k monitor to handle that GPU
---
Back in the day as in cata? when earthquake was added ?
---
Highest personal damage is not the same as highest damage.
---
Shit I *wish* that model was in the game but naw classic WoW only has the lore-inaccurate night-elf-robes-and-plate and Modern WoW Sylvanas was turned into that one writer's femdom fetish fuel in combination with his OC self-insert Nathanos.
---
I'm level 19 on my warrior and yeah, sometimes I die but it's usually because I'm not being smart. The one exception is in zones where most of the mobs are in dense little groups and you can't pull one without pulling 45. I mean every other character I've leveled in WOW has been easier (only one I haven't leveled on retail other than warrior is priest), but as long as I keep myself kitted in AH greens that are close to my level (and keep my weapon from falling off) I seem to be doing OK.
---
basically anytime he sees "animals' in WoW he demands to see in my lap and watch them, which, In the Barrens, is non stop

Hunter has a retarded amount of bugs currently
---
Just a fun fact, one of the first guilds that downed rag in classic used an MT feral tank. A lot of guides have now been written that there is a place for committed ferals in raids. One thing to remember that I think will become more apparent as time goes on, is that the fights are old and the knowledge base has grown, meaning the min-maxers are doing it to get through the content quicker and smoother, not min-maxing because content cant be cleared without it.
---

If it was me I could see myself writing a letter in game over and over always making it less needy and desparate sounding until eventually I just think no one really cared and would just send the gold and ghost like this guy. I'm not suicidal, but there's a long sad gap at the bottom that can lead to thoughts like that no matter the actual circumstances.

I had to stop playing games on a computer several years into my marriage as I would get heavily addicted to MMOs. I havent played a game on PC since 2013 I think. A lot of my friends pressure me but they dont have a family and dont understand the pit fall. I still game on PS4 but am able to put the controller down very easily now.
---
&gt; When do I start making some real cash with leather-working/ skinning and with what? Is there anything I can do now that will make some nice cash?
---
Devilsaur leather, and Devilsaur set pieces. 
---
They're BiS so everyone wants them, unfortunately people are farming them pretty heavy atm.
---
&gt;Are there other methods like this I should be aware of but just aren't due to my limited experience with this MMO?
---
Pickpocketing, advertising lockpicking in major towns for tips and just in general being able to sneak past mobs to hit a chest are some of the perks of being a rogue.
---
&gt;Is that correct? Am I missing something completely or this that an all round good idea?
---
It's fine, I find that rogues are more dependent on weapons rather than spec.
---
If you have some really good swords, go sword spec.
---
If you have some really good daggers, go dagger spec.
---
If you have some really good maces, go mace spec.
---
You really just want to argue I guess.  My last post was a "retract from pointless banter" reply.  
---
I don't like EVE so I could care less what their death penalties are.  I am an avid Minecraft player and I will add that the only downside in Minecraft to dying is that you lose your xp which is irrelevant as a player knowledgeable in building XP farms.
---
We obviously are going to endless but heads for no reason than to argue about a video game so how about we let this die.
---
It's hard going in fresh but once you start rolling BOE drops to sell on the AH you can keep yourself fed with good AH greens and vendor armor. It's all about keeping your gear close to your level, especially your weapon (or weapons). That's basically true of every class though, every time I struggled leveling an alt the solution was always just to purchase better gear (or craft it). I do gathering professions as I go too, so that i always have access to ore and leather and can take it to a blacksmith for cheap upgrades (just have to tip for the craft instead of pay for mats).

Debating between Druid rogue priest

My main enjoyment is world pvp. The ease of getting into dungeon and raids as Druid n priest is appealing. I have a lot of xp over the years as all 3 but more so Druid n rogue but doesn’t rule out priest for me yet. I love 1v1s as well. Would love some feed back

I lose the bis ring from princess twice on my 53 hunter so I said fuck it and went in and soloed her took me 20 minutes of kiting and my first kill I got my ring felt so good

Ah fuck. The no friends angle.  I'm toast!!
---
Their warrior guide isn't awful... I think.
---
Unfortunately this is the same as Vanilla so it will remain the same.  
---
Maybe it will sort itself out in time.  I feel like when paid transfers become a thing people will migrate to different servers and it will sort out.  Maybe?
---
Yeah it feels like every patch is an expansion now in terms of gear.
---
Not only that, but also a third party vendor is making money off of blizzard games which is usually a huge no no
---
It'll be greyed out if you're in any stance other than battle stance because you can only use it in that stance.
---
Oh yikes, yeah farming in general is gonna be a pain, if you're on a PVP server you can do Dust Devil farming in Westfall, these mobs drop an on use item that CCs a target for 30 Seconds, people love them for PVP, go for normally 30s low and 60s high depending on how many people are farming them
---

Shadow priest one I've seen is trash, so not surprised.
---
Cooking food buffs, scrolls, and potions are really helpful when you're up against the harder mobs. Also, people underuse demoralizing shout (the one that lowers enemy attack power). Hardest thing about my warrior so far is spellcasters when there isn't something to LOS them handy, but you can still drag them out a bit if you're careful. Looking forward to intercept to help with that.

Thing is, locked chest should only go to those who can open it, ie rougues and blacksmithers. Now if those who unlcok it want to give everybody a chance at opening it, than so be it.

Clutch comment druid bro
---
to be fair there were dozens of people spamming trade saying "pst for invite to ally raid layer"
---
At early levels this is the way.
---
Small guild, of just me and a handful of friends I know personally. We have enough to do dungeons, but would need to PUG for raiding if I was to actually raid with them.
---
Im not telling you, thats would cut into my gold making.
---
Retail character models suck ass. So does the animations
---
Actually I just think you're a loser with no empathy and there's enough of those to hang out with that you could probably find someone to be "friends" with.
---
Is layering allowed for mobs and stuff in the open world ? Cause I know they were banning for dungeon layering
---
Well hello neighbor :3
---
&gt;Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
Reading is hard
---
&gt; Multiboxing is essentially a pay-to-win situation
---
you've clearly never attempted to multibox in any way shape or form in any game ever if you think it's pay to win
---
Not entirely, I remember this being an assumption back in vanilla as well, as I remember dealing with this specifically
---
Currently in 1.13, it seems as though you can just talk to a faction member and it will appear in your faction tab. In vanilla, unlike 1.13 is now, in order to have a faction appear on your faction list, you actually had to gain or lose some amount of rep with them. 
---
So back in vanilla, I wanted to have all the factions appear in my tab, I went out to get some Ravenholdt rep but nothing happened with killing Syndicate members. I then had to go to war with Ravenholdt and dip down 25 rep into Unfriendly in order for it to appear (it did). Then, going accordingly by what i had read online, I killed some Syndicate members and nothing happened.
---
In that situation, I think, the reset time is counted
---
I only read the line about you being a multiboxer, just being a cheeky cunt. :x
---
Deep ret or no balls! Jokes aside, main spec whatever you want and stick with it. Find a guild that won't force you into healing and have a blast dude.

Any cat or wolf will be good

Rexxar just minds his own business. He's red, but he doesn't attack alliance unless you attack him first.

Welcome to the world of math.
---
Had the opposite happen to me, ran to engage horde griefing lakeshire, town was dead quiet and my layering was on cd, by the time i could layer the fun was already over.
---
I've noticed some funny stuff on my (only) level 29 druid. Not sure if its bugged but i feel like when my weapon skill falls behind I get insane strings of sometimes close to 10 misses in a row. So Ive been trying to keep pace with it just in case it is bugged.
---
Apparently some people also don’t deserve screenshots

Because their racials are OP, the leveling experience is better, the FPs are better, and the Horde has far more people so it attracts all the people that want it easy? ;)

Ban input broadcasting so they can't instant cast destroy people and it would probably be fine. Try controlling more than 2 characters well...it's hard.

Arw you on Bloodsail Buccanneers? I grouped with a Ciri today there

This would technically be account sharing, which is bannable.
---
This is very true if you can tank at all, if you hit a grind wall just grind out a few levels in dungeons. You'll get rich, find some good gear  upgrades, and blow through it until you can hit a fresh zone and do some new quests.

Win at Wow, lose at life.  Some people have to quit cold turkey to sort out their priorities.

MFW people start getting banned- so they'll cry on Reddit for sympathy claiming they were just sitting there...
---
People dying if you're a healer isnt based on spec;) maybe you used your mana inefficient. Or maybe the tank pulled too much (or be real the dps did). Or maybe you're over healing? Make use of the 5 second rule; even in combat. You'll regen your mana during a boss fight. You shouldnt be healing constantly.

If you haven't seen a reference before this you have forgotten the face of your father, and that is the truth.

I had about half the Green Hills pages just from questing when I decided to go ahead and finish the quest. Most of the pages were on the neutral AH for 5s; people were just dumping them off at Booty Bay. I spent maybe half a gold buying them and it was totally worth it.

Yup.  Can't even touch WoW or any other MMO's.  They are just straight crack cocaine for me.  I have plenty of (non drug) addictions, and WoW is *definitely* not one I can afford to add to the stable.

I googled it and tried to download the "Geforce Experience", which seemed to be what I needed. But now it's saying I don't meet the requirements?
---
I have Geforce GTX 560 Ti and it says it needs to be 600 series or higher.
---
So does that mean I can't use it?
---
&gt;Apparently its OK to break rule #3... if you need to complain about someone

naming ninja looters so people can avoid them doesn't sound like a witch hunt or a brigade attempt.

You just need to check other zones. There's no way you ran out of quests

You mean the raid boss can resist my FD?

I have a 52 frost mage, I haven’t partaken in these spell cleave groups, but I wanted to run brd and the only grps lfm was a aoe farm grp, so I figured hell why not I’m experienced with aoe and know how it works, grant you I am not specced improved blizzard because 90% of what I do is single target, I get into brd and all these pro mages preceded to call me an idiot for not putting points into imp blizzard and kicked me.. I’m like dudes I know pull big and blizzard mobs down, I leveled a mage on lightshope using strictly imp blizz and exp farming my way all the way to 60.. lol stop being eilitist jerks.
---
Thanks for the info :)

As much as I like being able to see everything around me, one thing that makes Azeroth feel really, really tiny is flying around it in retail. It absolutely feels more massive in classic with fog and no flying. Like you said, Azeroth was originally built around its limitations. Azeroth is sort of a shit show now in BFA, especially once you fly around it. It just doesn't look good or feel as big as it used to.
---
It’s ok it’s literally not an option on a Mac. Can’t be done. /s

I play hunter and have zero issued with FD

Two guys in our guild decided mid-raid to reroll because enhancement shaman DPS in their own words 'is terrible'.

There's two kinds of people in this world, those who learn by watching others burn their hand on the stove and those who run up to the stove and check to see if the same thing happens to them.
---
&gt; He was referencing UBRS as cancer, and not the grind.
---
Let's not split hairs here, he specifically referred to "a prolonged period of time".  He's clearly saying that the grind is bad.
---
And yes, that's how I do the reed farm, 5-6 man groups where I'm only rolling against one healer.  Takes about 40 minutes a clear.  But aside from that, your math is pretty debatable.  I'd say you have a MINIMUM of one player to roll against since many tanks are rolling on the MH.  But just for the sake of argument let's say you have one player to roll against.  That's a 7.5% chance per run for the offhand, and a 2% chance (pretty sure the drop rate is just under 4%, not 5%) for the MH.  So 13-14 runs expected to win your OH, and 50 runs for your MH.  So let's say 63 runs of jed/rend, at 40 minutes each.  That over FORTY HOURS of grinding UBRS.  For 2 items.  If we say that it's more like 1.5 opposing rolls on average, which I'm almost sure is closer to reality than assuming 1 roll, then it's up over 50 hours.
---
And we haven't even talked about the time it takes to form a group and travel to the instance.  Let's say you create all your own groups, so that you can make sure you're only facing one roll.  How long would you say it takes from your first "LFM" to your first pull of the dungeon?  It can be an insanely long time.  You need to find your 4-5 other players, find a key, have everyone travel there, have everyone disband and fish for jed, find him, re-form, and then prepare for the first pull.  That's EASILY half an hour on average, in my experience.  And I've almost never seen a group last for more than 2 runs, and the majority of groups either disband entirely or lose multiple members after a single run.  So let's say you have to basically form an entire new group every 1.5 runs or so on average.  That's another 20+ hours onto your time that you didn't even consider.  Now you're looking at a 60++ hour grind in near-optimal conditions (self-made small groups of minimal competition).

That's actually pretty hilarious, and a respectful score.

But if it really was overpowered, there would have been Duelist or even Gladiator multi-boxers out there.
---
&gt;It’s not cheating, and it has always been a part of the game.
---
If by always part of the game you mean it has always been a bannable offense. Then yes.
---
Yep. I'm leveling sword and board because I die less. I also use some skills people look down on because I guess it isn't the meta, but again I die way less (the shout that lowers attack power is really helpful). I just kind of slow roll through a zone eating everything. It's like pac man but with more "I need more rage!" and less wakka wakka sounds.
---
Screech and claw cannot effectively be used together; they are both focus dumps with rapid cool downs.
---
I usually keep screech enabled when doing quests and claw enabled when in groups or doing content where I'm purely focused on single target.
---
So you are telling me that there are no selfish players on other servers? Really?
---
So THAT'S how the skeletons get there.

Good main tanks too. Highest TPS through phase 6.

I'm in Asia playing in eur servers with ~300ms. PvE wise is not a huge problem at all. Pvp is more tricky in the other hand
---
It's crazy the bonds you get with people. I can think of 3 guilds I've been in where the people were literally like my best friends despite never meeting face to face. My first guild 12 years ago had 4 people that really helped my learn the game and I can still remember their character names and wish like hell I could find them again either in game or the real world.

You can’t block while casting

&gt;Angry, sure. Offended? Could go either way.
---
You just defined offended lol
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/offended
---
&gt;to cause resentful displeasure; irritate, annoy, or **anger**:
---
The reason they do this is because the zone you're in and that level bracket. 20-40 is tough because that level advantage they have on you. This slowly dies down after level 40, and by level 50 just about every PVP encounter will be a fair fight. Stick it out, once you get past that level bracket things get so much better and a hell of a lot more fun.
---
I’m at 52. One step closer!
---
Honestly I’m not sure if it would work or not. The least you could do is try to download it and see what happens. I’m unsure of any other programs that rewind and record previous game play.

You could try OBS Studio but I believe that would have to be recording while you play. And trim the clips / render them in Sony Vegas

Yes money is exactly why blizzard banned tens of thousands of botting accounts but won't ban a couple hundred multiboxing accounts

Guild rule #1: cell phone pics only
---
It has nothing to do with min maxing. Raiding and pvp is the endgame. Im not saying that's the end all be all, but it absolutely should be what classes are designed around doing.. as far as damage/rotation/abilities etc.
---
You say grinding, farming, etc are the 'so much more to the game'.. but why do you do those things? Why grind? to make money? to level up? Why do you do those things? They can be fun, sure, but if that was the entire game.. nobody would play. You grind to make money so you can afford things to make your character better. You farm so you can make your character better. Why? just to have a strong character and that's it? This isn't diablo 3, having a strong character isn't enough. You make your character stronger so you can pvp and raid. 
---
Obviously there are people who play this game that do neither of those things. People who just level characters over and over again, people who RP, etc. But those kinds of players and those types of things aren't what classes should be designed around. 
---
Again, it has nothing to do with min maxing. It has everything to do with wanting classes and specs to be functional in an end game scenario. In vanilla, most of aren't.

I'm someone who struggles with mental illness. Recently I hit a very low point after over a year of steady decline and was having serious suicidal thoughts. About 3 weeks ago I made a plan and did research.
---
I had started to reach out to my medical team &amp; partner but still felt hopeless. My partner was going to be away for the weekend and it seemed like the "right time."
---
He sat with me and sincerely asked me to promise him I would call before I took any steps to hurt myself. He left me the local hotline. He expressed what I meant to him and the value I had as a person and my successes and happiness in life.
---
When I made him that promise it changed everything. I could no longer silently go off and do the deed knowing I had lied to him.
---
That may sound silly, but sometimes even small things are enough to give someone a little more drive to hold on.
---
OP, I hope your friend is ok. Thank you for trying to reach out.
---
Thank you. My last question would be does any invite get you into a new layer? From any player anywhere ?
---
Dammit we done Gnomeregan couple weeks ago and now look at you.

Gz, long live ZT

As mage, check out a fire/frost hybrid spec. Haven't tried it myself but it looks absolutely amazing for pvp. They say it is very gear dependent though.

The BiS guides (at least some of them) are like shockingly bad and half-assed.  At first I just assumed I was looking at something credible, but slowly started to realize like.. where is this or that, why is this only on this phase but not earlier, etc.  And then it started getting updated and changing shit around seemingly at random, and you'd even have slots where it's just text.  Like oh let's see the bis helm is .. "Of Shadow Wrath".  Uhhh.... ok?  WHAT of shadow wrath?  How much +damage even?  Wtf?

Get 30 and feign death and u can let ur pet go ham no matter what

Yup, people that place profit over game integrity do. Sadly.
---
You honestly think fury spec'd 2h warrior is a perfectly legitimate tank in a pick up group? We didn't even have a priest or heal geared shaman.
---
And all DPS does not mean we went in with a mage farm group. We went in with just a slaped together mismash of of dps spec'd folks. It was Complete shit show with the aggro.
---
I have done it with 3 shamans that don't want to white hit... OR FUCKING DRINK BETWEEN PULLS! they were three crazy Russians that lived in NY and just got fucking plowed drunk and double cast all the totems forever and healed me and each other endlessly. It was a grind and I loved it.
---
It is a team game if you choose to play it that way, you also can play it solo, or play with only friends, or play just to be a burden on your party. You think it's all team support and doing your best at all times, it is not for most people.

&gt;You’re choosing to believe this story wholesale
---
I *just* said that only OP knows the full context. I can't know what's going on.
---
&gt;OP is asking other people to help them track down this person
---
Cite where this is the case. In both the post and comment he merely states that he's trying to reach out to his friend through reddit, not other people to assist in finding him. 
---
&gt;Nothing wrong with a healthy amount of skepticism
---
That isn't simple skepticism though, you're trying to claim what's "realistic" and what isn't without any basis.
---
&gt;especially in my experience seeing posts like used by stalkers to reconnect with victims.
---
With respect, your personal anecdotes are not a legitimate argument.
---
&gt;Endorsing it and criticizing other people who bring up other possibilities in a negative way is not helpful.
---
Endorsing what, specifically? You aren't being criticised for bringing up other variables, you're being criticised for asserting that your proposed possibilities are more "realistic" and making false claims about people's intentions here.
---
Don't get me wrong, I recognise you aren't attempting to be insulting or anything like that, but I do think you're being overly critical given the context. Ultimately the people who think OP are being genuine have as much legitimacy as those who say he isn't, but it's really a non-statement to bring up legitimacy lest you're implying that every personal conversation online should consist of "well I cannot confirm what you're telling me so I won't discuss it with you". You don't have to believe OP to answer him, most of what you see on Reddit is impossible to verify so it's pointless to say such.
---
They're talking about the OP.  shadowkinz responded to the OP.  Holy shit.

wow, im amazed that you know what server op plays on.
---
You seem to be in the wrong place
---
I have had the same feelings, and honestly I'm getting used to it now. I had to train myself not to get so invested and so mad when I died. When you're about to be ganked by multiple level ??s it's time to just accept your death and wait for them to move on. If you don't react, and you just go about your business, they'll just switch to a juicier target.
---
I used to get most frustrated on my resto Druid, because when ambushed by 3-4 other players, I felt like I should be able to get away, with heals on myself and changing forms to break through slows/morphs/freezes etc. It would make me so mad when they would still be able to hold me in place and kill me. But now when it happens I can just relax and accept the death if I die. it's not my fault, there are 4 players attacking me - it's OK if I couldn't get out of it.
---
You get stronger minded and learn that while other players can unfairly kill you, you can still tactically control your reaction to it, and get back to what you were doing as fast as possible.
---
If you can do that, then when you finally do get into the fair fights, they are exhilarating.

He was on Aegwynn on retail. At first it was really cool because it was a new thing at the time, but it turns out he was a douche Horde nationalist.

"I'm out of mana"

Same here. People think I’m weird to bind things on shift 2 oder ctrl 9, but it works perfectly thanks to the 12 buttons.
---
Deviate Delight. Actual real world is balanced really well
---
I mean, come on, I know the circlejerk is what it is, but classic Mage still has to deal with the majority of classic's... classicyness. Yes, they are the favored ones, but the gap between, say, Classic Warlock / Hunter and Mage is wayyyyyyyyyy less than the gap between classic Mage and retail anything. 
---
The game still provides difficulty for mages, especially those who aren't skilled or aren't running the cookie cutter strategies.
---
But now for ur 🦀$11_🦀 u get buffed knights
---
2h is only better when you dont have hit gear (which is available in this phase). Assuming prebis gear dw is hands down better than 2h and it's not even remotely close

Wouldn’t it be simpler to bind those buttons to the numpad instead of the regular number keys?
---
As is tradition
---
Yeah [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect&amp;build=1.13.2.31882#search=17625&amp;page=1) you go, that website has never been wrong about anything because it takes directly from the WoW client, you can punch in any spell ID and it will tell you pretty much everything except for proc rate and threat generation.
---
I add friend and then I add a note to them so that I can check if they are good/bad and why 
---
you'll probably forget if you don't. It's better as, if you aren't leader, ytou may not know that they are in the group if you just ignore them.
---
How do you think tokens are generated? Someone still buys them, so blizzard still makes money.
---
that guy is a dbag. IDK I mean I'm just doing it for skill ups. and I'm going to skill it up either way. So I figure I may as well give it to someone who it will actually increase their power as opposed to a random pair of braces 30 times.

You will suffer a few ticks now and then. You need to be in sync with the ticks to avoid them. It's a guessing game.

Shadowplay is just the recording feature within GeForce experience. It does many things for Nvidia users.
---
I am about to get on my pc for the night and will check and see how recording works on it cause I haven’t used it in a while. I mainly use OBS now because of streaming. 
---
The in game overlay is the menu that has the recording / livestream options so it may just be an issue with your hardware being a little dated.  Sorry for not being of much help. I did not know GeForce experience had hardware limitations for the nvidia cards

I’m “friends” with Google Image Search too! Small world!

---
What an incredibly poor and selfish mindset.
---
Yeah I did this too in ZF, had 2 mages in the group, had just killed the boss in the scarab room so I thought "fuck it" ran through the whole room spamming r1 AE to pull them all. Partially worked - I got the pack gathered and got the iceblock off, but the second mage was sitting with his dick in his hand so instead of starting the blizzard pull on a beautiful stack of scarabs he just jerked off while ice block expired then just AEing like a monkey
---
I want X item, all other items suck compared to X item. If i drop group i can farm x item Y times in the time it takes to finish the run.

Jesus this is kind of scary because my buddy with huge mental illnesses (depression and kind of a schizo)  randomly gave me all of his comics for free. I was a bit confused because he was acting weird, refusing to hang out.  Then like two weeks later he randomly comes to my house to ask for it back lol. Weird guy I swear
---
I believe I have a Nvidia integrated graphics card. What part are you referring to that would be $20 to replace?
---
The most bullshit comment I'd read in my life.
---
Using multiboxing to fuck the economy up is not a "flagship feature of the game".
---
If multiboxes are actually this deluded then that's ridiculous. 
---
It's not an "ability to play" a certain way, it's straight up cheating that Blizzard doesn't care about because it makes them money. There is no situation where you should be counting the individual time played on each account, he does not play that amount of time, does he?
---
You are literally paying 5 times the sub fee to increase your individual power in the game waaay over other players, at this point you shouldn't be talking about "features of the game", you are not playing anything as intended.
---
It's because it was based off people playing on private servers that had never actually played vanilla.  15 years ago I would just shake my head whenever I saw another lock with a VW out while I ran by and drain tanked 3 move at once with my imp.
---
I've been playing 1-2 hrs a day and I'm only in my 30s, and I've still having fun. WoW is time consuming if you want to do anything, yes, but you don't have to raid, you don't have to level quickly, etc. You can just sorta plod along with your 1 hr a day and you'll eventually get to 60, and with 2 hrs a day you can get your blues or PVP and get pvp blues, and be a pretty effective all around char.
---
Are you the mage, or him?
---
Well they are the one serving you since your lazy ass won’t go get it lol jk
---
No I think it's Nvidia integrated graphics card
---
if it looks like you're going to pull at least one just veer a bit towards that one so you don't get both
---
transfer server to windseeker! sorry for the blatant advertisement. I think the best solution is just get to 60 and return the favor.

I had a quick question regarding multiple action bars. Not the ones that are permanently fixed on the screen, I mean pressing shift+up or down to cycle through the action bars.

My warlock has 6 of these action bars, but my shaman only has two. I went to interface options&gt;action bars and didn't see a way to change this. Is there something I'm missing here?

Thanks in advance!

Proper use of Blink is a criminally underrated skill for us Mages.

It’s common that this happens. It’s likely he was talked out of it or he couldn’t go through with it and now he’s ashamed of it. It’s not easy struggling, poor guy.
---
&gt;thinking they would hit 60 and have no idea how to play their class
---
frostbolt/shadowbolt is a hard thing to learn
---
yup
---
Wild guess. The 60/40 goes both ways its hard to tell. I guess thats a testament to how well balanced the server is. Realm pop is always high at peak hours, consistent with most other NA realms.
---
I played blackrick and it was VC
---
So where to begin?
---
1. It's called a Hawaiian pizza and it's Fucking delicious... Especially if you substitute in the white sauce. 
---
2. You're cell phone pic discredits anything you have to say afterwards. 
---
3. You're playing PC games on a mac. -_-
---
4. Your hearthstone isnt on your right side action bar but actually in a key spot for potions, skills etc. 
---
5. Stock UI with no mods
---
So basically this is a post of you doing someone a favor by removing them now to save countless headaches from wiping later on... Congratulations

Another item I’ve had good luck with is Mithril Casings, ore goes for about 9-10s on my server, costs 3 ore to make, and I once sold some for up to 2g.

The money from the tokens is still going into blizzard's pockets. Even if the multiboxer isn't paying, someone is.

Hopefully he can't read. Barrens will ruin him for life.

Saying it’s a fact is endorsing the post.

This is willful ignorance. He’s just posting this story on Reddit to get his story out. Not soliciting help at all. I’m sure that’s all that it is. I’m sure this won’t inspire anyone to go out looking for them. Because that’s never happened before, right?
---
&gt;	That isn’t simple skepticism though, you’re trying to claim what’s “realistic” and what isn’t without any basis.
---
I never claimed to be an arbiter of realism. I’m stating the fact that more possibilities exist, some worse than others, that might be the case and should be handled with the same amount of attention as the post.

&gt;	With respect, your personal anecdotes are not a legitimate argument.
---
Evidence is not evidence? 
---
&gt;	Endorsing what, specifically? You aren’t being criticised for bringing up other variables, you’re being criticised for asserting that your proposed possibilities are more “realistic” and making false claims about people’s intentions here.
---
Endorsing the post’s surface assertion. You seem hyper focused on the word realism, which seems to blind you to the broader point. Much less the claims are not false, they are possibilities. Sorry I don’t believe everyone is honest actor on the internet.
---
&gt;	Don’t get me wrong, I recognise you aren’t attempting to be insulting or anything like that, but I do think you’re being overly critical given the context. Ultimately the people who think OP are being genuine have as much legitimacy as those who say he isn’t, but it’s really a non-statement to bring up legitimacy lest you’re implying that every personal conversation online should consist of “well I cannot confirm what you’re telling me so I won’t discuss it with you”. You don’t have to believe OP to answer him, most of what you see on Reddit is impossible to verify so it’s pointless to say such.
---
Obviously people will think what they want, I just wanted to make the case that other possibilities exist and they should be considered before such posts create a bandwagon and possibly do harm. I appreciate the even handed approach and not complete write off. Like I said, this type of thing has happened before and it hits close to home. As I’m sure it does for anyone who got brigaded by online witch hunts for someone who didn’t want to be found.
---
They did, it only fixed a small part of the issue. They've also identified another issue but haven't announced a patch for that. And even after that there will likely still be some issues.
---
Yep. Thanks for reminding me, totally forgot to look it up after I got home.

---
so once again proving my comment right of this sub doesnt think a tank can do anything wrong ever. Im telling you its a common occurence to have skull not have a single sunder after 10 seconds while every other mob has sunder. So why would the tank tell me to focus what he isnt trying to get aggro on? Because not all tanks are good, sometimes tanks suck, it isnt ALWAYS the dps at fault. And if your answer is then dont focus skull focus something else, then thats the tank at fault for telling the dps to do things wrong.
---
Thx I forgot there’s only one way to play and enjoy wow
---
Lol the same thing happened to me
---
If that player is in a different layer than you, which is impossible to predict because the number of active layers at any one time is dynamic based on server population.
---
Imagine not seeing the 'Humor' tag or recognizing self-deprecating humor and leaving the post you left.
---
I have close friends on battle net and steam, I don't have their numbers. We talk on discord so we never had the need to exchange numbers. Plus they are all from different countries
---
You should be fine! Just keep in mind that you will have to play on the lower end of graphics settings and also extended play sessions (over a few hours) might be a bit of a stress for your hardware.
---
You could try using Fraps to record your gameplay
---
It's not cheating because Blizzard says it is not.  Your complaining doesn't change that simple fact.
---
This is awesome, take my upvote!
---
Resources in the game don’t just get multiplied when you are in a party. Looted gold is shared. Items drop at the same rate regardless of if you are solo or not gathering nodes maintain a fixed amount of a given resource. Multiboxing 5 accounts doesn’t magically just multiply your gold income by 5.
---
I guarantee if you divide the total income (so far) of this player by the number of hours he has played (NOT counting each account individually—this was just an aside I made previously, one that clearly distracted you), that the gold per hour is not going to be significantly higher than any solo player playing with similar efficiency. After you factor in the multiplicative cost of training, mounts, etc., I’d imagine that this rate is quite similar. 
---
There is nothing that multiboxing provides that a guild group cannot. Your “power level,” as you put it, is noticeably *weaker* than that of a group of individual players. There is literally no reason to have your panties in a wad. 
---
As for a “flagship feature of the game,” note that I said *”playing the economy is a flagship feature of the game”*, not the strawman you responded with.
---
No one likes multi-boxers except multi-boxers themselves
---
Yeah I couldn't imagine what it would be like having a major Alliance hub that close to both Ogrimmar and Thunder Bluff. Would be pretty wild for world PvP though
---
Just wanted to come back and point out that Cdew just made it with the help of other top guilds on the server.  I think they sold 5 ingots for 250g.
---
Top guilds help top guilds.
---
I hate pvp personally but it does seem weird to have half the playerbase on a server unable to communicate with you and serving basically no purpose on pve servers. Why even have factions really? Yeah its nice to quest in peace but it doesn't really make sense that we can't talk to or work together with the other faction.
---
multiboxers existed in classic
---
whitemane????
---
streamer????
---
you do realise that it's a new community so this isn't cancer, more to the point, if streamers attract the ahats to a few servers, then they are doing a favour for the rest of us.
---
Imagine not seeing the 'Humor' flair or recognizing the self-deprecating comments and leaving this post.
---
I mean if the CEO of WoW is asking you to join his guild you should. My uncle works at blizzard and says that guy is great.
---
GUILTY
---
What does your guild have to offer?
---
Or I think a "my buddy gave all his gold to me and logged off for good on classic wow that has been out for only a month. This is seriously not like him" kind of post is corny, attention seeking, and should/could have been delt with privately.
---
Oooh, it tickles!
---
Time to use two monitors and mirror your screen. Lol
---
Pagle ^^
---
You’re a good friend.
---
That's a crisp UI, what's the addon that shows extended stats you got?
---
Thunderfury has a bit more on horde but was the closest to 50/50 when the census came out. I've been playing horde and it's pretty popular and no Que to play so that's nice.
---
Arugal: 37 Shaman, 44g.
---
Did some Shellfish Trap farming in Desolace to get around 17g in 90 minutes. Didn't get a rod but someone was nice enough to sell it to me for 1g.
---
Atiesh was 53/47 Alliance right before the census addons got merked
---
Yeah, apart from the time taken, it seems quite a reasonable ticket.
---
idk how they were able to put in a ticket whilst being banned tho - a diff. account? 
---
i've had to wait up to 36 hours or so for a ticket response.
---
Might be a good way to actually get into a fucking group as a rogue.
---
I am pretty sure that's because anybody with a pulse and attunement will do to fill spots.
---
Grinding in wow is a whole other ball park compared to osrs, so much more afk things to do in osrs
---
I'm not talking about OP. I'm talking about you who seems so interested in talking out of his ass
---
I don't.
---
As I recall, in later versions, they stated days. I know it was over two years. I was kind of disgusted with myself. This was 3+ years ago.
---
"Meatcloud" sounds like the father of that character on Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
---
I feel called out
---
Yeah same problem here.  Help! Lol
---
mate its as simple as keybinding strafe right and left to A and D and just removing keyboard turning from the game
---
I 'respecced to Mage' once on my Rogue in vanilla.  And by that I mean I used my Helm of Fire in a duel with a guild mate and he was really confused how I shot a fireball at him to finish him off.
---
Careful. White knights inc
---
I can guess well enough
---
It's more then just completing a quest objective list.  It's about taking in the sights and socializing.  If you run with some folks and you enjoyed running with them ask if they're down with doing more a following day and add them to friends.  The adventure isn't simply point A to B but about the journey with your companions to get there.
---
Note:  I'm a DM of a weekly D&amp;D group so I create all sorts of content like that so mabye it males it easier for me to associate to.
---
Druids are really fun to play, but they are terrible at everything in Classic.
---
World PvP is the only time druids get to shine, and it's because it allows a druid to really use their entire toolkit.
---
Druid is the worst class in PvE and for good reason. If you try to stand in the back and heal like a priest or paladin, you will be the worst class at it. If you try to stand in front and take hits, you will also be the worst at it. Try to stand behind the boss and hit, and you will be terrible at it. 
---
Druid is designed to constantly be moving around and changing your role on the fly to meet the needs of the situation. That just doesn't happen in PvE. It's not needed. The only time you'll get to do that is in clutch moments where things fall apart. You'll still be brought to raids and events, but not because you are good.
---
 You will be brought as a "Break druid in case shit happens". No one will thank you for what you do, but you can really save raids and groups with some of your cooldowns and role swapping.
---
Also you will be useless in PvP after Naxx/AQ, but don't worry about that since that's a year away.
---
Laugh in warlock (seduction +fear+death coil). Ikill every single rogue on sight in STV cause I know you guys aren’t questing over there.
---
Don't call crisis line they will lock you up against your will
---
They're decent for wpvp and solo.
---
That said, since I played a shadow priest in vanilla they're just raptor food for me in classic. Nobody knows how to play them anymore
---
far far fewer then on streamer servers full of racist manchildren and teenage edglords
---
YMMV per server
---
You literally cannot play as efficiently using the keyboard to turn, especially as a rogue who consistently needs to be behind a target. You're literally making up excuses for people to be bad at the game
---
Luckily it was the only super rough pug I was in and I was level 45 by that time.  All other groups up to that point seemed fine lol.
---
You say blizzard but blizzard has explicitly stated multiboxing is allowed. How the fuck do you even make coherent words with how retarded you are?
---
No shit?  Why are you comparing 1 player with 5 accounts to one player with one?  Of course the 5man has an advantage.
---
I love Rogue and I hate Rogue.  Leveling one again is an exercise in patience. We're great with pocket healers or in a dungeon but solo questing is like pulling teeth.
---
Yep. My dad would be like "just melee and heal me!" And I'm like "but I want to use my spells!"
---
Good times leveling with family. Luckily my brother got to his 50s quick and helped me with gold for my mount, so they're good for something.
---
because its 1 player and 1 player are you slow or something
---
3 bars to 42 (Druid). Full time job, also in charge of 80% of household chores. My firstborn is coming by the end of the month, so I really wanna hit 60 before he comes lol.
---
Although, I wonder how old til he can grind for me? :D
---
multi boxing is botting. How do you think those commands are getting to the other X versions of the game being played?
---
knew it was gonna happen as soon as you started typing
---
literally this, anyone else who says it's hard to get used to not keyboard turning is a fucking mongoloid
---
Man, I've got a real bone to pick with those B(i)S lists, lemme tell ya. Fat chance if I'm dropping my shield for a caster offhand (paladin) or running around in full cloth or +healing greens.
---
That being said, I'd never deny a group member such an easy boss like that. Gotta collect the full set (even if it's aesthetics). Plus there's the 0.5 coming up someday...
---
Got a hunter to lvl 15 on one server. Then my friends decided they wanted to move servers. Now I'm getting my second hunter up to level 14. I don't have a lot of time to play so I really wish I had all that time one one char
---
I feel this one.  I've been spending too much time on my computer with classic WoW and my dog has not been amused.  So I've had to put her on my lap for extended periods, but she is a bit too big, so I gotta play with one hand.  Really slows down the leveling.
---
I started in Wrath and can definitely say I enjoyed the content of each one.
---
streamers are cancer, they bring in cancer, multiboxers are cancer, whitemane is a cancer server full of racist twitch kiddies. You're right, I am glad that all these manchildren and misanthrope children are trying to suck asmongold's nuts on some shitty server they wait 6 hours to play on instead of bothering me. the fact they play the same game I do still bothers me though
---
No, each keypress does 1x(amount of accounts you have)
---
This hit a little too close to home. I literally took a week before my attempt a couple years back trying to delete myself from the internet. A couple people noticed characters weren’t on their friends list and I wasn’t logged into accounts anymore (Steam and Blizzard Launcher launched when I turned my computer on).  But no one reached out. You’re a good person
---
Whatcha watchin' on Netflix?
---
I work at a pizza place and I am silently judging everyones pizza toppings when I work oven. Pineapple on pizza is an automatic headshake from me, dog.
---
The best I've seen so far is "Come Honor Face"
---
because hes trash
---
&gt; now they're behind the bank where there are no guards
---
this isnt against the rules, if you are in an area where guards dont aggro you are fine.
---
if you are in an area where they do aggro but cant hit you/evade that isnt ok.
---
He literally didnt know how to deal with it. He didnt think blizzard would do anyhting since no active thread were made.
---
You're literally, the biggest douchebag on the planet. Go find a hobby.
---
Or will you just suffer another defeat, because we don’t come alone.
---
Join a local guild. We're hosting one at my place later this month. Wowc dungeons, world pvp, and SC1 tourney

Post a crappy cellphone pic of their order here, the sub really loves photos you can read but aren’t in a specific format
---
Ok that's pretty funny.
---
Good for you man. 
---
Classic wow may be nastolgic for some...
---
Many years from now, moments like this will be the true nastolgic for you.
---
Keep on keepin' on, puppy lover.
---
Warlock and ele shamans scale the hardest, warriors honorable mention
---
&gt; Not sure why it is so different this time.
---
Is it something you actually notice in-game though, or is it something you only notice because people on Reddit are constantly bitching about it?
---
Female Nelf is the end supreme bow animation.
---
Fairly confident it was a multiboxer, seeing as I had the debuffs stacked onto me all at once and I didn't even see any of them until right after I noticed the buffs stacked. And they were all running after me in a single line.
---
Still, funny.
---
According to twitch: "Stock market gold mining company analyst". 
---
That's a super volatile industry, it's what the folks on /r/wallstreetbets (4chan with a bloomberg terminal) love to invest in.

Well op found out. So hes going to delete the thread now....right?
---
Post a crappy cellphone pic of their order here, the sub really loves photos you can read but aren’t in a specific format, free karma

Just distract him off the boat.
---
May sound silly, but have you actually been clicking "save" after you finish editing them?
---
I'm a rogue and support the priests in this 100%
---
I typically don't bother with it unless it's an extremely dense area. The chance of pulling extra mobs in the open world vs in a dungeon with fear is suitably low that I'll just fear and forget one mob, let my VW tank one, then face tank a third.
---
10 hours and make 600g?  Really? &lt;doubt. jpg&gt;
---
Newbie here...
---
Why do people farm this particular dungeon for gold as opposed to any other dungeon you can solo as a 60?
---
im so jealous!
---
i have a war at 44, and a few very low lvl alts (around 5 - 15). another lv. 44 would be sweet.
---
i think i just play quite sub-optimally. although, what's your /played? my wars' at...4, maybe 5 days - i'll check when im home if you reply
---
I think they should open a tbc server and let you copy your character. As in keep it in classic and have a copy of the character in tbc.
---
Overtaking retail is a silly expectation.
---
It will be solid and stable for a good while. Loads of people played classic pservers for years and years ,loads of them will be playing classic now. Loads of people didn’t play pservers but wanted to play old wow, and we’re here too.
---
Retail will continue to be the juggernaut that it is. People bitch and moan but it’s still one of the biggest games around, and has massive surges of active players for each new content patch / expansion which is expected.
---
For my money, I used to plate retail on a continual sub, generally finding things to amuse myself (m+, arena, raiding, farming old crap / achievements). I’m gonna be one of those players that just returns for new content from here on in. Classic is more fun than retail, for me. I like the arduous journey. Leveling an alt is a big time commitment and I will relish it.
---
I’ll admit, after tanking Wailing Caverns with groups that were so bad I had to quit on them *twice in the same night*, multi boxing sounds like fun.  
---
   
---
Group 1: Hunter: runs ahead of tank aggroing 3-5 elites way ahead, swipes party.  
---
Group 2: Rogue: “target marking is gay just go fast dungeons r dumb and easy anyhow lol this game is all about PvP” 
---
It was so dispiriting I thought about quitting the game.  The giant influx of new classic players include a huge percentage of angry 15 year olds with weaponized ADD and no interest in learning how the game works. 
---
Th is is really the other half of the reason the 5-account guys do it. Because guilds involve politics and other people’s schedules, and pubbing anything is often utter hell because people are assholes or willfully stupid.
---
Wait horde racial healing debuff?
---
Not sure if this is just for melee but you could also try /stopattack
---
oh look another "i found rexxar" poast
---
have an updont my bro!!! epic!
---
Barrens
---
And my axe!
---
can you imagine a jmod doing such a thing
---
&gt; No, that is not. Botting is automation. There is zero automation that goes into multi-boxing legitimately.
---
They aren't playing all the characters so it is, in fact, botting. They are automating all but one character to copy that character.
---
A keyboard splitter, whatever that is, would also be botting. 1 click = 1 action. It's not hard to understand.
---
Hi, some tips I can give are,
---
1. Warriors are very food dependent when solo questing, I normally /who when I’m in a major town and ask mages for food and tip them.
---
2. Take mining and skinning, you can vendor the lower leathers and when you start getting thick/rugged leather you can AH them for a gold+, as for mining the AH is the way to go for all the ores and stones you get. Can use this gold for mount/ww axe quest items if your lazy/plate gear when you hit lvl40 if you want more armor.
---
3. Lots of higher levels in the game now, many will be happy to help with you lvl 30 ww axe quest.
---
4. Find a leveling guild where most members will be around your level. Scarlet monastery spams are a easy quick way to get from 34-41. Not to mention SM armory has good mail drops for warriors. Head/shoulders/legs and wep if you want an alternative to ww axe and the SM quest itself gives a nice neck with stam as a quest reward.
---
5. If you have enough HP to kill another mob without having to eat, don’t use execute. Keep the rage for next mob and watch him melt. 
---
6. At lower levels I wouldn’t spam heroic strike as much, spending rage on sunder armor is a better alternative since majority of your damage is from regular swings till you get mortal strike at 31 points and ww at 36. 
---
Once your gear is mostly plate 1v2 with sweeping strikes and whirlwind becomes a joke basically, mobs just melt, just remember to ask mages for food!
---
You are fishing up free action potions.
---
Advanced stats or something
---
cute doggo
---
Lol finally!
---
Yeah cause noobs know the boss and use that as an acronym rather than going 'hurr dead mines.. deeead mines. Must be DM'
---
That's simply not true. They do not notify local agencies until certain strict parameters that match mandatory reporting requirements are met.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#timespan=1000&amp;aggregate=amount
---
Kind of an overreaction, yeah. Hell, I've done that and I'm still alive, aren't I?
---
no, just wait till you are trying to do BRS or BRD and there are rogues waiting just inside to kill you as you pass by.
---
your first character will probably end up having at least 10 days /played when you ding 60. i think questie will help a bit but you will still be slower just because you are reading the quests/lore
---
I gotchu bro &lt;3
---
My hobby is playing in a nice classic wow guild until this morning when my sub ran out and I gave all my gold away.
---
I also found tyranda, Whitemane, stitches, jaina, anduin
---
The problem I forsee is that development for Classic is quite a bit more extensive and resource dependent than OSRS. Is blizzard going to be willing to dedicate an entire team to creating what is essentially a totally separate game from WoW for Classic+? I doubt it. More than likely they'll take the easy and lazy route of rereleasing the xpacs. But how many times can they do that? I'll bet that by the time they reach Cata they'll have expended their good will.
---
Almost all games ban multiboxing under botting rules.
---
Because it appears otherwise that arcane shot and aimed shot are on the same cooldown. So, correct me if I'm wrong, you can shoot an aimed shot, then, with improved arcane shot, you could shoot an arcane shot at 5s OR an aimed shot at 6s.
---
Ok people like you keep saying this as some kind of defense. There are like 2 servers that are ally dominated, and one of them is a carebear server. Ally queues are still going to be relatively instant.
---
That sucks, most everyone I know in RL that used to play rolled on a PVP realm so I did too, two weeks later they are asking if the free transfer will take them to a PVE server. They did not like the answer.
---
Proc rates was one of the things p servers 100% got wrong, not that it’s their fault it was just one of the least documented things from vanilla. There was lots of misinformation and shotty math going around
---
Vaults and Darkvire in BRD are another equivalent.
---
I'll bet you want to run Arena/Angerforge farm and are looking for a healer. Wonder why you can't find one.
---
Oh wow, I’d forgotten all about that. I remember tanks trying to drag him onto it. It was kind of fun back when the game was more of a mystery. I enjoyed the giant forum posts about how to get the ashbringer and all the other weird rumors of hidden quests
---
im 90% sure that DEing gets you to 60 and then it stops.
---
It sure seems like the second you said "go" he started running....?
---
Done!
---
i mean with that line of thought, the mere existence of people must bother you on a daily basis.
---
I have no idea what you just said
---
Around 5 days each.
---
I try that, but then I get dazed and dismounted and the other one pathes into the fight.  :|
---
60 rogue, ~200 gold and epic mount
---
Not sure how the community is in the big guilds but on Grobb we're balanced faction wise.
---
let me know as well!
---
Expect to off-tank &amp; focus on getting gear for tanking. Your DPS and healing are needed in certain situations but they're not the reason people will want you.
---
like what games
---
I'll fight you
---
it's a flawed one, but yeah :/
---
that's why you should probably not ignore them and just call them out in chat when you see them - far more effective
---
I found it easier to just get rez sickness then jump to a different zone. There are a lot of zones you can grind and quest in (though less quests in the 30-40 range compared to the other brackets). If a high level player makes it clear he wants to spawn camp me then I'll just go and hop on to a different zone. 
---
Yes its an inconvenience. However, the promise of being able to do the same once I reach a high enough level keeps me going. ;)
---
"I was reminding people of the rules" I actually don't think blizzard would agree.
---
thats the majority of posters here I've found, I suggest you dont go o nreddit for genuine advice
---
I can't count how many times I've been in that sort of position.  You did the right thing, mate.
---
true
---
I'm Nevernude on Blaumeux. I even made my character look like him.
---
&gt; I don't need or really even want my Moonkin to do equal damage to a mage or warlock, I like that he could heal or even off-tank in a pinch.
---
I mean you do. There is a reason moonkins would never be brought to raid if classic raids were tuned accurately.
---
&gt;Unfortunately hybrids are hard to balance, so it's easier to just make them more boring.
---
Hybrids aren't hard to balance, they are impossible to balance.
---
thanks :)
---
PRIESTS RISE UP!
---
Yes
---
Uh huh. Both my multibox and my phat family trust account in the Cayman Islands are totally cool cause they're both totally not against their respective rules ;)
---
As a healer I’ve never had a dps complain to me about dying. They generally know they messed up and will admit it.
---
I throw a corruption on as I am running past.. a little bit of help
---
I like to watch Swifty, he is usually playing a warrior.
---
I think Sodapoppin plays a druid and Asmingold also plays a warrior but I don't watch asmon though.
---
It really is, I got to 20 tonight and was impressed with how large it was. Even without much gear, it felt like killing mobs on my priest with the overleveled wand.
---
Let’s say u have added an additional action bar via the interface, that subtracts one of the bars u can scroll trough, so if u activate every additional action bar I think u have two to scroll through :)
---
Watch out for yummy boys
---
this guy doesnt know PepeLaugh
---
I read abilities work on it countless times, but that is still second hand knowledge.

General(everything) - Combat - Tells - Group - Guild - LFG
---
I remember one time in Alterac Valley I ran into a multiboxer with 5 elemental shamans. He would chain lightning one shot like 3 or 4 people at a time. It was fucking hilarious to watch, and I was alliance side lol.
---
Always had a feeling malaria was more deadly....
---
I like when my auctioneer's Thathung.
---
He is pointing out why it's pay-to-win in PVP when one player has the power level of five characters.
---
Sure, five individual players can beat it but that's not usually going to be the case.  Usually the multiboxer will just steamroll one poor soul at a time.
---
I mean, were all older.  Most people are more mature and level headed now.  There are of course many, many exceptions though
---
Actually they are required by law to call an ambulance and law enforcement to take you away to a psychiatrist hospital, even if you don't want to, if you are actively suicidal
---
you can quit cold turkey and still give your guild mates a brief goodbye.
---
lol if you cant keep the group alive, thats on you ;) - Healers job is to keep everyone alive.
---
lol seriously tho, I play a Lock and i'll tap during instances (Becasue y drink when we can tap) but then ill use drain life/siphon life to regain the health. (Also use a wand).
---
The biggest issue you had with the story tho was the tank, he SHOULD NOT be tanking if he is under leveled for the dungeon...... He was the main cause of the issues.
---
I shouldn't have to get a group together to defeat one player though.
---
That logic wouldn't fly in any other part of the game. "Warlocks are balanced because you can kill one with 4 friends" would indicate serious balance problems with Warlocks.
---
That is the best thing in the world.
---
It's sad that most people don't know that.
---
I'm from the gulf south in the US.  The food there is typically pretty high in fat and salt content, so I guess I have a tendency to like those rich, salty foods.  This thread is drowning in salt, so I guess that's why I'm here
---
yeah i look at my notepad saw i was off but im happy im  done
---
Get two points in feline swiftness for that super helpful 30% movement increase, then go straight into furor. The instant 40 points saves a ton of time in leveling. I just maxed out furor at level 26.
---
Our guild used to do golf rolls for funsies because of shit like this. Lowest roll wins, except rolling a 69 which was an automatic win.
---
it is a shaman/paladin weapon. only way itd be better for someone else is a horde warrior going 2h fury. most fury warriors are dual wield regardless of 2h being a little better because the rage generation is a lot smoother and more satisfying to play.
---
it's so fucking weird seeing all those other people following one guy around
---
i really liked the idea of going ret for pvp, and just giving the middle finger to mages by spamming cleanse from all their slows
---
If by a pack you mean two.
---
Turn off discord overlay..
---
It fixed it for me..
---
you could try running [this](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/world-of-warcraft-classic/19048) and it'll tell you somewhat how far off you are from being able to run it. if you can run skyrim with minimal settings i'd say you're probably fine to play classic with basic graphics settings probably higher than 30fps, but i'm not sure.

Feral druid here built as both kitty/bear hybrid but have been going bear unsurprisingly most of the time. Anyways Force of Will dropped for me and I was wondering if I should replace Rune of the Guard Captain or Mark of the Chosen?
---
You know the United States is not the world (although you guys call a team world champion for winning a national league). Normal countries use , as a delimiter.

Just saw this guys post in hot. For as long as multi boxes use their multiple boxes to brief, people will hate them, even if it's "not all multiboxers"
---
Murlocs...
---
Just making sure but I should put my agility gear as cat and strength gear as bear right.
---
Been following a good add-on for alliance leveling.
---
I originally bought this back in probably 2006 or so. It was at least before Burning Crusade came out. It has maps of every zone and numerous major cities. Sadly it doesn't come with dungeon maps, so it looks like I'm still getting lost in them.
---
If I flip to the map of the Badlands, it still has the little X I marked for the spawn point of Broken Tooth, since I mained a Hunter in Classic and BC.
---
&gt; I’d say anything over 10 multiboxers vs a group of 10 players would not work.
---
But thats not a fair comparison. The multiboxer could bring along 9 friends too.
---
Can we trade chairs? Lol
---
Man that’s awesome
---
Or just "write" a "!" again..
---
because devout mantle is obviously ret paladin gear.
---
Horde is definitely Hydra...just saying
---
Lol why not just let the players pay for 5 accounts and just have one character with 5x every stat? it's essentially the same.
---
May you all have long days,  and pleasant nights.
---
It's a meme friend, chill out.
---
Ty sir
---
times change
---
If its boe, then its not ninja.  Cause you could have done the same.
---
I fundamentally disagree. If the item is \*clearly\* to be used by one player's class and not by the other's, then there is no reason to roll "need" other than...greed.
---
For mage, probably the best streamer to watch would be Xaryu. Ziqo and Venruki are good as well. They're all mostly PVPers but doing a lot of PVE at this stage of the game.
---
Costco ftw! Lol. My wife and I spend a small fortune at costco. Feels like we go for eggs and leave with a ton of stuff we dont need
---
Plays a pvp server, starts crying when pvping occurs
---
That last part might just need a bit of an attitude adjustment TBH. Take a step back - Why does it make you so angry to be killed by a level 60? What's the point of getting angry about losing an un-winnable fight? Do you realize that this is exactly the reaction those people are hoping for from you? You're reacting exactly how they hoped you would. You're just going to keep giving them what they want? (Even if they don't necessarily know how you're reacting).
---
"Is only a game, why you heff to be mad?" - live by these words of wisdom, friend. Instead of getting mad because there was nothing you could do, shift your outlook. "Oh well, there was nothing I could have done better. Moving on." Getting mad about things that are completely out of your control is silly. Just like crying over spilled milk. The milk is already spilled. Crying isn't going to get it cleaned up, or get you a new glass of milk. What will help though - is realizing that it's just milk. Big deal. It's 2 dollars a liter. Getting camped? Go level an alt! Play a different game! Watch some Netflix! Don't sit there and mope while you watch your res timer tick down. Make lemonade.
---
To be fair, The Enclave is a fascistic organization from the Fallout series of games, so I could see it being a popular guild/clan name for these kinds of folks.
---
It seems that this would fall into their grey area where you may receive an automatic ban. I can't really say, but from what they said, I gave lots of gold to myself, then bought a ton of a single item that they said was extremely under/over priced (I think they misspoke), and then a couple hours later I was slapped with the ban.
---
I also see them out in the world all the time. I've had 3 run ins with the same ally now. In 3 seperate locations. I've also seen one of the guys I ran a few dungeons with in Hinterlands a few days later.
---
I've put hundreds of hours into this game when it first came out and have been playing non stop for the last month and this has never happened to me a single time. There is no way this is a common occurrence for anyone who is playing the game normally.
---
I'm very sorry to hear that. Thank you for the encouragement. I'm in a much better place after the med adjustment had time to take effect along with some healthy habits changes. 
---
In general I have a pretty kick ass life, just really screwy brain chemicals.
---
What does it do?
---
Haha love that you’re an asshole about it.
---
Honour exists, it just isn't tracked. 
---
If you get an honourable kill you'll trigger spirit tap but until phase 2 getting honourable kills won't give you anything.
---
Yes but you are giving up sword specialization for a Mace and Dagger. Literally better off just using the two quest swords Thrash and Mirahs
---
Come over to kromkrush. I'll be glad to pwn some alliance noobs with you
---
Costco! Occasionally goes on sale for 149. Possibly the most comfortable computer chair I've ever owned
---
Oh you beautiful person! I'd given up finding this addon for classic! Can't seem to find the correct version for classic, mind sharing a link?
---
Every guild has the same thing to offer lmao
---
All of the wowhead/icy veins guides are bad
---
Maybe stop doing this instead of loling about it
---
this breaks the horse
---
Was it on Golemagg?
---
Really? I've done a questrun just now. We made it to the Lyceum. We couldn't get any further though. Wiped 4 times in there and called it a night.
---
You are correct. Just like night elves can ride rams.
---
Though the parting hurts, the rest is in your hands
---
\#nochanges  
---
Just kill the damn bosses
---
does anyone know of any solid female streamers or youtubers? i find them easier to relate to than men, being that i am a woman myself lol
---
Are you trying to train all your skills? 
---
Every class has a lot of spells that they simply don't need to learn.
---
Remember when people gave Blizzard shit when Asmongold tried raiding a Horde city on BFA and it lagged and crashed?
---
Funny how it's happening in Classic just as much as it happens in BFA LOL
---
ahhhh ok I thought you were implying talents like the trees themselves were useless
---
That's actually a legit idea, good tip
---
You can.
---
5 days later: 
---
"You MT'd those runs but you've got no gear? You mustn't be good enough to have earned any. GTFO scrub".
---
Just like whatever you do make sure the cops dont bust down his door and take him involuntarily to a psyche ward, that is usually much more traumatic than helpful
---
Share it so I can win a ducking roll for once.
---
You can right click your name plate and reset all instance. You don't have to die to do this.
---
nah

Just do the gbok spam thing people found out about.

This is ghosting, not simply quitting. And ghosting isn't cool.

There's a difference between BoE and BoP being that everyone benefits from BoE. You don't *Need* **any** bind on equip item to progress. Edgemaster's Handguards are a BiS for fury warriors up to Naxx. There were, and will be in classic, plenty of fury warriors unwilling/unable to pay for them. These same fury warriors will still be raiding MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 &amp; 40, and Naxx. The way people are unable to grasp that BoP and BoE items have incredibly different values is incredulous.
---
Progression is important, but saying an item that is marginally better than another negates 4 other players chance to benefit from the sale, comes across as extremely entitled. Especially if it's a lower level item and you're in the process of leveling up.
---
The way this poster characterized it is not true. This could lead to many people being too scared to contact someone for help. I have done hundreds of conversations on Crisis Text Line and can count the number of times the authorities had to be called on one hand despite 99% of my conversations involving suicidal ideation. Actively suicidal means that someone has thoughts, means, and an imminent timeline AND unwilling to safety plan to de-escalate the situation. Ex: "I am holding a gun to my head and I am going to pull the trigger and no I will not put it down for even 5 minutes while we talk."
---
Wow that's cool, I didnt know you could do that.
---
PVP was a pain back in vanilla when the server capacity was much smaller... as soon as i heard they were doing megaservers for classic, i instantly chose PVE.
---
I would fully support a week of hotfixed Jed being removed from the game, with no patch notes. Just to watch people slowly descend into madness and despair.
---
That's hilarious. Didn't notice. Just saw another crazy defensive comment.
---
Cant say no to the lil guy
---
Ewwww.. Of course it's a dog! Can you not see the affection for his human!?
---
It’s fun tagging people who I’ve had good or bad experiences with. A lot of the time if I have someone tagged as a douche they end up proving me right.
---
Most of my guildies are interested in pushing quests and grinding to level so as to not slow down to find groups from what I can tell. Also a lot of them are raiding focused when I'm not.  Though that might change once I get to ZF levels.
---
This would happen on any high pop server. They are just not capable of handling combat between a few hundred players.
---
Holy pally in classic seems only tolerable if you have friends that just want to sit online and play with you all day
---
I love that you're watching the office. I wonder how many vanilla players are like us and just dual screen wow/the office.
---
Is it for me to sneak my way through BRD to get to the black forge? I just got the mata for the smoking heart and cant wait to craft it. 
---
All the attempts to full clear BRD have been extremely unsuccessful. Im currently lvl 56
---
Which I don't know why people thought it wouldn't happen the same. They're running literally on the same hardware and codebase..
---
I get that, but read some of the posts in here about how people are acting and tell me that this isn't some type of obvious over reaction. I will guarantee less than .1% of the wow population sees or even interacts with a multiboxer on a daily basis. To have this type of rabid dog attitude and to come into a thread telling me to fuck off and die, has nothing to do with multiboxers camping a single random guy, and has far more to do with their childish mentality.
---
I literally received 7 DM's from people literally harassing me on reddit in the past 12 hours because I am a multiboxer. Imagine that for a second. People are so rabid frothing at the mouth insane about something that they probably see less than once a week, that they would go to the lengths of DM'ing and harassing a player who made a post about how shitty the community is about supporting people who get wrongfully banned.
---
It's not a realistic opinion, its like being racist. Their justifications are simply so few and far between that there is nothing to really support this type of behavior.
---
Dude I spend 1.5-2 hours there. A friend spend 2.5
---
If you wear something way below your level and you come across something that upgrades your outfit and thus attributes it can actually make a difference
---
I wish the NPC would just throw them in the fire after you run them in and go "oops. try again"
---
&gt; Specially knowning the reaction of comments in threads about bans is usually assuming the OP is guilty, for whatever reason.
---
Too be fair, most of the time OP is guilty.
---
Every time we get a botter banwave in WoW, we get a ton of stories about from people "falsely banned".
---
I was considering doing just that, I now have 2/2 in swiftness at 21 and will also max furor at 26.
---
Zoinks!
---
No, those goddamn murlocs!
---
Congratulations! Now the endless farm of Ragnaros begins!
---
Greed has gold as it's icon...
---
The 5-10 people in every quest camp competing for mobs definitely debunks that single player theory.
---
Ok I gotta go find it then! Thank you. I’ve tried a gaming chair before but they are so uncomfortable. Idk how streamers sit on those for hours on end.
---
Lol if they do 3 dots each that’s just shy of the max on 1 target
---
I don't care about your definitions that's the weakest argument you could make.  Some people can use boes, everyone can use gold.  Everyone needing is not only more fair it makes ninjaing completely impossible.  Why is it fair that someone didn't get a boe that they can wear?  Because they had the same chance as the rest of the group to win that piece, everyone had the same shot they lost a 100% fair roll if they want that boe they can buy it with gold, perhaps gold won from some other boe they needed and sold.  Why does it matter to you that the person is going to equip it or not?  A mage rolls on a warrior boe sells it and buys himself a mage boe.
---
Applying arbitrary rules to the situation creates inequality and creates an environment where ninjas can exist.  The system you're advocating for is objectively less fair and let's ninjas exist.
---
Do people kill princess in emp runs. The terminology still eludes me sometimes.
---
&gt;question the 'experience' gained from private servers.
---
Most of this actually has come from retail theory crafters. The PS have always said multi dot + fear/DS tanking
---
Are you telling us to like the comment thus upvote, or do you feel the comment was also of potato quality?
---
He noggen'd for the slow fall effect, no it doesnt reduce aggro range
---
If you’re willing to buy that many subs why would they care? Lol
---
No I definitely have a good habit of tagging shorty players. Run into them all the time.
---
Yes and if a party member is wearing something significantly below there level and they sell the BoE they can purchase upgrades themselves.
---
Ah so because one class has a skillset that *might* help them deal with it it's not an exploit? cool. And I'm sure the "thousands" of stacks of mats that you accrue at 5X the rate of single box players definitely shouldn't count as an exploit for reasons you're about to explain.
---
Not really on my server people ragequit groups after one wipe or two, noone is used to dying.
---
Dude I’m in the same boat all I wanna do is play feral and every time I LFG I’m always asked to heal. It sucks.
---
Classicdb basically is Wowhead; 100% of their content, including the database and even database *comments* were ripped from Wowhead.
---
It was so painfully obvious that for a long time they still had post-classic guides and information up (like transmog guides) due to ripping things enmasse, though most of them have since been taken down. 99% of the underlying site is still Wowhead though, to the point of even the 404 not found pages being identical.
---
sorry man i think the edit was weird and the blaring music was terrible. 0/10
---
Fundamentally, because I think the game should put players on an even footing.
---
There is nothing I can do to keep up with a multiboxer other than multiboxing myself, which is both very expensive and not fun to me.
---
the kinda annoy8ing thing is that op uses . and , interchangeably.
---
also, imo, larger numbers are easier to read with , and . together i.e. 465,345,987.32 or 465.345.987.32
---
I mained a druid from Vanilla to post Legion (I never bought BfA but I played while it was out) Ive always wanted a hunter but damn I wanna go back to druid. I love the utility of them and I love vanilla druid healing. Buff everyone. Drop HoTs on the tank. Maybe a healing touch if they get too low. And maybe drop a moonfire and/or Sunfire on the boss if you have enough Mana.
---
but
---
streamers bad
---
If i remember correctly,  it's something like Lazy Boy Managers leather Chair. Pretty sure its on their website. It has automatic lumbar support that really helps out on long questing sessions.
---
nice!
---
FINALLY got myself a Warden Staff as a Bear Druid after a lucky Staff of Jordan drop and some gold from a friend. Agility enchant doesn't exist yet, neither does strength, so what would be the best enchant to put on it until those come out?
---
Lol u mad
---
so why are they still in the game?
---
its funny
---
taking a picture of your screen would also be funny
---
I mean it was in the same chain. lmao... fucking christ. Go find a hobby.
---
The key difference is BOE. A usable BOE item doesn't entitle you to it. Now a BOP item is a very different story.
---
Comments like this one deter people from getting help who need it.  They read stuff like this and become scared to reach out for help. CTL only calls authorities if you are ACTIVELY suicidal with an imminent timeline and refuse to cease your trajectory towards ending your life to plan for your safety. If you are holding a gun to your head or a bottle of pills and say you are going to use it to end your life refuse to put it down for even 5 minutes to talk, yes they will contact the authorities. However, this rarely happens. I have done hundreds of convos and can count the number of times I had to notify the authorities on one hand. This information is in their privacy terms of use and is not hidden: https://www.crisistextline.org/privacy
---
They act the same way your doctor's office, school counselor, etc. would. The goal of every convo is to NOT have to call the authorities. And if authorities get there and assess you are not a threat to yourself, they do not detain you.
---
Logic dude i think like most people here he doesnt want to do the same mistake twice by throwing his life away  A 2ND TIME . so just deleted it.
---
Its against ToS to use them in battlegrounds, if you do see them there then report them.
---
It shouldn't take 10 players to deal with 1 player.
---
Thats a serious flaw in the game.
---
The thousands of mats I own is from running the AH, and merchanting, not farming materials. I think you're just trying to throw mud and you don't actually have any idea how people who have lots of gold in this game earn it. I made 1000g a day for three days straight crafting Devilsaur Leather Sets, how did my multibox help me here? I literally bought the leather from other players, crafted the sets, sold the sets.
---
I also took 2 weeks longer than most people to reach level 60 who rushed it, because of how difficult it is to level while multiboxing. 
---
I don't think you know much about what you're trying to talk about.
---
This person is misrepresenting this and it is a danger to people who may need help.
---
This isn't new or interesting anymore
---
When I first started playing wow back in like 06 or 07, my roommate and i always had either the office or arrested development on the TV in our dorm room. So having it on my dual screen feeds into that nostalgia even morr so
---
Devias?
---
I must have missed that skill when training. What level do you learn to party?
---
It's useful, but "godly" is a stretch. You never, *ever* prioritize spirit as a Warrior. If you happen to get some on a piece you'd use anyway, or if there's a massive difference (+10 spirit for +3 agi), then sure, but that's it.
---
I'm actually going to disagree with OP here. While he's right about some clear copy/paste jobs; most of his complaints are pretty minor or subjective. That said, spirit is massively *over* valued by a lot of players thinking it amounts to more than it really does.
---
why not just jump and charge the giants while in the air? kekw
---
Well, if you've seen ti work then I'll take your word for it. Thank you for answering!
---
Source?
---
Last time I checked, they just disabled the /follow command in BGs to combat multiboxers.
---
I still haven't decided a main. I probably will focus more on PvP and dungeons (not raids). I'm basically playing all 3 cloths (in a "time ratio" Priest &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock) but haven't decided yet one to stick and level to 60.
---
I like how flexible my **Priest** is: I can heal when needed, easy and fun to level, have a great damage as Shadow for PvP.
---
I like how much control, utility and damage a **Mage** have: lots of cc, amazing burst, can make food, teleport, portals, fun to level as well, but haven't done a dungeon yet since when I try to find groups people only want to go that new AOE meta and I'm really not interested on it right now haha
---
I like how hard to kill and the DOT style of the **Warlock:** fear, strong dots, different utilty on pets, and I'm really looking forward to try the Drain Tank build.
---
But to make everything worse... I do want to play a non caster class as well, thing is... I can't decide as well haha. Everytime I watch a stream or a video it makes me want to try that class in particular.
---
People keep telling me to go Rogue since its amazing for world PvP, amazing damage, utility, stuns, picklocks, stealth, etc.
---
And also Warriors that has great damage, are the best tanks and top DPS (and from what I watch on couple streams the PvE rotation isn't something like one spell spam), anyway... the downside that people keep telling me is that you need a pocket healer and great gear to start doing some damage on PvP... at the same time I've watched some montages with Warrior going solo on wPVP and taking 1x2, 1x3. (I know that is the case of some skilled Warrior, but thats actually a huge positive point IMO, when you can see the difference between a good and a bad \*insert class\* is really satisfying and having a skill ceiling to always get better is also great.
---
Well, to be honest I think I've written this more to occupy my mind with something than anything else (the last 2 months have been really hard for me - psychologically speaking) but any answer and opnion would be great :)
---
You’re probably going to laugh a bit but I went back to relatively high level zones and did quests.
---
There are some quests out there that reward 10-20g upon completion if you censor the rewards.
---
A lot of guides are somewhat Meh.
---
Take  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVTD8ptt44U) pre-raid BiS gearing guide for example. One of the things it says would be your BiS is  [Skyshrout Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13170/skyshroud-leggings) even though this is blatantly false, as  [Senior Designer's Pantaloons](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11841/senior-designers-pantaloons) are just straight up better.
---
Tastes like crab walk like people?
---
The cops don't bust down your door and take you to a psyche ward based on the concerns of your internet guildmates.
---
A class with stealth getting camped LOL, you're just bad roll on a pve server asap or get to STV and quit the game, those are your 2 choices right now.
---
Most macros aren't in the game... We only get a very restricted macro ability compared to something like Autohotkey.
---
"You can totally level without cat form," is what I am telling myself for when I can finally start playing around Phase 2. But I know that after running at regular speed for 20 levels it's hard not to put points in Feline Swiftness. 
---
And people are going to be whispering for you to come tank so keep buying those ranks of Swipe!

Moral of the story, if you see someone going for a node, just fuck off and find another one. There are literally tons of them.
---
Asking people you quest with if they would like to join?
---
Let me take a guess, you never trained the bite or claw abilities did you? Even low rank 2 or 3 will be a game changer for pet damage.
---
Pets can do a ton of damage when you set everything up right. Especially when you get the talents to upgrade their damage by a percentage. I respected to MM at your level and I'm constantly pulling aggro off my pet when I dump abilities for big damage.
---
I think it's incredibly rude and a clear case of being a ninja if you roll need on an item you have no intention of actually equipping. That's what the greed button is for.
---
Why do you propose so many like the game and get addicted?
---
You're a damn wizard
---
If the follower doesn't use any actions they will become AFK while they follow and earn no XP.  So as long as you use a heal every few mins you're fine.  
---
As far as the community goes considering half of this thread is defending actual multiboxers you're golden.
---
Leveling with a non-damage dealing follower just to include your gf is going to be slow and suck.  Your gf slowly sucking on you for including her is going to be great.  Good luck and God speed.
---
this, for tailor/enchant it'd be quite good.
---
ima gonna try it if i get an alt w/ those profs.
---
Cannot decide between Warlock and Shaddow Priest for pvp.
---
I've played Warlock through several expansions and love them. But the idea of a troll shadow priest sounds so cool as well. My only concern is how few abilities they have - I'm worried itd be boring compared to a warlock.
---
Yep, the Stormwind nobles suck. However I always understood it was part of Onyxia's interference to destabilize Stormwind.
---
Yeah screw alliance and horde I want to join thr Defias brotherhood and fight for Vancleef
---
You're entitled to your opinion. It just comes across as extremely entitled to me that you would request other party members to pass on something that has benefit to them.

It's a user flair, on the right of your screen under the community details, below *create post* you will see community options, click that and then edit the user flair preview which looks like a pencil. There you will find options to add faction / class

Hunters have basically the same thing as grimoire ranks except they have to go around the world and capture the creature and use it in battle until the skill is learned and added to their known pets spell list.
---
I'm sorry if I cam off wrong somehow. I was just recently involuntarily put into a psyche ward a few weeks ago and I'm sure that makes me very biased. If you call the police and tell them that your worried your friend might be trying to hurt themselves, then they absolutely have the authority to do that. I wasnt trying to say that you were doing anything wrong, just that you might want to be aware of the possibility. If not then that's fine and I'm sorry to make you feel worse
---
This is exactly what my dog does! Shell jump up and paw at my arms until I pick her up then she just walks around on my desk in front of my monitor. I get about an hour or so of play from when I get home to when my GF comes home and I have to start making dinner. My pooch always disrupts that (but I don't complain... Usually)
---
~620 dmg every three seconds is not just a tickle, and that's not accounting for shadow weave stacks. To some classes that spells death, even 10 levels below.
---
Yup. There’s so many features that, during vanilla and now on classic, I had to use addons for that wound up getting added by Blizzard as features down the road. The auto-dismount is a perfect example of that. Another one is the ability to save different loadouts in your inventory for different things. I had a mod that did that during BC and it saved so much tedium that didn’t add anything to gameplay.
---
For some it is still exciting and this is where they share. You Take my downvote, OP hope you get gold, keep up the grind!
---
Good on ya.
---
Keep in mind there’s like 10x the people on each server now.
---
I kno my role. It is attac.
---
They use it, they don't want it. This is an often repeated and always wrong assertion - you *never* take an equal amount of spirit over Str/Agi/Stam as a leveling Warrior or even Rogue.
---
What you gain in reduction of downtime you lose in combat efficiency, which means taking more damage... which means more downtime. Not only that, it also leaves you more susceptible to accidental death, and with relevant level food you won't be spending that much time healing between combat anyway.
---
And my treatment was down right wonderful to the way [this gentleman was treated.]9https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/daaev0/wrongfully_banned_for_30/)
---
Classic does that too!
---
I do love a good coop farm session
---
They couldn't fix it, I think they were forced to abandon it. There's no way to talk to a human being anymore with Blizzard Customer Support so no one could help them.
---
NO CHANGES

To you*
---
Man I FEEL this post so much, except my 6 month old puppy begs to go up then proceeds to step on my keyboard and generally make it impossible to play hah. Doesn't help that shes a 40 lb monster who thinks shes a lapdog!
---
&gt;Also you
---
&gt;There is nothing to believe other than the fact that OP is concerned for his friend. 
---
You're right, that was bad wording on my part, so I retract that statement. 
---
&gt;This is willful ignorance
---
It's the opposite of willful ignorance. It would be ignorant of me to make definitive claims without actually being able to verify OP's post.
---
&gt;He’s just posting this story on Reddit to get his story out. Not soliciting help at all. I’m sure that’s all that it is.
---
You're making presumptions. Even if for the sake of argument we pretend that thousands of people lead a hunt to find this person, in no way can that be reasonably used to dictate OP's personal intent. 
---
&gt;I’m sure this won’t inspire anyone to go out looking for them. Because that’s never happened before, right?
---
Again, that is a non statement, you can say that about *anything*. For example, let's say I put cookies out on the table with the intent of eating them myself. Anybody could sarcastically say "I'm sure that won't inspire anyone to eat them, because that's never happened before right?" as a way to claim intent, but It's a meaningless argument in this context because that isn't an indication of my personal intent and it also isn't a justification for eating the cookies I put out. In a similar vein, OP's post isn't a justification for searching nor can it be used to decipher his intention.
---
&gt;Endorsing the post’s surface assertion
---
The assertion is that OP is concerned for his friend. In which case, debating the legitimacy of such an assertion is a mute point because of reasons already stated.
---
&gt;I never claimed to be an arbiter of realism.
---
You did. In your original comments you claimed to be asserting the "realistic perspective".
---
&gt;Evidence is not evidence? 
---
Anecdotal evidence ≠ objective evidence.
---
It's not a legitimate argument because it's based on personal accounts rather that facts. Even beyond that, under the pretence of your own argument personal anecdotes are cannot be used as evidence because as you said, "you can't believe everything you read online".
---
&gt;I just wanted to make the case that other possibilities exist
---
But you must recognise that it's a non-statement and doesn't actually add to or change the discussion. Which is my point.
---
&gt;I appreciate the even handed approach and not complete write off.
---
Of course, I agree with you on the point of possibilities and belief at face value , I only disagree with how you're using said possibilities as a justification for making baseless claims. There's no ill will though, which I want to emphasise :)
---
&gt;happened before and it hits close to home. As I’m sure it does for anyone who got brigaded by online witch hunts for someone who didn’t want to be found.
---
I recognise that, but you must recognise that personal anecdotes can not be used as a legitimate basis for claims against others.

I kno my role... I attac

At the height of my playing I had 7 max level characters. Do what's fun and don't worry about it. I'm just hitting level 19 on my warrior and thinking about how fun rogues are. And wanting to try priest. And wanting a mage for portals. And wanting a hunter so I can have a pet. And wanting a warlock so I can be a walking apocalypse. And wanting a shaman because fuck, why not?  
---
Not you paladin sit down.
---
Also, arcane shot is a waste of mana. Stick with serpent sting and auto shot. Using arcane shot on CD will only drain your mana. It's much more effective to use multi shot even on single targets. Even then you'll only be using it once per mob
---
I’m horde on that server too, and it hasn’t seemed to bother me at all. As mentioned bg queues should be fast.
---
Wow has never been able to handle tons of people in the same place.  The same thing will happen that has always happened shit will lag and if the lag is bad enough for long enough the server will crash.
---
&gt;Edit: I mean why would you sell to use the gold for buying other BoE? I see that reason a lot and you just trade one BoE for another, so yes greed for gold and need for use
---
For the same exact reason you mentioned, to "*upgrade your outfit and thus attributes it can actually make a difference"* You're arguing against your own logic.
---
You Don't Snipe in Karington!
---
This is sea shanty 3
---
I don't think any person should have to conform how they play and enjoy the game, just because someone else plays it differently and enjoys it in a different manner. That doesn't seem fair, or relevant. How does me having more accounts stop you from being able to be the best player on the server in your chosen area?
---
I am a cooler Warlock and support the priests in this 100%
---
how?
---
Wheres the blink
---
I'm sorry that my comment appeared to you as vilifying WoW. 
---
It was a response particularly to the phrase "WoW is another world that's better with you in it". I have always personally taken the stance that Real Life &gt; WoW, period. There are people that I played with for years that I miss, but I know it is for their own good that they walked away from the game. 
---
WoW can be great, and it can be awful. It just depends on the person, and what is healthy for them.
---
Oof, they are 250g minimum on my server (Dreadmist EU) I luckily got mine for 120g from a guildie
---
Giving away your possessions is often a sign of suicidal thoughts. Smart of OP to reach out
---
Oh I'm not arguing it isnt scummy, just that all major devs are doing the same shit.  And it's legal.  I just watched your video and it seems UK needs to get their laws fixed if they are offering a subsidy that the big boys can take advantage of.
---
I'm just saying in the world of business you dont blame the companies for taking advantage when they do because literally all the other major devs do as well.  Even in this video he mentions how the major ones are.
---
Why UK is subsidizing video game developers in general from the taxpayers I have no idea though... seems generally pretty stupid.  But to fuck up the law to allow giant companies to get the subsidy too is pretty bad.
---
usually for 1 copper as well
---
I agree, nerf mages. I'm sick of a single mage killing my entire team constantly.
---
you just need to do your best to stay at literal max range all day long so they can't blink/nova you in deadzone.
---
I'm really not sure which is worse, multiboxers or people that take screenshots of them and complain on reddit.
---
It’s the highest level dungeon that can be easily/reasonably solo’d without having to clear lots of trash. Lower level dungeons give less gold for vendoring the blues and higher level dungeons are too hard or require too much trash clearing. 
---
Once diremaul comes out, there are some solo and duo runs or trash clearing but for now mara is hard to beat on gold per hour.
---
iirc there's around 8ish.
---
just did it a day or so ago, the drop rate was alright (for me). plus you just kill them on the way to the other quests and you'll get a few of them w/o consciously farming

You know, "some people" and so on...
---
You do know that earth shock has a fairly short range right? Most boxers are not skilled, it's like calling a script kiddy a l33t haxx0r. Sure they may put in the time to learn, but the sophistication to truly box well is not something the average joe will pull off. 
---
I'm not denying it's a pain in the ass to deal with a boxer. But my point is, you *can* deal with them. And just like you would avoid a party of skilled 5 players, avoid the skilled boxer.
---
You've got it twisted. That fact that you can or intent to equip a BoE item does not make it yours. Everyone in the group has equal claim to the spoils of BoE items, it doesn't matter what the result of that spoil is. 
---
The ONLY way that it will be any different is having a conversation with your group before hand.
---
Don’t get every skill for your pets. For one, later on you can buy the latest version, and it will train all the previous ones. 
---
Only buy the skills you need for the pets you use. I only buy blood pact, fire bolt, 1st level seduction, 1st level spell lock, and sacrifice after level 30.
---
If you are playing BM and are dropping 4/5 frenzy with a 2.0 pet you are doing something deeply, horribly wrong.
---
And you shouldn't be playing a frenzy build anyway if you give a shit about damage.
---
*And* for pvp broken tooth is generally inferior to scorpids and wolves.  If the difference between killing a caster and not is a 1.0 speed pet you need to work on your mechanics and decision-making.
---
Definitely did the right thing. Pretty pathetic people were pretending to be him.
---
As a Human Warlock, i fucking hate WoTF.
---
Basically if the enemy is green, player or non
---
If the item is BoP sure, BoE items benefit anyone who wins. You're not being a ninja rolling on a BoE blue/purple. Again to put your progression before that of your party members is an extremely entitled attitude.
---
remove the player interaction and everything in the game means nothing. which is essentially the state retail wow is in now.
---
Probably a case of a lot more people sharing the same ah
---
private servers could handle it without issue.
---
Why would you go on a trip with people you dont know
---
Cringe dude
---
No worries, I just wanted to make a point, not just to you. And definitely RL &gt; gaming! Gaming can be fun, or just an excuse not to deal with real life. But that doesn't make problems go away.
---
That’s his grandpa
---
&gt; Mine is, I miss looking at the player and making out he was pimped by the gear had on.. No need to even inspect him. With xmog that all goes away. Can't show off your gear coz no 1 cares.. It's probably transmogged.
---
You can always tell the people who have no clue how transmog works.
---
You can't mog your gear to look like anything you have not looted yourself. If that person's gear looks like T1 that means they have looted T1. If that person's gear looks like Naxx gear that means they are in Naxx.
---
I am not saying you have to like transmog, but at least criticise it for reasons based on fact.
---
Incredibly fun.
---
Seriously though, this is a public forum to share ideas and debate opinion about the game, not a RP forum.
---
It helps if u jump right in the middle aswell
---
God healers predict other people's fuckups /s
---
Because this is a multiplayer game and what you do has an impact on everyone else. 
---
&gt; How does me having more accounts stop you from being able to be the best player on the server in your chosen area?
---
I will never be the best at a lot of things compared to someone with multiple account.
---
I can't 1v1 a player with 5 accounts. I can't farm gold or mats faster than him. The only way to compete with that is set up a bunch of accounts myself.
---
Seems to be a common theme here...
---
Because there is no guarantee you dont do the same. It's sad but fact of life in any mmorpg
---
I have the name Luffy on Grobb.
---
Good choice.
---
yeah its a double edged sword tbh. You want high pop for groups and healthy raid community but farming resources and mobs in the real world is a pain. World PvP is great though. Classic Azeroth simply wasn't designed for this many people.
---
good, a pattern that easy to farm shouldnt be expensive, esepecially whe nit costs so much to make.. greedy people.. smh
---
It's not against their rules
---
My dog thinks all Tvs are actually windows, and is super observant of what's on them. I put on discovery channel videos for him like 10 min a day and he when the animal is off screen he runs to the back side of the tv to look where it went. His favorite for a long time was the snow leopard hunt/chase from Earth, but lately anything with wolf packs running is his jam
---
I’ve lost 4 friends to suicide, you did the right thing.
---
Holy crap, Blizz, you awesome!
---
You can probably tank all the bosses. I've done the whole instance with a 55 warrior before. Arms is fine, but just to clarify "Arms tanking" does not mean 2h DPS running around barely holding aggro. I tanked everything in vanilla as arms or fury, including a good amount of raid content.
---
While you're still doing BRD, get the MC attunement out of the way. At about 56 or 57 you can start doing LBRS. It's great XP, Onyxia attunement starts there, and if you run it a few times you should be able to get your UBRS key.
---
Good evening Moo,
---
It is I, Destructa! That was indeed a fun solid hour of murdering those elite ogres in STV. Those moments in WoW are the ones I live for. As you mentioned, it's so enjoyable seeing most members of the opposing faction playing in a coop fashion on PVE servers. Hope to see you around future zones while we level. :)
---
Your Ally pocket lock,
---
Destructa
---
Yeah I was talking to a friend about this last night. What makes it great is having the cool gear in town to show people etc. I played through WoD. Alot of things led up to my quitting but the biggest thing was the player housing basically making you never see another soul. I did make the argument though that cross faction main cities are also to blame but that was years earlier.
---
So one example?
---
/u/JustTray said
---
&gt;Almost all **games** ban multiboxing under botting rules.
---
Did not know about that sub. Thanks, i will share some more soon :)!
---
Gosh i need that axe, 15 runs already and didn t see it once
---
Unfortunately you were dumb enough to not Need on a blue BOE. The fact that someone can use it is irrelevant if it's a BoE, because everyone needs gold. The best you can do is ask him to cut you a deal on the item for below market value.
---
Yeah my character blew up
---
I'm right there with you man. I love hybrids. From what I see in raids the ultra-min max has very little if any rets etc which is sad but man leveling up as a shaman I love how much utility I have access to
---
I'm so tired of people on this sub trying to make that way rolling the norm. Never in the 75% of my lifetime that I've spent playing this game has rolling been done like that. If you can't use the item and plan on selling it that's what the GREED button is for, the icon is literally a piece of gold for christ's sake.
---
lol, caught me red handed.
---
haha sorry this was my first time ever posting something like this on reddit so hopefully I got it on there now!
---
And marriage with couple of children is allowed there? :)
---
Wrote this on my phone while about 90% asleep,  so forgive the bad grammer and stroke i had in the middle of it
---
Their cities are crap tho. One big thing that deterred me from Horde is that I didn't want to hang out in Orgrimmar for the rest of my Classic days. It's so ugly. So is Thunder Bluff. Undercity is aesthetically pleasing, but a nightmare to navigate. 
---
Meanwhile all the Alliance cities are gorgeous.
---
If it's horde getting ganked they deserve it. Couldn't stay alive longer than 30 seconds tonight because horde where everywhere ( literally everywhere)griefing and camping bodies. Couldn't even reach the Griffin master in darkshire to fly to stormwind because 13 skulled horde were on top of buildings camping everyone. Horde can burn in the firey pits of satans ass hole.
---
no one get to 60 in 3 days

Imagine someone with 80k karma telling someone else to find a hobby.
---
no loser can afford this.  this isn't cheap to set up or play.
---
 I rerolled a level 21 to go to PvE and now I'm thinking of rerolling a lvl 28 because warrior is seriously a boring class.
---
Meh
---
I dont understand this logic because xp is xp, even more so in classic
---
What? I played it in Japanese
---
No it isn't. OP doesnt even know this person well enough to have any other form of contact with him.
---
&gt;upcoming duel tournament
---
If by tournament you mean sitting down and providing 100% crit chance, okay.
---
I don't think im ever happy with mine either if i analyze them, I just have to go with the flow.
---
Let me tell you about how I killed someone with rez sickness in 6 paragraphs.  
---
This game truly changed my life, here's 10 paragraphs with how my life is objectively better.  
---
&lt;insert meme spec&gt; is actually decent, here's 20 paragraphs and 5 external sources to prove it's below average.  
---
I finally got my ww axe/broken tooth.  
---
Finally dinged 60 by doing &lt;insert something not unique&gt;
---
I legitimately have no idea what or where this boss is.
---
Difficult to level doesn't mean you don't do 5 times the damage. Which is the problem. Unless you are manually inputting each individual action for each individual character (without software assistance) you are cheating. Just because some of your gold comes legit does not mean you aren't.  You have an unfair advantage in collecting both cloth and leather, the two you just *happen* mention to the GM, because you can just plow through mobs. Doing quests might take longer to complete but collecting mats doesn't. Because you still do 5x the damage.
---
Kinda funny that by pointing this out you just created dozens more people who will continue doing.
---
40 lbs at 6 months? I do not envy your feed bill
---
&gt; And just like you would avoid a party of skilled 5 players, avoid the skilled boxer.
---
I shouldn't have to avoid one player because he pays more money than me.
---
I had the luck of befriending a few GMs back in the day. We knew each other from before they got the job, and we all raided together for years during/after their time at Blizzard. I also had the luck of being online when a guildmate decided to login one last time to say goodbye. People were ignoring it like they thought he was being dumb and dramatic, but I PM’d him and watched as he started slurring words. Turns out he had just downed a bottle of sleeping pills and a handle of vodka. No bueno.
---
I gave my first GM friend a call and there was no answer. Fortunately the other one picked up while she was on break. She immediately started running down the hall to find her boss and get it up the chain, and they had his chat history and contact info out to police in that city/state within just a few minutes. Just in time, I’m happy to say. My GM friend wouldn’t tell me anything one way or the other…much to my chagrin but rightly so.
---
Fortunately, our guildmate turned up healthy and in recovery a couple weeks later. He told me all about what happened, and he thanked me for making the call. Apparently the response time was minutes. Police had to break down his door, and he was unresponsive and going into respiratory arrest when they found him.
---
Cheers, Dredorn the Druid! I hope you’re well after all these years!
---
you should spec feral for increased movement speed in cat form. makes leveling bearable
---
I believe OP did roll need, they're just upset the party member rolled need as well.
---
Damn OP, thank you for caring so much. We need more humans like you on the planet
---
Redragon keyboard?

I've only ever leveled warriors. I think I'd be stunned with how much less I'd die and quicker I'd level as another class
---
You got the reference.
---
Men these multiboxers are a plague on a server.
---
You and literally every Paladin player from Vanilla feel this way. Cataclysm shattered the Paladin class fantasy.
---
Said common sense
---
I think it's wack that you believe this. You call it greed I call it entitlement. I suggest you save yourself the obvious heartache and have a conversation with your group before you get started.
---
Most of these comments don't have a clue, and while the OP has some valid complaints (the obvious copy/paste job, which to be fair if you're writing a dozen guides is pretty easy to overlook, even if it *shouldn't* happen), the "important" ones really aren't.
---
Spirit is *useful* while leveling, but it's not a good stat. That sounds contradictory so I'll explain: It's a nice stat to have (and you tend to get a lot of it on gear you'd be using anyway), but you never *ever* prioritize it over primary combat stats (Str/Agi/Stam) - what you gain in reduction of downtime, you lose in combat effectiveness, which leads to taking more damage and more downtime. It's a complete trap and there's a reason that none of the Theorycrafting discords, much less Guides, recommend it.
---
As for talents... Eh. If you're using a shield, shield spec is fine; if you're not then obviously it's not. I tend to agree with OP here that mana is better only because I rarely prioritize shields for anything past level 10, but Enh isn't casting a lot of spells or stacking Int anyway, so that 5% extra mana does not go very far (also the same reason Spirit isn't important for Enh mana regen).
---
Finally, Shaman tanking... maybe isn't something that should be in a beginners guide, but IMO you're shooting yourself in the foot by not tanking in the early levels, so I *personally* think it's relevant.
---
I’m the magetard
---
I say it's the most fair option available. The auction house works as a giant need / greed. Players that want an item the most will pay the most for it.  
---
Besides I have been with plenty of players that claim they need an item, but later ends up on the auction house. Now check out this sweet [loot](https://i.postimg.cc/np1SBcY8/Dwarven-Hand-Cannon.png) that the hunter didn't get.
---
It's rooted in a sense of inequality I bet. Either inequality in the game- people will see 5 indentical characters steamrolling and have an emotional response to that alone, rather than thinking about the effort involved; or inequality in life- maintaining several wow subscriptions as a hobby and the required hardware overtly suggests some level of affluence. 
---
Either way, it's an emotional response to perceived inequality

I am a very generous Priest buffing all factions.

Aint throw weapon just ammo without a gun. Why not learn crossbow gun bow and get a new stat stick
---
I kind of enjoy the classic/vanilla pathing. It's like frogger everytime.
---
I skipped Blasted Lands entirely. It really isn't a levelling zone. The quests there are mainly to get some endgame buffs. Would not recommend going there if you're trying to level.
---
People are doing this at the Winterspring recipe vendor. They run to the northwest corner and can attack people.
---
Bottom text !
---
I think it is sad that people can't be happy for others that win any item that would be beneficial. The other warrior in the group can always farm up the gold needed to buy a pair off the AH. Just be happy for everyone's progression, especially if they're a friend of guild member.
---
I don't understand. What is the point of casting fear and then immediately nullifying it's effect?
---
You also can't do these things against any single player who is better than you, you're trying to justify an issue with a player base, because you can't or choose to not do it, not because its actually hindering or even effecting you. 
---
You'd have this viewpoint whether you see a multi-boxer once a week, or once a year.
---
If anybody can ruin your gameplay for you in an MMO like WoW, its because you're choosing to let it ruin your gameplay, not because it actually is. You being offended or upset doesn't constitute that someone did something to you, or prevented you from accomplishing anything.
---
If you want to be the best player, you better be playing 18 hours a day, if you're not, then how is your comments even relevant to any single user who does that?
---
Full bags bruh, full bags.

I did roll need...

Gotta bind to Shift+key and Ctrl+key for every key too.

You didn’t overreact at all. He’s your friend. That matters to you. And you matter to him.

Wish you both the best, and many more days of happy hunting.
---
Sincerely,

Someone who’s needed to be checked on
---
yeah, so why are you entitled to it? What makes you think that you would have killed that mob instead of him?
---
 If somebody needs a boe blue and doesn’t equip it I block that person immediately and I don’t care what the reason is.
---
Corsair STRAFE wired mechanical keyboard , cherry mx red
---
Wait why is it a waste?
---
That's why you go to lower level areas where you're the skull.
---
So did Blizzard actually have this info when they were working on classic?
---
I thought they claimed numerous times that they didn't actually keep any of this data?
---
That's totally fair, I just wouldn't have thought someone who didn't play would subscribe to or even stumble into the classic sub. Welcome!
---
I am still undecided, but I am getting close to choosing on a shaman on a pve server or a  rogue on a pvp server.
---
it is wack, 
---
boe for class A = gold for class B --&gt; boe for class B
---
How people refuse to accept this is nuts.
---
...but you can vendor BoP items thus making them the same as BoE items in terms of "spoils" so what's the difference?
---
Exactly!!
---
This is coming from a guy who raided WoTLK...
---
We had raid groups. I played a DK on the realm Bloodscalp. In a guild called Gansita... anyways. They had 3 raid “groups” and you earned your seat based on attendance, DPS/HPS/Tanking ability, Item level, and how active you were in the guild community. I was in group two because I could not speak Mandarin. However, there was an American speaking rogue in group 1 (he was top geared rogue on our server). I would say I was a well geared DK, I would maintain top 5 on charts in group two quite often. I could have easily pulled my weight in group 1. Anyways I didnt speak Mandarin so I was shit out of luck.
---
well when i was in vanilla it was always need boe's.
---
Looks like you already bought it, that's unfortunate. You could have bought the mats and found a tailor to make the gear for you at a much cheaper rate. Also dreamweave gloves are better.
---
Ye i do this a a warrior, i charge anything thats green while travelling
---
I have a parrot and sometimes he can chill on my shoulder while I play, but that doesn't last long before he tries to either chew on my headphones or climb down my arm and stand on my hand.
---
I was wondering myself last night how do I taunt the slow moving blobs in maraudon? I guess whatever one does to get the violent attention of a flesh eating blob--I just do more of that.
---
As a warlock, I just troll everyone by constantly using fear. They either force close the game or let themselves be killed.
---
Just a bunch of mageweave and shadow silk
---
&gt;Nobody screamed bloody murder about that
---
Its always been disliked. People live with it, but its broadly considered bad for the game ever time discussion comes up.
---
You won't get a source because it's untrue. Blizzard's solution was to remove the /follow command. If anyone is able to get multi-boxing working in some capacity in battlegrounds, they're doing something other than multi-boxing which would be against the ToS.
---
They either had less people or lower tickrate servers or both.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it. :)
---
Notice how you had to add per account to make that work. It’s each keystroke provides as many actions as you have accounts. If you have two congrats your one button press just caused two things to happen. It should be considered cheating.
---
I ran on mboxer on my server. He is runing 4 shadow priests. At the end, i ended up with 4 dots and left to die .. and that was slow and painfull death, knowing that eating food won't heal you up, bandage would get interrupted and I was out of potions ..
---
As much as it is a job I don’t think that missing the first official raid due to real life reasons is deserving of a boot, I get that there’s a certain limit to the amount of raids u can miss I wouldn’t want non serious members on my team aswell, but most of us aren’t 12 anymore who are online 24/7 and it shouldn’t require that in my opinion. 
---
Thanks for your opinion regardless
---
Why thank you! Sad I lost my first epic drop on this character. But I also love that image because it shows off my UI which I am quite happy with. Except the party bars. I am not sure if I should ditch them entirely or put them horizontally up top. I can manage with just Grid2, but it feels too empty without the party bars.
---
Oh, it'll get better.
---
When BGs comes we'll get the honour system were 60s can farm lvl 48-60 players for points.
---
Please enjoy plaguelands.
---
Blizzard considers macros to be a single action.

Imagine thinking 80k karma is some unachievable goal that requires an insane amount of time and effort instead of just casual posting. Just because you're such an unlikable dick that doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
PS we're both on Reddit. :)
---
My bad, looks similar
---
Just as much as a bot is "input from a human" because they installed it and turned it on.
---
I say they can kill the bosses I need or they can find another priest.  I help people kill bosses I don’t need all the time and it’s only fair
---
The classic wowhead guides are pretty terrible. The warrior one was absolutely awful and full of misinformation until the classic warrior discord made then fix it.
---
You know this is a joke and not a dick? So ya know you ain’t gotta take it so hard.
---
most of that shit seems to be written in haste, probably even before the game even released to capitalize on the hype. It gets shit wrong all the time, even the most basic things like the levels required to mine certain deposits are incorrect in the mining guide for example. Trash.
---
&gt; But don't be surprised if they fight back, and even put up a decent attempt! The way PvP works is that PvP attracts more PvP, you start by killing one person and that's fine. You find a few more, wipe them out and carry on. Before you realize it, some higher level players are coming and targeting you specifically. It escalates to the point where an all out war basically takes place.
---
Yup, absolutely love Hillsbrad for this reason.
---
Was running through there to get to Hinterlands and kept seeing people in General chat talking about being ganked by Alliance. 45 minutes later and many, many epic battles later (even though I was high level it's tough going up against a full 5 man party even 10 levels lower), Hillsbrad had been claimed for the Horde and most Alliance had gone off to quest elsewhere.
---
At least until they rallied their players and the cycle starts over again.
---
You cant try to apply logic to culture, this 'cleave' means whatever the community wants it to mean
---
Doesn't sound like you mained anything.
---
That's not an answer. If I can sell a BoP for good money, why can't I just roll Need on it then? According to this ridiculous logic, I should be allowed to "advance my progression" no matter what.
---
We can be hopeful
---
why you dont have a mage?
---
Switching to hemo at 30 was key for me. Those stealth talents and the 3 combo point cheap shot are clutch.
---
I'd just like to take a moment to point out that this is pretty common from what I've seen across multiple industries: metrics require employees are getting perfect (or near-perfect average) scores.  Management is relying on you to be thoughtful and give an 8/10 so they can use that later as a reason for withholding a raise, or worse.
---
So, knowing this, do everyone in service a favor: if you think that support rep, chain restaurant server, or whomever you're filling out a survey on did their job even slightly well, give them full marks.  Anything less is actively harmful.
---
Hopefully he'll grow out of being a dick
---
but that gold can be used to buy a different boe that is a far greater upgrade than the original one for the person who supposedly 'deserves' it.
---
Welcome, friend!

---
Regardless of how you want to spin it, doing 5 times the damage allows you to collect mats faster. That's an object fact. Nobody multiboxes "for fun" they multi box because it gives them advantages over other players. You're not going to get banned for it. There are many blue posts about it where they dodge the legitimate questions about multi boxing in favor of easy to answer softballs. You can admit you do it for an advantage.
---
No worries
---
Why would anybody care about your guild drama?
---
Crabs are people too.

---
If the tank demands you do something you do that something.
---
how does this not make sense?
---
No...
---
Or it can be used on a different color mount. It's gold.
---
I'd venture to say a 5x character would be a massive upgrade from a 5 account input broadcasting multi boxer. But yeah you got me, I multibox 2 accounts. My main warlock and a separate account to sit in org and be my AH/mail slave. Game breaking lolllllllll
---
I stuck with combat. People able to kill 2 mobs at once every few minutes and adrenaline rush is just too good to pass up.
---
:(
---
Generally no. You kill her only if someone asks to
---
Sprint has different ranks with different speed increases...the first one looks weird, the second one looks - okayish and the last one is probably the one you saw on the other rogue...
---
Got the same mount in WoD from bonus bag from HC as healer or tank.
---
Your rogue is defective. You will have to reroll
---
how are spriests in bgs? is mana issues to much of an issue? should i stay away from? what about gearing?

What's that actionbar add-on?

I want to remove the bags and talent buttons etc. but still keep the original Blizzard look with the gryphons. This looks kinda like that.

Anyone?

Why is 'Oceania' servers being routed through the Netherlands?
---
Imagine being so bitter and salty about a video game that you go on a community forum of said game to vent your frustration on a completely irrelevant topic where people highlight legitimate bannable exploits. 
---
If you don't want to pvp don't play on a pvp server.
---
You can also just get yourself into a party with your alt (need a friend to invite) and once you're set up that way, you can reset the instance fully solo by logging into your alt for 2-3 minutes until it gets passed party lead.
---
You're absolutely right. Nobody likes getting ganked. But I love the possibility that it could happen. Keeps on my toes and when it does happen, I love that you'll sometimes have nearby players jumping and you either die together or turn the tables which is glorious.
---
That or you run away and leave your ally to die and get hate whispered after which is always hilarious.
---
I see your point now
---
I too am sorry you were dropped on your head as a child.
---
Man had a full on orgasm right there.
---
But seriously it might have to do with the rank of sprint you are using. I think it ranges from 50-60-70%
---
Are you sure about that?

60 Human warrior tank here, just got ahold of a " **Eskhandar's Right Claw** " :  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18203/eskhandars-right-claw#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18203/eskhandars-right-claw#comments)

Is this worth using over a sword? at which point would I switch over? Before I was using Lord General's Sword:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11817/lord-generals-sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11817/lord-generals-sword) 
---
I was thinking of farming for Ironfoe but it doesn't seem like it's necessary now that I have the fist weapon, only issue being is not having the weapon skill to go with it. Thoughts?
---
Because that's not the item that dropped? If that was how it worked then the mob would just drop a big bag of gold that everyone could roll for.
---
A shaman or paladin should get it...wtf?
---
Why are 'Oceania' servers being routed through the Netherlands?
---
I'm alliance, and he certainly can, but that's one class, and I haven't come across one yet that actually knows that he can actually do that hahaha

Adam Lanza played wow
---
At what level is it realistic to do the warlock succubus questline? Can it fully be done at 20?
---
I would feel like an asshole taking strikers mark from melee.
---
New player here playing on Blomeaux, if this happens I just say in zone or guild chat "getting camped by a hankering plz help" and usually within minutes half the horde online show up and fuck them to death for me.
---
It costs 50% less gold give or take to do the quest line and get the dreadsteed, so this really makes no sense at all. How could it possibly be objectively worse?
---
Keep digging
---
It's not entitlement it's etiquette, need is for items you intend to equip, greed is for auctioning and vendoring.
---
And then in return when an item other people can use drops and I can't use it, I'll greed it.
---
Well, what I don't understand is people can and will make weird purchases at AH. Say I am buying a green item for 100g, because I think it is worth it, but their system will ban me because it is extremeley over priced? Why are they the one to judge whether sth is over or under priced? This automatic system makes zero sense. This is not even close to punishing the gold seller 101. They have no idea how the actual gold seller is selling the gold.
---
Your post says that they are in a spot where there are no guards OR evade bugging them. Evade bugging is against the rules, pvping in a spot where guards don't aggro isn't.
---
This is so rad
---
I get this too, and experience it when I get a green. "Hey that guy over there might need this" inspect, trade " no it's free man" when they offer a few silver.. I swear it's selfish feel goodery but damn is it nice.
---
I'm a priest and a warlock. I think you know where I stand.
---
Thank you for being a good person.
---
Awesome
---
I second this, almost 40 on my troll priest and I’ve only even been ganked twice so far, two separate occasions and both times the ganker bounced afterwards. As long as you know where you’re going and what to expect in certain areas, you can avoid alliance bases in contested zones etc., and so far I’m not sure if im lucky or have some mystical aura about me but most of the ally I see will just pass right by me, regardless of if they’re about my level or higher than me.
---
You do realize that by that logic everything can be needed and there is absolutely zero logic to the entire process?
---
So there was an alliance mage Zubsero farming the same spot as me in WPL. At first we didn't interact with eachother and then other alliance started showing up. As most of you know, mages are very territorial when AOE farming, so he started pointing at them. At this point I think I was getting the hint, so I would spit on them. If he spit back, I would know it was a sign to kill them. He would sit and watch as I murdered his friends in exchange for efficiency. We then took turns pulling huge packs and helping eachother AOE them down for awhile. It's definitely one of the most unique experiences I've had in this game and really wanted to share it with you guys.
---
You sure have good luck with rolls... Truestrike and Dal Rends already
---
Why do you need a shield in pve as a holy paladin? Or armour in general for that matter
---
Sounds feasible to me, it was an absolute nightmare and I had the added benefit of being on a 2:1 horde server as alliance at the same time
---
Congratulations!
---
... but just because I am curious - how does this staff increase your healing performance?
---
Ka is a wheel.
---
PvP in WoW is like Rock, Paper and Scissor.
---
Youre not ment to be able to defeat everyone with one class.
---
It is cosmetically different than any other alliance mount and thats enough
---
Welp, i know you’ll shoot my opinion down too but i kinda agree, because it happened to me and then to my girlfriend a few months later.
---
Cut too early, wanted to see if you got shafted with only a few taps
---
Good chance he just decided he could do better things with his life than spend it on video games, giving stuff away and deleting is just a way of reducing the temptation to start again.
---
Not saying anything might seem a bit rude but sometimes people don't want to give the opportunity to be talked out of quitting.
---
Nope and Nope.
---
Adapt and overcome! You must avoid the thugs, and farm boars in the forest.
---
What do rogues beat right now?
---
Kudos to you and Blizzard for caring
---
Because equipping an upgrade bop is worth more to that player than you vendoring it, but a BOE to someone who can wear it is still worth the exact same to soneone who can't wear it.
---
"oh hey that looks like a flurry of red name plates... I wonder..." dead.

Now when someone ganks my alt I can go over there and order 66 them all.

How is it possible in 2019 for twitch vods to load so damn slow
---
Yea but it seems hunter might be better at dealing with more situations? I was trying to decide between hunter/rogue maybe I should go hunter?
---
This happens literally every time I raid which is every week. Yes it is a problem.

Some people just play it for the social element.

I think OP meant a duel tournament is coming up?

This clip wasn't the duel tournament. I believe Asmon is running another duel tournament in the near future.
---
Thinking of starting a paladin on a different server. I've never played and all my friends picked horde so I did too, but the paladin really interests me.
---
WoW has COUNTLESS items, NPCs, achievements and all kinds of things referencing real life stuff but, sure, "selfie" is just too outrageous.
---
What site do you recommend then?
---
Maybe RL possessions, giving away pixels just as often means they want to reduce the temptation to come back to the game.
---
No it doesn’t tell you who lol. It doesn’t show up combat log
---
Man that's got to hurt.
---
You raid main city every week?
---
Yeah it was just out of control. Then I play a game like Warframe and every frame has 4 buttons and it's joyous. I hope someday they go in and consolidate similar abilities, or make them automatically work based on context, rather than how it is now (like making overpower a skill that gives you a free instant heroic strike that can't be dodged rather than a separate key).
---
Unfortunetly I think right-click reporting is the only way to report, unless you can put in a ticket &amp; give them the screenshot. Hopefully he gets banned, nobody should be using that language.
---
Me, highest is 23, then 15, then 8, then a couple of 6's.  I play a couple days, stop for a couple days, on and off.  Don't want to get burnt out by playing too much.
---
Oh god, the memories. That was a massive undertaking and I still can't believe we pulled off that trick of summoning two of the raid groups inside ironforge while the others massed on the road and acted as a distraction. 
---
The carnage was amazing - we OBLITERATED the alliance. Could never do something like that today, Spy would spill the beans before anyone could even finish a summon.
---
Pretty sure we can say that the streamer server is an outlier from all the other servers.
---
It eliminates the prisoners dilemma which greed / need rolling currently is.
---
It also removes flavour from the game.
---
I asked for the minimum amount they could give so I could log in and get some gold from a friend for the token so that I could log in for the raid, they gave me 2 weeks and told me to have fun.
---
Back in vanilla it had 0,02% drop rate
---
Rogue or mage, both have soo much cc and utility to deal with almost anything.
---
I haven't seen a Herod one since middle of last week.
---
yea it's kind of fucked.  I also didn't start on opening day, and leveled 2 other classes to ~14 before doing this one...  do I have a problem?? :/
---
I ran SM Cath so many times just for the hat that I made multiple ingame friends from different groups of SM just by joking about it, frankly it was a bit frustrating but very fun.
---
You keep posting this definition of greed, but I think the part you are missing is that the item and the gold are completely interchangeable in many ways.    
---
     
---
You get it, you equip it.  I get it, sell it for 10g, then use that 10g to buy a similar item that works for my class, and equip that.  Same result.    
---
Now, I could see an argument that while leveling up, many items have a very inconsistent market where availability is inconsistent and costs fluctuate wildly, in which case one could argue that in those situations it's best to let the person who will actually use it equip it.   
---
But with a functional semi consistent market for higher level things, then it makes total sense that BoEs should be the same for everybody.
---
I had a priest join Sunken Temple Eranikus run (just a beeline straight to Jammal'an -&gt; Eranikus, no other quests/bosses) who suddenly had to go right after Jammal'an died and he won the item he wanted.
---
I'm wondering if people think other people are so stupid that they can't see through this? Anyway, made a note of his name. Won't be inviting him to my groups anymore (I'm a Warrior tank).
---
Huh? You can sell BoPs and use that money to buy BoPs? I don't think you can use that logic at all.
---
I thought they did this already in retail at some point.
---
Ignorecleaves!
---
Just dungeon grind to 60 if you're getting camped.
---
No. You want mp5.
---
If you don't have pants and the rogue next to you does, how you gonna get in the raid to replace the pants?
---
I farmed it for seven years on retail. Zulian Tiger took me only 13 months
---
unacceptable !
---
Yep.
---
I don't know if it's just recency bias, but the level 32 power spike felt even better to me than the level 20 one.
---
It's non-existent. If you are Arms and in a raid, MS won't be used. So don't be Arms if you care about doing competitive DPS. None of the bosses heal, outside of some adds and you would be dropping off a more useful debuff that provides a lot more value than a single warrior's MS damage.
---
Doing tribal LW quests. Wowhead says that the guy in feralas sells Pattern: turtle scale gloves, but he doesn’t have them. Anywhere I can get them easy?
---
I mean, I get that before forming groups. But then you have to worry about the long con ... sure this guy was friendly for the first 3 hours ... even passed on that mail armor piece he could not use ... but was that just to lull us into a false sense of security ... I get it now thanks.
---
Try playing LoL, Dota2, Rocket League, CS:go, Pubg, R6 Seige, Battlefield, CAll of Duty, any other game besides wow and you will see that those communities are far more toxic than wow.
---
I raided horde and alliance in vanilla. Never seen or heard of a guild giving an ele sham a raid spot really, let alone a hand. Still sounds pretty stupid. Owell.
---
So, as someone who's not even 60 yet and still leveling, are you planning on being one of the highest level pvp players on your server?
---
Probably not.
---
You're also only thinking of a single 1v1 situation vs. a class who's already very good against your class. 
---
If you're planning on being a top pvp player on your server and grinding to rank 14 then you're individual skill isn't actually that important in all honesty because it's mostly a BG grind and doesn't have an awful lot to do with skill. 
---
The fact is, if you're good and enjoy the class then there will always be a lot of players you can kill and pvp will be lots of fun. Sounds like you're overthinking it.
---

Do you mean 180?

For herb/mining the farmer needs to be max level in order to farm herbs and mine nods in high level areas right?
---
There's a big difference between Asmongold raiding a place vs Anyone else raiding a place.
---
Report that shit
---
305 weapon skill (which he has as human) you want 6% hit. Ideal for orc/human warriors is 2% from Lionheart, 2% Truestrike, 2% Devilsaur. If you get Flameguard gauntlets you can swap bracers/bow/boots/ring as options. 
---
But I see Unforgiven 2%, TS 2%, Battleborn 1%, Blackcrow 1%, Painweaver 1% - He's already at 7% not counting devilsaur. Maybe he wants 9 for the felstriker with no edgemasters. He could also go for cflg instead of flameguard to get that to 305.
---
The meta is different in 5-mans than in raids. Having a paladin healer who can survive a few hits or even offtank when things go south is a real asset.
---
Plus all pallies need a plate (or at least mail) set for farming. Holy paladin in cloth +healing gear is quite possibly the worst solo'er in the game.
---
Ok
---
&gt; There many many ways to overcome stealth.
---
&gt; you're on a PvP server. You signed up for this.
---
Being a little less obvious would help you out a lot.
---
Try it out if you have the scepter, worst comes to worst you use innervate and a mana pot, should hopefully be enough.
---
... /s ?
---
I always do, and twice today the tank ran right on by and refused.
---
Good on you for not being a safe space for hate speech!
---
Who would you give hand of rag to?
---
TRADE
---
No way in hell would blizz let someone sell something for 200k gold right now without banning them. Combined theres not even 200k gold made yet from all the players across on that realm i bet.
---
Never used Multibox for WPvP, unless people tried to gank my toons. My main challenge lied in "solo" runs of dungeons. Got only until lvl 33 on my 5 shaman with 5 stoneclaw totems tanking mobs for my elemental casters. The raiding took all my free time and I abandoned multiboxing hobby.
---
Depending on what you find comfortable I'd recommend either move the quests over below the damage meter and  stack vertically on left side screen or horizontally right above your actions bars. That's just what I'd do from a aesthetic/functionality perspective.
---
Very clearly not the kind of multiboxing people take issue with
---
the other guy that responded to this comment is pretty spot on, can say the same thing about Horde
---
Plenty of enh shamans raided then and raid now, windfury helps all of the rogue and warrior dps. It's worthwhile to have one enh sham in each melee party.
---
There’s no way even gold sellers have 200k .. right?
---
... and then it _actually_ dropped and drama broke lose.
---
They did, couple expansions ago now.
---
You're talking to a wall. 
---
The amount of people in this thread who have absolutely no idea how multiboxing works is funny to read.
---
I could say I have 5 PCs and 5 keyboards infront of me customized to have a single key that i press with different fingers and they'd argue its botting and I'm cheating by using assist macros.
---
They don't know what botting is.
---
Warlocks will pay more but to be fair, they’re getting the level 40 mount for free.
---
This just happened to me! I logged in to power level in Un Goro today and got an inv to please heal BRD. I have like 8 quests for it so I said sure and start listing the quests I have while flying out there. After running the whole way I find out they're planning on doing 5 resets for arena and on the 5th one we're doing some other bosses/quests if people feel like it. So I'm already pissed but say screw it I think there's a ring from arena I want. Then they don't want to clear mobs on the way to arena, there's some walking pattern you have to know ahead of time to avoid aggroing a bunch of trash. I don't know if and no one explained so I pull and wipe. They get pissed at me. So I left group and had to log for an hour to calm down before going to Un Goro like originally planned.
---
Just had to rant lol
---
5 of Sledge's pets made a band.
---
I’m not 100% sure, but he may only have limited amount of plans. If someone buys it, you have to wait about an hour before he will have another. I would camp him because people like buying those plans and selling it in AH. Wowhead has been pretty accurate for me.
---
Who else are you gonna give it to lol? Your druids?
---
Imagine being such a worthless piece of shit you have to do a banable act to kill people 30+ levels below you.
---
Do the guards actually evade when players stand there or do they simply not have "vision" for lack of a better word? If it's the latter I don't exactly see how that's cheating, especially when it's so easy for anyone to just hop up there and start fighting back. Not like a ranged class/spec could kite a melee suddenly beating their face in without getting fucked up by the guards.
---
Abusing bugs that will get you banned wouldn't and don't take away from my gameplay, if someone is going to abuse bugs and get themselves banned, more power to them. It's not something I can change, nor am I responsible to make that change. Why would something that I know blizzard would fix and ban people for abusing make me upset? What kind of personality do you have to have to be so offended.
---
You can't omagine 500 gold farmers on a server? China has a very large population.
---
Costs mana, cant use it if you are locked out of shadow school, is on the GCD and messes with the five second rule.
---
Does anyone else wish there was a list of quests to avoid? Like quests that just take longer to complete than is worth it for the amount of xp they give? That'd be pretty neat.
---
I just started 4 days later and am now 44... enjoying the questing, the zones, the grind... but not so much time to play except on weekends, and then it is awfully frustrating with all the overcamped zones :(
---
That’s true, just can’t imagine one person buying that much. That’d be a shit load of money according to the rates the gold spammers advertise.
---
Be careful clicking on the link depending on your municipality because your mommy might have to take your tendies away,
---
I'm a hunter.  Can I need that?
---
Warriors should prefer a BRE or Spinal Reaper over Hand of Rag. I know I would.
---
Make sure to keep your swipe leveled up for tanking. You hit many enemies at once and it helps hold aggro. 
---
I’ve been tanking in ZF since the weekend and we haven’t had any issues. Keep an eye on any mobs that break off and tab to target then, the  growl to get them back on you. 
---
I like to keep the mobs a little distance from the healers and such of course so if one breaks off I can easily see it and tab and grab.
---
The only benefit to thrown weapons is that you don't have to waste a bag space for ammunition from your bow or gun. It's fine that they are weak, they are there to give you a ranged pull. When you come across a ranged weapon with stats on it use that instead and buy some arrows/bullets.
---
Reading all this makes me believe a little bit more in game developers👍👌 also really nice to see such a community! Guys i love you all!
---
ive had a few wipes that actually brought my groups together even more. Sometimes that random mob comes out of nowhere and throws everyone off in such a way that that we all cant do anything other than laugh and go again
---
Cool analysis, what would you say about the focus frame? It's literally UI but could interact with game mechanics
---
This shit just breaks my heart man.
---
Jinkies!
---
&gt; but it doesn't make sense for boe rare/epics.
---
&gt; it's also a boe that i can sell
---
Are you serious now? So you don't need the item for equipping but for selling. There is no difference. Noone can check up on you actually getting another BoE with the money you get from selling the drop. What if the BoE you buy costs less? What if you suck at trading and effectively downgrade?
---
All of that does not happen for someone who needs on the BoE and actually fucking equips it!
---
Download the Character Notes addon if you haven't. You can add notes to each player you meet - the next time you see them you'll easily be able to see if you have any notes for them and can write good/bad/neutral notes. Great way to keep track of ninja looters.
---
This one hurts because its true
---
True 
---
 But if they removed it now it would be horrible 
---
Even back in vanilla lots of spots where contested af and so on 
---
Now imagine this with like 5 times the players 
---
Or 10 times (can’t remember the server limits)
---
Slight misconception: There are not really any fights before Naxx that a prot paladin is an issue for. The closest is tank swap fights like Golemagg that force you into an add tank position, or Nef’s class call (again, you’ll be in an add tank position for phases 1/3 and not MT).
---
Naxx paladin tanking becomes an issue due to 4H, and you can’t MT Gluth for the same reason as Golemagg (you’ll probably just kite chow). That’s about it.
---
I am an enhance shaman and I also support the priests, as long as they understand they will still get one shot when windfury procs :P
---
lul,it's so cute.
---
No you cannot drop ferocious bite. Shred deals under half (or a third) the damage compared to a 5 combo point bite, so you'd end up losing a ton of dps. Ferocity doesnt make much sense for most bosses as you will not be using claw. Theres like 1 boss or so where you cant stand behind him.
---
Maybe I'll transfer there. Does blizz publish stats on horde to alliance per server?? I'm on kromkrush rn and it seems like for every 1 alliance there are atleast 8 horde. My guildy was in south shore last night trying to get some fishing in while 9 horde laid waste to any thing that moved. :(
---
Out of curiosity, are there any guides that you would recommend? From what I’ve personally seen from the warrior guides for example, IV seems pretty solid.
---
How so? I have not moved yet, slowly starting to see the population and active players becoming less so shazz has no more queues during the week really, maybe like a 5 min one here or there but nothing as serious as before. I assume Bloodfang is rather dead? The times I logged in a level 1 char and went to org to check, there was like 5 people. Then I log onto shazz and there are hundreds.
---
I’d argue that all high population realms are going to encounter this when a city actually puts up a defense against a raid of 3-4 full groups.
---
I don't think you understand what he's asking.
---
Different debuffs have different priorities in-game so if you use a high priority debuff it can take off other high-priority debuffs but low priority debuffs can't.
---
For example, Fury warriors are free to spec Deep Wounds because it's a low priority debuff and won't wipe off anything important.
---
Eve Online has a similar issue with multi boxers and at one point they banned "input multiplexing". Basically they didn't want a single keystroke to broadcast the same command to multiple accounts.
---
Not sure if the same applies to Wow but honestly it sounds like it wpudk solve the issue. If someone can tab between multiple screens and PvP then more power to them, but allowing players to PoM Pyro a single target 5 times with one keystroke should probably not be allowed...
---
The difference is that a BoE has a set value for every player, and a BoP has an added value to the player who can actually use the piece.
---
Dope.
---
yea, im on the verge of suicide, so it's all good lol.
---
Doggo: "Look at this weakass build. Comooon human..."
---
true.
---
A raid with 5 hunters, so nice of the lock and mage not to need
---
I used to main a warlock and almost never life tapped in instances if i had i water. If i ran out I'd eat. 
---
Now I'm playing a priest. Still fairly low but the only lock I've grouped with soul stoned the druid in WC. luckily we never wiped but it was a dumb move.
---
Take 5 Spirit Tap in Shadow. This allows you to get full use of the spirit on gear (it doubles as long as you get the killing blow on xp / honor rewarding units) as well as giving you 50% mana regeneration through casting for 15 seconds. Also get Wand Specialization in Disc for extra 25% damage with wands. From here you pretty much go whatever you feel. If you want to go for damage, follow the path in Shadow and go Improved SW:P, and Shadow Focus. Mind Flay isn't really strong until at least level 36 when you can get MF rank 3, so I don't advice going for it until then. You can get improved shield and stam buff from disc which is a pretty neat bonus to have while levling. Other then that make sure you'll get good wands while you progress as you'll be wanding a lot to maintain your dps. You can also heal very well in dungeons as shadow until ZF and ST and above when you need better mana management to keep up with the fights to make them go smooth and fast.
---
A miserable little pile of secrets
---
Maybe they were just sand people?
---
I never specified what the currency was for.  I just stated that it started off as BoE that couldn't be used then got turned into currency which can be used.  Sure you can't buy BoPs, but how do I know you're buying BoEs when you sell the BoE you can't use?  At the end of the day, if you're claiming that you need BoEs because money then looting BoPs for money shouldn't be a problem as every piece of copper helps right?
---
You can hide behind the "a BoP benefits the player more", but we can see that in actuality it just holds less value to you because you can't AH it like you can a BoE.
---
Are you joking?
---
Go watch it
---
Cataclysm came out just under 10 years ago
---
IV is just historically shitty.  It started going downhill a few years back, I checked the hunter one for vanilla just looking for pet advice and saw some questionable shit regarding talents and some other stuff.  IV being trash is nothing new though, but I couldn't really tell you where to find a good guide cuz I don't typically use them.  Maybe class discord?
---
name your guild Wind Ride Master
---
At least BOTH of you got a fair opportunity to win an item that benefits either of you.
---
1 keystroak = 1 auction per account is literally how it's defined in blizzards tos
---
you can write a ticket "increased mana regen after killing a target that yields experience" was understood by the millions of players before you. but it's never too late to improve things.
---
you sound very beta dude probably why you use reddit LOL
---
Big oof
---
? We all agreed to need BOE before anyone rolled. Not sure what u mean!
---
I originally played on a pvp server at the suggestion of a friend.  Stayed on that freaking server for a long time, even as it became a ghost town.  I haven’t played in a while but resubbed for classic on a pve server.   I do miss the large scale battles that would take place on pvp server in  Tarren Mill and Crossroads. Some post here are nostalgic and I’ve wondered if I’d still enjoy the pvp server. Overall though, I feel so much more relaxed leveling.  Used to always be so paranoid I now realize.
---
Anyways...I’d either start really broadcasting for backup support when you get ganked, take a 5 minute break whenever it happens, or reroll on a pve server.  If you like the game, the progress you have so far is not too terribly significant for the long run.
---
Me too actually !
---
I did it at lvl 20, no problem.
---
i'd love to see their reaction if the mount actually dropped haha
---
How is warrior harder? Druid is kind of the uncontested skill cap, right there with warlocks..
---
i hope i can have ***Deathcharger's Reins*** one day. 
---
Grats man !
---
Strategic office placement.

*breathes from small hole in [Hydrocane]*
---
disagree, ear rape was 10/10
---
It's not impossible to thread that needle depending on your level. I became exceptional at it in vanilla. Not as good these days. Having to relearn the distances.
---
ITT: people like you who don't read the context and realize that this was just me and some other dude killing mobs for a quest at level \~40
---
&gt; spirit of Classic.  
---
While I agree with most of this, cut that line. Defining what and how Classic is to be played is cancerous gatekeeping.
---
Care post screenshot of yourself in game?
---
The bag goes up to roughly where Grid is. So having the quests there is a no-go. Would just make that side cluttered.
---
Chromie needs to chill.
---
With proper pulls to specific Line of Sight spots, this is easily doable in ZF however you need 1 more mage (no lock) to burst everything down before things get out of hand. 
---
Source: Did this comp with randoms from 44-52 insanely fast.
---
We are the princes of the universe.
---
No, once you're hit capped the fury pain train never stops. The top parse on every single raid boss is a fury warrior doing 1000+ DPS except for Rag and Ony where they can't DPS 100% of the time.
---
Why? Because my numpad has "," on it and I generally use it for writing numbers and only sometimes when I don't I use ".". Imagine being so mad about it you have to post stupid comment like this.
---
Scripts no longer work
---
I was lucky and got to these quests just before most people were high enough to do it. Got lots of xp and leather killing all those mobs and then made another 20 or so gold selling my extras on the AH.
---
It was always a laggy mess. I remember an Org raid back in BC that crashed the whole of Kalimdor.
---
I doubt it. Everyone is stresmsniping each other making the concentrations of players larger than ever seen before.
---
lol
---
I wear an AFK tag like 90% of the time to avoid the constant whispers from people begging for a tank to do stupid shit that does nothing for me.  Just uncheck that auto-clear AFK box in settings, and only respond to the people who are doing something that is actually useful for you.
---
Good god.  Imagine being on a server with a streamer.  Yuck.
---
Damn dude, fix your map mini map buttons. I’m triggered.
---
As a fellow Skeram Squad on the Horde, will definitely add to my shitlist. Thank you. 
---
Any recommendations on a Skeram Discord/Guild?
---
No its not, no program is controlling anything, you are making inputs to do everything. If you dont multibox 40 accs your missing out.
---
Honestly I shouldn’t have even mentioned which server it was. 
---
This type of lag is due to spell batching, and will happen to any server which happens to have a couple hundred people fighting each other.
---
Was the lack of tanks this bad in vanilla? Called off runs once or twice when a tank can't be found, and today we found another healer and told our resto druid to go get his tank gear for lbrs...
---
Looking forward to getting rank 7 in phase 2 so I can tank 5 mans.
---
IIRC on cataclysm early patches it worked like this in random dungeons:
---
-if you roll need on BoE, it binds to you.
---
-if you roll greed on BoE then it's not bound and you can sell it to other players. 
---
I like how it is now. If you want to equip it and don't win a roll you can just buy it from winner.
---
Streamers and their community are a cancer
---
imagine shaming them on reddit. yikes
---
I'm not so much into the raiding thing; my endgame will most likely be 5, 10-mans and eventually a ZG once in a while.
---
Plus there is the soloing aspect. Aleriya sums it up nicely.
---
The paladin class "design" is a joke?! They have literally ONE healing spell, their buffs require you to keep buffing the entire time in a raid, their only slightly interesting spec is protection, which isnt remotely viable due to the lack of taunt (and atrocious mana inefficiency). Ret i wont even talk about, as it doesnt actually have any design to it. It is less engaging than enha shaman.
---
(Ciri has seen better days...)[https://i.imgur.com/24GivPq.png]
---
I am feeling the same, I think I’ll go rogue on a PVP server
---
This is incorrect,it does stack with dire bear. But it's not necessary at all for dungeon tanking or raid offtanking.
---
Yet another thread about this? Every single day
---
...and it was a bad decision.
---
I wish I could downvote you more than once. My guild, among many others, gave the hand to an enhancement shaman in vanilla.
---
You're not min-maxing since you're NElf instead of human, so you could go for 2hand fury instead of dualwield and be good dps still. You'll only need 8% hit in that case, and should already be close if all you're looking for is legs.
---
Cata was amazing for pallies. The class started to become alive. They were also the best healers in that expansion :P
---
Ok I'm new to this game and have to ask. 
---
Why is it that every guild recruitment I see, on every server, horde or Alliance, all guilds raid from 8-12pm~ on Tuesday's and Thursdays?
---
Is that the way it's always been? Everyone in every guild always raids at the same time?
---
Legashi Rogues in Felwood drop it rarely.
---
Depends on what it is. If IRL, here in Norway at least, you have a legal duty to report things if you know about them. If you know and do not warn about it, you may in some cases be centenced for it. This goes for The Netherlands as well if i am not mistaken and i believe more european countries have that kind of law.  Just like you are allowed and often even expected to break the law to save a life.
---
It’s not a great one. You’ve got to remember Stuff like that sells very slowly. Not to mention the main market for it isn’t looking to buy yet, when bgs launch it will get you a return I’d say. But until then it won’t loose value I don’t thing. 
---
Boe epics, I like in the modern game are not a quick flip item, unless you get them way below market value.
---
Which add-on?
---
An epic boe dropped I greeded it without even thinking. The war wanted to greed aswell even though it was an upgrade for him because he felt bad needing it, told him to need it. Those people needing shit for gold and trying to explain themselves are assholes.
---
Isn't bear form still better until about 24? When you get rake.
---
Rets werent even viable in BC..
---
Ok hotshot you explain why these nameless anecdotal private servers are apparently better than live servers.
---
Neck and shoulders as well
---
24 days played....
---
A lot of shawty spelling going around as well.
---
Gold can be spent on literally anything! There is no requirement that he use the money for an upgraded item. He could buy a new mount of another color, or send it to an alt, or whatever. That's absurd logic and only serves to legitimize selfish behavior.
---
This is surprising
---
Yeah, I swapped from warrior to paladin and the time I’ve shaved off of corpse runs alone has made the switch well worth it.
---
Hmmm, I want to say priest leveling picks up as soon as you get a wand (which for me was later than usual, probably around 10). The very early levels are definitely rough before that. But a good wand and a chunk of spirit means no downtime unless a pull goes awry.
---
On firemaw EU that pattern went for 57g last week and has been going down since. The priest one is sub 20g already.
---
For a moment I thought they were all Deathcharger’s reins
---
Report it to blizzard customer service instead of bringing your guild drama into reddit.
---
Completely false. 
---
Additionally, the person mentions World of Ming as a pro rogue. He was only famous for having a PVP blog in classic then some in BC, and people assumed he was some elite PVPer.
---
When arenas came out, he couldnt get about 1700 rating and was exposed as being a total scrub.
---
Didnt know this was a sub thank you!
---
Join an mc attune lava skip group
---
Ah the heirloom cloth set. Because everyone think if they can put it on they should. EVEN TANK!
---
In that case I'd personally do horizontally above my the action bars. I like to keep my mouse mid screen, so I like things being close to mid if I need to throw an "oh shit" heal.
---
&lt;Morgan Freeman voice&gt;
---
The only max level node is black lotus and that's a rare flower (1 per high level zone per hour, best to just look up a video. There are good ones made on classic wow already) rich thorium is like 275 I wanna say so not quite maxed. 
---
Just google herbalism/mining requirements vanilla or something and you'll get links that shows at what level you can pick that specific ore or herb and the best spot to skill up.
---
I can relate to having to reroll, but for other reasons. I rerolled from 42 and am back to 41 playing exactly the same class. I have to admit somewhere in the 30s I almost gave up, but I pushed through and am back on track. Even if it cost me a bit more than a extra week to get back here while feeling left behind as my guild is starting their raids.  
---
I guess I would advice against rerolling, even if its clearly doable. In regards to it being a pvp server? Well, thats how it is. And wont ever change until you are 60 and your fights are almost equal, except for the times you get ganked by 4 enemies while you are alone, reminding you of the times you got smashed without a chance to do anything.  
---
Its your decision.

Dogo: "Pull more mobs at once and you'll level faster."
---
He's a huge piece of shit, but you can get into a lot of trouble for "witch hunting" threads, I'd either edit the post to censor out names or delete the thread all together, rule number 3
---
"No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light."
---
Ive seen that guild-name! Noggenfogger right? :)
---
Is it deserved/fair: no
---
Would a raidleader boot someone who wasnt able to join the first raid when there are other players who are able to join all future raids: yes
---
Can you give me some counter arguments. Maybe as to how rogues can only kill anything once every 5 or 10mins because they need all CDs. Others were telling me rogues can handle most pvp situations if played right? True or false? What about the rest of the quote.
---
Wondering that too
---
Might be a kazoo
---
Isn't Grizzly on Stalagg? If you're looking for top-tier PvP competition you'd be hard pressed to find better.
---
&gt; A) How can you assume my spec/gear
---
They can't, which is why they're asking if you want to.
---
&gt; B) Why not just use the LFG its less spammy
---
It's easier to whisper people you're interested in having tank or heal for you.
---
Sometimes your opponent does something so fucking epic that you only can stare at them in awe and compliment them.
---
I'd say it's a very good upgrade, 10 more DPS, and weapon speed doesn't matter too much for tanks.
---
The main downside is the weapon skill for fist weapons isn't commonly used, so it's probably 1.
---
Back when I raided in vanilla, we had a guild website with class requirements and raid composition, where everyone could sign up, then the guild leaders would form the raid accordingly with gear, talents and attendance in mind. Also, if you are not happy with how your guild is treating you, leave, form your own raiding group or join another.
---
I am a rogue, now give me that [assassin's blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1935/assassins-blade). I totally won't sell it. I promise. Pinky swear.
---
Yeah, I dual boxed my two characters (priest, mage) starting from launch day. They hit 60 today with 17 days /played.
---
I probably could have leveled them separately in less time and with less effort, but it was a fun challenge. I'm not convinced that there is any real advantage to dual boxing because, yeah, controlling two characters at once is really difficult, and you're losing a lot of efficiency. I couldn't use blink for traveling because the priest would fall behind. I couldn't use teleport because I couldn't bring the priest with me. The priest's main advantage is that he doesn't need to stop to drink, except now he needs to stop and wait for the mage to drink.
---
Yeah, being able to shield and heal a mage is OP, but that mage is also standing there getting hit like a dork while you're focused on getting the priest to heal. Then the mage blinks away and starts frostbolting, and now the priest is standing there like a dork. I'm sure a lot of people saw me questing and thought that "we" were just exceptionally terrible players.
---
Its awesome when the opposite faction help out!Can’t help to notice your ammo pouch, you must be gunning a lot! I would think you’d get more value out of a regular bag that can carry other items. Given that you could carry one stack of 200x bullets at a time and doesn’t require a ammo bag.
---
Rag was killed week 1. This really isn't an achievement anymore.
---
I love your last two sentences. 
---
 I’m lvl 37 and even the anticipation of getting mount at 40 is oddly enjoyable.  The feeling of steadily working towards and earning this goal is indeed an element I had missed in latest xpacs  in retail.  Hadn’t played in a couple years but is great to be back.
---
I love you both
---
How my raids (not on classic yet) work: 
---
Raid team accepts that you have life and can miss a raid. You should accept that there's limited amount of spots in raidgroup so sometimes you get benched. 
---
And having an emergency right before your first raid makes terrible first impression. If you want to stay in group, communicate with raid leader about next raid.
---
His argument is exactly that...
---
The problem with this is that you're missing out on the non-LFG channel requests. Even on low/med-pop Felstriker I get a few whispers every time I'm on. Even when I decline, I still confirm that I *am specced* for tanking just for future reference (people assume anyway because my char name implies Feral). I think a few people have added me to their friend list because they'll message me shortly after I've logged on.
---
If you've played retail recently, you know it's at least better. In retail if you get more than 12 people involved in a PvP fight it lags like fucking crazy.
---
You are going places
---
Hopefully op sees this and doesn’t cry about flawed logic and needing on bop’s lol. 
---
Always need on BoE’s simple
---
It’s better than whispers I am getting that just say “LF TANK AND HEALS” they must be from an addon that just spams classes
---
So true xd
---
You seem to be confusing being mad with curiosity. It was a question. Are you dumb ? Feeling the need to defend yourself ?
---
Loving playing a shaman as well, they are a great class. But keep in mind that endgame pve you will almost certainly be healing, as enhancement and elemental shamans are not that sought after.
---
Lol had no idea this was a thing until yesterday. Got my Gnome absolutely wasted, went on the mast and started /yelling and doing /spit on all horde that walked under. A level 60 came up and ganked the shit out of me much to my surprise.
---
Nocharles the gm of Archaic is a shared account by multiple people.
---
This must be the correct answer, because everytime I see it given to a Shaman, Warrior, or Paladin I hear "LOL can't believe you gave Sulfuras to X"
---
Yeah. More for training but free mount.
---
I hit 10 million gold in WotLK, making one easily one of the richest players in the world on WoW at that time. I accomplished this without Multiboxing. I don't need multiboxing for an advantage, nor have I ever needed it for an advantage. I do it because its fun, and more so because its far more challenging.
---
Hey, you do you though. Obviously people only do anything so they can get one up and over their counterparts, because obviously nothing in life is about enjoyment, its about sticking it to your peers.
---
Given how many people have epic mounts already I think you might be surprised
---
Not what I asked for
---
int to help with shape shifting/self healing while soloing.
---
If BoPs vendored for as much as BoEs AH, do you think people would need on them like they need on BoEs?
---
A little late to the party.
---
Im leveling a warrior(main). He is hard is you dont upgrade gear as you level and also im burnout leveling cooking, fishing, first aid and engineering. 
---
Im going to make a hunter to make money and to fund my warrior, is this a good strategy? How do you make money with the hunter? What profs to choose?
---
It's because of their bubbles, you bubble the "puller" [lock, hunter, or 4th mage] before they agrro anything. This way the healer gets no threat and the puller has a bubble to increase the amount they can pull before needing to be healed. If the first heal comes out before the mages begin blizzards/nova all the mobs will agrro to the healer and it gets messy. 
---
Additionally if you are using a warlocks Eye of Kilrogg to pull, by default the eye has 1hp, so the bubble allows it to take a hit and keep agrroing more.
---
&gt;As a feral kitty druid
---
oof
---
druids are mostly tank or heal in endgame, nobody would expect a kutty feral so the chance to ask is 50/50. you play a spec that is not good in endgame so dont expect people to think you are a kitty
---
Even back in vanilla it was like this, tho without the fucking streamers.
---
I raided and got my arena shoulders as Ret, so I’m not sure how you got that idea.
---
Whats wrong with ppl asking u to tank if u were a good tank for them before? I have the same and i love these pms when i get online. Ofc gonna have to dissapoint alot of ppl when i go resto. Did u ever try /dnd ?
---
What about it?
---
Fist weapons use Unarmed skill.
---
Interesting... 
---
OP logic - Everyone benefits from winning this item, but I can equip it. If they roll on it they are selfish.
---
My logic - I can equip this BoE but insist others need roll it because then we all have an equal shot at winning. 
---
I'd hate to meet someone like me in game. Sounds like an entitled ass.
---
If you want a BoE that you don’t win then guess what? You can buy it on AH!
---
I never tanked or healed for these people... they were unsolicited
---
Just my experience, dudes. I've never heard of a shaman getting the hand of rag, but I have heard of, and seen, plenty of streamers getting stuff for free so people can be in their streams and try to be "famous". And to me, that's what this looks like. Go a head, keep downvoting me though. I could give a shit about an online popularity contest with Chinese social ranking systems haha. Don't care.
---
People know they just don't care
---
pics or gtfo
---
The hype carried over to a 120 man raid on IF that the server absolutely could not handle before they were even through the front gates. And yet private servers ran those engagements like cake. Sad and confusing to see.
---
So you had a fair chance and lost and now youre crying about it. Yikes.
---
What add-on plays the game of thrones theme song?
---
Because bartender4 has nice feature to set keybind modifier to switch action bars. For exp when I pres and hold  shift it  switches two main action bars and you can see skills which are bind to shift+1,2,3 etc
---
I wouldnt doubt it, there's probably already bots grinding gold, i guarantee people are farming with 5-10 accounts aswell, already heard reports of people doing it with pvp. Real gold farmers/sellers also usually have players ready before launch to start the grind asap so the rich kids can buy all the gold they could ever want right away.
---
Prob found a girlfriend and realized there is a world outside of wow.
---
Gotta love the elitism on this subreddit... I'm gonna play what I want to play... don't like it too bad
---
How do you get to the point where you’re running strat without learning that like 40 levels ago?
---
Exactly. 
---
Just last night i camped a warlock only because he tried buttering up to me with /Smile /wave and other friendly emotes.
---
It's always best to set looting rules in a group. Boe drops from trash are need for everyone, to avoid someone acting like a dick. Boss drops are need/greed according to class and stats.
---
Bullshit, you can't kill 15 soul eaters in an hour!  There are 13 groups trying to farm the 8 spawns!
---
What happens if that procs at the same time as windfury tho :O
---
Looks like tidy plates to me which is now neat plates I believe. For the unit frames
---
Sounds like the more social experience of classic is not for you.
---
Whispering people can be a good way to find a good fit for your group and find people that might not be actively looking for a dungeon.
---
I have accepted direct whispers a few times my self, some led to multiple dungeons with a good group on my travels to 60.
---
Context is pretty irrelevant. Popular BoE blues/purples get needed 100% of the time
---
Just ignore these knobs and play the game
---
Something need doing?
---
You are supposed to keep notes and shit? I just ignore the really shitty players and then forget about them.
---
Seek professional help.
---
This is basically me except replace dog with [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHs57U6.jpg) [little monster](https://i.imgur.com/3Nx0SUj.jpg) &lt;3
---
Can you say what you mean? Because you're trying to lead this somewhere and I'd prefer you just get to the damn point.
---
Doesn't help that I see twice as much Horde on this server than fellow Alliance.
---
/push
---
If you really need it that badly, I'm sure you'll go on the AH and buy one eventually.
---
But you're not, because you don't actually need it. You just want a free blue that you were fortunate enough to have drop in your group.
---
I'm a paladin and LEEEEROOOOYYYYYY JJJJEEEENKIIIIIINNNNNSSSS
---
Please keep us updated on your GM ticket and the resolution.  Thanks!
---
What group addon is that?
---
They all have their own spot?
---
OP has a horde flair as well, Paladin is my main too, can’t have that gear competition
---
So cute! My puppy does that too! :3
---
I don't mind socializing but if I want to find a group I go into LFG or Trade I dont randomly message people unless they are in the same area as me working on a quest
---
on top of what people were saying about wotlk
---
cleave also usually means to attack more then 1 target. generally its a melee term. like you can cleave X number of mobs/players with your Y skill! type thing.
---
aoe are usually magic, aka spells
---
so it became spellcleave.
---
I've had negative feelings about multiboxing ever since I was invited to heal a dungeon with a guild group on Faerlina. One player had a name like \[dog\] and the other had a name like \[bigdog\] and the second character was just "following" the main character throughout the dungeon. Not doing a damn thing. Just soaking the XP/gold.   
---
No one talked, except to all caps yell at me when I asked why one of the people never spoke or did anything, they were actually  AFK at one point. It looked like some sketchy ass shit and ruined the dungeon for me. Probably someone who is just shitty at whatever it is you do to multibox but regardless, it feels like a cheap way to play the game.
---
I just answered you why. Why don't you go fuck yourself? Are you mad because your head can't comprehend two different symbols used in the same way? I won't replay to any more of your comments passive aggressive toxic kid
---
Read a lot of discussion about how those two interact. It seems Windfury hits can't procc Ironfoe, but Ironfoe Hits can procc Windfury or something along those lines.
---
Thanks for the tip. I dont think there is a very big chance I'll do any raids though. My real life doesn't have the time for that unfortunately haha.
---
I appreciate it, but I am far beyond fucked.  I'm not a young person anymore, so it's ok.  I've lived a life.
---
Also the angle was the room sliding down a hill at the time?
---
if you ignore people your kind of like a geek right?
---
Sick man, that is actually the fury warrior dream :o
---
Probably should look into https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves
---
Might be one of those items that becomes bis in very specific situations like yours ^^
---
To be fair (and I'm not justifying what this guy did, because I don't know the story): back in vanilla, the rule was that everyone rolled need on BoE blues+, because they can always be traded to anybody that needs them for stats after the fact. This eliminated ninjas, too, because they couldn't steal anything without a big chance of losing the roll.
---
Lemmings simulator?
---
Theres honestly nothing wrong with wanting to share stories/posts like this or enjoying them, in my opinion. 
---
You and this bollywog guy though, you guys got serious issues that has nothing to do with world of warcraft. I hope you find some love in your life
---
I’ll take your horde earthfury or heartseeker alliance gold
---
FINE! LF Fun Layer, please invite.
---
Your hypothetical situation is completely irrelevant
---
And no, that wouldn't change anything.
---
Commenting for more visibility
---
Indeed, but being best among 50 guys is still quite different than being best among god knows how many warrior tanks, thousands, easily. When every ranking lost (even how close it was), drops points all the same.
---
We have an undead rouge in the party of 3 I usually run with and I completely agree with you.
---
You criticised everything other people said without offering any insight at all into your reasoning or any viable solutions. If not frenzy what build should I be running if I give a shit about damage? Why is 4/5 frenzy with a 2.0 pet deeply, horribly wrong? And in your opinion what would be correct?
---
It definitely got laggy as shit on pservers during giant city raids with hundreds of people
---
Iam on stonespine, you’re not so you can say.
---
Yeah then let them know beforehand you have the capability but to win a roll on a locked chest they must pay you the exact amount it costs to make the key. So if it costs 1.5g to craft have them fork over 2g for them to loot contents of chest and negotiate all of this before any loot has been revealed in chest. I would guess most people would say no thanks but then you would be free to take loot for yourself. That’s the fair way to do it imo
---
Idk why, because blizzard is trying to safe money I guess?

The input lag difference is massive.

Go see a friend or seek some help brother
---
What the shit. People should be upfront about their dungeon plans.
---
I’m just over here at level 49
---
Well he’s back will be deleted.
---
HEY GUYS LOOK MY WIFES BOYFRIEND JUST COMMISSIONED THIS ART PIECE OF ANDUIN
---
Although you are correct you can go to other places to grind mobs but who wants to spend 12 hours killing the same mob to level. Playing alliance on a pvp server is like playing on ultra hard. Every 50+ place is camped by horde and its impossible to quest
---
It worked in vanilla 100%
---
Everybody does, except the multiboxers themselves and blizzard.
---
There haha, I'll downvote myself for you guys. If you care about a number next to your fake internet name, you've got problems.
---
I’ve never had this problem
---
Oh man, the bullshit excuses are the only good sides of this. And he just leaves without one, that's  bullshit.
---
Meanwhile I'm the carebear who mind-control-buffs undead rogues in the hopes that they spare me in the future.
---
Not likely
---
Oh for sure I plan on being holy at 60.
---
If I find I’m getting a good amount of BRS/BRD groups on a regular basis i might think about switching before 60. 
---
This post was purely thinking about combining a specific gold farming method (aoe grinding) with leveling.
---
Under water breathing was not expensive for me. It's worth keeping the potions to use the instant it makes sense to swap from using the vents to underwater breath. Very cool quest. Made 15 gold from that easily. Probably spent a couple hours at least. It was competitive but still a lot of fun. Underwater is a LOT more fun than I remember, these potions made it so, never bothered (alliance side 15 years ago, no shell farm for them that I know of)
---
Warrior and was level 36. I wish I had bandages with me, that was foolish. Cant eat underwater. Burned a few health pots on accidental pulls from patrol trying to sneak the shells away, one pops out of the cage, now you have to swim away from two, stunning your ass. Speed pots are expensive but may be worth having.
---
Just get both. Judgement in the streets, dresses in the raids.
---
80k isnt a goal.  It's you spending a nice portion of your time here.  Its ironic you would EVER tell someone to get a hobby
---
Same can be said about random green drops. Bear/monkey/owl/eagle/tiger affixes sell for a lot, so by that logic should everyone need on them so they can buy other greens that they’d need?
---
36 is pretty easy to get on a pve realm. Maybe 3-4 days RL time. Going to be honest with you, unless you live in dungeons it will only get harder.
---
there is nothing stopping you from forming your own raid team with your own rules.
---
&gt; Can you say what you mean?
---
You are contradicting yourself and being condescending in your 2nd reply.
---
Saying there are many ways to overcome stealth of enemy players first and then pivoting to "you're on a PvP server" makes your second comment an ad-hominem reply towards a constructive argument (that it's **not** easy to detect stealth alone in the open world).
---
All in all, it makes you seem defensive in your replies and by exension weak and insecure in your argumentation.
---
Oh if people like you are offically on this sub instead of /r/wow i guess its safe to say retail is truly dead
---
Thank you for doing this.
---
They look like crabs but talk like people
---
the YELLOW hitcap, this means abilities(including heroic strike), is 9% for 300 weapon skill, 6% for 305 weapon skill, and for PVP the hitcap is 5% no matter what(unless if the players specifically use +defense gear), and weaponskill makes very little difference.
---
You need more + spell power gear
---
Crikey
---
Go troll bait someone else. You will find no more prey here Harpy.
---
Ill bet your learned fixing cars from your dad too... or more specifically that you dont know how to hold the flashlight correctly. 
---
Bonus points, if he asked you to get a tool, saying its "back there" when the garage looks like it was hit by a nuclear bomb.
---
My names are posted here! ;)
---
In all seriousness though, anonymity breeds shitty behavior. Them being able to say things without accountability is why they do it. Especially if these people were on my server. I've had a lot of great and positive experience with players on my server, and many people constantly PM me asking where the Chubby Train is, and what I am currently up to. Far fewer people decide to shit talk and harass me when they realize I can hold them accountable for their actions.
---
Yes sorry Cat Form is at 20! Travel Form at 30!
---
Yes, my weapon skills are only trained every time I try to shapeshift from Cat to Bear then realize I have no mana left lol. Also, at 42 am still using my lv21 Prison Shank because we don't care about the DPS, just the stats. 
---
You know, the shapeshifting playstyle is also what held me back from Druid. I didn't like not being able to see my shiny weapon and all. But and the end of the day I realized it was the only thing that I disliked about it. I play 90% of the time with my brother, a Priest, and there are just countless times in our journey I was thankful I was a Druid. Some situations as a Druid involve you needing to switch forms just to get one spell off then switch back and its ultra-satisfying for me to figure those situations out haha. I'm sure there's a lot more come level cap PvP time!
---
Dont vendor them Larval Acids!
---
Nice could I get your incendius gold if all else fails?
---
Yes it is. You can't make geoups or post in general chat.
---
Gz, very cool on Alliance.
---
Literally 1 guy with the recepie on my serveer
---
haha i dont care but let me just explain myself and make me look like an absolut retard. 
---
dont care tho
---
Same
---
Yep
---
So why is it frowned upon to need on good greens? You can get a few gold depending on the affix and item (rings, necklaces, cloaks especially in the ~30 range) yet nobody needs on those unless they need it.
---
Maybe because of Nostalgia reasons.
---
But MoP was (for me and many more HC players) the best exp ever. And apart from BFA every exp has been better than classic. Classic maybe on par with wod, maybe
---
Join onyxia pugs if you can. Its good fun.
---
Heck, you'll even be able to find mc pugs, I've heard from a bunch of people killing raggy that way.
---
I use mouse to move, and keyboard for spells. I've never used wasd for movement. My fingers are on 1234 instead.
---
Why would they try to raid in those areas anyway? Why would another guild be grouped there?
---
You're sending more than one input with a single physical keystroke, yer botting. 
---
&gt; If you dont multibox 40 accs your missing out. 
---
Yeah, I'm not a piece of shit, so I'll pass.
---
Just roll last.
---
Played prot pally from tbc to current. Rolled warrior because taunt 4head.
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ninja%20looter
---
It sucks if you lost a piece of great designed for your class, but you gotta just blacklist that player. Tell your guild about it and who the person was so they blacklist them as well.
---
You could also make a forum post calling that player out on their shenanigans. Just make sure you can provide undeniable evidence that they Ninja looted (i.e. screen shot of the crime or something similar as well as maybe a whisper of guilt, plus maybe a screen shot of the clear defined loot rules agreed upon).
---
People are going to defend this because they want it to be common practice to do this sort of thing.
---
Just blacklist and conduct a smear campaign. Upside to Classic....
---
0o0 how did you know i wasnt?
---
Maybe he killed himself.
---
Its common people with depression to give away their items before killing themselves. 
---
At least you got gold out of it.
---
BoE's are a big bag of gold that anyone can roll for...
---
I’m sorry that your police are bad enough to make you think it’s a world wide thing, no one deserves that kind of police force
---
I have a quest notification for this guy in my map but no quests when i talk to him. Anyone else?
---
To me orc warlocks are the coolest warlocks. They are the og corrupted race.
---
47 warlock and a 16 warrior… yet the urge to create a hunter is growing daily!
---
This just proves that this whole thread is just a big gold/karma farm. You don't even know the number.
---
No need ! Blizzard have background apps to check for transactions like this. A multiboxer dude in this subreddit got caught out incorrectly by it. He got a ban then got it over turned.
---
Am I wrong in thinking 18str and 1% crit isnt worth 1500g? Price will rapidly drop with time
---
well are you atleast asking in zone chat for help? Generally people will save you 90% of the time, thats kinda the idea of it
---
Stop putting all hunters in the same spot
---
i have a full atx tower so it is only about 8" from the bottom of my desk
---
my cat sits on it to get his butt warmed up from the top exhaust and to watch whatever is moving around on my monitor. he will actually watch me play wow for an hour at a time just moving his head around rapidly if anything is moving.
---
its pretty funny because he is cross eyed as fuck and has his eyeballs 3" away from the monitor.
---
Welcome to PvP
---
Leeroy Jenkins room?
---
Double down, kill mobs for rep like Timbermaw and do both. Then when you have the money to buy the rest do that.
---
I hope you are just trolling and know thats what multiboxing is.
---
I hope you find happiness.
---
This is absolutely amazing, man. I hope you do more for different instances.
---
Nothing is cooler in classic than a enh shaman going ham with wind fury while wielding Sulfuras. i love it
---
Yeah, they didnt fix shit
---
Gold buying is pay to win, multiboxing is far from any scenerio of being pay to win. There is so much work and complexity involved that most people who try just give up after their first month.
---
You're the kind of guy who has a shitty attitude, and wants to believe that people would do something petty like have multiple accounts to downvote you, when in reality, people are just downvoting you because you have a shitty attitude. Weird, right?
---
He did EXACTLY that.
---
Judging by your username, did you play HoN by any chance?
---
Looks like 1v1 he wasnt in combat
---
Get a nanny that can take care of the children at night once a week for some dungeon time! :D
---
Everyone needing is actually protecting from some greed too though.
---
You know, like when someone says “all greed” then hits need?
---
No Mr Boom, I expect you to run!
---
900 crit on leather user yeah wow this weapon owns my fucking krol blade can crit that
---
I’d quit horse to
---
Think how much XP you get from farming the drops!
---
Didn't realize this was a thing but haven't had it happen in prob 50+ runs
---
Good on him. That's the Classic spirit. Sometimes you are the one getting carried, and sometimes you're the one who joined a BRD "Emp Run" only to spend 4 hours in BRD.
---
Were you leveling at the very beginning of the game release tho, on all 3 characters? Obviously there are more BoEs dropping.. because people are doing a shit load more content atm that actually drops loot. Unless you're on a PvP server, no one are not spending their entire day grinding honor or PvP'ing. Meaning everyone is farming dungeons and raids, producing a shitload of BoEs to the AH. And I've never seen a BoE Epic on my leveling of my two characters so far, one being 60 and other 32, so you've been quite lucky there. I've seen two BoE Epics drop in lvl 60 dungeons, but that's it, none while leveling as far as i can recall.
---
I hate all these skip boss speed runs.
---
I usually only do a few dungeons a week, I set myself up so I have like 4-5 hours available to do a few dungeons. As I get to bigger and bigger dungeons Id rather do a whole run through once then run in, kill two bosses and run out to reset.
---
Seriously, it makes perfect sense for a friend to let you have it, but these people just want strangers to essentially hand them gold.
---
If you don't like the idea that you don't always get items you can use, I recall there being a version of the game with 'personal loot' where this won't happen.
---
At least at the servers I played at that wasn't the default ruleset. It was need before greed by default. Everyone needing boe's to sell would be called ninja
---
Because alliance are scum
---
I mean it’s possible but most people probably can’t do it. Aoe mage farming with no compition is extremely strong.
---
This is the second time I see broken tooth referred to (first being OPs post), what IS broken tooth? I'm guessing a rare spawn of something?
---
How do I teach my wolf Furious Howl? I have a worg from RFK, which does not know it by itself. So I tamed another wolf, which has a slower ATK speed, but know furious howl. So why can't I teach my fast wolf the skill? I used to have a boar pet, and when I go to the train pets window, his Charge ability is there (but obviously when I click it, it says my wolf cannot learn this ability)
---
Fucking Blizzard wont let us off ourselves. What is this? Communist Russia where no personal liberty is allowed?!?!
---
for real?! I been playing WoW for how many years and didn't know that
---
&gt;It doesn't
---
Ill just leave this here, so you can think about it. 
---
&gt; You'll very rarely see a party of five doing a random generic quest
---
How often you see 5-man mutiboxers, at the same rate, less or more ?
---
I sure as fuck havent seen other multiboxers than myself outside a major city. EVER.
---
Yeah, they usually respond 2 weeks after you call them about a problem
---
nah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDytJC655c
---
i haven't watched this video in 13 or 14 years but i still remember it
---
Seems to be a common mentality
---
Ah!! thank you so mush.
---
apparently dogs (and cats!) couldn't watch tv or computer screens in the past because their brains process images at a faster rate, so they see flicker up to 80hz, whereas we humans are happy with 60hz images.
---
so now with 120hz, 144hz, 240hz monitors and beyond, cats and dogs finally get to enjoy watching videos
---
Do you not use keybinds?
---
Some of us just dont have the force of luck.
---
In 15 years of playing wow in every different expansion i have yet to recieve a epic world drop. Granted i only played really active in vanilla,tbc,wotlk and cata. And just a month here and there on the others.
---
Think of how many mobbs you can kill in 15 years. And not once get a world drop.
---
I'm a tank and I'm with you brother. If both sides protest then those greedy DPS are going to be SOL!
---
I was horde. Seal of Blood was legit. IIRC, you took passive damage and then got mana back from being healed. I don’t ever recall mana problems. As I said though, you could raid as Ret, and I did.
---
You seem to be a druid so it wouldn't work on you but...
---
whenever I need a tank for something I know they don't need to run, I bribe with Rage potions. I kill tons of beasts as a skinner, so I get half the mats needed just from loot. My brother is alchy and herbing on his war, so i just send him stuff, he takes half i get half back and bribe my tanks for runs through shit I need.
---
Works like a charm.
---
Yeah you can usually need and greens or blues that are an upgrade. Usually I’ll just ask “anyone mind if I need” the first time around and almost everytime there are no objections
---
Definitely. I've been stuck in the 30-40 range with my priest because I don't like STV and Desolace + I'm disc specced. I wanted to be a healer, but there are so many that all I can do is beg the LookingForGroup channel to take me literally anywhere, I dont even care about the loot, I just want to get to 40 so I can quest in Tanaris. 
---
I've also given up on getting my mount money, ever. The most gold I've ever had at one time is 22. I'm level 38 right now.
---
So now I log in, relist my expired auctions, beg people to let me heal them for 30 minutes, give up and play one of my level 10-20  mage or shaman characters instead.
---
Correct
---
I add the real assholes to my friends list &gt;.&gt;
---
I’ve never heard of TOS and EULA either. But my point is that it’s hard to follow rules you don’t know exist. And if you don’t know they exist you’re not likely to try to look them up either.  If I knew what the rules are I’d follow them. It’s not like Blizzard warns you before you join the server that there are any rules that you should follow.
---
John Staats even said they have a snapshot of every vanilla patch, if they wanted to they could recreate a 1.1 to 1.12 patch cycle. Blizzard not having the data is fake news, every big company never deletes anything. They are a publicly traded company and are obligated to make sure all their data is backed up and save.
---
Gave it to the vendor.
---
And yet a ton of people love it. I started playing OSRS again when they released an updated game mode to it and managed to max all skills to 99 mostly while doing other things. It's a great "secondary" game to play while doing other things like watching netflix or playing something like Civ.
---
what do you have to trade
---
Well I mean it's not like I had anything better to do with my life &gt;.&gt;
---
The context really doesn't help your case. Why should this guy that doesn't know you from Adam and doesn't owe you a damned thing just let you have something he could sell. Depending on the item, it could shave a lot of time off his mount grind. But he should just let you have it because you feel entitled to it?
---
This was happening to my group yesterday. We got across the second bridge and groups were being pulled from out a super far distance. Groups that don’t patrol or move; and are at least 50 yards away. We just accepted the bug and whittled them down.
---
Ewwww downvote me more than once ewwwwwwww you're so fuckin cool, dude. I wish I could care about a pixel as much as you do. Get a life.
---
Every enemy multibox i see on retail and classic was doong exactly that. On my current classic there is a horde druid pack that loves to moonfire people
---
I thought we all agreed to go with Lordi -  Hard Rock Hallelujah?
---
I will be a curse upon Skullflame, children will wake from sleeps screaming at the thought of me. My legacy will be death and madness .
---
I understand what you're saying. I just think you're wrong. Obviously everybody in the raid group could play bad/broken specs and still kill everything, because the endgame pve content is super easy (which is a whole different discussion)
---
What i'm saying is, sm/ruin or ds/ruin should NOT be the best spec. The fact that they are is a testament to the bad class design in vanilla. This isn't 'min maxing', this is wishing class design made sense.
---
The whole point of runs is to skip the bosses your group doesn't need. Why waste time doing everything?
---
Its Bind on Equip.. before it is equiped it has the same value to everyone.. like 10g on the AH. Or in some BoE cases 500g. 
---
BoP should always go to the one using it instead of going to those that intent to vendor it.
---
If you both needed and he won the roll, he won the item. Maybe if you really wanted the item you could buy it of him.
---
I’ll put my two up for the list.
---
The Rod drop of yeti’s in Hillsbrad (~170 something kills) 
---
The drop off of steam smith’s in searing courage (~70 kills, but with only 4 possible spawn locations, on a 2-5 minute respawn, heavily camped).
---
Don’t think you know what passive aggressive means
---
There are differences but more global. Things that Classic allowed and what didn't changed the meta. Yet guilds that were hardcore on pservers would and still are hardcore on Classic.
---
Why even bother replying with this?  If you k ow nothing just don't bother commenting.
---
Because the boss drops also good rogue loot?
---
I dig it. Anywhere in particular come to mind?
---
I saw a moonkin while i lvled my druid...Asked him wtf he was doing and he was just bored of feral. Lvling as moonkin is only slightly viable after lvl 40, and requires you to just spam starfire (as it is the only manaviable thing you have).
---
double down. do dungeon runs. you get  ton of runecloth for strat, scholo, brd, and brs. any items you win from greed rolls vendor for a good amount. with luck, you could get 4-5 gold worth of gray items per run too. on top of any boe blue/purple that may drop that you may win.
---
*aaand I need one more gizzard*
---
20 vultures later it finally drops, fuck these quests
---
You seem to care more than anyone else here
---
I get anxiety walking over the Blackrock Mountain chaina because of these posts!
---
Yeah, but why stay on Stalagg or Skeram for the instant queues when you can just transfer to Heartseeker and still have instant queues?
---
Pretty sure transfers are closed now, but that was the idea when folks were mentioning that previously.
---
Well, because of the media it makes it look like cops are going around executing people in public when in 99% of the cases the media presents, the officer was justified in the shooting (but they leave that out ofc because it doesnt generate clicks).
---
Okay? Great! 
---
If that was the only thing to do in this game, you wouldn't play it. And i promise you that is not the only pve content that you actually do.
---
You can do that while having functional classes/specs. I have no clue why people who are all about classic are so resistant to things making sense.
---
Exactly? How do people not see this. Like they would pull 3 mobs at a time if they could so why grief a mage just because he can pull more then you.
---
Rogue or warrior? If a warrior The offhand damage increase due to glancing blow reduction shouldn't be under rated. That's rage.  Also hit on plate is hard to come by so the 3% feels a lot less now than it will if you're having to balance around strength crit heavy pieces later. There will come a point where you don't want to be using something blue with just hit% because you have to be. Dwarf better for pvp though so balance for what matters to you.
---
Lol guess it wasn't just me lmfao
---
Link to podcast? Gotta 3 hour drive home tomorrow and I've been looking for a wow podcast.
---
More specifically boss BoP drops. Someone uploaded a picture of the arena boss in BRD dropping kroll blade. They were in a guild or friends so they let the rogue have it. The savage mail armor dropped and their warrior got that too. The most important thing is to make loot expectations known when partying with random people before anything drops.
---
Have you learnt the howl?
---
Did it pop up in chat when you were using the wolf with the howl that you had learnt it?
---
I saw, made me happy actually. The elitism and refusal to help others that was on the private servers isn't infecting the classic, which is awesome.
---
what? No i understand that getting exp triggers it, it just doesn't state honor does like other things do.
---
FULL INT AND SPELLPOWER!
---
Become what the spelladins cannot!
---
Extra stam actually matters alot as dps warriors pull aggro a ton and it matters for solo leveling, especially since there are alot of piece that are agi focused that most dps wars pick up that sacrifice the other stats. I dont hardly see anyone foregoing Herod's shoulders. Also all SMs are pretty easy to spam and itd easy to get a pair that doedn't cost the tank them. I ran plenty of arms after I had all the drops as tank
---
I'm with ya mate.
---
I went LW just so I could make my hunter the Black Dragonscale armor because I know it's pretty good. I'm not worried about some "BiS" crap.
---
I'm gonna try for as many T0 as I can get and fill in with what I can make. Plus dungeons do give some good loot other than just whatever BiS everyone is frothing at the mouth about.
---
AQ let’s fire take over because the crit rating starts to really ramp and because mobs start having a lot less fire resistance
---
When that happens you label the guy who rolled need as a ninja and talk shit in trade chat, it's the way I've always done it.
---
I know it's all against the #nochanges movement. But this would never be a problem if rolling need would bind the item. Some changes are just usefully. Changemymind
---
Only thing I can say in defense of Feral Dps is support... extremely underrated for max lvl dungeons and raids... I can hibernate beasts and dragonkin and innervate the healers mid combat and don't have to worry about being OOM... I don't see people bashing on Rogues so stop shaming people for playing the spec/class they want to play and let them enjoy the game
---
Tons of difference. Basically u wear one more piece of gear
---
The reason to roll need is to prevent the sale. If you both roll need and then you are inclined to give it to someone that's different. Just protect yourself in groups with people you dont know.  It may be shitty but that's kind of the way it goes with randos.
---
Bear form is always better. Except for cowering from enemies in stealth. Or sprinting. Or both. 
---
I was a Wrath baby so I don't claim to know how it will go in Classic. I've played on private servers and Rake was underwhelming. When leveling I didn't buy it. Apparently [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-leveling-classic-wow) doesn't think you should buy Rake either. But their leveling strategy is to dps cleave groups in bear form (being careful not to take threat from the warrior tank who, *remember*, needs the rage) so who knows? Don't get seduced into cat durid is 4 fite!!!
---
Keep that rational thought away from mah complaints... boxing is cheating OK? /s
---
That's not how economies work. I earned the gold to buy those materials by merchanting and crafting items for players. I didn't need 5 accounts to do it, I needed one. A person with 500 accounts would still not have more money than me if they were farming literally 18 hours a day, every day, since launch.  It's not possible.
---
There is no magic gold switch that multiboxing flips to have gold fall into their lap, there is efficient ways to earn gold, and the only way to be INSANELY rich in MMO based games almost always revolves around running the AH, which again is not something having multiple accounts helps.
---
Exactly. Two hand tanking uses up so much of my mana as a Priest, because the warrior takes too much damage.
---
&gt; The God Mode was always on
---
What's the difference between the beastmaster flag and the invis god flags? There's an error that appears if you try to cast a spell on or duel a GM or sometimes if you attack a mob just as it's spawned: "The spell cannot be cast on beastmaster or invis god targets".
---
idk.  It makes me think some accounts have different RNG seeds somehow that actually alter luck to a degree.  I wish we could know how it all actually works, and get a clear picture of what is happening.
---
The cops in America are there for the same purpose, just because you are brainwashed by the media to think that police officers are executing people in the streets does not mean that they are in fact doing that.

Warrior mainly, but it’s good info for a future Rogue too. Yeah Stoneform is definitely better for PvP, it’s just a balance I’ve been trying to decide for a few days now!
---
Just keep notes on certain players. Doesn't have to be negative, could note a warrior with 'reliable tank' or a mage with 'gives double stacks of waters '
---
0 tier. .5 tier is quest locked! And unavailable until like phase five!

Shield first, then 1h.

“Alt + print screen” is your ally thru the PC world.

Nah, the mana problems were mostly alliance, as horde was basically the only way to retadin :)
---
I’m a level 13 mage. I have 1 gold. My best gear is probably these robes I picked up from a bone snapper thing. Idk what they’re called but they increase intellect and stamina. 
---
No fucking clue what professions are or how they work. All I know at this point is: accept quest, kill, collect, return quest, repeat. Some times group up with other players which is a blast.
---
Holy he'll! I thought they intentionally just stood side by side and talked just to act like they didn't know each other or something.
---
Private Server theory crafting is just as good as the server itself.
---
There were _some_ major differences, though. For example, on many popular live servers you could trigger on-crit effect (like fury warriors enrage) by sitting down in-fight. While you still get crittet all the time when sitting the effects don't trigger on classic. 
---
Also, iirc, the misinformation about 8% hitcap came from private servers, too
---
More like 2-3, right?

Note to self: Do not bring Twuggy along for Scholomance.

OOOHHH that's why the internet is filled with posts like "Where do you guys go to multibox farm" "mount farming is much easier with multiboxing" and "how to multibox farm" 
---
It's because of how inefficient it is. I see.
---
55 with 126g but I play the AH a lot and maxed alchemy so that amount can fluctuate. At 37 I had up to 206g. I’ve got a lot of assets I’m saving for a later sale and I’ve also got blue weapons already stocked for my hunter alt
---
Makes most sense to do it around 22-23, so you can knock it out while doing other quests in the area.
---
You’re wrong here. This is a common misconception. When you’re smoking 12 joints/bong hits/ or whatever a day, which many people can slide into, it does become a problem and can wreck your mental stability and affect your life. Just because you don’t understand, don’t knock an entire subreddit of people who are suffering and trying to quit something they see as a detriment to their lives. I smoked for 15 years, when I smoke it snow balls into an obsessive habit and I become filled with malaise and start looking at the world through much darker glasses. Call me weak minded, say I’m pathetic or whatever, but this is a very very real thing for me, and I have to stay away from it. 
---
Quitting was incredibly difficult, I have sweats, an inability to control my emotions, and it lasts for over a month. I’m weed free now and I feel significantly better.
---
And here I'm sitting with two lvl 17s
---
&gt;don't know why but mages seem really high strung.
---
Try to roll as a pally on any loots and peps are gonna get mad lol
---
Yeah in my experience it was "If you roll need on a BoE you aren't going to use get fucking booted". There are two particular posters in this thread posting in every sub-thread I've opened. Really seems like they are trying really hard to normalize the "everyone should just be greedy" mindset.
---
That gold would be stained with blood.
---
I just don't get how would he be an MT with limited playtime and behind gearlevel since his guild already doin' MC.
---
Imagine caring
---
Mate. Dreamstate and Apes going at it was enough to just lag out everyone around burning steppes for minutes at a time. I know cause i was there, something does need to be done. On pservers it was never even near this bad (the ones i played at least)
---
Unless your guild absolutely loves you all the spell damage gear in raids is gonna go to warlocks first. Shadow Priests are usually one the last classes to get geared. 
---
As far as gear lists go, it will look pretty similar to a [pre-bis list for pve.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tqJdHFSc0WQR_J2zyVSA29kppCd5dWdv6iv2c88yUo/edit#gid=1778055920) You can use wowhead to filter items for stam and shadow damage. Engineering is also a must since you don't really have good mobility.
---
When did they say that?
---
For sure.
---
Im planning on tracking my roll results over 100 rolls just to get some facts to my claims.
---
Pvp servers are for people with tons of time to waste, who rush to 60.
---
Drooling 12 year old donate cuck discovered.
---
Just get Nat Pagle's Extreme Angler FC-5000. And if you're Alliance: Just reroll Horde :-D
---
tbh, you can just say, before starting, I need boss " X", are we doing boss "X" ? Otherwise its pointless for me to go.
---
9/10 times in my experience people say "sure" and you take a little detour for that boss.
---
is that a gun in your relic slot?
---
By asking you to explain your thinking I demonstrate a shallow understanding? Off to a good start I guess. I may not be on any highlight reels but I can almost guarantee you I’ve played more high end hunter than you, I appreciate your opinion but yeah, you’ve got a lot of attitude for someone with a basic understanding of the class.
---
No, I would be annoyed with myself when I try to understand why we keep full clearing a dungeon with all its optional bosses, when we dont need anything from those optional ones.
---
In a setting where you run it with your friends, full clearing it once for quests or whatever and then just run it for gear seems like the way to go.
---
Exactly, need is for upgrades only. If you need a boe to sell it you're watching way too much asmongold and have turned into greedy assholes trying to justify your greed as a set of rules that weren't like that in vanilla. Greed is there for a reason morons.
---
I’m willing to greed if it’s a blue BoE, but if it’s a purple, I’m smashing that need button. You can get another upgrade that isn’t worth half my mount cost.
---
I think the problem is pulling. I've never played paladin, but I've heard that paladin has almost zero ranged ability until they got one in TBC in the protection spec for tanking.
---
skinning/mining, just like every other class while leveling.  Hunter is a strong money maker but until you hit 60 you are going to be eating a lot of your profits in ammo or literally feeding it to a pet.  There are work-arounds to minimize the costs but if you want an obscenely good farmer I'd look more at druid, personally.  You can still solo princess runs and you'll spend a lot more on your spells as you level, but you at most wear leather which is significantly less to repair and you can herb/skin without shifting out of forms.   Also you can take advantage of under-exploited farming areas with swim form.
---
Goldshire was also supposed to be massive and they did away with it because they didn't want to give the Alliance too much stuff.
---
you and all other mages disgust me.
---
You can gauge someone’s IQ by the server they choose to play on. A PvE RP server....? Yeeeaaahh.... lets just say you’re most likely not the sharpest tool in the shed with a bit of a naive perception of reality.
---
still a person giving real time instructions to the program so while a 3rd party program, odd they let that slide under the EULA, its not a bot, which is a program that interacts with the game an a much much more complex way
---
You can not just include things you do not like as part of botting.
---
Found Skeram.
---
I never understood how that works. The Warrior needs rage, but the bear doesn’t? A bear without aggro can use one skill every 10 seconds or so
---
 I always knew that only kindest people play warlocks. There is always a puppy lover behind all that demonic appearance.
---
Wot? It's virtual currency, what are you talking about?
---
Was this your attempt at being poetic?
---
That's great if that's the system you'd like to use, make sure when you party with people you don't know you let them know prior to any looting. 
---
I let people know to need roll on BoE blue/purples prior to looting. To each there own. BoE's are equivalent to a bag of gold dropping that is worth that same amount of gold to all party members.
---
How deep is too deep though? I imagine that is too deep.
---
nope
---
Same we had a wipe at thw ogre boss cuz mobs pulled from basically across the room
---
Last year I bought BFA and a sub because I was hyped for it. I made a caracter and during leveling I did strat. It dropped for me on my first strat, I was like "neat, a new mount" and then it struck me. Never did a good roll after that for 6months

You must tame an animal that already knows this skill.   You can find which animals have which skills on petopia [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)  or by using the skill that tells you everything about an animal.  Hunters get it at level 30 or so.
---
To learn furious howl you are looking for a wolf in ashenvale lv 22 or 23 from memory, there are others but that will be your easiest target.
---
Keep in mind this applies to other skills such as bite, claw, cower and dash.  Also don't forget that you will need to learn the next rank of these skills by taming a higher level animal.
---
Because of this, until you have learnt every pet skill in the game you need to keep a pet slot free for taming new pets, meaning the max you can have is 2 if you purchase both stable slots.
---
I like being nice to people even outside of my friend group, weird I know.
---
&gt;If you don't like the idea that you don't always get items you can use, I recall there being a version of the game with 'personal loot' where this won't happen.
---
Dont give me that shit, youre the one arguing for rolling on items others want to use.
---
Guy is a litteral blizzcon champion, what do you mean boosted? He could join ANY raiding/pvp guild and hold his own. If someone as skilled as him wouldn't be given hand of rag AND DESERVED IT. Then show me the guy who would be deserving of it.
---
I’ll try to do so if I take any time off from questing/leveling.  
---
PS thank you for a response without 18 goddamn acronyms in it.

There must be a way to code it with lua in WA. I made a simple but good WA for my feral powershift to know how many times I can go in and out cat form before I run out of mana. I am telling you this because I based my code on couple of sites that have  every parameters that exist in the game so if you or anyone you know is good with code try to google abit and make your own.
---
Before doing so I'd suggest you to look at www.wago.io maybe someone already made what you are looking for

This really sets us back.."

I feel like Alliance players just have more quests in Eastern Kingdoms whereas Horde Players have more in Kalimdor. Aside from Hillsbrad and Arathi I haven't quested at all in Eastern Kingdoms up until level 50. Where I did Searing Gorge, etc.
---
Or wait, I also did Stranglethorn. But Kalimdor had a ton of Quests as well. Thousand Needles, Barrens, Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountain, Tanaris, Feralas, Desolace
---
Thanks. Tried that but doesn't change it.

Before the market started to stabilize I actually made some decent cheddar selling stranglekelp. Now I can't give the shit away.

Nahh man, you are a gnome mage. This is expected off of you.

None of the DPS pets can tank up to 4 mobs of the same level, even for a full BM hunter... Only one of the tank pets would be able to do that.
---
DPS warrior would be fucking pathetic if it couldn't use leather. Missing so much hit.
---
shut the fuck up normie, you intentionally misrepresent the whole point
---
next time go for Brewfest song on a tuba/sousaphone

I took a picture of playing WoW on a camel. I sent the photo to the blizzdev team, and it was really nice they sent me an audio file of them back laughing their asses off at it.
---
They are people, and really good ones in my personal experience. I stopped playing WoW because I guess I just kinda changed, but one of the fondest memories I have of the game is that interaction with their support team, and I think that says something.
---
What? Cat has much more DPS than Bear at any level beyond 30. You get Ravage and Pounce and Rake, Rip is good for longer fights and Ferocius Bite for shorter fights or to finish the enemy off. As Cat you also get more crits, since your attack speed is 1.00 unlike in bear where it's 2.50. So you hit more and get more crits.
---
Rake is a really good ability because it bleeds the opponent and goes through armor.
---
I understanding for the spellcleaving thing, but even with Swipe it deals way less damage. In my opinion it'd be better to do dungeons as a healer. But what do I know?
---
Glad to hear it's not just me, seems to be the only spot giving me problems though. Looks like I'll have to pull the whole room before the Orge boss.
---
Dont use w to move, use the mouse and bind w to something more useful.
---
nah bro you gotta read the situation just because most people who make posts like these are full of shit doesn't mean all of them are.  This dude comes off as very sincere and his story is a believable one.
---
What in the actual fuck is wrong with you? Just leave the post if you're gonna be an ass like this.
---
He wanted a raiding guild with big claims, I think I can hold that against him...
---
i think its pretty critical to know if he's taking it lying down or actually calling for help. 9 times out of 10 you can get a lvl 60 of your own faction to save you
---
I am horde, and I just learned of this particular fishing pole. Buuut at least I made a bunch of gold.
---
Yeah and that can never ever change.
---
but you only have a 33.3 recurring percent chance of being successful.
---
I agree with you but in a different context that shit is fucking funny as all hell
---
I do every time. And its either a hard no, or even worse, we get there and they just keep running.
---
I mean jokerd hit 60 3 days 20 hours and 40 min after servers opened. He didn’t play it straight so yeah about 3 days played is the absolute fastest you can do it.
---
That has nothing to do with spell batching. You are talking out of your ass.
---
By that logic one shouldnt invite people who follow the same religion as the biggest terrorist groups into your country either
---
The detail on this is so great. It reminds me of an old Grind House movie poster.
---
No pets were harmed in this post, also we take care of runners. I wouldn't be posting if that was the case. It seem the farm east mob right before you get to the orges has a weird aggro table and just aggro for afar its quite off. Fortunately that seems to be the only spot.
---
Reckoning is a disaster when tanking bosses. If youre crit, you get double hit, boss double parry (because 15% parry chance) and club you 3 times in the face and you die. Reckoning is a DPS talent THAT SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN WHEN ACTUALLY TANKING.
---
I can’t believe people conclude self harm over quitting the game...
---
The man, myth AND legend
---
I second this.  blizzard does a lot of "permanent" bans that are just them fucking up/a compromised account that they end up reversing.
---
If everything you've said is true you'll get unbanned if you keep harassing them with the kind of professional calmness displayed in the OP.
---
I understand that's an assumption you were making. But I honestly was logged into a PC Cafe in South Korea for 3 hours, and got a ban email 40 minutes later. I was grinding in Azshara during those 3 hours. I obviously can't prove it to you but I would take my lumps if I was actually botting and got caught.
---
You can try blademaster leggings from the beast. Literally a shittier version of devilsaur leggings
---
For me, the first 30 levels as warrior were insanely miserable and I got shit on all the time. Many times I barely survived a 1v1 mob of my level like a fucking plainstrider. But near SM, it gets way easier. I mainly dungeon spammed from 30 to 40 with sm, and then rfd a few times. Arm and cath and rfd get you super kitted. Uldaman and zf help a ton too. Basically just run a bunch of dungeons, exp is better, money seems better, you get better at tanking. Shit has been so fun for me lately. Im about to ding 53, and ill be running the black rock dungeons soon to keep on going
---
I assume posters for this are on sale somewhere? If not, they should be
---
Me big dumb, you save me big sadness.
---
This is laughably incorrect.  You are looking at it the wrong way.  Sure you aren't going to blow people up as a druid but people *cannot get away from you*.
---
The classic pvp build was HotW (~0/30/21) and you can basically just chase people forever putting moonfire/bees on people and then fucking booking it when they want to turn around and try to fight.  Pretty much nothing but hunter even stands a chance at all and against them you can just bear it up and beat them to death in melee.  
---
This of course assumes decent gear at 60 but you can do basically the same thing at any level and you can still heal, stealth, bear charge, stun, root, and FFF as early as 30.  If you end up in a BG without enough healers, well now you are the best skirmish healer in the game with just a gear change.
---
That said, druid has severe drawbacks for all that movement, skirmish, and harassment power but a good player that knows how to lean on the toolkit can do amazing things.  Sure you might not ever make *unbreakable.avi druid edition* but that's not why you play druid anyway.
---
Is your life so pitiful that you decided that its a good course of action to insult someone's intellect based on the freaking server they chose to play on? 
---
This is the stupidest thing I read all week haha
---
They are grey level and you didn't kill one of them.
---
I know the feeling, levelled to 30 on a server before a huge influx of players made the queues unbearable, swapped to a lower pop one and tried levelling a different class (since I was thinking about doing it anyway). Got to lvl 25 on the 2nd class before deciding it wasn't for me and deleted it to start a new character. Currently level 12 despite having played for nearly a month.
---
Tbf the Voidwalker both did decent damage and held aggro fairly well (with 3/3 imp. Voidwalker) on both of the pservs I played on.
---
I think cleave groups *want* bears to tank.
---
I'm convinced that anyone who actually thinks a 5x multiboxer is better than 5 individual people is someone who hasn't actually fought a multiboxer before. I saw them alllllllll the time in MoP and occasionally throughout previous expansions.
---
The best I've seen on classic so far is a warlock because even if you can shut him down and kill him, he will still kill you with DoTs and it's so hilarious.
---
Gold is gold, right? Every bit of it helps! :)
---
Is this the part where I come in saying I got the Steamsmith thing on my second kill
---
The timing seems to suggest it wasn't that though. I'm guessing warden picked up on something running on the PC Cafe's computer, as the ban was legit 40 minutes after my 3 hour session at the PC Cafe.
---
as I have said all along
---
99% of all GM's are useless and most of them dont even play the game, treat them as inbred retards because thats what they are :D
---
I am truly amazed that you got unbanned, thats not easy as.. well, most of them are retarded :D
---
Thoughts? Complete shitpost ;)
---
As a Tank myself I am appalled that another Tank would refuse that service. Being as they are life lines to the party, I dont mind doing anything for my group. Especially in endgame content like BRS. Some of use are good boys I promise
---
It really shouldn't cause in the other scenario what's the point of the greed button. Unless previously stated by the group leader that boes are all need, that should not be the default rolling method.
---
Dude how do you know all this?
---
Damn we really can't enjoy anything anymore these days.

The amount of negative or salty comments in a thread that is supposed to be about celebrating someone getting one of the most iconic legendary items in the game...

see esfand and clearing MC twice in a week :D

---
It depends on how you look at bis lists tbh, I've looked at four or five different ones for warriors to figure out the 1h/2h options, viable trinkets beyond hoj and what I can sub in for certain slots,  some of them are incredibly informative (even twink lists when I was around that level)
---
Like I've played the game since wotlk and wouldn't have known about the hinterlands trinket without a list, or the Mara trinket
---
I think some people probably are taking optimization a little far (reserving pieces in lfg comes to mind) but overall they've helped me a lot
---
Go to Org and kill like 50/70 boars to get it started. Then there is clam chowder which easy to get from killing turtles or buying it, or shells from coastal drops. Its really not hard, and soon you can farm raptors in arathi and use raptor eggs for omelettes and the raptor flesh for cooked raptor. That shit basically takes you all the way to 200. My cooking is about 275 now, and thats what I have done.
---
Best part is that when the desired item finally drops it's going to get needed by your hunter because he needs that staff with spirit.
---
Didn’t even need your servants to cook or clean for you.
---
&gt;BIS lists for blue gear stem from a cancerous mindset and are contrary to the spirit of Classic.
---
What does that even mean? Are we just pretending that we didn't strive to be the best we could be back then? People wore bad gear back then because they didn't know any better. We know better. If we knew what the best gear was back then, you bet your ass people would be farming bis gear over the sets. 
---
I would argue that using gear that you know is suboptimal goes against classic spirit (and mmo spirit in general) more than bis lists do.
---
There are people out there like you, and there are people like me who drink 20 Noggenfogger Elixirs with the intention of getting slowfall, and don't get it a single time.
---
you sound like a typical horde 12-year old undead rogue player, no surprises in this post tbh
---
You did the right thing and I completely agree with you OP.
---
May I mambo dogface to the banana patch?
---
&gt; It’s each keystroke provides as many actions as you have accounts.
---
Its like, its the same as everyone else, go figure.
---
Exactly, most of these issues wouldn't happen if people knew beforehand what kind of group they were getting into.
---
To be fair, the raid he had in classic and the number of people on both sides got so much larger than anything BFA. BFA starts having issues at about 3-4 raids worth of people in one zone, and Classic seems to be able to handle much more than that.
---
Don´t argue with them. I think in this part of conversation it´s just trolling. Every normal, polite person knows that GREED = I want to sell it (it´s the word GREED by itself ffs :D) and NEED = I need the item because I want to use it.
---
That´s how it normally goes in 95% of groups without ninjas twisted logic.
---
^
---
There's a reason why most GM's are really fucking dumb.
---
This is like when old people try to be funny about video games and still mention Atari. Trying too hard to impress technologically-impaired imbeciles that should still be wearing velcro shoes.

Just FYI: BiS lists are specific to certain contexts. A pure damage BiS isn't the same as a world PVP BiS. *shrug*

Because virtual gold and internet points mean dogshit. They literally are worth zero. They aren't as important as friends and the relationships you have with them and someone's wellbeing. I am sorry if life has made you cynical to that truth.

Oh hey, let me prep for a tournament by getting an item that the majority of participants won't be able to afford. 
---
Any tournament hosted by or participated by streamers is heavily favored towards said streamers due to the volume of gold and gear vomited into them by sycophantic fans.
---
Someone is selling 5 on the AH for 1.5g... If it were that rare i assume they would sell it for more.
---
If you havent yet, stop by blasted lands for a set of 5 quests you can do all at the same time.  Ungoro is available for questing too.
---
Since the NPC in question speaks english they also speak english in the Japanese audio.
---
On another note if you want more thrown weapons go to undercity. They are sold next to the poisons.
---
Done with Ungoro and Searing Gorge?

I don't believe you. They must have done something that Blizzard couldn't do if it is true. Something like the connection to the server not being as secure or something.
---
&gt; I'm not slow, I'm just wondering why you would ever consider 1 player controlling 1 character and 1 player controlling 5 characters an equitable comparison.

I don't... I'm saying 1 person shouldn't be able to control 5 characters...
---
&gt;Yeah, the guy with 5 characters is going to win. But 5 people playing 1 character each are also going to win. It makes no difference.

but you need 5 humans to play the game for that vs multiboxing whih is one person gaining an unfair advantage

yeah but all of that is stuff you are typically worried about if you are in combat. You cannot mount in combat so why would a global, shadow lockout, or mana matter?  in some rare extremely specific situations where you dont even have 100 mana to spare and no life left, maybe, but that's so incredibly niche and certainly not a reason to not get the mount.

Any full runs are advertised as such, and you'd have to be a fucking idiot to join a group assuming it's one or the other. Which brings us back to the comment you tried to nitpick:
---
&gt; Its best to clarify what youre running before you run. 
---
In what universe does more than this need to be said?

People tend to farm those mobs for runecloth/felcloth. The patterns are basically inventory filler for clothies.

420g will be less but you'll already get good amount of cloth while farming argent dawn and timber rep.

The healer said go.
---
Let me guess please!!
---
Undead male Rogue, Troll female Mage, Tauren male Warrior, Undead female Priest and Orc male Hunter? Ammirite?
---
Because honestly, who subs/donates because of/during a VOD?
---
They have no reason to improve it
---
Found the Reddit employee in the thread
---
Virtual currency will long outlast your friend, it looks like it clearly did. Lmfao.
---
&gt;equal worth to each member of the party.
---
Patently false.  Unless you're arguing 2 handed sword with Str. is as useful to a Mage as to a Warrior.  
---
How many of the 2 handed swords currently for sale on the AH get bought by Mages?  Exactly.  Very close to 0.
---
Regardless of any other part of your argument this portion is incorrect by a wide margin.
---
The story is some guy told me to stay in Stormwind for a bit and I'll get a huge damage buff that will let me one hit mobs. I'm new to WoW and I've never played retail and just started leveling as a human rogue on lvl 7. Now I don't feel like playing this anymore...
---
Hes a good boy. He will grind gold for you soon.
---
no changes
---
now go back to retail my friend
---
Anyone hear him bitching about his gear a few days back? Couldn’t decide between Ele or Enh. Guess that’ll stop now.
---
I got two inside of ten minutes after farming for half an hour.
---
The BiS "Pre-Raid" guide on wowhead for rogues is incorrect. 6pc shadowcraft is much better if you arent going to be raiding for a while. 
---
The only reason the 2pc devilsaur set is recommended is because you'll likely break that 6pc set bonus quickly once you start raiding.
---
Hey man, if it's an upgrade it's an upgrade. Why would you skip it then?
---
These guys need a Classic Nice^(TM)  server that they can all group on and just share and care with each other and leave the rest of us who play properly alone. Like RPers, just push them all onto their own servers so normal people don't have to listen to their fucking garbage.
---
I can't imagine it's even a drop in the bucket. I've seen 2 multiboxers so far and I'm on an extremely populated server.
---
It's weird people get so up in arms over this. This is definitely annoying to die to but it's SO rare and has zero impact on really anything.
---
Well exactly, so seems a little daft to claim it's a 'retail' mentaility. We would have done this in 2005 if the talents allowed it.
---
Octarine
---
Is this subreddit simulator?
---
When I first started playing, my friends would get mad at me because they'd tell me to roll on stuff and I'd need it because in my head, the logo for need was dice, so obviously that's what I should click if I'm rolling.
---
Hello, yes! [\[Society6\]](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker)
---
as someone learning the game what does it mean for a mage to know how to use blizz and nova?
---
This looks wid on mobile haha
---
&gt;Alterac Valley was still relevant and fun, I would run into a guy multi-boxing somewhere between 15-30 accounts The exact number escapes me, but it was significant. He was Horde, and he was hated by his team, because as it turns out, multi-boxing with that many toons in one BG is SUPER ineffective and guarantees the Alliance wins. He was a glass cannon that could only aim at one target 
---
There is no /follow in BG on classic, you will not find them on Alterac
---
Tbhing is when i swap from 1h+shield to my 2h with a macro for say battlestance like this: 
---
#showtooltip battle stance
---
/cast battlestance
---
/equip 2h name 
---
and when i use that, i do only get the GCD from stanceswap and it equips the weapons without any aditional CD from the weapon swap
---
Fuck can ANYONE translate what this guys is saying? Way too many letters in his words
---
I hope your friends realize that you care more about what they can give you than your friendships with them.
---
Why do you have 2 hunters though?
---
Here  [\[Society6\]](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker)  :D
---
Thanks for the feedback. Care to show your 21/21/9 build? I'm curious.
---
This, is what I'm going to do @ 60.
---
2 hour farming allies in hillsbrad yeti cave a day takes the cancer away.
---
You get barely (bearly) anything from hitting targets though and your crit chance isn’t that great in level gear.
---
Most of your rage comes from getting hit. Try tanking as bear and getting a priest shield and then tell me you make enough rage from attacking
---
Our boomkin got our first Golemag staff yesterday, he also has nearly full cenarion even though hes still using bis blues instead.
---
Also his dps on those 3 wraths before oom is really nice.
---
You: clicker
---
Now do it to a whole raid running into MC.  Not enough healing to save the whole team, fam.
---
Spec into Improved Enrage? lol
---
I have no clue. I would think tanks would scream at you if they saw you in bear form.
---
How much gold did ya get?
---
Similar thing happened to me. I told a friend in Canada what I was planning to do, he got very worried and contacted Blizz. They got ahold of England emergency services and told them what my friend had said. The police initially called me on the phone I had linked to my Blizz account, but I was in a different room and didn't hear it. The police showed up and explained they had to do a quick search of my room to check I didn't have anything I would hurt myself with. Well they did find something, an ambulance was called, and I was taken to hospital for the night.
---
Oh man, you just made me realize the tournament is going to be filled with loot funneled streamers. I really hope a no-name wins.
---
60 Rogue
---
1K Gold + Epic mount
---
Dal rend main and Pyro shoulders from Pre raid BIS
---
Professions: Skinning + LW  300. Might drop LW and Pick up engineering but don't wanna waste devilsaur patterns. undecided.
---
Next goal is to get into a raid. The pugs have sketchy loot rules, and my guild isn't quit there yet. Hoping to be full pre raid BIS by the time we step into MC so I can stand out as a rogue, which could be hard when my GM is also a rogue.
---
That is the classic dream.

Oh definitely. Hit 34 today after some SM runs through Library and Armory. Had the most amazing parties and pulled through Armory in a breeze, despite most of us being 32-34
---
My favourite fantasy series. I love Silk and Barak.
---
60 hunter with epic mount and 600g. Mostly from devilsaur farming.
---
No. I'm saying ALL BoE blue/epic items have a median price they sell for on the AH for their server. Everyone has the opportunity to win the item and sell the item or equip it if they can.
---
50,000 5 man multiboxers, holy fuck that's an estimate and a half
---
Thank you for the opportunity, you're a pal!
---
Oh, you are right, my bad.
---
Easily herbalism unless you don't want to spend time herbing.
---
Yeah the entire time I leveled there, finished every damn hunting quest I only ever saw TWO and they were both tagged and dying.
---
I just don’t get what the bear’s role is in such a cleave group. If he’s not supposed to tank then why not take an actual dps who is not rage starved
---
PvPing without honor..*yawn*
---
Yep.. So fucking sad that Blizzard can't provide anywhere near close to the performance some europeans in a basement could. Really hope they fix this shit. We had a 80v80 fight the other day and it lagged way more than a 100v100 did on Nost.

---
&gt;and the group announcement says "LFM need healer for BRD"(or whatever your flavor), then that boss is at least attempted, time allowing
---
I know what you mean and mostly agree, except BRD is the worst example of that. Even a "proper" group (not farm) doesn't hit every boss possible like 95% of the time. The place is massive. Most don't hit relic coffer boss, or the big fire giant guy, or the random boss spawned somewhere after you open the coffers, or all four(?) bosses in the bar, or roccor, or a few of the others as well. Many groups will hit a few of those along with the common bosses, but I don't know that I have ever been in a group that did \*all\* of them in one go.  
---
If someone wants a particular boss off the 'beaten' path though, I'm nearly always down.
---
Welp, make sure your weapons at least are relevant for your level and, as someone here has already stated, go out and smash.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah nothing triggers me more in the entire game than people needing stuff they want to sell or needing stuff someone else needs more (e.g. warrior needing item with 10 stamina 10 intellect because his item is only 8 stamina when there is mage and priest in the party ... Guess who wins the roll everytime this happen)
---
Was it the Orc Warlocks on Whitemane by chance? Those are just about the only multiboxers I've seen on this server.
---
Yeah I'm 58 and still havent touched EPL/WPL besides the breadcrumb quests, still got quests all over the place. Should have a nice glide into 60
---
&gt; I thought this but then I have to assume they're all 12 ish right? Otherwise yeah man I don't get it.
---
You can stop jerking yourself off now. We get it. You're super *quirky* and *unique*.
---
I honestly forgot what the beastmaster flag does.  There like a dozen flags almost.  God mode, invis, fly (swim), beastmaster, few more.
---
That sounds awful, I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
Tons of RTV? They are few and far between, and honestly worth fighting and dying for.
---
Ah, thanks
---
It's very careless to use foreign PCs for any serious business even gaming. You never know what is installed on them. Could be malware that spies out your passwords or the stuff that happened to you. It's like having sex with a stranger without protection. I'm sorry for your situation but in my opinion Blizzard is doing the right thing because you are responsible for your account as stated in their Code of Conduct and EULA.
---
Doesn't the bear make like 5 rage per normal attack? Attacking abilities that use rage don't add rage when hitting.
---
That being said, the questline comes out in phase 4 as 'catch-up gear'. Just so OP doesn't get too disappointed at 52.
---
I'm just your friendly neighborhood vending machine dude. Fuck AoE farming
---
It fucking sucks leveling on a pvp server. But its much More fun at lvl 60. Sometimes i wish pvp was disabled until lvl 60
---
Cheers muchly!
---
If a of value drops, with strangers, always need. Because the warrior in my group can f right off demanding edgemasters. It's a boe, you need it - buy it, just as a righteous orb. (That's for rnd drops, not like tier Boe's).
---
It's pretty damn low, according to https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14637/cadaverous-armor
---
Honestly I doubt it
---
It’s also hilarious how you need to talk to do all sorts of class quests to obtain bear form, aquatic form and cure poison but by the time you get to cat form your trainer is just like “yeah whatever, here’s cat”.
---
That’s better I can’t really read more than 4 letters per word. That said, what the FUCK bro I thought we were total guildie spawnie ally pally mountie fuckies?
---
Is he gouging people? Mine charges 100g a craft, pretty reasonable. Ends up running 600-700 gp total.
---
Imagine being upset that an over 10 year veteran of the world of warcraft community and Blizzcon champion, has a large following of fans, friends, a whole guild and a community, who are excited to help him out to get him an awesome legendary weapon in a game they love, to help him win $90,000 of tournament winnings. Cmon man, why are you upset about this? You should probably do some introspection.
---
Any place except BRD where i could farm pre-raid BiS as a Warrior?
---
I feel like both drops i need from Arena/Angerforge in BRD are both extremely low dropchance
---
Yes, but not solo. BRD torch room.
---
Yea. Thats what they do. Earlier in a dungeon epic BoE dropped ( leather  hands) everyone greeded except a rogue (who is a friend of mine) and some druid. The druid won and putted it on the AH. Quite a dick move so ignored the bastard right away. Didnt know there was a note addon tho
---
Your quickest xp is likely to just heal the mage and help with gathering mobs to let him aoe farm.

I thought the lvl 50 ST quests weren't available in classic
---
Inc overheal to make your cannibalize useless
---
Enjoy your ban, I guess.
---
The way I see it PVP is actually infuriating for you - I would recommend to switch to PVE server (you can even try your luck contacting support and explaining your frustration - you might get a free realm transfer)
---
Personally, coming from Warcraft 3 and DotA, I enjoy PVP and I am aware I will be killed by a lot higher level opponents, camped, harassed, etc.. This is what makes the levelling exciting for me, as sometimes in order to complete a quest I have to call guildies or spam the zone chat for help, or even logging in in calm hours so there would not be many players on the server. All this adds an extra layer to the game, but for some people it might affect negatively the experience.
---
If you don't enjoy all I mentioned above probably PVE server is for you. In a PVE server you can still PVP in battlegrounds when they come out so you will still get that PVP experience and on a more balanced terms.
---
Don't forget we are all here to have fun!
---
But BoP's don't have the same value, so your hypothetical is irrelevant. I can see his point: a BoE sells for the same amount you can buy it for, while you can't buy BoP's, and even if you could, vendor price is smaller than the buying price would be.
---
So this is how your pet says "You are dead to me!".... ouch.
---
At least as a warlock you don't have to deal with this. There is no friendship to break when you have beaten them into submission and bent them to your will in the first place. ;P
---
Also they skip mobs on the way to quests and ignore green quests.
---
Referencing a list is one thing, but there seems to be a mindset of "if it's not #1 on the bis list, it's trash and a waste of time."
---
Trust me, when you go heal you won't have to worry about finding groups. You're like the prettiest girl in school.
---
If you spam Dungeons with a efficient group yeah easily
---
BoE's are not the same as BoP's, for the last goddamn time.
---
Nobody "needs" a BoE, it's just AH gold, and everybody is allowed to roll on it.
---
Epic BoE bow drops?   The rogue is allowed to roll on it, because:
---
* He helped kill the mob that dropped it
---
* He can trade that for an epic BoE sword
---
It's just that simple.
---
#NOCHANGES
---
I have seen 5-man multiboxers at least half a dozen times out in the wild in the last couple weeks since launch. 
---
I have not seen a part of five doing a random generic quest.
---
OK, I got it. They are powershifting. 
---
5/5 Furor means 10 Rage every time you shift into bear. And it's not on the GCD. When out of Rage you cancel aura and shift right back into bear for 10 Rage and hit the main target for 5. Now you Swipe and powershift and if you are fast and have a good connection you catch the global cooldown again and don't miss and you can Swipe and repeat until you run out of mana.
---
Except Timbermaw farming is one of the most crowded areas...
---
That's exactly correct.
---
Unfortunately you'll probably have to deal with a bunch of carebears who don't understand this simple fact.
---
I wouldn't say it picks up so much as it becomes bearable. 
---
For the first 35 levels or so I spent 15 seconds at the most killing a mob on my rogue, usually less and only had to eat once every 4-5 so pulls. This was wearing decent lvl appropriate greens and with blue weapons though since it was a second character. Priests have no down time but I don't think that quite makes up for the rate they kill at.
---
I’m sorry you feel that way
---
And he attacks once every 2.5 seconds and a skill costs 10-15 rage. And there is a chance to miss. You do the math, how often can you use swipe?
---
lol, I recently found out there's a little courtyard in Old Town in Stormwind, blew me away haha
---
I mean ask them before you start the run. If you only start demanding after you are there its on you.
---
Druids put out a *ton* more threat than a warrior, even without MCP. Warriors start to catch up to druid threat around AQ40/Naxx level. And even then if you use Manual Crowd Pummeler, they're way back behind again.
---
Was advertised as a full run...sooo yeah.
---
My dream is fulfilled.
---
No, dude.
---
BoE's are not the same as a BoP.
---
BoE's can be traded for whatever your class needs.  BoP's can't.  That's why everybody is allowed to need a BoE.
---
The Undead?
---
38 is on the low end. I'm bouncing back and forth between there and STV.
---
Yes, but UBRS is kind of an endgame dungeon, and there's upgrades over mantle in BRD that are getable by early 50ies. Kinetic Amice comes to mind.
---
If you'd prefer to have their belongings instead of them, it means you got your priorities very, very wrong. Not going to see it your way, you absolute nutjob
---
Exactly.
---
BoE's provide an upgrade to whoever gets it, that's why everybody can roll on it.
---
Riding the boat to Ratchet feels more like the D-Day landing scene on Omaha Beach from Band of Brothers.
---
I always assumed those ment save the princess :X
---
I'm dreading the moment a flask or transmute recipe drops in a dungeon.
---
I'm an alchemist and I just KNOW that non-alchemists will need it because you can vendor it for 100g+
---
As a shaman I found that grounding totem eats the sleep, but threat drops when he uses the ability so tank had to taunt the boss back. Otherwise I've tried having an offtank taunt during sleep until mt is back.
---
Notice the bit where I quoted you?  That was copy/paste.
---
Your understanding of economics is flawed or non-existent.  Value is subjective.  The Market Price of an item doesn't even need to correlate to the value that an individual might put on it.
---
If you think that's incorrect write up a paper and submit it to an economic journal, if you can prove your theory there's likely a Nobel Prize in it for you.
---
My dog does the same but it makes me happy every time!

Reason to get a 4k monitor, or maybe just print out a huge map at officemax lmao.

SM is great. One of the few sad things about being higher level is not being able to run SM over and over again effectively.
---
How exactly does multiboxing even work? Is there a script runni g that allows all your input to be registered by multiple instances of the game at once? Or do you have to switch windows whenever you want to cast a spell or attack on any character?

Any tips on that final push from 58 to 60?
---
Sell them in the neutral AH (assuming you're horde). They go for much more there because you can get 10-25g for them on the alliance side (25g is the highest I've sold one for).
---
I buy up any Big Iron rods if they're less than 12g but people seem to have cottened on to this strategy as I've not seen one for less than 15g for a while.
---
See how long you last in parties acting like a 4 year old :\]
---
F2p sucks and leveling is 200x slower when u are just bad at the game
---
That was 15 years ago, buddy. Rag was downed in under 5 days with a raid group where half the players weren't even 60 in Classic. People actually know what they're doing now so class circlejerking isn't as much of a problem in Classic. If you can't down Rag and you have a Shaman in the raid it's not because he's there. Y'all just suck ass lol
---
LF9M UBRS - Full Run, We will be doing Solakar Flamewreath!
---
&gt; By that logic, needing on BoPs that you can't use should be ok as well, no?
---
This isn't complicated, dude.
---
BoE's are just gold.  They do not lose value based on who you give them to.  Any player can use that gold to buy an upgrade *for their class*.
---
BoP's are not just gold.  They either bind to a player and get used, or they're vendored for almost nothing, which doesn't provide an upgrade to anybody.
---
That's why everybody is allowed to roll Need on a BoE, and everybody should use Need/Greed for BoP's.
---
In classic you don't need BiS preraid blue gears for MC. You can do it with green and blue quest rewards at lv 58. And as a priest, there shouldn't be too much competition, so you can get your T1 shoulder pretty fast if it drops. However I share your sentiment, brother. I was a priest in vanilla and most groups skipped that boss in UBRS. I'd love to collect a T0 set for T0.5 and experience one of the most epic quest chains in WoW history. My advice is that you get a UBRS ring, and when a group is looking for somebody to open the door for them, you offer your help but bargain with them to kill that boss. That's what I did.
---
I had the same problem, updated addons and it went away, think Questie causes some issues sometimes.
---
That was an example, there are other shadow wands in the game at around lvl 40 even, and for more casuals, that Wand is stuck with you for a long time. Shadowform also increases shadow dmg with wands that does shadow damage with 15%. But hey, if you thought it was a good idea waiting five lvls before you get that ridiculous damage boost, then sure ;)
---
And you don't get oom. Mindflay is like the best dpms in the game. 4-5 stacks is easily obtained and wanding the last 5 seconds is just ideal.
---
It's about relative utility. A BoP that is BiS for you is obviously going to get you much more utility than the 7g I can vendor it for.
---
A BoE that is BiS for you but can be auctioned for 500g would let me buy MY BiS, or save me days of grinding fod mh epic mount. I get basically as much utility from that item as you, hence I will be rolling need on it. And if you want to roll on a BiS for me that is BoE, you can do so too, because it will help you as much as it helps me.

---
Dude, I'm not attacking you or anything. Just discussing and I even asked a question. I don't know everything, man. 
---
Of course it's better to get hit as a tank. I didn't say you can tank without taking any damage. I just said you get rage when you hit an enemy and even more if you crit. As a bear tank I never had issues with rage on a big pull. Although I don't tank that often, so I'm not experienced that much.
---
You shut your mouth
---
Absolutely fucking not.
---
BoE drops:  You can trade that for a BoE **that your class can use**.
---
BoP drops:  You can get some chump change at the vendor, and you can't buy an upgrade.
---
That's why BoE's are Needed by the entire party, and BoP's are Need/Greed.
---
BoE's lose zero value when they go to a player who can't equip it.

You get 0 exp from torch runs now.

Level 49 priest, I've levelled as holy with 5 points in spirit tap and wands. At the moment I feel pretty strong questing but I also like healing dungeons and I want to start doing BRD in the early 50s. I'm temped to do a more healing orientated respect away from spirit tap. Should I keep spirit tap &amp; other questing talents until 60 if I'm doing a mix of dungeons and questing?
---
That much gold is worth £100,000 right now. Doubt anyone has that
---
And the [results](https://imgur.com/a/blrbBpG) of our farming look great!!
---
mage player here that never did any aoe farming or dungeons.
---
when and what aoe should I be using in endgame dungeons? do I start aoe as soon as the tank has a good amount of threat or only when the mobs are low to finish them off? when do I do coc ae or flamestrike vs just using blizzard?
---
Wow, this is great work!
---
Am I missing something or is it really hard to make any money from pretty much anything on the list? It seems like the margins are so small that it hardly pays off to stand around creating 100 pieces for something between 300 sec and 50 minutes just to sell them for 1-3S profit per piece. Am I reading something wrong or are the margins that small?
---
Fine! Goldshire has someone for everyone.
---
Good Idea! Thanks
---
This is the worst logic ever.
---
BoE drops: You can trade that for a BoE **that your class can use.**
---
BoP drops: You can get some chump change at the vendor, and **you can't buy an upgrade.**
---
**BoE's lose zero value when they go to a player who can't equip it.**

I looked at his VODs and he's farming an infinite spawn in Suramar for grey/greens and just vendors them using Tundra mount on 41 hunters for X amount of hours to get WoW tokens on all of them.b

They almost always only give permanent bans for serious breaches of conduct, cheating, and the like. So all this is very weird, so my advice is to insist with customer support, ask to talk with a manager if they don't resolve the issue, keep escalating.
---
Usually while leveling I have a list of items to buy for quests, and starting from whenever I first visit the AH I will always do a quick search for quest items that I’ll need later. My only rule is to by something that’s really cheap as to avoid over spending. I end up usually having those quest items ready before I head to the zone I’ll need it in. I don’t do this for quest items that are very common are have a really high drop rate as to avoid losing out on a lot of good mob grind exp (that’s a huge chunk of your leveling exp)
---
Things like the searing gorge silk cloth quest, I won’t buy that off of AH cause I know I’ll get loads while leveling so I’ll just save the 15 I need and put it in my bank for when I’m about to head to searing gorge. 
---
Always keep in mind, don’t buy stuff you’ll get while leveling like cloth.
---
If you don’t want to spend much on quest items and only want to spend on stuff that’s gonna have low drop rate/highly contested mobs. Like the blasted lands ones for example.
---
its the damn torch room huh? Havent made it past there yet.
---
I mean, what does that have to do with anything? It's a simple suggestion, not a rant against people that are a-holes. If I prefer to not run dungeons with people who have been acting like shit throughout the leveling experience I think I should be able to do that
---
So you 100% know what is installed on the cafe's PC? If not, then that could possibly be the source of your problem
---
Get the Addon VanasKoS. It has a KoS light for enemy players that did you wrong, a nice list for players that you  were fond of playing with (you can add both factions) and a hate list that you can add players of your own faction to. In case of the hate list, it'll tell you that specific player is on your hate list when he's either near you or add a \[hatelist\] tag next to their name in any chat. 
---
It's how i  keep track of some players.
---
Yeah streamers who end up on livestreamfails get 0 exposure for themselves and in turn twitch. Surely no reason.
---
It shouldn't take tipping for someone to be proud of their work and want to do it well 
---
e.g. the Japanese
---
Havent ignored anyone so far, but I also haven't grouped a lot, so there's that.
---
#no-changes
---
I had the same experience with SM runs. Nobody wants to heal Armory and nobody wants to tank library. Why not both?
---
Most of the popular guides have flaws on Icy Veins as well. I noticed this was a problem for Diablo also. Sometimes I wonder if they give sub-par information on purpose to hoard the last 1% of knowledge that gives them an edge.
---
I advice you to take a step back and read your own comment and just see how unnecessarily NEGATIVE that you're being over absolutely nothing.
---
Well, yes. It's not crazy.
---
How many wars and people getting murdered for the things they have? That's the way of the world, baaybee.
---
You only want equipment in the first place because it benefits you, so how is needing on a sack of 500g any different...
---
Reporting people auto ignores, just clean up your ignore list
---
If you have more than 10 people on your ignore list at this point, you're the one with issues
---
Hunters should only get leaf. A guild giving strikes mark to hunters dont know what they're doing
---
fairbanks is a good pacific timezone server
---
Based on stat weights, kentic and devout are tied.

---
You put everyone on the ignore list if they tag your mob? That's funny. They can increase the cap to 1000 and you're gonna have a full list by next week.
---
Don't be that sensitive. I've got like 3 people on my ignore list. 2 are ninja looters and the other one was a tank who got mad for no reason and left the dungeon.
---
There's even idiots who steal the chest while I'm clearing my way to it. It's disgusting, but I'm not gonna put them on ignore, lol. You can ignore without having them on the ignore list.
---
Tbh, look at some of the comments, when people comment on the guide being wrong you get a mod/admin come in and go "If you dont like it go elsewhere" i feel like Wowhead is run by the same folks at Twitch... Clearly they know better than the WoW Community or the users of their site....duh.
---
Nothing would change because BoP's can't be purchased in the AH.
---
Nobody wants to do dungeon runs if there's only a 1/5 chance that they'll get the BoP loot specific to that dungeon.  That's why everybody uses the Need/Greed system for BoP's in dungeons -- so that we don't all have to run the same dungeons forever.
---
BoE's are completely different.  You can just go to the AH and buy that BoE anytime you have the gold for it.
---
Isn't it BIS druid tank fire resistance weapon?
---
what else are you going to do in the meantime? Just run BRD when you feel like it and use whatever you get first
---
Yep blizzard should make this game a perfect safespace for you :) poor brittle thing
---
First off, that quest isn't in the game yet and won't be until I think phase phase 4, when all the ST class quests are added.
---
The polearm is the least useful of the three rewards. At 60, you can easily replace it with any of several somewhat common drops, like Peacemaker.
---
The Eye is probably the "best" choice, and if the quest was available now then you could take it and skip the horrible grind for hand of justice and have something that's almost as good, but by the time this quest comes out, you'll have better non-luck-dependent preraid options at 60, like the DM class trinket.
---
The tooth is interesting, it's got an effect that's found nowhere else in the game. Ultimately, if you're in WoW Classic for the long haul, this is probably your best bet. If you do PVP as BM, you'll have a pet ability that procs when your pet lands a crit, so it's useful to be able to do that on command. And it remains useful at 70, if Blizzard ever makes TBC Classic and lets your characters transfer over.
---
Priests are pretty great too. I only die due to laziness occassionally.
---
Because it's pathetic to need things you only want to sell... but some people's morality get's heavily shaken when more money is on the table so it's suddenly not pathetic for blues even though it still is. It's sad and funny at the same time.
---
There's going to be 1-2 multiboxers on every server that are infamous/known and pretty much a non-factor. You haven't heard of it and I guarantee most people online haven't even seen one. It's one of the most minor annoyances but it receives the biggest outrage.
---
I did this a few days ago but only after grinding for an hour or two saw that it was hopeless and went to the AH. Saw that each individual piece was worth 50s on my sever so made a cool 10g on animal bits.
---
No, I don't think so. I checked, and the wolf had the skill. Do i need to do something else for that to happen? Reach a certain loyalty lvl or something?
---
Steal tagging? You dont own the mob. The first to tag it gets it. Cant steal somthing that is not yours  to begin with
---
Took me a solid 22 kills of Herod just to get a drop.
---
It turns out that providing hours and hours of entertainment by playing a game we all love at its highest levels comes with some benefits.
---
I can be reported as many times I want for what I said. And nothing will happen.    
---
Mage, right?
---
I definitely didn't come here to have a discussion on economics. My point is that BoE items have value to everyone. One person being able to use the item, even if it is BiS, does not increase the median value of the item on that servers AH. The item has a predetermined median value on that server's AH that is equal to all party members.
---
The Gold Vein is in another castle!
---
You have to learn it.
---
Keep using the wolf that knows the howl until you're told that you know it, then you can teach it to your other wolf.
---
But even the way you explain this sounds like there are some pretty minor, and yet still important, differences between the two. 
---
Do you think this will make a difference to how classic plays out, or will it be basically the same as privats servers?
---
But now I'm a fully grown adult and you can ask me "do you miss it?"... yeah a bit that shit was funny
---
Level 47 Nelf Druid.
---
About 200g, but starting to AH hard now, so much more to come.
---
300 skinning &amp; 200 enchanting. Skinning will soon be dropped though for engineering.
---
Gear is of course leveling crap. Both feral &amp; resto gear.
---
Next goal, get to 60 &amp; dick around with my mates in MC/Ony until BG's are out
---
I'm a priest main and devout mantle is shite and there's no reason to bother with it.
---
The addon "Spy" is a third party addon that gets a very unfair wpvp advantage.
---
Why are you so obsessed over what is earned when **guilds** are the one who fund these rather than individual players
---
&gt;No amount of justification or "sovereign citizen" logic
---
The only person using "sovereign citizen" logic is you. You're avoiding the definitions of botting and automatic because it doesn't fit your narrative. Even if Blizzard were to consider it cheating, it's still not botting.
---
&gt;If you're using a third party program to play the characters for you, even if it's at your immediate direction, you're botting. End of story.
---
That's funny, because that doesn't fit the definition of botting.
---

---
Any combo with warrior is great. Period.
---
The worst part is that they destroy the uniform look travelers backpacks create.
---
No, I have people on ignore list who have intentionally just stole the mob i was trying to get to by killing a bunch of other mobs and then not wanting to invite or accept an invite.
---
I have people on ignore list who were throwing out need on every single item in a dungeon.
---
I have people on ignore list who have stole nodes/chests when i was literally on my last mob to them.
---
I don't know when you've played, but I've played from when it started and I think there were a lot more people then, even with all the layers, in a single zone.
---
And what does that have to do with anything anyway? It's a simple suggestion. I didn't come to rant, I came to suggest increasing the cap of the ignore list. If you have anything to say vs my suggestion then I'm all ears
---
You got an upvote from my brother. Screw Reddit, it's a super toxic community
---
&gt; BoE items rolling need is default
---
Naaaaah. That would be something that would need to be said ahead of time. You don't go in, not say a word, then start needing everything.
---
And get dismounted as the water was to deep....
---
I've only ever seen 1 multibox which was 3 mages that were identicle and they were doing some quest in an alliance zone.
---
I'm not shitting on your opinion dude, mostly because it's not an opinion but an incorrect fact. I'm merely saying that if you don't have the answer to a question, don't answer it. No need to go all ballistic. 
---
Yeah, the game has been around enough to have figured out that Druids are indeed superb single target levelers because they have no downtime and amazing mobility, something Locks tend to lack. And for similar reasons, leveling a fresh warrior isn't all that challenging anymore because weapon progression, specs, and other factors that help smooth the experience have been found out about and fleshed out. 
---
I'm not claiming to "know everything", not sure where you get that from. I simply stated that what you said was factually wrong, and you decided to blow up on me.
---
Need more companies like Blizzard that look after their players, you guys are doing an awesome job and I couldn’t believe a company would go to such lengths to investigate and make sure a player is doing ok IRL, once concerns are brought up. I’m really impressed and I think it’s something we should see more of in the gaming industry. You’re doing the Lights work Blizzard
---
I agree with you that it's too small but I think there's an add-on for this purpose as well.
---
I swear that's built into the fucking code just to toy with you... Exactly the same thing happened to me last night
---
Great pitch, but you just made my decision ten times harder.
---
If I'm selling the BOE and buying one for my spec, with the gold this is quite literally an upgrade for me as well.
---
There is no right or wrong answer, it all comes down to loot rules that have to clearly be stated in chat before the start of the run and have everyone agree with them (or leave if they don't).
---
I use to roll greed on things I won't equip but stopped (years ago) mostly because it created so many ninja problems.
---
Thank you for the video, great tips. Everyone that downvoted already knew, but unfortunately everyone needs to spread their opinions here on Reddit, a little to much. I try to stay away from this site
---
Also Princess drops a nice epic dagger, for casters that struggle with mana problems.
---
A hunter with a turtle pet could use shell shield and soak a lot of damage.
---
If the guy isnt immune to roots or fear then a lock or druid could chip him down safely too.
---
Stalag here. Very wholesome most of the time on horde. Even cross faction is chill MOST of the time. Blood baths and camping happen to both sides. Horde is favored though.
---
Bingo! I just hadn't activated the extra on-screen action bars on the lock yet.
---
Can someone bring me in the loop on the runescape crabs thing?
---
Maybe it was simply reality check? He didn't want to waste his life into WoW anymore and deleted everything cus of this. Bro simply wants to move on.
---
I learned this lesson many years ago, now I never wait at the elevator stops *ever*.
---
You need gold in this game just as much as gear.
---
Like you need both hands to exp a lock  ...
---
You get Innervate at 40!!!
---
Oh damm
---
This is just a shitty ravager proc with editing on top of it. Seriously?
---
I've been attacked by a multiboxer 1 time in Classic 
---
and over the past 15 years maybe 2 times in retail.
---
So it happens but it's EXTREMELY rare.
---
&gt; I was just recently involuntarily put into a psyche ward a few weeks ago and I'm sure that makes me very biased. If you call the police and tell them that your worried your friend might be trying to hurt themselves, then they absolutely have the authority to do that.
---
Confirm. May I tell a short story?
---
14 years ago, I was going through a **bad** breakup. I went to the bar next door to where I worked and the bartender made me a drink called "Pink Panties". I have no idea what's in that....but after about eight of them, I yelled "I'mma chug Pink Panties till I die!! Anyone with me?!?"
---
I had (several) more...then went home, barfed my brains out, and slept for a bit on my nice cool tile bathroom floor. It was nice. And cool. And bathroom floor. That's all I knew, and all I cared about. It was nice.
---
Until I woke up in the backseat of someone's car at ER with EMT's telling me that I had to get out or they would come get me out. They were not smiling. Someone took me literally (which, honestly, was not a bad idea at the time)...and whilst I slept comfy on the bathroom tile, they busted in my apartment door and found me "dead".
---
Thus the ER visit.
---
It's quite rare that I get to claim "privilege" of any sort, but the cop assigned to my Suicide Watch case happened to know my parents....who showed up in ER. NOT WHAT I WANTED as a 21- y/o dude living on his own....but it's a good thing they did. Dad's smooth talking saved me from an (unneeded) involuntary 72-hour committal in Psych. I went home with two bags of saline in my veins, and a bruise from the IV. 
---
Was I in danger? Nah...I was sad and attention-seeking, but I would have never hurt myself, but I can see how people thought I might have.
---
Can we as society tell the difference? No. No we cannot. I might not have been in harm's way, but we the people should protect those who would harm themselves from themselves. It's a loss of individual freedom, to be sure....but even the suicidal deserve protection. Even if that means the cops or the neighbors bust down your door.
---
Do you invite them without a word, or do you talk to them beforehand? If you talk to them, do they show interest in grouping?
---
Do you actually, genuinely only view interpersonal relationships through the lens of "Can I get any tangible things out of this"?
---
Check my comment history and take a look at what I respond to. This should be evidence of what it takes to get a response here or anywhere else. We make mistakes, but we do our best to be the best that we can.
---
Multiboxers in WoW are a reason why you're looking forward to playing another game? Have you come across any multiboxers in WoW? It looks like almost nobody in this thread has. Their impact on any server right now is almost zero. It's like getting ganked by a level 35 Undead rogue in Redridge. It's annoying... for a very short amount of time. Then you get past that level range and that Rogue is a non-factor and you never see him again.
---
Boe is always need roll bruh
---
You ... don't understand what those lists are for, do you?
---
!remindme 168 hours
---
Seriously they nerfed this?
---
Why what did they change?
---
Bad ass
---
Again, you are attacking me personally and not the suggestion I put forward. What are the cons to having a bigger ignore list?
---
If we had the wrath rules of rolling on loot warrior would be close to the worst dps class around. There's like 6 serviceable pre-raid items for dps, and one of them is the lionheart helmet. And two of the other ones are bracers, with two more being belts.
---
I'm not surprised warrior dps was bad back in the day, if they  all wore plate.
---
On the minus side, the lack of ability to tank onyxia with a shield swap if you're up for aggro in p3 is kind of sad.
---
.. nnot me. Just did my first dungeon ever last night. I died 4 times; I got us all killed twice lol
---
Technically it was a few quests, they all share in the same mob parts.  Still though... it's terrible, and I'm never doing those quests ever again D:
---
It's rare. 
---
Rare is cool.
---
I mean it's not stealing, but it's kind of a wee bit of an asshole move to tag a mob when the lock has already put his dots on them.
---
Other than that, first one to hit wins. I haven't seen many doing this purely on purpose anyways.
---
but I was MEANING to get to it!
---
/s
---
0,02% is certainly not common.
---
woah so much salt in this reddit towards streamers, bunch of nerds always malding when streamerss get what they can't so understandable
---
Which pokemon is that?
---
I thought it was hilarious.
---
He seems to mention it completely out of context, so for a moment I thought I just had been playing too much and miss heard. I found it intriguing that he mentioned it without any follow up? Was it just on his mind?
---
Not from the very launch, when I started to play it was something like 1.4.0 or 1.5.4 version, before BWL, and before tier 2 was revamped. Before release of TBC I had 3 characters leveled up to 60, my internet sucked so, I couldn't raid or farm battlegrounds, except WSG. But I hate that BG, so I was just leveling characters, trying new professions etc.    
---
Maybe I am lucky, just got one epic from a little dragons in badlands while questing yesterday, rares are very common as well, it's usually once in 2-3 dungeon runs for me. 
---
Even while questing I get a lot of blues. I got 2 ring of defense while questing, It's unique though, so I couldn't pick the second. leather low level shoes, bracers, cloak, pants, 39 lvl sword
---
I always play on PvP servers. 
---
It just seems odd to me that people get extremely rare world drops. At the beginning of the relaunch it could be explained by layering exploit. But they shouldn't do that rn.
---
Sorry, you're wrong. Because of the 4pc bonus, if you already have 3pc, nothing is a better upgrade. It's literally better than Prophecy IF it is completing the 4pc bonus. 
---
If I had any luck getting different gloves, it would be a different situation.
---
[Dancing crab rave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM) became a meme, used to celebrate something which is usually unpleasant. The crabs are meant to evoke the song, and the /r/2007scape community co-opted it to criticize the apparent carelessness of the Jagex (developers of Old School Runescape) towards players getting wrongfully banned, winners of contests never being mailed rewards, vocal minorities seemingly being given favoritism over the will of the majority of the community, all the while raising the monthly membership prices to $11 / month.
---
On-topic counterpoint: No, the ignore list is fine as-is, and rather forces you to reevaluate player interaction and expectations.
---
In my opinion, this is not useful, as a weapon change will trigger the GCD. And this is a 100% intended, as a rogue would have an insane amount of DPS increase.  
---
In early vanilla, there was no GCD, and it was ridiculous.
---
Just anecdotal evidence but 9/10 better to sell or even vendor. You rarely get the price back. Unless it's a cheap BoE
---
Blizz bans 20-40 account bots all the fucking time though. They ban botters who are leveling solo, botters who are leveling in dungeon 5 mans with zero effect on the economy. They did a massive banwave on thousands upon thousands of accounts for archaeology(dumb) botting. There are SOOO many more bots being banned than there have ever been multiboxers.
---
What do you mean, Autisticles? We all just care about ourselves out here, right?  Gotta get that gold to get our BoEs, right? :)
---
made my day xD
---
Okay let me try to explain.
---
BoE: This item sells AND BUYS on AH for the same price. This means the item has the exact same value to everyone, which is the selling price of it. Any player can buy it if they think that value is worth the item, and every player can sell it if they rather want the gold.
---
BoP: This item CANNOT be bought with money. The value of the item for someone who wants it for gold is whatever it vendors for, the value for someone who actually can use it, is gold from the eventual vendor, AND whatever use the item have. A BoP is technically invaluable for someone who can make use of it. You can't put a price on say bonereavers edge(well unless if you are literally buying boosts but lets be realistic). 
---
That is why the need and greed rules are not the same between those two kinds of items.
---
Yep, the dwarves give 0 (or close to) exp now.
---
The envy and salt is really overflowing in this thread.
---
Removed exp gain from the dwarves.
---
You have never seen a boe epic drop, and if you have and still believe this you are a moron. Everyone will roll need on it. No one is just passing on a 100-1000 gold item for no reason.
---
Essentially using it correctly. Blizzard's main strength is the Improved Blizzard talent that slows. Frost Nova lasts for a very long time if you don't apply direct damage to it immediately.
---
Millions of bots at $15/mo were banned. Did that sub money not exist or is that a different form of money?
---
Sell now. If you get 80 gold it only cost you 10 plus AH cut.
---
Whats even more fun than putting them on ignore, is downloading the addon called "character notes". Everytime some one fucks you over, you put in a notes explaining why you should be avoiding them ex. "This guy just left me in the middle of a BRD run without saying a word".
---
I always make my own groups, and I find so much joy in getting whispered by a player I've previously had a bad experience with, and just replying to them. "You fucked me over in ZF at level 45, you are not going in my UBRS run.".
---
Can someone explain to me the different types of BRD runs that people do? I remember previously seeing an explanation in one of these threads, so if someone has the link that would work too.
---
Can tell you from experience, deffo the mob xD
---
The theory crafting is correct because a lot of the formulas were data mined. Things like health, and armor values were just an approximation however. Which is why classic is so easy. All the theory crafting, mix maxing, and BiS lists carried over from private server research but the difficulty did not. Which is why ragnaros was steam rolled week 1.
---
Bro I might rather die than go through that again, I honestly dont know. I'm not trying to be mean here but unless you've been in one and held against your will how would you know?
---
Yeh, I know that. But in the beginning with blue weapons I mean.:) have a good 2h but no good 2 x 1handers, so i think fury not worth it for me right now
---
Cat durid is 4 fite!
---
Bear durid is 4 t0nk!
---
Low quality Arab memes
---
imo you should keep spirit tap until 60, its very valuable when youre out there questing, and will def miss it if you respec out of it. 
---
i was healing dungeons as shadow even at 60 so you shouldnt have a problem with healing regardless of spec.
---
In PvP you only need 5% hit instead of the 9% for raiding. PvE BiS is all about stacking damage while in PvP your stamina is the most important stat. To get an edge in PvP you want to use every consumable you can; bandages, hp and mana pots, free action pots, jungle remedy, restorative pots, tuber and +engineering everything.
---
Rohkdelar has a damage range of 89-166
---
Carapace Spine has a damage range of 82-124
---
So no, definitely use Rohkdelar.
---
What bop vendors for 900 gold? The correct answer is none.
---
Me too, they are the best
---
It gets better, I promise. My wife had to bench WoW for a period of time when we had infants too, but now that they are school-age she can raid all night, no interruptions.
---
Just establish some bedtime boundaries so they unconsciously accept that leaving their rooms after a particular activity (drink of water, last pee, storytime, etc) isn't an option (baring sickness). Your hubby will thank you for it too.
---
I support your cause, because I think it's absolutely pathetic that someone would REFUSE to do a boss in a dungeon when someone needs gear, but I don't agree with this
---
&gt; BIS lists for blue gear stem from a cancerous mindset and are contrary to the spirit of Classic.
---
They may be contrary to your vision of classic, but BiS items are just showing people what the best item for that slot to ensure they perform in raids. I know it's not needed and I know people had no idea of these BiS lists in actual classic, but now we do and it makes the game easier/more enjoyable for most to target their Pre-Raid BiS before trying MC/Ony.
---
Exactly the same for me, around the same time too! I love seeing the characters from HotS and discovering their backstory in-game.
---
Doing the exact same thing and same level, questioning my choice aswell....
---
But i think im gonna keep both wand and spirit tap tbh. Even in instances i still get wand last hits which can be a boost to my mana reg midfight, and its critical when soloing.
---
But in the end, do what you feel is best for your style.
---
Repeating, of course
---
it's very common for mail/plate wearers to farm herod.
---
The steal tagging was referring to more of a situation where I was clearing 5-6 mobs to get to the one I need and people just casually moving in and taking it right when i was about to get it. I see your point and maybe it's an exaggeration with that but still, the thing that I wanted to discuss was mainly having a bigger ignore list, regardless of the reasons you want to ignore people.
---
probably didn't know how to run the fight.
---
Do you have room for a Human Rogue XxaragornxX?
---
&gt; There weren't a trillion addons back then for everything.
---
I mean, for one, there were, that's wrong. But he's not even talking about addons, keybinds aren't addons, you know? What do you do other than 1-9, do you just click on everything?
---
You do you, but I don't know why you'd willfully make the game more annoying to play. I didn't use a lot of keybinds 15 years ago, but I was 12 and had no clue.
---
It's only punishable if loot rules were announced ahead of time. So if OP said something like "no needing on items you can't use, only need for upgrades" and the other guy agreed THEN Blizzard could yoink the item back for you. But if nothing is said and someone just needs then you're SOL
---
What "walking pattern"? There are three doors to open and one fire ele, if that, to kill and then you're at the arena.  
---
If they were doing arena runs without a key, you dodged a bullet.
---
I'm sure you have nothing to give other than superficial things, but most people do have a lot to give, even if they don't have a dime to their name.
---
Hard to tell. The only negative thing so far I encountered are some private server pricks who elevate themselfs over _retail plebs_, and think they can somehow enforce some rule they had in their isolated social structure on their private servers. But they are an exception to the rule.
---
Much of the meta regarding warrior dps comes from private servers, though. At least I don't remember in vanilla having so many of them around. When you played a warrior and grouped up, you always were supposed to tank. 
---
Also, stuff like +Weapon Skill is valued much higher these days, simply because we know better now, which is part of the effort of private servers.
---
Because alliance are carebear pussies
---
I will. It's been about 30h since I submitted the ticket and the estimated time has only increased, though :/
---
Literally me right now
---
It's not automatic. Botting is using a program to automate actions. Automate meaning that it plays the game for you. Whether it be a sequence of 2 buttons or unlimited by reading the gamestate and running forever.
---
Multiboxing is simply allowing all game clients to see the same input. If you press W, all clients can see W being pressed. Normally, the input of W can only be seen by the focused game client. This is because of how the operating system of a computer works. It's hardcoded to only put input to one window. If Microsoft wanted, they could make input pass-throughs native to the Windows 10 operating system. The only reason why they don't is because in 99.99999999% of usages in computers, there is no need for the user to do so. That's why people created programs to do this.
---
Anyway, a Blizzard employee described it like this:
---
*Malkorix, Blizzard Poster*
---
*"Think of a single key-press as a lever. You pull the lever, and something happens."*
---
*"Think of multi-boxing as simply attaching 5 levers to a single handle. You’re still only pulling one lever, it just affects more than one something.*
---
*"Now, think of automation as a lever attached to a set of gears and pulleys. You pull the lever, and a whole slew of bits and bobs start working, gears whirring, pulleys spinning. You might pull a lever, but it sets a process in motion that would be impossible with an ordinary pull of the lever if those gears and pulleys were not in place. Automation can apply to a single character just as much as it could with multiple characters.*
---
*"The point is that the ‘something’ that occurs spools out without direct human involvement aside from the initial pull of the lever. That is automation. Even if it’s only a single extra step.*
---
*"In multi-boxing, every action taken by those characters has its source in a human command. Each individual action. Thus, it is not automation."*
---
The automation they refer to as actions impossible to be done with a single button press on their own. For a game client, you press a button, it does "X" and nothing more. Botting is extending the action of "X" to also do action "Y" after it does "X". Or it might repeat the action of "X" after a set amount of time or reaches a certain criteria.
---
Multiboxing might be a shitty thing to do that disrupts gameplay in a unique way, but it isn't botting because it's not automated.
---
Hey,
---
There are numerous “pre raid BiS”-lists available. 
---
May I suggest classic.wowhead.com 
---
They have optional alternatives to the BoE and low drop rate items.
---
Thats true if he have a bad relationship with those who he ignored. But if he use his ignore list as blacklist then thats a good request to have more slot in it.
---
Uh. Sm ranges from 29-37. Gy. Lib. Arm. Cath. In that order. It's just a dungeon for like 10 lvls straight and always people looking.
---
Your attitude is the issue. I grind mobs for gold and dungeon for gear. Quest for exp. It all comes together.
---
I also have alts and am loving the game. It's taking my main longer to level but it's awesome!
---
Until you take Group Content into the equation. If you do an instance run with a group, the Loot gets distriibuted among 5 Players. A Multiboxer can just run the instance solo and get all the loot.
---
I'm a hunter and i want to say a big "thank you" to the mages for that.
---
I disagree with that arguement
---
Things didnt work out? You do what you like doing the most, maybe its not the 'normal life' that you can talk about on a highschool-reunion, but who cares? 
---
Arent you excited for future gaming? WoW 2? Or is life in general too draining atm that you're pessimistic about that aswell?
---
Get your gnomish horror away from Rexxar.
---
Open up their trade menu
---
You wanna know what’s even simpler? “Need if you want to use the item, Greed if you want to sell it”. It can’t get any simpler than this.
---
If only Kline’s could join, he’s on a OCE server
---
Okay, maybe I didnt know the  [**c**](https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/circumstances.html)**ircumstances**  ;)
---
I experienced the EXACT SAME THING around level 40 on my male orc warrior. It’s just an awkward aesthetic phase imo.
---
I couldn’t shake the feeling that my character looked like a gimpy shrek.
---
That being said I didn’t reroll and I’m glad I didn’t because things get better for us at 60.
---
Yeah too many people take the memes as gospel
---
Herod is around 3-500 at max, Faerlina around 1-2k at peak.
---
If you dont feel like farming hand of justice just go with Rune of the Guard Captain (hinterlands elite quest) and Blackhands Breadth (UBRS quest)
---
Savage gladiators chest is also very rare to find, just search for a more common alternative.
---
You absolutely dont need the absolute best in slot items to raid. Just reach your hit chance minimum and optimise the rest.
---
Dude, who cares? Is it affecting your life? This is a post about my missing friend and all you people can do is criticize me keybinds.
---
Isnt the damage worth dealing with the GCD?
---
&gt;By definition it's not botting
---
Okay, where is this definition? You'll be surprised to find the definitions of that and "automation".
---
&gt;just because you don't like it
---
No one likes being absolutely unable to play in an area with a 5-man multi boxer killing everyone on sight. It's literally someone that says "now you can't quest here anymore" just because they pay more money than you do.
---
Quest/full run: The entire thing. Pack a lunch, kiss your loved ones goodbye, you'll be dungeon delving for ~4 hours or more with the average, level-appropriate group.
---
Emperor Run (Emp/Lava run): Pull as few mobs as possible to get to Emperor. You typically get Incendius, Magmus, the Emperor, and either save or kill the princess, depending on the group.
---
Golem Lord/Angerforge (sometimes including arena): Sneak your way in and kill General Angerforge - since the extremely sought-after Hand of Justice drops from him this patch - aswell as Golem Lord Argelmach. Sometimes you'll see more or less full melee groups run this, sometimes they'll sweeten the deal for casters by including the arena.
---
Coffer run: Typically you do the arena, then run to the area where the Dark Coffers are. Mostly done because some materials for leg and head enchants drop there.
---
Alliance only: Jail Break. This is part of the Onyxia pre-quest for Alliance. You free Marshal Windsor from the prison area at the start of the instance and escort him through the entire prison area, before making your escape and confront Onyxia (no spoilers ;\^) ).
---
Deprecated - Torch spam/run: Until a few weeks ago, the mobs in an area called The Lyceum gave experience. Only a small amount (around 20 per kill, a pittance at best at level 50+), but what you'd do is use a hunter pet with Power Word: Shield on it, so it can't get dazed, to pull as many of the monsters in there as possible, and AoE them down. They only had ~1k health and respawned nearly constantly. This is just one of the many extremely fast leveling methods (120k/hour with a good group) that people found. Blizzard has since fixed this.
---
Used his spells?
---
Be mad at your employer for paying you peanuts instead of the customers who are just there to enjoy a good meal.
---
So THATS why you dissapeared?! Been ages now. Glad to see you’re well.
---
Uhhh they took that out
---
You are entitled to your opinion, but try to accept that some of us are of a different mindset and think you should not need to sell.
---
It's this holier than thou attitude of those that subscribe to this belief system that takes reads need/greed literally.  It's to seperate themselves from the gray area of needing on an expensive boe.  If anyone does not follow their roll belief system they get to come crying to reddit about how their system failed them but it's never their fault and the guy is a ninja!  Real ninjaing is a rogue needing on bop priest gear to vendor or breaking some predetermined loot agreement.  It's getting old.  Just need on the crazy boe gear and if you win it go ahead and hand it over to the "proper class that will use this item" if you feel so strongly about doing that.  Personally, I'll hand it over to an auctioneer and the free market can decide who deserves the item.
---
Started as horde. Went alliance and I like hunter in retail so I tried one again. But in the end I dont like the ammo, pet food and less bag space so that's why I got 2 haha.
---
Vanish...
---
&gt; you'll likely break that 6pc set bonus quickly once you start raiding
---
Not with the amount of rogues around :D
---
OP fans are everywhere!
---
That is outright false and I'm questioning if you know what the word value means. If an item had the same value for everyone, it would never be bought or sold. An item is sold on the AH because the holder values it less than the AH rate while the buyer values it *more*.
---
I killed Mufasa.
---
World of Draenor
---
I haven't seen any unavailable items but yeah, some options are very questionable.
---
So does Maraudon! There's even a princess if you're feeling lucky!
---
Add them to your friends list, right click, then press set note.
---
1 keystroke = 5 actions if you are 5-man multiboxing.
---
You're bending your words to make it look like it's not what it really is.
---
You have to understand how you can multibox, and be playing like you're just 1v1-ing, while your spells are 5 times more powerfull than your oponnent.
---
How is that fair?
---
If it's unfair, which is it, and it's an advantage, which it is, it's an unfair advantage.
---
One you gain by paying more money than someone else.
---
Cool I was legitimately curious, I fled Herod onto Earthfury.
---
New to tanking. Find it hard to keep threat and rage with some groups. Not even talking about cc :(
---
Maybe my play is wrong? Charge , thunderclap , go to def and sunder tabbing the pack.  What am I doing wrong?
---
Salty salty salty. I love it
---
I'd go full fury and just keep a shield handy, if I were you. Protection is horrendous for solofarming.
---
nope, that's not the case. Otherwise I should be able to roll need on a BOP because the gold from vendoring it gives me a new item.
---
This only works if the healer is in combat aswell right? You dont get into combat if the healer is not in combat either
---
You cant farm runecloth without making some gold so do that because you will be doing both i guess
---
Only read up to the ban reason as I have to leave for work, so sorry if you covered this later.
---
The reasoning they gave also applies to manipulating the AH (which is a lot easier in Classic than retail) and people were getting banned for it back in vanilla already.
---
Botting is a program autonomously doing an action. Automatic meaning a self-regulating system without human input. Multiboxing isn't botting because there is nothing automatic. It's simply allowing other clients to see the same input. If you press W, it's still W. It's not an automatic input of you tapping W and it turning into W, then A, then W again.
---
A Blizzard employee described it like this:
---
No one cares about Blizzard's definition.
---
EVERYONE knows Blizzard allows it, and there is only 1 reason why they would allow it at all.
---
We're talking about "SHOULD" Blizzard allow it, not "DOES" Blizzard currently allow it.
---
And they shouldn't.
---
Ah, I meant that the healing gear is usually cloth so it feels weird to roll on it against casters, but if I see if they need it first then I will never get any healing gear. Kinda wondering how I should do to not make people mad.
---
Damn, that bad huh?
---
He got caught cheating &amp; his wife deleted his shit.
---
Cus everyone plays rouge....
---
But you don't skip any bosses when killing Herod. Unless I misunderstood someone?
---
I'm a Rogue and I'm not in the run because no one invites another person to roll against Dal Rend.
---
I agree. In most cases, people just really haven’t found out yet that everyone should roll need on BOE’s if you wish to use or sell. It was a collective group drop that anyone in the group can use for different purposes, like trading, selling, equipping etc. If the person who wants it as an upgrade wins it, then cool, but otherwise he needs to buy it like anyone else from the person who won.
---
Yeah, I am on a pvp server and even though I don't really indulge in it to much, I love the excitement of having to watch your back at any time :D
---
A somewhat equal balance would of course be amazing, but I am in Europe and to further specify it on the German servers - so I will try an get some population info.
---
But I totally agree on the cities and mounts, so I will be rerolling tonight!
---
Sometimes I juste have to reboot the game and flop I gain 40fps :)
---
No item has equal value to everyone, even BoEs. BoEs are more valuable to classes that can't farm well, since gold means more to them. Sometimes BoEs can be upgrades for people, making it more worthwhile to them than others in the group.
---
But really, it's something that should be discussed with the group before rolling. If it's an upgrade for someone, whoever it's an upgrade for needs, otherwise everyone needs.
---
I remember seeing you at the yeti cave in Hillsbrad. Good times.
---
Also pro tip. If you know that a rogue is nearby walk with your mouse. Distract is pretty much useless that way since you can just instantly snap back.
---
I tried to do it once but when I could do it I believe it's a matter of understanding when the time is right on the for the first time in the morning do you want to go to the store and get some rest and feel better soon and that is why I am asking for a friend to talk to you about it when I see is the best way to get a hold of you.
---
Herod's the final boss of the instance though. People aren't going and farming Houndmaster Lackey though are they
---
I would recommend watching Kargoz warlock guide 3.0 on YouTube. 
---
I did before release, it really explained drain tanking to me. He goes over the classic warlock as a whole and the whole presentation can be downloaded in a pdf.
---
People were doing Corpsemaker farm runs on my server
---
Dragon's Call EU (DE)
---
Isn't that for complex multiboxing programs? The simpler ones wouldn't be able to do that, I'm pretty sure.
---
I think he doesnt mean boosted as in lacking skill, i think he means boosted in terms of how fast he got the weapon. He tweeted he got the eye and 3H after that tweet he had the weapon. He got everything traded to him by viewers or connections from being a streamer.
---
This post made it pretty high on /r/all
---
I concur

BiS Lists are tools. People misuse the tools. Blame the people not the tool.

If someone hits themselves with a hammer, you don't blame the hammer. You blame the idiot holding the hammer.

Biggles player here also. I gave up questing at 38 and just spammed dungeons til 60. Either alliance is leveling slow as dirt or there are twice as many horde. The run to BRD you will die at least twice.
---
im going with  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVudgoxVGzIhz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVudgoxVGzIhz) as my "final" build for some time. This is basically a 100% fully functional holy build (holy shock is a waste of mana for healing), and its one of the more common holy raiding specs (one usually specs this to get sanctuary) and it can tank almost as good as a deep prot spec.
---
Im planning to heal in raids, tank in 5 mans, and hard focus on collecting all the mail/plate spelldmg gear to still be able to dps, solo quest and farm (and even pvp) with some efficiency with improved SoR and a fast weapon. Its basically 1 build that can fill all 3 roles in 5mans sufficiently without even needing to switch gear (or just fill 2 of the 3 roles perfectly with apropriate gear sets).
---
I’m expecting to get downvoted for saying it, but I multibox because I want to use my time as efficiently as possible given my personal circumstances.  
---
I play 2 characters at once, a Warrior and a Druid, on a PvE server.  I do this to combat the biggest weakness of the Warrior, who I consider my ‘main’, and honestly it’s pretty fun to tackle 4-5 mobs my level and come out with full HP ready for the next pack. I’m not playing to try to mug other people over, just to try to be time efficient.
---
I only have a tiny amount of time to play each week, typically a couple of hours at most, so i figures in advance of launch that if I could level 2 characters instead of one at the same time I’d be doubling my gains for my available playtime. Given the way I play it’s not quite so simple actually, even playing like this there’s disadvantages; the worst by far is collection quests (possibly also beneficial due to grinding), I’ve spent full levels getting 2x the materials for a single quest before...  
---
My setup uses distinct keys for each character, with all my Warrior attacks on 1 to 8 and my Druid’s heals on shift+2 to shift+6, all macro’d to target the warrior or themselves as appropriate. The only ability that the software passes to both characters at the same time (ie multiple actions from a single key press) is a /follow macro for each character to follow the other. I don’t pass the mouse control between clients, so I actually only control one at a time with WASD and the other is on /follow. I click a number of non-frequent abilities like battle shout and MotW, so they never get touched by the multiboxing software.  
---
I’m only level 25 with these characters, but I don’t feel like I inconvenience anyone when playing, and am happy to group for any quests still; I’m actually becoming quite proficient at tanking and group healing at the same time, though I haven’t dared try it in a dungeon yet.  
---
Sorry if this method of play winds people up, I just wanted to make the most of my time...
---
You can’t have a horde and a alliance character on the same realm in Classic.
---
You did the right thing. It is not an overreaction.
---
Nice video. I love low level twinking.
---
One of the things I'm really going to miss is turning off XP and twinking a lvl 1 or a lvl 10 character.
---
As far as i'm concerned, if the person actually healing the dungeon wants healing gear they should get it. Anyone else who's not healing and wants it for offspec has equal rights to it. Unless it's a BiS for a certain class then obviously let them have it
---
Yeah, but we all know the deal here. If he had even an inkling of a chance to shut your friend down, you jump in and end it before he can.

Any time I am doing AoE pulls in a questing area and I see someone is having trouble I ALWAYS ask if they need help. And if they send me an invite I accept and ask what they’re doing and offer to help. Then when they are done they leave me to AoE in peace and I don’t have to worry about anyone pulling Aggro and messing stuff up. Being a gold mage is all about being aware of your surroundings.
---
This! I don't know how this is so hard to see. Obviously the only reason I would want a bigger ignore list is to not have to scroll through a macro to see if the people I put on my blacklist are actually there or not. I literally couldn't give two shits if people just spam/curse me or just following me around to contest veins, but I don't want them getting in my raids.
---
There's only so much you can do. Even moreso without Defiance. If a DPS doesn't play carefully, espcially with AoE's, they *will* pull aggro and there's nothing you can do about it outside of spamming consumables such as Oil of Immolation and Sapper Charges, which is obviously not something that's expected of you.
---
If you're losing threat on single-targets, maybe mark a skull and focus more on generation threat on that, instead of building on the entire pack right at the start.
---
Very much agree with this! Can't really go exploring or exploration xp will tick me over!
---
More doing it = more reports = sooner actions from Blizzard. I hope some morons will go and try.

---
You're not putting yourself back at all. Look up weapon progression, you can find a lot of useful things in the wild that help speed up the process. Level cooking and first aid, make friends with healers along the way. 
---
With Classic approaching, a lot of things about the game have been blown out of proportion, the difficulty of leveling a warrior being one of them. It's going to take a non-insignificant amount longer than if you leveled a Hunter or a Druid, but we're talking 20-40 hours here - that's nothing on the timeline of a WoW character. 
---
If you think Warrior is the class that's going to make you happy, play Warrior. If you need help along the way, feel free to shoot a message, I'll gladly assist you
---
And I'm not attacking you. I'm saying it doesn't make sense to be bear and not the tank in the group.
---
Why do you want those terrible shoulders though?  Having said that I 100% support healers demanding the boss they want  in a run, especially when it’s not a huge detour.
---
100% agree, and I did realize that this is a noticeable exception right away. In general though, almost no groups are doing partial runs until like, BRD?
---
I have one friend who started with me but he is lvl 17 and we didn't do a single quest together so I will be rerolling.
---
In the end it is your character and you need to get the maximum enjoyment out of it, and for me that won't happen playing a big cow ^^
---
Also with Malfurion and Illidan being Nightelfs, I also enjoy them lore wise.
---
As for the class I also have a priest alt that I liked to dabble whenever I am needing a break from the druid, bit when I am going alliance I will try a paladin, since I want to heal with my alt anyway.
---
When I first played wow. I Frankensteined my pc with old computer lab parts. So no judging. Old parts are really cheap. If you want it bad enough. It shouldn't cost more than 1 good meal ya know.
---
BiS lists are just that, best **in slot** lists. They're only concerned with the highest performing item in each individual slots, not set bonuses. 
---
It's like that for all the lists.
---
I was finishing Maraudon and looked up because of the atmosphere change in game. I (for the first time in all my years of wow) noticed this area wasn't enclosed and thought it looked pretty cool.
---
"When everyone is a ninja, no one can be"
---
Flawless logic.
---
What do you do about very rare upgrade like Iron foe when you can't find one in the AH and it drop for your rogue or war dps? Having gold not alway equal having the opportunity to buy something with.
---
In the end of the day, I strongly disagree with need = equal gold but it's up to every group to decide before end. We can argue for an eternity about that but it doesn't matter.
---
double down farm rune cloth while mining ores to get maximum drops
---
How do you have alliance and horde on the same server?
---
They didn't.
---
You just don't get procs from getting critted at if you are sitting down.
---
If it's worth 100g, why are you unwilling to spend 100g on the item?
---
Insanely lucky, I think you can quit classic now since ur loot luck is depleted until tbc xD
---
Nice dir Alliance, Totally sick for horde, as every extra hit can proc wf again and the other way around.
---
How ever I always feel like fellstriker would be way better on a rogue since you, can get way more attackspeed, get more procs, can time some burst into it.. not to forget it’s a MH waepon for them at this phase if the game xP
---
I'm doing that right now and I don't see how I'm being negative over nothing.
---
I'm browing this subreddit and I see a lot of negativity towards things that used to be fun about this game. Big crits and good loot. 
---
I'm not calling people "drooling sycophants" because they like different things than me. I'm trying to make people see that we don't have to turn this subreddit into a toxic shitfest of people just breaking down everyone because of things like Twitch.
---
So, thanks for your advice, because I did take a step back and thought about what I said. And I absolutely stand behind the message.
---
Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing to this btw.
---
No, the gold from vendoring or disenchanting a BoP item is not equal to the cost of buying an equivalently powerful item. That line of reasoning is fallacious.
---
I have the ‘global ignore list’ addon. It lets you add a reason as to why you’re ignoring someone, if you join a group with that person again it gives you a notification so you remember. It also auto ignores them on all your characters. There is 0% chance of you unknowingly playing with them again.
---
Solo if I tell you I got 2 just in the time it took me to do the quest there you'll be upset ?
---
&gt;what kind of mobs are being pulled
---
can you list some examples from the dungeons? 
---
and if I'm the only aoe class do I just wait for good tank threat before dropping anything
---
They took out sit crits proccing talents like Enrage/Reckoning (although you can still do it by abusing spell batching), you still have 100% chance to be crit while sitting.
---
Do you want me to list every single game in existence that bans multiboxing? Stop being daft. It's a well known inconsistency in Blizzard's rules.
---
I actually have an old system sitting in a closet somewhere that a hard drive failed in and I just built a new one instead of getting a new hard drive. I'll take a look at it sometime today.
---
Had a similar situation last night, been getting ready for DM for ages and was super hyper, got the group and our healer joins we are all just about to go in and the healer says "sry I can't play I have to come off" and runs off into DM? Not much later another healer joins and we go into the instance and we see the old healer stood at the top waiting for something, one of the DPS said something and it was so funny I had to laugh and made sure I did /laugh at the healer who wouldn't get a run. 1 hour and a half later and we completed the first run with only 5 wipes. Screen you random druid healer
---
Bis if you are wearing 3pc already. 4pc bonus is +23sp.
---
its best to just save it till you're level cap. at 60 BRD pickpocket runs are like 40-65g an hour and its pretty chill too.
---
There is a big difference in the equivalence of gold value when you sell a boe on the auction house and vendoring something for 1g...  The boe is most likely a 1 to 1 trade for an equivalent item for your class.  If needing on bops followed the same logic then people would be doing it, but you don't see that.  You see people needing on boe because the there is a nice middle ground between the extremes of needing everything, and following self imposed moral guidelines  that you're trying to impose on everyone else.  Lets say I follow your rules, will you come upvote my eventual "Someone ninjad from me" post?
---
Ehhh, I would argue Blizzard DID do the right thing given the info they had at the *time*, but that there's no reason it *must* stay that way, especially once they have the full info of what happened.
---
But I absolutely agree, I have no idea how the OP felt safe entering their username and password on a PC that wasn't his or a friend's (and I wouldn't even log on with a friend's PC to be honest). There's any number of things that could go horribly wrong.
---
I feel the same!
---
Yupp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;
---
Which boss is it btw ?
---
Ah okay, about 150 comments in this thread are saying this is the same thing as botting.
---
I feel ya man, just remember it happens on both sides. Im alliance and always tried to share contested zones because logically sharing mobs was faster than constantly killing each other and neither of us progressing, or at least that was my thought process. But after constantly being ganked and corpse camped at every level between 0-50 I've become bitter, and now that I have power I have returned to hilsbrand, and STV to exact my revenge. Hang in there because it gets better and revenge is soooo sweet.

Just role a Gnome next time, 100% of people will try to kill a Gnome.

On the Countdown to Classic podcast, one of the original developers and dungeon designers, John Staats, said that so many people miss such cool stuff in dungeons because they never look up. They keep their camera tilted on their character the whole time.
---
I noticed this for the first time too a few weeks ago because every dungeon I'm in I've been stopping to look at the ceilings.
---
found the weird 23 year old following around asmongold giving him gold
---
I agree. Makes no sense to be in bear for dps. But hey, if these guys wanna play like that, sure. I'm not gonna go into a dungeon with them like that.
---
How is that related to the topic at hand ?
---
Well, its still an upgrade for the warrior. Just because its more useful for someone else, doesnt mean the warrior cant have it
---
Honestly, if they refuse, I'd just pull him. If they'd rather wipe than kill him, that's great, they deserve it, and afterwards I can leave.
---
:D sure thing !
---
Well I wasn't even talking to you
---
Jandice drops this https://classicdb.ch/?item=18689 i got it yesterday, pretty sweet cloak
---
I prefered Deja Classic Stats aswell but had an issue with it, all my stats went to 0% and I tried reinstalling, updating etc. Didn't work, sadly.
---
Might give it a try again at some point.
---
Yeah some items on the list are more profitable than others, but because I was using the list to level professions on the cheap, as well as make profit, I have included the bolts of cloth along side the actual wearable items too. If you are just looking to make profit, buy the items where the "cheaper than" price is the highest for that specific type of cloth (marked in green), and stay away from those which will never be profitable from vendoring (marked in red).
---
If you are looking to skill up, you might be guaranteed a skill up (Orange) from a non profitable piece (say Grey Linen Shirt), but if you can get the linen under 29c a piece, it may be worth you crafting an unlikely (green) skill up item (Linen Bag) because you can make a profit off the item instead.
---
I did exactly this with my First Aid with Mageweave/Heavy Mageweave bandages. MW Bandage sells for 4 silver, Heavy Mageweave sells for 6. To profit off Heavy Mageweave, I need the cloth to be under 3 silver, where as if it is under 4 I can make regular MW bandages and make profit. Rather than use the Mageweave for guaranteed/highly-likely skill ups on HWM, I made regular MW Bandages until it turned grey at 270. Runecloth Bandages are available at 260 so I actually did not need to craft HMW for skill ups and managed to level my first aid skill AND make a profit at the same time.

After leveling a paladin this video made me cry

I still need to get mine to 20, I miscalculated and now I have to play as a bear or caster with a bunch of agility gear and it's horrible

I think I can do it for you if you want to go to the store and get some rest and feel better soon and that is the only way to get the same thing as you can see I have a think about it and let me know if you need anything at least you have a good day and I will be there at the same time I don't have a car so I can get the money to you and your family a very happy and prosperous New year to you and your family

Did any private server have a player count even near to the realm this guy is playing in?
---
Everyone takes up resources from the server.
---
The rule is one command = one action per character.
---
Not one command = one action in total.
---
I don't make the rules, but the rules clearly have allowanced for multiboxing.
---
Botting means using a robot. Multibox is a loser using two or more  characters at once at the same time.
---
A lot of people in this thread are wrong.
---
Yes, it's unfortunate the helmet cannot be used at level 60, excellent point. I have been defeated in this internet debate.
---
By your logic most people with a sulfuras dont earn it.
---
Generally its a guild effort item.
---
Either way, armor does nothing for you as a Holydin except eat up stat budget. You're gimping yourself for no gain running around with a shield until the Ouro shield in AQ40.
---
I was in my tanking outfit, swapped my blade and shield for the weapon just to showcase it, didn't bother changing to my DPS outfit...
---
I do that very often so it must be the out of date add ons
---
Oh yeah, cool. I don't mind them. Poor man's Devilsaur for sure. Thanks for that. I'll be running UBRS for MH Dal'Rend and bracers anyways so hopefully they make an appearance.
---
Nobody is powershifting at early levels.  You need talents for it to actually be useful and nobody takes those talents first.
---
Basic mage moves oO
---
Blink out of slow fall is epic now ok..
---
&gt; Looking specifically at the tier 1 and tier 3 picks. Unless you intend to level 1h+shield, shield spec is vastly overshadowed by Ancestral Knowledge (+5% max Mana). The author claims "Shield Specialization is mostly meant for the first few levels where you are likely to be using a one-hander," but this is ridiculous for two reasons. One, high-dps staves are easily available from vendors and quests starting well before level 10, and considering [1-20 is less than 10% of the leveling experience,](https://i.redd.it/9xn9qd1gi0z21.png) shouldn't we allocate our points for the long haul? 
---
Shaman tanks are legit (you acknowledge that) and they're great for 5man dungeons, but you should really think about other situations when you want to use shields. Most if not all zones have elites/elite quests which are group content. This shield talent gives you edge in such situations.
---
The 5% max mana talent is pretty bad and is used only as filler. It doesn't decrease your downtime at all, you just have very slightly larger mana pool. Sure, it's your go-to choice at 60 but you'll be probably re-speccing at 60 anyways.
---

---
In theory I'm right there with you mate, but with an increasingly stressful job and a social life on the side, I still haven't found the time to do one complete BRD run, which easily takes 3 hours. So sometimes, I just want to kill that Golem Dude in hopes of getting some sweet pants. I think there's a place for both - full runs and skip runs.
---
I am willing to spend 100g on it. If I don't see it drop and If I can find it on AH (which I can't right now).
---
That doesn't mean that I don't deserve it when it drops. Unless we have to come out and just clearly define that ALL tradable drops are free for EVERYONE to need on, because they can sell it and use the gold to buy an item they actually need for example.
---
Which is not something I think is the norm right now. If BoE Plate drops in a party of 1 warrior and 4 mages, and the item is an upgrade for the warrior, you'd expect the mages to not roll need.
---
So if an alchemy recipe drops in a party with only 1 alchemist, who will use that recipe, why would it be different?
---
Enjoy your clazzik quality MangOS experience I guess.
---
Modern Blizz is such a joke ofc.
---
Shouldn't be necessary when a group is advertised as a "full run" and it's brought up ahead of time and no one objects, but nevertheless, here we are.
---
Yeah, I have the Dreadforge Retaliator already so I was thinking about this considering the difficult I'll face getting the MH Dal'Rend to go with the OH I already have. Thanks!
---
You are definitely an idiot if you spend all your time grinding gold and other stuff to give to streams. Streamers may as well take advantage of these simpletons.
---
The way I think about reserving an item is. You need a tank and I can tank. I don't really want to tank but I do want this item. So if you can give me this item I will tank for you.
---
and 2% to hit as well. That things is BiS for a good few phases yet

I work in IT. It takes a while for me to get upset.

Unless you think saying "I downvote posts like yours now" contribute to the discussion.

I downvote people like you :)
---
You should look at the wow keybinds under TARGETING, it will give you many ingame options, how to do it. Just as how you can have a macro that attacks the target (or just targets) the same thing your tank is attacking, so can a multiboxer.

I know, but the build up with "his first swing" as if something truly amazing was going to happen was kind of a let down when he was given the crit for free.  Better example of the weapon's power would have been shown had the guy been standing like a normal situation.  Make more sense?

Same on my realm (Venoxis-DE): pretty much exclusively full runs (only exception being SM GY rare hunting in the 30s, but that dungeon is so tiny we usually ended up doing all of it anyway) of low level instances, now in BRD the first partial runs are very commonplace. Considering the size of this particular instance, it's not surprising though. If I had to do a full run of BRD everytime I want to have a shot at the Arena caster belt, I'd not be getting that belt.
---
This community gets extremely jealous in posts like this.

I played on tichondrius beginning in 05 and rolling need on high value BOEs was super common.

That's why I say go for a Normal realm if you are new. Don't listen to the PvP is the true and best Vanilla experience bullshit.
---
Income, probably.
---
balance is mana hungry, and not good for leveling due to the down time, max level its pretty good PvP since druid mobility and ranged attacks.
---
Feral leveling is most efficient, by far, you can still use balance spells, and when you get to lvl35 you start speccing into HotW which increases your mana pool by a large amount, more useful for balance than half the balance talents.

If you look at _context_ which is something a lot of people don't do, it isn't.
---
I was pointing out negativity towards people who were innocent, which is something I think happens a lot in this subreddit, for no reason other than a manifestation of jealousy.
---
&gt;"one of those drooling sycophants following these streamers around giving them shit."
---
Calling someone a "drooling sycophant" is what I call being negative. Here it isn't even "someone" it's "people" in general, specifically people who follow streamers and contribute in their community. 
---
So, I think that's not something I want to see in this subreddit and I voice my opinion of it.
---
You are calling me out, in a very amusing manner by using my own words, on also being negative. But I wasn't being negative in the same way as he was, because he's targeting it towards a general group of people that weren't doing anything negative to begin with. While I was targeting it towards him.
---
I understand you (and a lot of other people) probably just don't like the way I said "I advice you to step back and blabla" because it makes me sound condescending and that makes my message immediately void because now I'm an asshole and whatever it is I was trying to say doesn't matter anymore.

You sacrifice a good amount of offensive stats for armor on plate gear, which is why leather warriors were always a thing for DPS. If you're trying to solo stuff as a Paladin, even if you're prot spec as I am currently (20/31/0, hybrid that can raid heal as well) you'd still want to use a 2H weapon over sword and board for soloing content.
---
The only place you want a shield is when you're tanking or PVP healing in BG's and the only place you want plate armor is generally PVP and tanking.
---
Thanks so much! I'll give it a try now.
---
Would you say its certainly better than playing without this?
---
You really missed out on consecration, its the most important tool and obligatory for prot palas, its better than everything the prot tree has to offer. I would really advise you to respec and get that, it should have been your first priority before switching over to the prot tree even if you were going pure tank.
---
Pala levelling also isnt nearly as slow as you (and many others) think. A pure ret build with decent gear can solo farm and quest very efficiently, and a prot pala with consecration can always pull and kill 2-3+ mobs at a time, and once he gets really good gear he's the only class that can even come somewhat close to mage aoe farming (with absolute bis endgame gear even better in certain areas, due to certain items like skullflame or the engi shield or the 16 "thorn"-dmg trinket from ragnaros).
---
Well Im playing on a PvP Server, so I can't complain about getting ganked. I had a lot of fun. I really enjoy helping players from the other faction. The moment they see me and starting to panic is awesome :'D I even did a elite quest with a human warrior, it was fucking awesome, he helped me while the shaman was just running away instead of healing me. He knew Im going to die so he taunted the mobs an we killed them together. I love this game, so many awesome memories
---
Guy makes an attempt of freeing himself from an addictive video game, reddit tries to pull him back in
---
Definitely not solo. A decent aoe dungeon group for 24 hours might get you there.
---
why is that? I mean the feral on classic part
---
Ya i was thinking about that but not sure of the spec or most important to be too weak for tanking,
---
of course i don't plan to go full green or else but wondering the ability to tank
---
Alliance players are already higher than horde levelers there. Maybe he called his ?? friend because a group of orange/red allies ganked him over and over again? It's a vicious circle, but a little bit spoiled on alliance side.
---
Not at all. The number of people playing as frequently as you and therefore around the level to be doing dungeons with you is far smaller than the population of the whole server. The number of those people playing the same hours of the day as you is smaller again. The number of those people who will be around in a couple months is smaller again. The number of those people who are at the ends of the good guy/dickhead bell curve is tiny. Reputations already matter, and my server has 100,000 characters.
---
From a tank perspective - doing Vaults and Darkvire is a fucking chore and its not even close. Arena takes 1 fire elemental - everything else can be skipped. Anger takes 1 middle lenght corridor and 3 more packs.
---
I'd rather add Golem to the mix to make clothiers happy with drops there (literally nothing in there for me) than do the Vaults and Darkvire, going there only SEEMS to be quick, its nothing close to being quick. Compared to the Golem where you pull packs of 6-8 regular mobs and delete them (which in a sense is a part of the boss). Also fight is more challenging and priests learn about positioning from that fight. Also can make hunter happy with Guzzler goblin kill for quiver just for a price of 4 fire elementals if we need to.
---
If you wanna do the Vaults and Darkvire just go for keyforging run, There are shoulders from Interrogator and earth elemental, arena has its own merits, then you have vaults and your bis pantaloons from Ironfel dwarf. That's literally what you should be doing instead of Arena / Anger / Golem runs if you wanna kill these bosses.
---
Gross. 
---
Fuck Grizzly - they collude with Horde.
---
Honestly your missing out, that place is a fucking gold mine.
---
I started soloing her at 57, still level 57 now.
---
I can just about sneak past all the trash packs, but some of them are veeeery close, by a knife edge. I imagine if you were 56 or lower, you would aggro some of them.
---
So basically you have no idea what you are talking about
---
Hey what’s the add on that shows a yellow dot as a chest? Thanks
---
Hello,
---
I've just exited the low level-dom area (which, for me, is &lt;40). Focusing on questing mainly and doing some dungeons, pretty much at least once, for the quests.
---
Been focusing on my professions lately. All above 225 :) Alchemy 272, close to that mongoose potion unlock.
---
I really wanna level an alt mage but I don't have that kind of time. Such is life over 25 or so..
---
Listening to Prison Mike talk about the Dementors while I grind is just the best.
---
It honestly depends on what the prices are on your server and how many of the main ingredient you can get. For some of the items the profit margin is really small. For some, it just isn't likely. Bear Meat needs to be under 6 copper a piece which just isn't likely, but is theoretically possible. Some are just not possible at all. Mightfish Steak,  for example, vendors for 18c, significantly less than the cost of the spices needed, which are 1s80c, to cook it so will always vendor at a loss, even if you get the fish for free.
---
Most of my crafting is done in time where I normally wouldn't be able to fully commit to playing anyway. I can't play while cooking dinner, showering, bathing or otherwise taking care of my kid or doing chores so rather than have that time wasted, I set myself up with enough to craft lots of one specific item, click 'Create All' and then go and do what I need to do. I'll maybe check back in every so often to see if I have run out of materials, or bags are full of stuff and I can't craft any more. I'll sell those, normally to the trade/general goods vendor I'm standing at, buy more bits if needed and repeat.
---
I have gone AFK crafting easily 200+ food items or more occasions than I care to count.
---
Ideally you do want to sell to another player or through the AH and you can significantly increase your profit margins. The issue with having servers with a high population of lower levelled players is that everyone is making and trying to sell the same things, plus a lot of people just do not have the spare cash to buy items with marked up prices.
---
These are some easy to make items which might help you make profit, or it may help you level a profession on the cheap or even for free. I actually made profit levelling my First Aid by opting to buy only Silk under 2s a piece which is about what it is going for anyway on my server at this time. Silk bandages sell for 2s each, heavy silk for 4s so if I could get the cloth under 2 and vendor the finished products they were all profitable. Mageweave bought for under 4s and only making Mageweave Bandages. I skipped making Heavy Mageweave entirely because I couldn't find the cloth under the 3s a piece I needed to make profit off Heavy Mageweave badages (sell for 6 silver but use 2 cloth). Admittedly I wasn't getting a lot of skill ups when it went green so it did take longer to get to 270. Heavy MW Bandages would have been quicker, but it would have cost me money to level because I would have sold the bandages at a loss.
---
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
---
no, greens are nowhere near worth what a rare/epic is worth.
---
also, if you disagree, fine. you do you but don't fucking come here crying like a little baby when someone ninja's from  you - because that's what your rules allow. That's what you accept when you follow them.
---
okay
---
Ok, maybe "anything" was a bit too all inclusive of a word.
---
Missing out man that place is a gold mine.
---
Firstly, he is saying that rare BoE is worth the same amount to everyone decided by the AH value. If that item didn’t drop and they had to buy it off the AH it would cost them X but since it dropped in a dungeon they made X amount of money by not having to buy it. Secondly, he is also saying that X value should be rolled on by everyone in the dungeon since they all worked together to earn it instead of one person being favored.
---
I had an account perma banned 1 day before TBC released, I can tell you what NOT to do...
---
So I'm 17-18 yrs old hyped af for the first Wow expansion when BOOM! The ban hammer strikes (my fault, ngl). So obviously being addicted to World of War rack, I lost my shit. I tried appealing,  which didn't work so I tried appealing some more which (surprise) didn't work.
---
At this point I'm desperate, I had multiple lvl 60's a few 50+ some twinks and a fuck load of cash... All gone!
---
Then I have this amazing idea!
---
My head: 'Right bro, nothings working but I got you, hear me out.'
---
'OK what you got for me?'
---
'Wow has had some bad press about people dying over this game, depression, breaking up families etc, let's use this info!'
---
'um OK how?'
---
'email blizzard, tell them that Wow is your life and that you  are so depressed over this ban, your just gonna end your life... They wouldn't want more bad press, they'll definitely give your account back!'
---
*Tap* *Tap* *Tap* SEND!
---
Im at work the next day, gets a phone call... Local police... I explain what I was trying to do and that resulted in me getting roasted by a police officer.
---
TLDR: Don't say you'll harm yourself in an attempt to get your ban overturned.
---
That is technically true, but usually not a reason to give it to anyone for this bit of extra FR. If your guild can and has made Hand of Rag, you likely shouldn't have an issue killing anything that requires fire resist (Ony/Rag). The truth is if you are in a good guild, you never really need fire resist at all. Resists really come into play in AQ and Nax with nature and frost resist. Some guilds have their DPS pop fire protection potion on drakes in BWL, just so you can smash them quickly and speed things up without any danger.
---
TL;DR You are correct, but...
---
Is this a new copypasta? Because I saw it already in this thread.
---
Happened to me the other day, it said "25:00pm"
---
I mean it's cdew so, yea? When the other Binding drops for Asmon it'll be earned as well, because he's the MT for his guild and MT very often gets Tfury first. 
---
Are you somehow surprised the player heavily associated with shaman pvp gets the weapon most associated with shaman pvp in classic? If an Eye drops during a raid Esfand is leading then guess what, the guy who is obsessed with ret is going to get it. 
---
The fact that they're streamers isn't relevant, those are literally the specs who should be getting those items. Listen, if soda's guild gives him their first Atiesh that's one thing but seeing cdew with a Hand doesn't remotely smell of "handout".
---
Some of it is 100% accurate, some of it is not. Take with a grain of salt and double check. Voidwalker was overtuned on Pservers so people found out using felhunter is actually quite good if not better. Frontstabbing was a known pserver bug that none really expected to work in classic.
---
&gt; They could put the horde players on queu or just not let to make horde characters etc but nothing was done. 
---
LOL !  
---
Are you serious with that awnser ?  
---
Back in the days i played on a Ally dominated server and i didnt even cry that hard.  
---
when BG's are out, you will have a low que timer for BG's
---
The game is now live for about a month, and you are already showing this kind of negative attitude.  
---
IMO its best you quit playing at all...
---
It's same with tanking. Got party invite to arena runs, there is warrior 60 in party (war60 looking for tank in 50 content, thats always good sign) and they tell me that i can't roll on armor (without giving any hint beforehand).  
---
So yeah you just want me to tank 3 bosses for literally 1 upgrade for me, where i'll have to roll need with 3 other people? Nah I guess ill start my own group.
---
I’m 35, and it’s used in general as a way to describe poor managers in my profession too.  It’s a widespread term and certainly not only used just by “gamer kids.”

But priest doesn't have any CC other than a mass fear - which is probably the worst PvE CC spell when there're many mobs around.

Yea, in this case I'm for bringing back this little change. It solves so many petty little arguments.

[Something like this?] (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305011302-05050104525010051) - just standard-ish PvE fury (not sure if that's the go-to spec).

It's interesting how many people seem to do this, it seems to be so widespread yet I've never been able to understand the mentality behind it. 
---
I used to see this kind of thing all the time when I played Runescape - you'd see people deciding "I'm quitting" but it's never enough to just unsubscribe from the game and leave it. They'd always have to drop/delete every item they own and completely screw themselves over so they *couldn't* return, then they'd always be back 2 days later rebuilding their character's wealth from scratch.
---
Or when people are going away to college and they decide "I'm not going to need these old games anymore" so they sell or give away all their old Nintendo 64 favourites, only to think about them again a couple years later and regret selling them.
---
I guess I just don't understand the mentality behind it and why people have to screw their future selves over and why everything has to be so final, especially when people so often end up coming back just a few days later.
---
Lol no, your killing speed takes a huge jump forward the moment you get cat. Bear is only for tanking and some special situation when you fight multiple mobs.
---
but there's no guarantee that they will equip it
---
there's also no guarantee that they don't already have the item but haven't equipped it yet (or on that run as it's a off-spec item)
---
and there's no guarantee that someone else won't roll need and win the roll and ninja the item
---
your system is flawed. follow it but don't cry when someone abuses it. you can't abuse need rolls for boe's.
---
The difference is that you can not buy BoP items on the AH.
---
nice
---
it was hardly the difficulty, just the fact that dungeon farming is incredibly strong and it was never a thing on pservers due to the servers not having the extra bonus exp that dungeon elites gives.
---
Yup Welcome to Classic and ppl thinking that its "retail" (i dont like talking like that but its kinda accurate here)
---
As a Warrior u can try few more things, but most important talk to ppl or put symbols ( but even so..).
---
So these days i kinda Battle Stance -&gt; Charge, Thunder Clap, Demo Shout, Buffing shoot (that generates more aggro if 4+ members in range), Switch to FURY stance, the free rage spell that generate rage, WW sometimes then go back to defensive stance and Vengeance everytime its up on every mobs.
---
Also try to kinda play cooking game style lie Overcooking, u "feed aggro" more to the focus but u also feed the other one when u can, a little vengeance on the other one, sudden armor on the other etc
---
Extended character stats
---
On the other hand there are way more horde players than alliance in hillsbrad.
---
Also you don't get to dictate where it is okay to gank/get ganked.
---
Tldr; stop crying or reroll pve.
---
I see an Asmond post,
---
I down vote !
---
Mighty is the wind, but you can still break it.
---
Meditate on this.
---
Yes, it totally isn't hard, give the right preperation (knowing the spots, rested XP etc) but it's impossible due to competition in everything
---
no, there is a fundamental difference between:
---
- items that are below rares
---
- rare/epic BoPs
---
- rare/epic BoEs
---
If you think they are all the same thing, I'm just wasting my time on you.
---
8 ingots = varies by server a lot, I'm seen a few for like 350g but never more than a couple on AH so getting 8 might be a lot more expensive. That's ~3k gold at least.
---
50 Arcanite Bars @40g each = 2k gold
---
Everything else = less than 1k gold
---
So uh, around 6k? But greatly depends on how much you get the ingots for. Plus a blacksmith to make the hammer, the plans cost 1 additional ingot.
---
You don't need resist gear tbh. Im a warlock and last week we killed rag with a half guild half pug raid and I had maybe 25 fire resist on my own just the ony attune neck and +10 on boots.
---
Well to be honest I view hand of rag as a symbol of gratitude for a deserving guildie. I would totally be down to give it to a druid even just for walking around in city. Of course I would never expect others to want that as some classes can actually use it in pvp but you know.
---
LvL 40 druid with 21 point in feral. How can I keep aggro on multiple mob in dungeon ? 
---
I'm always rage starved and can't really use swipe.
---
I know that mobs should be focus one by one by the dps but let's be realist : 90% of the time the mobs die at the exact same time 😅
---
What do I do ?
---
Thanks !
---
Well, you didnt REALLY know things like weapon proc rates that have quite a big affect on BIS lists etc.
---
And ragnaros was steamrolled on week 1 because of bugged XP in instances (in raids). Private server people would have killed ragaros anyways AS soon as they got enough ppl to 60 and the douse quests done.
---
This is amazing. Thank you. This makes it much easier to read. I'll update the sheet again, though I have changed the B to a C to match the Copper listing, rather than Bronze that we use.
---
you do you but if you get ninja'd from because you follow a flawed system, don't come crying here.
---
Can you explain why it's so bad? You can just not join those groups. Typically I find multiple people in a group will end up wanting a different item but will work together to at least give each boss a shot under the agreement to let each person get what they want should it drop.
---
People who reserve everything under the sun should knock that off though. It's not fair or practical.
---
woah there, satan
---
Tankadin would solve that issue with ease :0
---
Try writing this in your chat:
---
`/script ResetInstances()`
---
Thanks!  Any screenshots btw?
---
Also, if you send your pet to attack opposing faction in Gadget, do guards attack it?
---
Except one of these people has a legacy name. And the other a poor imagination. lol
---
Makes me miss my parents dog :D
---
can't wait to see him again.
---
There’s no reason that shouldn’t work.  Does for me.
---
***D O N ' T  \_ T O U C H \_ M E !***
---
Same dude, doing my thing in the office half asleep but pumped up to do some brd run tonight
---
Efficiency.
---
Haven’t had that problem, but it seems to interrupt my TSM scans now *every time.*
---
Auctioneer does an auto scan when I open the AH.  Wait for it to finish, “/tsm scan.”
---
Auctioneer begins its own scan.  TSM scanning is now on cool down.
---
Do a full 5-10 min scan on auctioneer, so maybe it doesn’t interrupt?  Doesn’t work either.
---
Barrens chat doesn’t count that shits always going to be bad. You go in knowing that lol
---
There is no global rule, you are playing with other humans, not with the game in itself here.
---
Different guilds / raid groups have different philosophies. However most if not all will chose a new member who is here over a new member who isn't.
---
Once you are a regular things can be different.
---
How you get this gold?
---
in numbers, quite successful but the true success of classic relies on people sticking around, not high initial player numbers so its too early to tell. In terms of actual gameplay, it's failing to live up to expectations so far, clearly it was rushed to release due to the summer promise, but hopefully it will get better.
---
&gt; It's like that for all the lists.
---
I've seen discussions about shamans that the BiS lists for resto do the opposite of what you're saying. I.e. tier 1 is only bis because of the set bonus and most BiS I've seen lists T1 as BiS for resto for phase 1.
---
Not needing is dumb because you’re just leaving yourself to be ninjad. I need and then let the people that ACTUALLY need it have it/if nobody needs it just have everyone roll on it so it doesn’t get ninjad and the dumbasses that greeded it have a chance at getting it. 
---
That being said, I personally don’t think it’s fair to arbitrarily assign whether it’s ok to need or greed based on value of the item. I can understand why people do it, but hiding behind the merchant class BIS excuse is just flattery for being a ninja.
---
Ganking is a part of life on PvP realms sadly.
---
I dunno if there are realm transfers in Classic, you should play on a PvE realm if you do not enjoy PvP.
---
Don't listed to the BS about PvP being the only REAL multiplayer experience. During leveling you will be helped out and help out people during difficult quests interacting and communicating with them which forms connections.
---
Don't let the PvP elitists fool you!
---
That's what happened to me in every single horde/contested zone as alliance. I get jumped by high levels constantly.
---
In a solo pve scenario? Yea, that's pretty much what it means.
---
come back later! :D
---
Sitting on 1k is a terrible idea unless you've already invested a bunch of it.
---
&gt;Yeah this is a pvp server, go to STV and try killing hordes with same lvl as you. Nah, you can't kill em'. Right?
---
I agree with you completely. It's sad, but it's true - the cap on the ignorelist is too low.
---
As for people saying that if you have more than x on ignore then you're the problem, don't mind them. They're probably the ones you want on ignore anyways.
---
I've played from 2005-2010 on a full realm and my ignore list through out was single digit. Calssic is different. There are plenty of toxic people with dog shit personalities and absolutely disruptive mentality. And this is not only because of larger realm size. You still meet a ton of nice and civil players, but unfortunately there is also a lot of fucking assholes. And why should we get forced to install addons to deal with assholes?  
---
You have my vote.
---
Most raiding guilds wouldn't prioritize it to a shaman. Being a streamer certainly gives the privilege of being allowed to gear up a meme spec.
---
Glorious, I was about to do Blasted Lands quests. I guess I'll wait it out and do it at night, the best questing hours.
---
It can certainly be used for that. Just not the all star score.
---
While lvling youre shit out of luck. Priests are better for spellcleave and shaman is better for everything else. I dont know how it is on the alliance side tho.
---
I'm a holy pally and here we go again...
---
You're doing good.
---
If you can't hold AoE aggro using that technique, ask the group to wait 3 seconds before joining in. If they do that and it still happens, ask the group to wait 5 secconds before joining in.
---
Also if it doesn't work, stop trying to AoE them and just mark a skull target, ask the hunter to not multishot until later in the battle, ask the mage to focus the skull first with single target damage before going AoE.
---
People that are going to keep playing classic will need to recalibrate to dps-ers being responsible for aggro.
---
Why is layering even in the game when servers only have 2 layers at most anyway, clearly mass layering isn't needed.
---
ONE BUTTON ONE ACTION
---
I feel you, it really put me off too.
---
Just don't take it personally, the tank losing threat as much the DPS's fault as it is the Tanks.
---
I had a Warlock in Mara pull aggro from me even tho I was high 50's. The I realised he'd just DoT everything up, life tap down to no health, spam shadow bolts, and then start Hellfiring.
---
Had to drink and eat after every fight.
---
I remember back in the day, even in TBC, it was more about pacing yourself for breaks rather than seeing how fast you can OOM yourself.
---
Suspecting newer players are playing the damage meters rather than the actual game.
---
We have one of those pserver people in the guild and we keep baiting him into discussions to shut down all his statements cause we are aholes
---
 *All* Of This *Has Happened Before And Will Happen Again*
---
what kinda attitude is that? When 1 person gets something dope the guild helps out.
---
We have 3 priests with benediction / anathema, and a lot of people helped them with the quest.
---
Ye, I was thinking about what Kargoz said about speed leveling as bear until 24 I think. I used cat the moment I got it and didn't really notice a big difference then, but then again I wasn't really thinking about it. I do notice the dps now at later levels which makes cat dps waaay superior to bear.
---
Wierd my farming rotation is having my Pet pull 4 mob then gather them up and and dps them down. While skinning those mobs I pick up 4 more.
---
Sure the pet can’t do this on its own. But if you are new to the game a tankier pet might be useful.
---
Wow. I'm really glad I've never had to deal with people like this or some of the other whackjobs in this thread who don't understand basic vanilla loot practices...
---
**You only roll need on** ***any*** **BoE because the** ***item itself*** **is a direct upgrade for you on the character you're currently playing, and you intend to use/equip it (on that same character) ASAP. If you're rolling on a BoE for the money, you roll greed, like every other halfway decent human being who's playing this game.**
---
Every class needs gold, yeah. That's why we're rolling greed and not passing.
---
 log·ic 
---
 reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity.  
---
* the systematic use of symbolic and mathematical techniques to determine the forms of valid deductive argument.plural noun: **logics**
---
* the quality of being justifiable by reason.
---
No one can be a ninja in a situation where everyone get a roll 1-100. If you feel the class that can use it should have it, give it to that person. That's what is great about BoE items, you can decide to equip it, sell it, or give it to the class that gets the most from it. If you choose to greed you've passed on the roll if anyone else needs the item. So, if you truly feel the class that gets the most out of it should have it, it would behoove you to roll need with everyone else. Or at least wait until everyone else has rolled, so that if someone does try to ninja an item in a group where rolling greed has been agreed to as default, you can challenge a ninja's need roll too.
---
Banned from a server (player run), not the game
---
[My Boa](http://imgur.com/a/bVWo21V) hangs out on top of my monitors/pc case (wherever heat is) and hangs down from my mic stand sometimes to give me kisses.
---
I don't know, maybe your miserable attitude?
---
What do you mean, so you're okay ninja'ing boes but when it's your bop's suddenly you want people to be decent? Money is money, and everyone NEEDS it, right?
---
My dog does the same thing. I hate it because they get it your way, but it's also super cute and sweet that they're taking interest in what you're doing even if they don't understand it. Luckily for her I have a bean bag sat in front of a TV, so she can sit and fall asleep on my lap if she wants instead of walking all over my keyboard.
---
I’d always greed on any blue/purple BOE if I couldn’t benefit from the actual item and someone in the group could, just doesn’t feel like the right way to treat people who are mega excited for hopefully a great upgrade.
---
After all, you’re needing on the BoE imo to say you need that specific  item for your character, like with any loot drop, your need relates specifically to the benefit that item provides, ie the stats, the loot box is not asking you if you need the potential gold it could be worth on the AH
---
That's a lie. What are you even talking about?
---
You basically just said "People have a lot to give, even if they have nothing to give" lolwut?
---
This is just so freaking great! It has a weird almost Pulp feel to it, I love it :)

---
Especially if it's a streamer.
---
In raw dps you need 6-8 int for 1 spellpower.
---
My dog is literally doing this to me right now. Pretty much the exact same kind of dog a poodle x, just loves sitting on laps.
---
Same on ZT. A mage and hunter just sniping Horde for two hours, I encouraged people to report them for cheating.
---
It's pretty stupid. The roof top thing is harder to do anyway but that ship is literally something you can just walk into and the guards don't do shit. If I try to attack as a melee I get shot to pieces. So the guards DO have a ranged attack...
---
I know some things, not a lot and certainly not everything.
---
Tip: Q and E (default) are strafe buttons, use the mouse to turn 90 degrees to run past at full speed without a chance of getting dazed
---
Thankgod, this was bothering me too and I never met the guy. Glad he's okay. And I am surprised by what the "internet" as you say, (just pathetic weasels in life IMO)  do that  to the wrong person one day. World doesn't need people like that, nor care bout what happens to them.  
---
Unbelievable... just pisses me off.  
---
Anyway, good on you for caring bout your friend, and blizzard helping out in timely fashion too, whatever the actual situation you're  dealing with I hope you figure it out and godspeed to you brother. peace
---
We saw a couple guild members take the last minute transfers today before they closed. 
---
It’s come to the point where as a guild, we will likely only World PvP in a raid or in BGs. 
---
Money making in the world is futile, don’t even bother. Go for what you need and get back to dungeons. 
---
Dungeons are the only consistent money making for us, and it means we have zero interaction with Horde.
---
I didnt play much cata but I would argue paladins came into their own in wrath. Both ret and prot became both viable and good, something that cant be said about vanilla or tbc
---
I leveled a warlock to 60 it took me just about 9 days played in game. Between retail and private servers this is probably the 6th character I got to 60 so I know a relatively quick route. If this is your first time playing and you just now started using questie I'd guess it will take you at least double that amount of time. It's not a bad thing at all if your having fun. If you want to go faster make sure your grabbing all the quests in an area and try and do them all before you leave, sometimes 2 or 3 quests will send you to the same place so instead of running back and forth 3 times you only run once. Things like that can save you massive amounts of time. Other then that as your running around kill random mobs for xp.
---
Wow does not drop sacks of 500gold. If the game did I would be all for everyone needing on that.
---
Last time I was playing a game, I came across this guy looking for his mate Gavin. Sure would like to know what happened to him.

---
Why is this here?   It works according to people in the thread.  There is no blue response.  We don't need to make this a mirror of the Blizzard forums by posting everything there here.
---
its unfair for one player to use 5 characters
---
&gt;No it didn't 
---
It did, and he had to leverage this fact several times after getting banned for multiboxing. They unbanned him every time.
---
And that's your experience there. I had the exact same experience trying to quest there as alliance; getting constantly gangbanged by higher level horde until I realised that was not a good area for anyone to quest.
---
Wow. Did not notice her when I was there.
---
Same for Zandalar Tribe, although I'm not sure about that people being friendlier part, there are nice people and assholes like everywhere else.
---
What I was getting at (very poorly) was just that. It is more of a status thing that you give to a guildy who you think deserves it, but won't make or break anything as far as raiding goes.
---
Do you tab between targets if there's more than one? Do you stop when selecting area for blizzard?
---
I would probably focus on green plate gear with +int &amp; stam (of the eagle?) and just keep raiding trying to find those very few pieces. If your only healing you can just keep your alt set in the bank
---
The tier sets will help alot for this and look bad ass
---
pretty sure its BIS through naxx aswell
---
Dude... not cool.
---
You probably can with either grinding or quests, or at least close to 24 hours.
---
If you average about 3\~ hours per level it's doable.
---
Pretty cool, didn’t know you could do that.
---
Nah, just a moron voicing an opinion vehemently .
---
Stranglekelp actually makes free action potions, which are very useful.
---
I as a rogue who levels exactly like that, feel uncomfortable now &gt;:(
---
Correct on both counts. But you did make me remember another source of healing. Second wind. Oh and enraged regeneration
---
Most groups add Golemlord to the mix as he is right after angerforge and drops bis healing trinket and boots.
---
A popular multiboxer is called "preparedwow" he used to do mupltiple pvp events with his own 40 man multibox.

You can take Furor by lvl 30 or so. And you probably should, at least on PvP server.
---
This is my brother Daryl and this is my other brother Daryl.
---
Flight from IF to Menithal Harbor is 2 mins flight from SW to Booty Bay is over 5 mins. From Menithal you can get to darn or dustwallow for ony. From booty bay you can only get to rachet. Do I really need to keep going?
---
You've met my future self then. :D
---
Surprisingly, we can't find any higher level hordes to guard us near the cave.
---
I don't think you can 100% consistently avoid damage starting out. Maybe if the lava damage shares the same tick as something you can observe. Once you're in the lava if you take damage while jumping you need(?) to delay the next jump to get onto the no damage cycle. So whether or not you take at least one tick of lava damage is effectively random for most players
---
or more specifically, LFG BRD Save Princess Runs
---
You can get on top of the gates of of stormwind using slow fall
---
Needs Dance with the Dead for a theme song.
---
It is.
---
Backpedal into the next mob you need to kill for the quest makes rogues happy.
---
It was default bound to numlock for me
---
Because you typical get reserves on the rarer items and there are more people than just the tank or group leader who need that item. People tend to Reserve items when they have run the same dungeon over and over and not saw or won the item they want, so they try increase their chances of getting it by reserving it. This happens A LOT in UBRS and LBRS groups because
---
1) All warriors/rogues want Dal Rends swords
---
2) All casters want Briarwood trinket
---
3) Everyone wants gemstones from LBRS for UBRS key
---
It is bait and switch. When they originally announced it, they said a few weeks. And they have an easy alternative. Queues.
---
Holy shit.
---
I love the color scheme
---
But maybe I want Mop servers because the PvP and class identity was pretty good there. Where is my MoP server? It literally never ends. They shouldn't bother with any expansion servers at all.
---
Oh yeah, and wolves, my bad
---
As a Paladin I need the devout shoulders too! It’ll help me heal better and have more mana.
---
Mark the kill target. This usually helps.
---
Tbf, there's a lot less (or should be) compute going on in classic. Spells/auras are more basic, no character tailored/scaled content, no quest phasing, no per-zone sharding etc.
---
Thanks, I know this armor probably won't last me past 40 but I wanted to get it early and the ability is nice on it so it's worth to have around even if I don't have it equipped :).
---
if you think BoPs and BoEs are the same then you're a waste of time.
---
the game isn't balanced around BoEs, it's balanced around BoPs.
---
If you are friends with any warlocks go to a place with any kind of elementals have them banish and you can bash away till you max out your skill.
---
Wtf that warrior is in my guild. This is Flamelash-Du
---
The first week of launch though, good god...
---
CAREBEAR
---
:)
---
you do you but don't come here crying when you get ninja'd from for following a shitty ass system
---
&gt; The value of equipping the item should be considered first, before monetary value comes into consideration.
---
This is absolutely the case for BoP items. 
---
&gt;  That's the point of need and greed. The people that have butchered the definition of need to include monetary value are just greedy, plain and simple.
---
Bind on pick up and bind on equip items are inherently different. You don't Need any bind on equip item to progress. Edgemaster's Handguards are a BiS for fury warriors up to Naxx. There were, and will be in classic, plenty of fury warriors unwilling/unable to pay for them. These same fury warriors will still be raiding MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 &amp; 40, and Naxx. The way people are unable to grasp that BoP and BoE items have incredibly different values is incredulous.
---
Progression is important, but saying an item that is marginally better than another negates 4 other players chance to benefit from the sale, comes across as extremely entitled.
---
If I remember correctly the recipe is limited supply, which means she'll only sell it within a time frame of the last time she sold it assuming it's purchased. I'd check classic wowhead comments for the timer.
---
You watch Trevor Noah's shows...poor soul!
---
So I'm botting because my ingame macro commands the pet to attack then casts hunter's mark?
---
Thought i'm the only one never learning it lol
---
Let's start a support group
---
Gadgetzan is such a poorly laid out area. I've seen a duo killing people there for a while, they didn't even abuse any terrain, just carefully picked spots without guards around. Even inside the town there seems to be plenty of safe spots. They did mess up a few times but for the most part guards didn't notice them.
---
It's supposed to take like 3 minutes but in my experience it takes alot longer which is probably why most groups want to skip it. There is nearly always some dude stepping on the eggs, and every time a Rogue goes to activate the crystal some whelps spawn there so he has to wait for them to despawn.
---
yeah and the person who 'deserves' it wouldn't have gotten it if not for the group. 
---
it's a group effort, so the group should have a chance for it.
---
46 Undead mage
---
70g + normal mount 
---
Gear - anything I can fukin find that is an upgrade
---
Tryna gear myself better.. just doing ZF spell cleave runs atm
---
That very much depends on the server you play on it seems. On Everlook whenever someone asks to do the extra boss we do it.
---
Improved Wand, Improved PWS, Improved Fort in disc. Spirit Tap in shadow. Then honestly it doesnt really matter. Just buff your friend and use PWS to gather mobs without being dazed, help wand down the runners.
---
Thank you😉
---
The good wvw comes with the bad. Pvp is great if you can live through the tough times.
---
Yeah it’s just strange losing like 50 rolls in row. what are the odds? But then always winning the boss drops. Idk
---
Use Maul instead of Swipe. It costs less rage and generates a ton of threat.
---
Basically what the other person said. You NEED plate for pvp as holy or you’re gonna get clapped hard. Also your best friend will be a warrior. You keep them healed and let the freedoms fly and he will tear apart every butthole from storm wind to thunder bluff for you.
---
I disagree, having a tank along massively improves the quality of life for spellcasters.
---
[x] A bunch of people who happen to share the same twisted and weird sense of humor.
---
Spooky
---
3 hours per level in the 50-60 range as a warrior ? Dunno if it’s possible
---
Isn't that exactly how the world first one got made in EU?
---
Like its a guild wide effort to get it, if they cant afford it rn, then they can borrow the funds and return them later ofc. Idk why this is so weird for some people to get.
---
For the best of reasons!
---
Enjoy
---
Yeah this bugging the hell out me too.  Really wish they'd sort the desktop app integration for classic
---
I'm not a fan of multiboxers myself but this:
---
&gt;One command = one action
---
can easily be argued to mean Macros are also cheating.
---
If you're two DPS looking to get a group together, you have to start your own.
---
...and you can use the data of those trades to extrapolate a market value

I've got a lvl 28 priest I level on my own and and a lvl 26 mage i level with a friend. I don't have loads of free time to play so it's just something i pick up now and again (which is probably better for my physical and mental health!)
---
I also couldn't care less about end game at the moment, I'm just having a blast playing the game i played all those years ago!
---
I mean, i cant stop it 100%, but it stops it most of the time.
---
Which addon do you use to show the bosses on the left and the quests on the right?
---
A warrior with a dedicated healer is scary as hell. 
---
Holy Paladins are amazing in pvp, but yeah, you need that plate gear.
---
Why waste time having fun?
---
It's *literally* Ethics 101, the day they cover Kant. If everyone lies, then no one would believe anything that was said, so lying would be pointless. The inherent contradiction in the action proves that the action is immoral.
---
Because there is no optimal solution.
---
Hunter is quite easy to learn so probably that. Rogues can do well in terms of just opening up one someone and oneshotting them with no effort at all. Literally any person with a good weapon and a thistletea can kill nonpvpers in an opener with tea.
---
New to wow here. Been playing for a month but the game is so vast that I'm still trying to understand some of the stuff I read. (Even tho I'm on reddit/forums everyday).
---
Without exploiting or anything, I can’t see better than a good dungeon group to do the 50-60 in 24 hours. 
---
In the level 51 to 55 you can try to grind the blood elves in Azshara, they are pretty squishy, with my hunter I get a XP bar every 10 min in that area
---
Grats boiz
---
horrible "music"
---
downvoted
---
This is literally the reason why i didn't pick a pvp server and i avoid it.   
---
Your best luck is to play on the low hours, or find some 60 friends/guildies to kill your campers.
---
It’s BiS for shamans as well, and I’d assume druids too. Beside, he drops the schematic for the fire reflector.
---
All good then ;)
---
Keeping up good MH is def. important. But there's really not much that can be done to prevent rogues from having a hard time leveling. Hard to get invites to dungeon farm, and they grind almost slower than warriors.
---
This is what i thought would happen.
---
no, i'm saying that your 'solution' is stupid
---
I'm tempted to actually level as holy, was thinking I'd do primarily dungeons as a healer, doing it this way over questing or soloing (though obviously I'll probably still do quests when I can and it's relatively easy), is this a good idea?
---
As a holy paladin should I be using bol or bom On tank? I never hear anyone ever even mention Bol, I just learnt it.
---
Work is DA POOP
---
nice, i'm 7 days, 4 hours at 44 /sigh
---
As one of those loading screen thingies from Civ 5 (it was 5 right...)
---
Also you need to learn how to use Frost nova to proc shatter.
---
Sounds bout right. Helm is insane
---
I quested mostly and did dungeons for the quests inside or if I needed a piece specifically.  I averaged 5-6 hrs a level as holy.  59-60 took 6 and a half hours just questing
---
simply report and they get a free ban.. problem solved, also name and shame these basterds
---
I was leveling my Paladin in Redridge last week, and a level 10 rogue shows up, twinked to hell, killing clothies over and over. 
---
I show up, start wailing on him, and he just. Won’t. Die. 
---
Bastard is hitting me with bombs and while I have no trouble surviving against him, I could not get him below 40% health. He must have had a ton of potions and bandages and bombs on him.
---
&gt; There's even idiots who steal the chest while I'm clearing my way to it. It's disgusting, but I'm not gonna put them on ignore, lol. 
---
those shitbirds are on my friends list.
---
Just hit 60 ally hunter. It's been a lot of fun pvping but im sure itll get tiring because there isn't any rest.
---
Afking in ungoro or sithilus can get your pet killed and your corpse spit on. Lol.
---
I definitely have over hundreds of kills. I wish Blizz was letting us track the kills we make vs targets that will eventually be honorable kills. That would make me so much more interested in playing actually. Right now I'm just playing farming simulator on hard.
---
They already are.
---
I've been enjoying casual classic, and countdown to classic
---
Full gear best in slots at 60 :)
---
I apologize for bring Alliance scum, I forgot there are different atrunement chains.
---
I do !
---
learn tae read ya stupid fookin’ waesa space robot
---
thats not an addon, i edit that into the video to showcase our progress :)
---
Sounds like my experience back in Vanilla.  I went for a PVP server because IRL friends.  Got to 60, hated every ganking minute of it.  Finally abandoned that guy, rerolled on PVE and was so much happier.  If you don't enjoy the PVP server experience, my advice is cut your losses and reroll sooner rather than later.
---
Which is literally what this sub is about...
---
"This group is pot-positive and we have no problems with pot other than the fact that it isn't right for us, so we keep this a *selfish* place. If your problem is with other people, other smokers, or cannabis in general then keep it about how that affect *you.*"
---
You're saying BoE upgrades aren't worth it, and yet you're also saying they're worth buying off the AH... Kinda contradicting yourself. 
---
Either way, that's just a blatant excuse, and you know it. You're stealing a possible upgrade that someone wouldn't have to buy off the AH, and hiding behind your greed to do it.
---
I've seen people argue that you should need to stop other greedy people from getting the item, which I can understand if you pug a lot. Your excuse is just some retail brain mental gymnastics, though.
---
it's not really a maze though, just hug the wall.. It's just a room with groups very close to each other with some seriously annoying mobs. Skeletons cant be hurt by magic, poisonous clouds that makes it so the group have move all the time and likely ninja pull.. The boss is garbage as the healer can't do anything and will draw aggro from all the ghosts.
---
Me and some guildies tried that addon but couldn't get the list sharing to work, does it work for you?
---
You don’t feel that it is a problem that some classes can use more items? If for example you are a rogue and I am a warrior, we group up to kill a few mobs for a quest and an epic drops. Are you fine with that I have maybe a 70% to get the item because I can use everything you can and will roll in does and I still have a lot of items only I can use so I should get them. We split the caster stuff neither of us need. Maybe you are a nice guy and is fine with your 30% chance but do you expect all rogues to be that also? Or should rogues just not play with warriors if they are not fine with having a lower chance if an epic drops?
---
The real nasty AoE shit comes when you have coordinated magi. One mage novas while the other is casting Flamestrike and CoC. That's some disgusting stuff.
---
Thank fuck this awful logic hasn't made its way to EU servers.
---
Dwarf racial.
---
While a couple of guilds have done MC in greens and blues at lvl 58, saying everyone can do that is just wrong. Those guilds have cleared MC a 100 times on private servers and know exactly what to do.
---
You can have a couple of plebs pre 60 in some bad gear and be just fine, but if your whole raid is like that then you're in for a bad time. 
---
MC raid difficulty in mechanics is a joke, but you still need gear to keep the tanks alive and to dps the bosses down.
---
I personally don't consider it a proper dungeon run unless you kill every boss in the instance reguardless of the loot they drop.
---
I don't think anyone minds it as long as you don't abuse your advantage in pvp. Defend yourself, but attacking other players when you're at a huge numbers advantage is definitely going to get you a lot of hate.
---
Outside of that, people are probably just jealous.
---
I disagree. Gold is gold, and who is to say that he deserves it any less than any other member of the party? An item’s worth is subjective. It is a value set by the player. Someone may consider 300 gold to them to be justifiable over someone equipping it, and that’s perfectly valid.
---
As soon as a fury has reached the hit cap, they should outdamage every rogue with equal gear.
---
The add-on is amazing. I just wish it worked with single click instead of two :)
---
How do you cast abilities of people you MC in pvp?
---
Yeah, a lot of them value hit over crit for casters which is just plain wrong.
---
If the water is free from a mage? I expect the person to always be drinking and not worry about them only getting 10 seconds into a water. 
---
If you paid for that shit? Different story.
---
If they use it, it's fine by me. I also like the gold, but it's fine either way.
---
oh didnt get that, mb
---
It takes aprox 10 ingame days if you are pretty casual, doing proffessions and stuff..
---
At least thats the experience of my grp of friends.. 10days +/- 1day
---
It’s always 420 somewhere
---
That's cute as hell!
---
Hopefully sooner rather than later.
---
I don't mean to sound like a jerk but if you were close why don't you know his real name and reach out to him?
---
None of you in the comments reading the undeads name
---
See, that I would be fine with. If even one of the randos I’ve played run a dungeon with or done a quest asked me to join their guild, then sure!
---
BOOOOOOOOMKINNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Mob grind? Why not just farm strath, you'll get way more money.
---
Unlucky. I have seen it 2 times in about 8 runs or so.
---
What if I can sell that Epic BoE and, with the money I make, buy my BiS Devilsaur leather armour set, or BiS epic tanking staff, etc? It would just be the equivalent of trading it in for someone you yourself can use. It’s selfish to think that no one else has a right to roll on it.
---
Now THAT is ridiculous. I gotta sit there for 1hr and 10m ????? Wow
---
Is there a guide/overview somewhere which dungeons/bosses rogues can do solo at 60? Be it for gold or BOE drops.
---
I.e. can rogues solo Princess for the Ring?
---
Are you doing it with the TSM UI open or the Auctioneer UI open? Because for me it crashes like you describe if it's not on the TSM UI when I scan.
---
Is the time respawn time in game displayed?
---
Maybe if were an inferior Alliance race, but the Blooedelf Master Race with Seal of Blood on the other hand... ;P
---
Objectively wrong. Read his comment again.
---
Lol I have considered that.
---
As a tank, I just assume everyone is a newb and explain things. It takes 40 seconds and if it prevents 1 wipe in 10? Still more useful than not.
---
How did the Boomkin perform? Are they as awful as you read about?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejacharacterstats
---
Actually the sitting down works if you time it correctly due to batching. As you get crit but you are standing up.
---
Takes some practise tho
---
Back in vanilla I farmed my epic mount cash here. Good old essences
---
I'm not, just telling that I disagree his point on the BoE topic.
---
BoP is another matter where rolling need on it when you can't equip is really scummy
---
I would like to know too
---
Affinage ? Are you cheese ?
---
So happy for this guy, he's my favourite streamer, he seems a lot more well adjusted than the others.
---
Hiding behind the power of a financial institution to shield you from the lawful repercussions of your criminal actions...seems like a very Goblin thing to do.
---
If it's happening on an RP server then they should be fine : D
---
This game is so AWESOME!!
---
Every story I read here I can relate with.
---
Every Meme created I can relate with.
---
The sad stories, the fun stories and even the angry stories all   comparable  to my experience in WoW Classic!
---
What a game, well done Blizz!
---
What do I care about some pug melee who's doing a third of my damage and afked to fap in suppression room? I would never take this from a friend or guildy but a pug wtf it's a game I'm trying to get my set too
---
RemindMe! 8 hours
---
Dungeons that feel like part of the world. Won't find that in retail.
---
Sulphuras is really good on ret paladins/enh shamans. Of course an enh shammy got it.
---
Yeah because throwing money at any issue is always gonna turn out good right? At some point the hard/software just can't scale any better.
---
You said at the end of your post that they are “one of if not the most op class in classic”, presumably the person saying ‘if they have a healer’ was responding to that part.  
---
It’s not like they’re making a needlessly pedantic point either, they’re merely pointing out that the class isn’t very good for 1v1 or when lacking a healer, which happens all of the time in world PvP.
---
Those linked on reddit often dont work at all for me on mobile. This one for instance didnt work.
---
Genius
---
I helped our 2 guildie warriors as lvl 60 rogue. 2 Ravagers in a row.
---
If BT is enough to kill a caster on their own then you didn't need 1.0 attack speed in the first place.
---
there's no way i wait 10 secs for each summon and waste 1k+ mp. succubus for all. alone mobs, dot and dps. grouped up mobs, dot and fear. spell casters immolate shadowbolts while succubus solos a doted mob. and you dont waste shards :P

Master Loot

As people have said BRD torch is nerfed, only the first time each thing dies will you get the ~20 XP. Warriors also weren't one of the classes you took.

Yeah the posts disagreeing with me are just bad at the game, you can do a lot more for your character with all that gold than 1% crit

I honestly don't mind it taking a long time between phases, I wouldn't want to have it end too soon, I'd just like to have some actual release dates to look forward to.

The wowhead guides are the ones 90% of people will be looking at when they google "&lt;class&gt; pre-raid bis list classic", they're definitely at the top of any searches, and that's how they function.

&gt; Your attitude and how you speak to people is what has turned everyone against you. 
---
I literally don't care about the opinion of cheaters and people defending cheaters. And if "everyone" was "against me", I wouldn't be up 65 points, I'd be down 65 points. Soooooooo... maybe, just maybe, harsh language is the least people that ruin the game for others deserve? Maybe "everyone" agrees that multiboxers should be banned like the botting cheaters they are?

Learn from this, or don't. Oh who am I kidding, cheaters never learn.

Autoattack all mobs who are alone.

[This is illegal, you know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQFcVR6vEs)
---
Speak for yourself.
---
You should really roll need for the role you are currently doing in the dungeon, if healing item drops and the healer doesn’t need it you can, or maybe ask them each time if they mind you rolling,
---
I put 5 in wand specialization for sure..  after you’re 60 respect it to the reduce stun talent.  I prebubble, shadow word pain smite till the mobs at 30ish % then wand
---
&gt; Everyone wants gemstones from LBRS for UBRS key
---
Really? I don't think everyone have such masochistic tendencies that they would willingly want to expose themselves to that mindnumbing farm, *especially* if they were rolling against 4 others for every run. 
---
I've only really bothered with it during my last run on a private server. If you aren't planning on doing hardcore PvE stuff, or you perhaps are in a guild with several UBRS-keys already, I don't see why one would want to even attempt to obtain it.

You can gauge someone’s IQ by the comments they post on Reddit. This comment....? Yeeeaaahh.... lets just say you’re most likely not the sharpest tool in the shed with a bit of a naive perception of reality.
---
Fixed, lol. Will you trust me now?
---
This post basically says you need to use your utility skills to counter another class' utility skills in PVP, and calls it "out-of-the-box thinking". What they describe is just PVP. If anything, this post should encourage someone to play Rogue, as it nicely describes a bunch of utility skills you can use to counter a lot of stuff.
---
In the end PVP is rock-paper-scissors, assuming skill level is similar. You're always going to be able to get countered by something.
---
cat gets 2 AP per strength just like warriors do, it's still very good for them. agility is better, but don't ignore strength.
---
It would also solve the problem by not letting people roll for gear that isn't for their class. 
---
We can further solve this problem by not having shared loot. Each person has their own chance at rolling for loot. 
---
Congrats, we've taken out negative social interactions by removing all social interactions and now we have forced personal loot!!
---
Right and if you get blocked by half a server because you refuse using common sense, don't come crying here.
---
That would be in between m8 aka 5
---
I mean that's fine, but you'll run out of healers who to kill only your boss, well before you get HOJ on average.
---
If your plan is pvp healer then really you shouldn't be walking around on your own, so your long ass stun combined with divine shield should give you more than enough time to stay alive while team mates deal with your attackers. You should be fine in leather if you have trouble finding decent Stam/int plate. 
---
Communication is key, if you're being focused you need a way to alert team members that you're in trouble, if they like being healed they will prioritise protecting you. Make a macro or something to alert nearby team members. 
---
What worked really well for me in the past when I started doing battlegrounds is to hang around with a good damage dealer or 2 and make it clear I was looking out for them and ask them to keep an eye out for me too for when I get focused.
---
Because it is BiS forever, why rush it now? MC and Ony are joke easy. Huge waste of gold currently
---
lol if it's not bis or close to it, it's a fuckin waste of time. casuals smdh
---
Yeah i like having time to catch up. They will release info when more people start complaining, they even said it it themselves they will release the phases based on community feedback.
---
I would strongly consider eventually getting edgemasters. It's dropping quite rapidly in price as people find out it's not that useful on humans, and for leg piece blademasters does okay
---
Congrats.
---
Nice to see you can level with a friend! I'm also a software dev and got to leve 41 with a mount. My friend stopped at 10 and went back to retail because he wants to do the campaign or something.
---
Geez this is one of the reasons people dislike retail. In fact not even retail players liked it when they made gear irrelevant in pvp. This completely defeats the purpose of an MMO.
---
Yeah they really gave up on class specific quests it seems. There's one for the first tier of cure poison but not the second one, and after lvl16 there's no more class specific quests until lvl50, not even for Cat or Dire Bear. It's so strange.
---
Oh yeah true, totally forgot about those!
---
Used to do this with my old guild back in TBC, used to call it "Gnome Cannonball Run" and whoever won got 5g from each participant. Fun Times.
---
And this is why Blizzard made everything personal loot. I personally rather have people create their own loot rules in runs than being treated like babies.
---
MUCH APPRECIATED!
---
Well, that's better than we usually do.
---
Pretty mich what I thought. I rarely am afking and usually am fully committing when I'm online. I checked prices this morning and on my server almost nothing goes for more than a few copper less that what you listed as threshholds. But maybe I'll take the advice and level cooking for basically free using your list.
---
Very nice work regardless!
---
Yeah, i was in the same boat as a druid. I did level a druid in actual vanilla WoW. But it was before 1.12 patch and talents rework. And i was an absolute noob back then anyway.
---
Then i started leveling a druid and tried a leveling guide (thinking it will take Classic changes into account). But it seems it was build around the idea that Druid is supposed to DPS in dungeons? But why DPS if you can tank with ease?
---
You could need on all the BoPs you see and get 900 gold, the amount isn't relevant to the point
---
Based on my experience on private servers, tanks did those runs to make money, since they usually have a rather hard time farming money without gathering professions. 
---
Not that I necessarily think it's good practice, but I think their motivation for it might be a somewhat mitigating factor.
---
Exactly, so you go do Golem Lord, or Arena since they need pieces from there. You create a route that encompasses everyone's needs. I've done well over 100 runs of BRD and everytime we hit what people need, but I'm not gonna do full clears for no fucking reason. I'm not there to explore the scenery for the 100th time, i'm there to get loot.
---
This guide is pretty good for shamans and is recommended on the shaman discord:
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-shaman-guide/
---
Other class leveling guides on this website are not all good though.
---
Is it even suppose to work ingame? I never was able to make one even on retail

---
You guys give me hope. I’m a healer gone tank because I’ve done all the healing classes except for shaman. I wanted a fresh start for classic, but at the same time I wanted a fall back plan in case I sucked at tanking. Druid was the obvious choice. But despite being feral specced into tanking and moderately geared for my level, I still hesitate to join as a tank. Strangely enough, I feel more comfortable healing in my feral spec than tanking in it. I think I get tanking anxiety. But as inexperienced as I am tanking, I wouldn’t even attempt to tank in clothie int gear. Time is valuable, no need to waste everyone elses.
---
Sorry OP but you are wrong
---
Yes, so if one of those items drops for one of the class/specs, is it still okay for others to roll on that BoE? Based on your own rules that class/spec doesn't have any extra right to that BoE. Nevermind that the item itself is a huge upgrade. This is the problem with a blanket "Everyone rolls need on BoE".
---
Server allocation and server stress isn't something you can throw money at to fix.
---
Each realm doesn't have its own server, it has its own server allocation. Financially speaking Blizzard wouldn't own individual servers for each realm as that would be laughed out of the building, instead realms are given allocation on a server and function from their own "partition" so to speak.
---
I feel like these should be in the reverse order.
---
Remember that you can always sell your Jacket and buy like a Sentry Cloak or so with the money!
---
You will get your answers between the 1st and 3rd of November at Blizzcon.
---
It's fair as long as everybody rolls need. People waiting and then rolling need in last are just ninja. Or would you assume that every one else already had their Bis ?
---
Traded for gold, which means you don't need it, you greed it.
---
I’ll have to check this one out. Thanks for sharing.
---
Don't listen to that numbers-guy, BT is not overrated at all. It's just that peeps who don't have him yet say that, because they *want to* sincerely believe it. It's wrong.
---
Gearing wont be a issue.
---
There are a bunch of pug raids with a simple roll system.  
---
There are even a few looking for specifically „meme“ specs.

My own guild is using a dkp/priolist system with shadows considered.
---
Guess i need to try out myself different gearsets.
---
It wasn’t until recently that it was even acknowledged as an actual addiction in the medical world (and I mean officially in the DSM) it also doesn’t fit the classic substance abuse description, it is basically a different beast altogether.
---
It will probably be a while before it gets recognised for what it is in the public’s eye. And when it does, it will probably get misrecognised by people around you. 
---
I went through this process myself a few years back, my dad was convinced I was addicted. I went to an addiction clinic to appease him, they didn’t agree with his assessment. He was convinced I was misleading them, so I took him with me to another one to get a second opinion.
---
Turned out I was on the autism spectrum, that and a slew of other problems that arose from my childhood essentially meant that I gravitated towards solitary hobbies (and still do for that matter). 
---
Point being what is excessive or addictive behaviour in the eyes of one, might not actually be. 
---
If you’re able to seek help (I’m Dutch so our healthcare system allows you to seek help even if you are of poor means.) do so, waiting lists are often long as it takes months to get help if you aren’t suicidal (at least here). You might find underlying causes or you might be addicted, self diagnosing doesn’t help if you don’t actually seek help for what you (or others around you) diagnose you with. Professionals are equipped with the tools to help you find your issues and give you (and the people around you tools to deal with your situation). 
---
All in all I wanted to share this personal experience for people on the fence about it. Hope you find what you’re looking for, and please message me if you need to talk.

ATB, real 2004 hours
---
Works if its a paladin tank.
---
I do see "princess runs" all the time tho
---
Right? WTF is going on with this post here, does nobody else know that option exists?
---
You see a single target with 5% health. Blizzard. You need to aggro a new group of mobs cause tank is too slow. Blizzard. You're waiting for the boat/zeppelin. Blizzard.
---
To earn gold, and because its what I love to do, I aoe grind dungeons or packs of undead in Western Plaguelands. So my build is centralised around being able to do so during the times im not raiding.  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxoZVRtI0zZV0L](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxoZVRtI0zZV0L)  this is the build. 
---
Holy: 
---
* I have 21 points in holy to get the essentials Illumination IS essential, Divine Favor maybe not considering you are usually flash of light spamming raids... however when you are aoe farming like I do a FREE big heal is essential. 
---
* I went 5/5 spiritual focus for that reason also, as long as the mobs do not interupt (typical of undead mobs), meaning I can throw a big heal, with concentration aura up, without knockback.
---
* Stuck 1/2 Improved LoH for the sake of getting down to tier 4 of the talents, good talent anyway.
---
Prot:
---
* 5/5 Toughness for maximum damage reduction.
---
* I opted for not speccing into defence as to me, 1.2% extra avoidance for 5 talent points is not great considering a piece of gear alone has 10+ defence.
---
* 2/2 Guardian's Favor is ESSENTIAL for healers to protect your squishies, and tanks if you lose threat. Overall great talent.
---
* Blessing of Sanctuary, essential to tanking IMO - generates threat and reduces damage. Also having this when farming low level dungeons is what makes it even possible
---
Reribution:

* 5/5 Benediction, reducing mana cost is essential for a protection paladin as we need it for threat, chose it over might due to improved BoM because alot of holy paladins already chose that, so in a raid its not necessary and in a dungeon its hard enough to keep threat anyway :)
---
* I have 4 talent points left, 4% parry is the obvious choice. It reduces damage taken whilst slightly increasing your dmg dealt to a target, increasing threat.
---
Id like to add that when I do do aoe farming, I aim for high amounts of armor and spellpower, whilst rocking Skullflame Shield, Demonforged Breastplate and Wraithscythe. These items all have lifesteal mechanics and unknown to many, they scale with spell power.
---
You are as dumb as the dirt you sleep on :)
---
You're exactly the person I thought I'd find this deep down in the comments.
---
 Don't shield the warrior before he goes in, he needs rage. You can renew. Use the biggest heal you got and try regen as much mana as you can between heals. Take advantage of the 5 second rule. Drink as soon as you get out of combat. Keep an eye on the dps if you notice one of them pull aggro you can put a shield on them.
---
 You can be shadow and still heal 5 mans.
---
So I can’t give you much advice as I’m a DPS player mostly, but one thing I have seen every warrior tank say in classic is to not shield them since taking damage builds their rage. If you shield them, they don’t take damage, they don’t gain rage.
---
John Staats hadn't worked at Blizz for a decade. They clearly stated they have all the source code for every version of WoW.
---
They also said they don't have the original databases, since they overwrote those each time up to 2.0
---
Ppl like picolas cage
---
Haha. Our guild would be the ones responsible for demolishing an opposing alliance raid at the bottom of the chain/jump. We didn’t even have a single death, it was magical.
---
We never do the jump, and we’re at the top of the chain with a Mexican stand off with them at the bottom of the chain, our RL made all the right calls and it was beautiful, seeing all those alliance corpses.
---
I liked the way you explained your logic and I'm having trouble disagreeing.
---
Must be Baroness Anastari, the banshee one.
---
Druid IMO. It’s not flashy/bursty but they excel in 1v1 with their sustain, and can escape most any fight that isn’t going their way. If you’re on your way to the main action ain’t nobody gonna slow you down whereas other classes will have no choice but to turn and fight or die.
---
here is the thing buddy, the class is MEANT TO BE AUTO ATTACK because it leaves a free global to use dispels, buffs, BoF, heals etc etc. And most people just cant grasp that.
---
If one is playing a paladin and just attacking, he is playing it wrong. And that wrong playing is the main reason about this "just autoattack lol boring".
---
No. It's not a problem. No one has any extra right to a BoE ever. If people would like to pass or roll greed they can. They can also roll need and if they win simply give the item to the person who it is a huge upgrade for. It's BoE...
---
Someone tried that on me and it litterally did nothing
---
Just imagine getting Devout Mantle beside for RP reasons
---
You can't buy BoPs, that's the difference. If a BoE drops, it's an upgrade for everyone. If a BoP drops, it's an unobtainable upgrade outside of that instance for one person, and 4g for everyone else.
---
You all have to be outside the instance to do this. Logging out and having somebody from the outside reset it is usually faster than running back to the entrance
---
This is heavy duty. I hope he's okay. A coworker of mine too his own life yesterday... It's so hard to know what others are going through.
---
I can only speak for healing - the top 3 ranks of heal (whatever they may be at various levels) are more than enough to get through a dungeon run. Renew is horribly inefficient. Use whatever rank of heal is required to manage your mana.
---
The tank doesn’t have to be at 100% hp all the time - by that I mean if your second rank heal will get them back up to 90% then that’s good enough. 
---
You want to be targeting as much +spirit gear as you can  to regen as much mana as possible during pulls with the 5 second rule.
---
The 5 second rule is our golden rule: your mana will start to regen 5 seconds after your last cast finishes - so it’s imperative you have as much spr gear as possible to maximize this window.
---
For soloing: open with holy fire or mind blast depending on which is more mana efficient per damage. Then shadow word: pain, shield and wand them to death.
---
Spec the first 5 points into spirit tap in the shadow tree and then the next 5 in discipline tree for 25% extra wand damage - your wand is your primary dps generator.
---
5 points into holy for the crit chance and work your way down from there.
---
I’ve played a troll priest since vanilla and have only leveled as a holy/disc spec with 5 points in shadow. It’s surprisingly easy, efficient and makes you tough as nails to kill.
---
You really don’t need to drink with the above setup and should have minimum to no downtime between kills. 
---
Apologies for the essay 
---
All the best mate and enjoy!!
---
I believe you misunderstood. I should've elavorated more.
---
With igs attack speed BT will basically interrupt the caster forever while you kill someone else. Then you focus the caster.
---
Just pay the winner 100g for the recipe? Also how do you prove someone has alchemy?
---
/cast Arcane Intellect
---
 Make more
---
Yes?
---
Chalk it up to an unwritten (but very widely accepted) rule that in this video game, whether or not a piece of equipment is an upgrade for someone who can use it is more significant than how much gold someone else can sell it for. 
---
It's not perfectly valid, it's an extremely shitty thing to do.
---
This had me on the edge of my seat till the end.
---
Then you get even bigger assholes needing it just so nobody can sell it
---
ohh this made me think o my little meatball, she used to jump on my lap and get inside my shirt and sleep there while  i was playing wow back in the days. 
---
miss her so much and i think i  will never stop :\\
---
Anything else would be massively dissapointing.
---
That's not the point. Tank of course needs good gear, but you could cut some slacks for the healers. They are the only ones who can do MC at 58. It won't be possible for DPS because mobs and bosses would be red and most of their attacks will be resisted or dodged, but no problem for healers if your DPS is fast enough and everybody knows the mechanics.
---
Nice!
---
Ghoul Skin Leggings are better.
---
thats majority of my gamer friends in a nutshell
---
u go to work then u spend like 100 euros a month for food (more if u eat fancier food)  then if u have ur own apartment and u live alone u spend 100 euros for gas/electricity/water/etc  then maybe 100 more for other things and if ur salary is like 3 grand that leaves 2.7k unspent a month
---
i live with my gf we share expenses i spent around the same so rest of the money is either unspent or used going to restaurants/traveling/exploring new places where we haven't bene or just plain gaming together   which we both enjoy honestly couldnt ask for anything more
---
I got into several heated arguments IG about this too. I just don't get it I mean OK if you wan't to play by these rules fine, just explain it when grouping and I'll happily kick you to greener lands but don't try justifying it with logics. What's logic in that ?
---
 It literally is written on the rolling options.... Need is for when you ... need. And greed is for when you want it for the money. Needing money to buy something else is an option, and it is called GREED. So fucking click on greed that is the only logic that holds. Anything else is just additional rules you're trying to push, so be upfront with it and stop being an ass-hole.
---
Most servers will have someone camping the recipe vendor for reselling on the AH. You can save yourself some sanity by just buying it from the AH, but you'll probably be paying way over vendor price.
---
I dunno eh. I got the shoulders from the interrogator in BRD and theyre way better.
---
Spam LBRS with a strong group. 50-54 as a dps, 55+ as a tank. Get 60s to help you.
---
ik but I play sm/ruin :D
---
What's the difference between deathcharger and undead epic?
---
Or maybe a rouge dw one handed swords
---
I really dont think you should be concerned about his binds, he clearly knows whats up, and you dont sorry.
---
...And I think that's a fair way to do it! Like I said, just getting anxious from not having the information.
---
Wouldn't be the first time I see someone delete all their accounts everywhere because they want to focus on something (most likely college).
---
Weird way of doing things, definitly.
---
You don't Need the Gun, you want it for the Gold and that is the definition of Greed
---
No, you need to get LUCKLY. And hope there arent people that know the timer. OR check multiple layers
---
I'd recommend: "Give me that loot or I'll kill you and your family, you bitch."
---
German accent optional.
---
20 Minutes is a huge value for 2 talent points.  And you only use LoH when things are desperate, so you don't want it to be wasted.
---
Healing the Tank to full is easy, I don't need a 1 hour cooldown to do that. 
---
  Since with Divine Favor and Holy Light you can usually bring a tank up 60% of their HP or more  I'd rather have one big cooldown that fully heals me or the tank and gives a huge armor boost, than one that only heals.
---
Rito pls....
---
I‘m pretty sure it‘s the level my dude.. Sure maybe you didn‘t have the 100% perfect rotation but if you are that low lvl there is no way in hell you‘re gonna get rage...
---
But did you whipe because of it? I mean I read a lot of posts about that and I never give a fuck as a DPS if I get aggro as long as we do not whipe 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
You guys aren't getting this at all lol
---
If you took Felstriker from a Rogue you should consider suicide.  
---
Sincerely, a rogue sick and tired of DPS warriors needing all my gear.
---
Haha have you been to STV yet?
---
I've levelled to 60 on a PvP server and I can honestly count the number of times I've been ganked by someone showing ?? level on one hand, and I've never been camped by one. Sometimes you're just in the wrong place killing mobs the 60 wants to farm for some reason, so you just go do other quests in the meantime.
---
Had plenty of PvP with randoms questing in the same place as me, but I rarely ever saw 60s hanging around killing lowbies.
---
Yeah it’s always nice to know, I’m like 49 at the moment so I’m hoping it’s a few months away! RL sucks!
---
Oh really? Excuse me while I go and make a bajillion "When is phase 2?" threads on the Blizz forums!
---
In 6 hours, I only got 2 Basilisk Brain drops.
---
rolling for gold, rolled doubles over and over again
---
Make your own group for a full run? I don't see what's the issue.
---
Yeah it's nice to do. Most mobs are fine I mean. It's only 4 demons in 4 zo es for a specific quest.
---
This is exactly how I feel and how I play the game. It’s definitely a playstyle that is becoming increasingly rare though.
---
No, it is a massive overreaction and posting it on reddit is just attention seeking. Quitting the game and sending over remaining gold isn't a crime, and when / if this person sees this thread he may feel like he did something wrong or caused people to worry when in fact he probably just left the game. How exactly were you close if he had a friend that knew he was okay but you did not? 
---
Love the way you slid in that you are a volunteer as well, what a guy.
---
&gt; only takes the 1 time out of 1000
---
If this is how you choose to live your life, I wonder how you find the time to play the game or do anything at all. Almost anything can be interpreted as a warning sign or a cause for concern.
---
I would like to formerly request that if I mail you gold you don't (pretend) to freak out and head straight to reddit to get upvotes
---
At 60 pretty much, between two same geared people the guy who uses his rotation better wins.
---
Their experience is similar to mine and according to all those census things the server I'm on is about 45/55. Not even but not enormously lopsided either.
---
please, do more... like sfk too :)
---
Adding to the list, demonic blood from fel wardens in desolace, 4-5 mobs that’s all heavily contested. Thankfully the droprate is 100%, but screw me was that quest painful.
---
Yea there is some greens with random +healing enchants that are better, but most BiS lists dont mention them as you cant really farm to get those, thats just random luck
---
And half your group drops after running the one they needed.
---
But that's solved by adding these folks to ignore lists. End up on enough ignore lists and it's almost like you become a ghost.
---
Def. a guild that has priests with devout mantle can't do it in greens / blues, since they have 0 valueable stats. On the other hand a full green +healing priest can easily heal throught MC
---
Mage and Warrior are the only S-tier classes in vanilla. Warrior is slightly more inconvenient to play and sometimes expected to tank, so Mage is perfect for people who want to faceroll and have an easy advantage in the game. 
---
Mage can farm gold, raid and PvP with a single talent build and essentially just using ~5 skills in total, one could play the class with a guitar hero keyboard and outshine other classes in each field of gameplay.
---
This is why people said before launch that it was crucial that class balance is revamped at some point.
---
If you don't need any other loot just leave and black list that tank for yourself. Make on tank friend and you can do your own groups.
---
Trust me, anything is better than t0, even that kentic amice from BRD is 10 times better than this shit. Stop trying to defend OP with outright lies and deception.
---
Not the OC, but I've done that. Twice actually. Once b/c I couldn't find any balance between life and WoW, and a second time b/c frankly I was playing to hang out w/ my crush, and that did not end well.
---
Im leroyyy and this is Jackasssss
---
Right, may be that then. Thanks
---
honestly priests are so demanded and so rare atleast in my server that u can probably charge gold for each run u do as a healer
---
so if they dont go to where ur item drops just tell them to FUCK OFF.
---
and make ur own group
---
There are better items than devout mantle..
---
Then no one has any right to any item. The fact is the buttons themselves describe how they should be used, but people are greedy.. I will just have to continue to surround myself with people who know the difference between need and greed.
---
They should look into this. Phase 2 brings world bosses which means a lot of people in the same place, even without a streamer wrangling a horde of fans.
---
As tank dont bother about dps getting aggro. Care only about healer because he can heal + he can ress when somebody dies.
---
It’s a huge time commitment which in a relationship can be unsustainable and a bill that keeps coming if you play or not. Canceling isn’t that unheard of.
---
I do it and its a great addition if you dont want to open up with cheapshot or garrote.
---
I like to use it against mages since they just blink out of stun, especially if they got no shield on they can go down fast :).
---
Ah right. Yep that makes sense. Is there anyway to put that gcg into a macro?
---
Dal'rend only has 2% higher Droprate than Ironfoe my friend. Im in the same boat.
---
&gt;Chalk it up to an unwritten (but very widely accepted) rule
---
Citation needed. Because the general concensus appears to be that everyone should need on extremely expensive items such as these.
---
&gt;it's an extremely shitty thing to do
---
Nah, what *is* extremely shitty is to expect people to pass on items just so that your own selfish self can have them.
---
Actually they aren't plague but ebolah, smallpox, measle and zika.
---
I don't mean to offend anyone, but if you're having trouble paying for a wow sub you might want to better organise your finances. It's really not a huge sum and when you look at it from an entertainment to cost ratio it's ridiculously good value. 
---
When you think about how many hours of fun you can get from 1 month of sub the only thing that comes close in terms it value is services like Netflix, but watching shows and movies is not the same as a game where you make your own adventure and can interact with lots of other people either cooperatively or competitively.
---
I agree that needing when everyone else has greeded is scummy as fuck, but if you're establishing the rules before the dungeon, needing  BoE epics/expensive blues just makes sense. It's basically an upgrade for everyone, and it totally blocks the possibility of a pug asshole needing after everyone else greeded.
---
make a level 6 twink brah
---
True enough. But I still don't see the issue. Right now even on lower pop servers there's more than enough people around to just make your own groups while avoiding loot crossover with other party members. I don't see anything inherently toxic or awful about calling dibs. I'd only take issue with it if they announced it only after we got there, or when it dropped, or he's reserved half the damn loot in the dungeon.
---
Not the same thing. The multiboxer uses a third party program to replicate its keystrokes to all windows. That, my friend, is automation.
---
Now, I'm not saying all multiboxers are automated. I know 10 years ago i'd level 2 characters by having 2 games running with 1 character just on follow. Of course if i needed a heal, i would need to manually select the window and press heal button.
---
I'd heard about folks using different ranks of spells, but I'd thought that was just for a small playerbase of folks who were trying to min max, but I do see your point, I'll keep the last three on my action bar for this.
---
At what percentage of HP do you recommend should I be doing what I can to heal the tank?
---
THE RNG GODS HAVE SPOKEN!
---
why tho?
---
i disagree with the stat weights listed. theoretically, 10 int = 15 +healing? and spirit has roughly half of the stat weight of intellect? just seems off to me, i'd rather have more potent spells which allows me to downrank harder rather than have a few extra spellcasts and be forced to use higher ranked heals to have the same healing output
---
Imagine imagineing
---
Ikr, the thing that annoys me is almost every streamers talks about a 3 month gap between each phase as if it is set in stone, when in reality Blizzard has never said this. They just instantly think Blizzard will cater to the top 5% of players.
---
Sadly doesn't matter how blizzard intended the 2 options to be used, what's important is how people use them. If everyone needs on boe either you do the same or stop complaining when you lose the item. I dont like it but there is no point in getting mad over this kind of things, i do greed on most items and dont even realize when something is boe 🤣
---
Not often I hear that but I'll take it
---
The biggest con for warrior is gear dependency. It's THE most gear dependent class in the game.
---
There’s nothing to spend gold on, after my epic mount I just have nothing to spend gold on because consumables are so cheap, so my gold just piles.
---
First time I did that quest I was luckily ahead of the pack but it still took forever, so second time around I simply didn't do the 10 vulture and 10 basilisk quests so I could still do 3 quests without having to fight 8 people for spawns.
---
Thanks for posting this is cancer.
---
HoTS pepehands
---
Is there any other addon that makes me able to change around with my actions bars except dominos and bartender, but let me keeps the blizzard UI?
---
I tried both bartender and dominos but neither of them had the option to keep the blizzard ui :(
---
And now you know the reason I never click on twitch clips.
---
We were pondering about this back in closed beta of vanilla wow as well. I even messaged GM regarding that back then and he told me the cat druid quest and other class quests are "ready soon" and they should be ready by the time the game goes live.
---
Theres a whole LOOOOADS of things that were planned and never really happened (not in vanilla, not later).
---
you can farm the gold and get it off the AH. i see healing greens listed pretty frequently.
---
I mean chances are he doesn't want to throw away another 6 years of his life to the addictive drug that is Warcraft. Maybe he simply realised he had to rip off the bandaid.
---
Offline WoW sounds horrible imo. The whole fun part is the interaction in pve content/dungeons and pvp
---
You are lying or dumb, not sure which is more disappointing
---
How viable is warlock mainly destro spec towards the endgame content?
---
The fire warlock spells/talents, immolate, conflagerate, searing pain, soul fire.
---
I don't plan to raid really, I don't care about maximizing dps or going for the  most optimal build, when I play its mainly just goofing around.
---
Pretty much every classic warlock build guide seems to be affliction based, maybe with some destro talents but never far in. But why? Is it that bad? Is it so terrible for dps and survivability that going 100% destro is obsolute for even just questing or higher level dungeons?
---
Lol thanks, it looks wrong but i wasn’t sure
---
power world shield on warrior or druid tank is for life saving, not to afk while the group goes down. please use it as last resort.
---
Thanks, I think I will be doing mostly dungeon running, so I may just go prot spec. In any case, if I regret my choices, I can always respecc again until 45-50 as the first respecc is relatively cheap.
---
I'm actually really glad the shouts work so well, I actually didn't think they generated threat at all :p
---
It's called "Horde" for a reason, you know...
---
Alliance players have a much different questline. The only thing we need in UBRS is Drakkisaths blood.
---
I feel ya comrade, im in the same situation
---
So the only argument here is, that this is cheating because i dont have 5 different keyboards. mmm'kay.
---
I like how the only side calling people assholes are the ones that don’t agree with the viewpoint of “high value BOE epics = need”
---
Good thing y’all are the minority. The very whiny minority lol
---
"Haha yeah i make so much gold guys"
---
r u proud of this post
---
Just get 60
---
Nah it was because making Goldshire massive meant they'd need to have other towns match its size and it would have been too much work
---
Thanks I was kidding with that edit, I tanked as a bear and *damn* was my character rage starved, and that was WITHOUT being shielded :p
---
Amazing to see this from Blizzard. Good stuff.
---
Warrior
---
Pvp healadin is all about armor, stam, int and mp5. Spellpower is also nice for when you have to fight back but hard to get early on. Right now i'm using a lot of the deathbone set and mainly plate with stam and int.
---
It's not ninjaing to need an item you are literally about to equip. Such a weird and forced perspective.
---
If an upgrade drops and you "need" for the gold, because everyone "needs" gold, you're an ass. It's literally in the name of the system. Whether it's 3g for a BoP or 30g for a BoE, if you need the item, you need, if you're just greeding after the gold $$$, you greed. The only way this goes wrong is if some ass tells you "I needed because I need the gold, it's your fault for following the rules". 
---
Never seen this perspective in a group I've been in, seems very limited to reddit. I can't help but think that you yourself are just a ninja justifying their previous need roles on every BoE that ever dropped because "I need gold too lol".
---
the last item take as long as all the previous one combined
---
always
---
Oh god I thought he was rogue.
---
&gt; hearthed
---
Why? Leaving group in instance will teleport you to where your HS is set up...
---
Good gear for a ret pally, how did you get that BoE equipped? I have egans blaster in my extra slot
---
I mean that's still an upgrade in it's own way. Should you roll greed when Baron Rivendare's mount or a 16 slot backpack drops?
---
Yea mc still a joke, i fondly remember my days ranking to rank 11 on northdale, every weekend id Get up drink coffee then spam premades. It was fun and hilarious when an epic dropped and 40 ppl needed it
---
No I completely understood, any caster shit enough to allow that to happen to them would have died to a 2.0 pet just the same. 
---
 Any fight that's not a complete walkover, meaning your opponents are skilled, that shit isn't going to work on them. You are doing to want to have the scorpid to protect the mana drain, a boar for a timely root, or a wolf to buff your burst.
---
BT is a noob trap.  Certainly cool, certainly interesting, but virtually useless to a serious player in serious fights.
---
according to their mentality 9. according to results 3.
---
i had so much fun with that one made a  5 man group and locked down the area from alliance ;D
---
That one was likely layer abuse, I remember the OP said he paid for 8 ingots when anyone who was legit would know the total cost is 9 ingots
---
I mean you will have several sets of gear as a fury warrior. Every fury warrior should have a tank set for tanking/pvping.
---
Curse of Moo first warlock racial
---
i personally check wowhead for the quest look if its chain and the chain is any good item/exp wise if not il skip or come back later if its camped/etc and it worked really well
---
This is weird, I was waiting with a group ( we are all 58-60) and an alliance lvl 54 ish priest strolls by. We MC’d him but I the mage could not use my int buff on them, the priest who MC’d could use stamina though. So I’m curious how did he manage to buff int?
---
Sounds like we agree, good luck on HoJ.
---
Thanks, I was concerned about when to throw out heals, especially given I've yet to internalize the 5 second rule. Soloing has helped me to get used to it for regening mana in between fights, but as I've yet to do my first dungeon, I wasn't sure when the tank would definitively need his healing (I actually would've tossed it out at almost the first sign of trouble).
---
They're not talking about lying, they're talking about using the system of loot allocation in a way so that you don't need to worry about others lying. This isn't ethics, it's more along the lines of game theory. There is a clear way to avoid abuse of the system, but people don't want to do this because of labels, that are ultimately arbitrary in the case of BoEs, saying 'greed' and 'need'.
---
And instead of saying smarmy comments like 'flawless logic', how about you actually address one of his arguments? Why is someone getting a BoE to use any different from someone else selling it and buying their own upgrade?
---
This is super familiar.
---
Same any day working from home.
---
Apart from mine is a 30kg german shepherd!
---
When one guy is the group leader and spent half an hour looking for members he worked substantially more though. And those two hypothetical melees could have joined a different group if they didn't like the reserve.
---
untill bg wont open, the 60s have ptretty much nothing to do. 
---
and yes, these things where  happening even in the past the situations escalated quicly everywere, u just ress away, heartstone  and change zone.
---
Oh my god my dog does the exact same thing
---
That must have felt good.
---
I bought the set but i still didn't bind the gloves. Because I can't decided between shadoweave and mageweave. Thx for the dreamweave I'll get that saw them. I'll try to sell me shadoweave gloves.
---
of course, witch hunt the player for using a commonly accepted way of rolling
---
They make free action potions too. Paired with the oily blackmouth I made 10g/hr fishing those schools.
---
Prowl past a bunch of mobs and some players killing the mobs to get to the NPC that needs to be die for the quest. Kill the quest mob. Prowl back out, past the others players still fighting their way in.
---
I see absolutely no problem with this as long as it's clearly stated beforehand.
---
 If I'm farming HoJ say, I can either start a group stating that it's reserved beforehand, or start a group stating full on Phys.
---
 It's better imo to reserve an item, that way maybe a rogue or warr that has the item or doesn't want it can join, rather than limiting my group to only casters or something.
---
ok probably going to just buy it, i am still waiting after about 50 mins. So far no one has came. Only 25 mins to go lol
---
Everyone here is gonna claim that warrior &gt; rogue anyway. The charts that have been spread recently are absolutely irrelevant and misleading because they were based off MAX recorded dps, not AVERAGE. But everyone still goes by them as baseline.
---
[https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000) 
---
Ofc warriors can theoretically reach by far the highest possible dps, because they just go way more insane with a few very lucky crit streaks &amp; hoj/wf/sword-spec/ect procs (even more so for horde with wf totem, theres a big difference in war dps, and to some degree rogues, between horde and alliance but not for any other classes). Thats also why they have the largest dps range. Most other classes, especially casters, have no ways of artifically and luckily pumping out 3-4x their regular average dps through some lucky procs or conditional buffs or stupendous combinations of worldbuffs and consumables in very short fights.
---
But warriors actual AVERAGE dps is below that of rogues as of now in p1 as you can see in the chart above. I dont even know how anyone would keep trying to deny this, people here think that every warrior always hits his max ever recorded dps in every fight when in reality, even the worlds currently HIGHEST RANKED dps warrior on warcraftlogs "only" pulls about \~550-600 dps on average, yet those recently published dumb af charts were trying to tell us that p1 bis warriors reach \~900+. Some people just believe what they like to believe (or to justify their picks or personal biases), and some others just play the game and see things for themselves.
---
I don't get the hate. If a random enh shaman gets Hand of Rag is he a piece of shit for having a guild? How is that different?
---
he drops a leather chest which is badically cadaverous armor, easier to obtain with like 10 or 15 AP less than cadav
---
Ah I see you too are rocking a The Office the left monitor swtup. My friend did the exact same thing when we LAN'd haha
---
I play on Ten-Storms EU which is a PVP server and there are times I can get annoying when getting ganked by higher levels, but then I realised I was in a slightly higher level questing zone, (e.g. Badlands. I was level 35, most other players there were around 38-40).   
---
Switched to a green colour level zone and then I was higher than most, and green quests give the same EXP at the end, just the mob kills reward a little less. 
---
Im not an aggressive player perse, but I will defend myself. So if you are in a green zone, and horde have more chance being your level or lower, and if they attack you have a greater chance to survive.
---
That was in later expansions, disengage never did that in vanilla.
---
I'm no expert but I've been maining priest during classic and in pservers.
---
Talents: Wand in Disc -&gt; Shadow Spec for Lv 1-40. Respec at 40 to get Shadowform. Respec at 60 for full healer if you want to. Leveling as a priest (even doing a lot of dungeons) will be painful solo as Holy/Disc. You'll be able to heal 5 man dungeons just fine as long as the tank is proper level.
---
For actual healing: 
---
* Don't preshield or early renew before the tank has gotten threat on all the mobs your group is fighting. You will accidentally pull aggro on mobs that haven't been actively tagged. 
---
* Even if your tank doesn't need a heal, start casting your heal anyway, if he still doesn't need the heal by the time the cast is done, cancel the cast. 
---
* Have a set of "cheap" water (a tier below) and "expensive" water (highest tier); use the cheap water when you're half mana and have a moment to rest.
---
* If you are using (nearly) every GCD healing the tank, and a DPS gets targeted (or accidentally pulls some extra), it's probably better to let them die and res them after.
---
* I almost never PW:S a warrior tank unless it's an emergency. They need to get hit. 
---
* Keep 2 to 3 ranks of heal on your bar. Lower rank heals heal less, but they cost less. There will be situations where you don't have enough mana for your max rank heal but the tank is going to die. 
---
* Call OOM in chat as soon as you're out of mana during combat.
---
I have thrash blade with fiery enchant and an epic, it still painful haha
---
you will get it eventually bum rushing the helm over your own profit is stupid.
---
yes definitely shield and renew the warrior before every single pull
---
God you're whiny. I'm gonna spend a couple hours in that cave tonight just for you, bud.
---
That's a really good point, once you've gotten the items you need there's not much point in going through Live Strath, taking orbs seems fair payment for that along with knowing the person your with isn't rolling on your gear.
---
I leveled up a warlock to lvl 40 and decided that I didn't like it. I know the struggle xD
---
Well I can't really hate them, this community really hates pay2win right? If we boil down to what it is, I would describe it as such: "using resources outside of the game to gain advantage inside the game". This same description could be use to describe streamers as they use resources(fame) outside of the game to gain an advantage over other players.
---
Right now. All the top dps in my guild are fury right now.
---
bless u
---
Holy crap people suck...
---
This!
---
Just because others do it isn't a reason to do it. I know that's the culture today, "just go with the flow". However, I would rather not make that the status quo.
---
My experience has been different anyway, I find the majority of the people ive encountered to be like you said. People don't notice a boe, and even when they do they're mostly looking out for who actually NEEDS it. I would like that to continue.
---
You definitely were. Deltateam? :P
---
Obviously it's not ninjaing to need an item you are about to equip. No one is arguing this. It's ninjaing to need an item if you don't need it and plan on selling this.
---
BoEs are essentially just large sum of money drops. If you don't understand this, you clearly slept through basic economics in high school and should go review. Generally, everyone greeds on sum of money drops, for example mats such as Essence of Fires. It gets sketchy though when the difference is 400+ gold. To avoid any chance of having someone ninja that gold, everyone rolls need, and everyone gets a fair chance at getting that gold. If your group has champs in it, the best plan would obviously be to split the money even with every person, something I do with most of my friend groups, but it's absurd to trust every random player to want to do this. Also in the long run, you get the same amount of gold by simply always needing.
---
No more!
---
You're missing the point. Some nerds in their house had hardware that could handle 100v100 fights perfectly fine yet Blizzard is incapable of it.
---
Why? Obviously the hardware/software *can* scale just fine if these dudes could do it. But Blizzard can't? 🤔
---
Dual wield, best dps, Charge skill.
---
I think people use some macros or automated stuff to buy that shit, usually when i check like the runecloth bag recipe near there, theres multiple ppl camping it.
---
Good thing i knew about this and bought some of the hard to get recipes when i was levelupping. I just should have tried to stock them up as much as i could. Idiot me just bought one of each.
---
You should swap colors here
---
To be fair it was not a basement but also a top tier datacenter I'm sure.
---
Everyone need on high gold value BoE items. No one can ninja then. Share the profits if you want. No drama.
---
You act as though I haven't already specified this is for pugs only and loot mechanics should be discussed prior to any looting... 
---
You're absolutely right though. No one has the right to any item. If they did the game mechanics would be set to automatically put whatever item into your backpack rather than letting you and your party/raid choose between greed/need and multiple other loot mechanics like master looter or free for all.
---
Made a warrior till 30, then rerolled hunter and now 40,5 on that one. I kinda also want a rogue and oh god I will never get to 60 :P
---
Why even sticky the top comment
---
The Trainer Cartel Druid was like "it was funny at first sending you on all those pointless quests but it's getting tedious figuring out new ways to waste your time, so just gimme all your gold"
---
I swear I never feel so robbed than after visiting the druid trainer, even when I don't train half the abilities, I don't know if Druids actually have more abilities they can train than other classes, but it sure feels like it.
---
Try using the golemagg discord
---
spend that time leveling and than make more gold selling later matts and drops. To really make currency you need to stay above the curve of other players. Case and point, low level to mid range matterials for herb mining etc are currently the cheapest they will ever be because that's what the majority of players are dropping and selling to afford lvl 40 mounts.
---
you are incapable of critical thinking lmao, sounds like a weezer fan to me
---
Maybe you can migrate them to a PVE server. I've accidentally had my pet attack a dwarf npc which toggled pvp on. Oh how I've run into a dark corner and cowered until it toggled off again..
---
I mean the reality remains, there's only gonna be 3-4 rogue spots in any serious raid.
---
Why would you do that? Bear has fair bit lower dps than cat form (+ feline swiftness) so everything just takes longer - amount of money isnt really relevant.
---
I would understand if you would level semi-afk half the time and the bear was basically just for the laziness of not having to watch screen too carefully and being able to alt-tab often and not die, but without that... dunno.
---
Had to updrew at "drill"
---
Oooh, actually another question as this came up with my bear form, should I chase mobs that go after a caster DPS? Especially given the casters are probably standing next to the healer. I'm always concerned the mobs I'm trailing behind me will lose agro (since I'm no longer focusing on them and instead chasing another mob down) or might even have AoE powers that could strike other party members (like those annoying plants in WC that can cleave).
---
Also, if a hunter's pet has grabbed agro on a mob, should I be concerned and try to get agro back or can I ignore it?
---
Also, up to what level is there little to no necessity to bother with CC? RFC is the easiest dungeon and I tried to manage the group and have them CC one or two mobs, but our DPS was so high no one bothered, when does CC become a necessity?
---
Thanks! I'll check it out.
---
Hey, I was just wondering how easy / difficult Wailing Caverns is for an off-spec shaman to heal? Any tips would be appreciated
---
I usually start with flame shock to grab agro. the 10yard difference is range is pretty neglible and you move on foot through that 10yard faster than the casting time of the lighting bolt is.
---
Warlocks for sure. We're very self reliant.
---
I imagine he put in a ticket through the website. You can add attachments there.
---
&gt; Can't feign death be resisted?
---
It wasn't a resist. You get a message when it is.
---
What macro you guys are talking about....im one of those people....
---
Cost about 5k AFAIK with some good deals on ingots. Everything was gathered within 2 hours.
---
Grid is popular
---
It was a normal thing in firelands trash mob farming, but it was always stated beforehand.
---
you really dont need the 5 second rule often, spam your most efficient heal and drink when mana runs out. You can wait quite a bit of time before healing at low level, but later you need to keep everyone topped off in case something happens.
---
If you're playing priest as your healer most of the time you should be using renew and your big heal (it's name changes as you level up, I think the final version of it is called greater heal) shield and flash heal are not very Mana efficient and should only really be used to save non tanks that are in danger of being killed. 
---
Always try to keep as much spare Mana as possible, so like don't just spam heals just because you're full mana, you'll thank yourself when you get 3 or 4 adds and you all survive because your tank was good and you had enough Mana to keep him alive. Also, don't be cheap with your Mana potions, try and keep at least 2 or 3 of the best kind you can use for your level, they can save your group from a wipe and a potentially long corpse run. 
---
Good luck!
---
The point being made is that your poll presents mutually exclusive options. By the poll you’ve presented you can’t be both hardcore and social, calling it a 5 doesn’t cut it. 
---
By that logic if a guild raids 4 times a week and won’t give you a spot unless you are consistently playing then they would be a 10 (most hardcore) but then they are as far from social as possible when actually they might well be a very close knit group who interact regularly outside of a raid setting (therefore very ‘social’). 
---
The flaw is confusing social interaction (an environmental factor) with a casual attitude to performance (productivity). A better analogy would probably be hardcore vs casual.
---
That’s so sad :(  Wish I had a guild, or at least one that cared like that. I hope they are okay!
---
100% agree. It's fucking insane to see people here even suggesting that rolling need on an item should soulbound it to you, or that you shouldn't be allowed to roll need on an item that's not for your class. Like how the fuck do you think we got personal loot, people complained over and over again about others taking their gear and so to avoid any negative interaction, they simply removed all social interaction.
---
Dwarfs can't be ninja because technacly you are always the first one to spot a chest.
---
And even if you stole the chest no one would care.

I’d rather have them delay p2 for a bit and have a short p2–&gt;p3. P2 will be a mess for the poor people who haven’t reached 60 and tbh it’s not a particularly fun way of ranking running around epl killing people leveling
---
Yep the support is no existent they give zero fucks. Sort shit out yourself or not at all.
---
Ooh yes good call, thank you!
---
And this is exactly how I will level up my alt. With main parked nearby.

those nodes are inaccessible tho
---
&gt; Someone that uses a bot has a program play the game while they are not physically at the computer
---
A botter plays 1 character with automatic systems and a multiboxer plays several.
---
Can't help but think the drop rate is higher in classic, than it was in vanilla.
---
Unfortunately there's far too many healers around now, you'd actually have an easier time finding a group as DPS.
---
No they are not just large drops of gold, that's just how you see it, mats are large drops of gold, boes are items with stats that fit one class or another. Some classes need that item, some classes greed after the gold. The system works fine.
---
Your argument is basically that BoE items are just gold for your mount / whatever you want from the AH. But they aren't, skull flame shield is a tank item with tank stats in a tank slot. The tank needs that item. Its not about the gold to them, its about that BoE with those stats that just dropped. The fact you can't see that, and that instead you only focus on your own entitlement to the gold, is greedy. That's greeding, and you should roll greed accordingly. I will do the same for you if the pattern for true faith vestments drops, and everyone leaves happy.
---
I did not. I don't use serpent sting in raids.
---
Ah right, so you're being a lot smarter than I was back in the day :D
---
It's already 36s per 5 at vendor and you pay no more than 50s for 120. C'mon.
---
Outside of the game's explicitly defined rules of macros, **they are and blizzard has banned people for it.**
---
They've banned people for Synapse macros as botting. That's why it's so boggling that multiboxers aren't banned for arguably a far worse offense that's far more disruptive to the community.
---
You deserve -100 votes
---
Wowhead classic guides are basically noxxic-level bad now.
---
&gt; Which is literally what this sub is about...
---
lol, where did I dispute that? I didn't even mention the subreddit. 
---
Reread my post.
---
Level 60 hunter can farm maraudon for gold. It might not be the best gold/hour but it's probably the most effortless and consistent.
---
That doesn't really feel fair to Mara though, they specifically made an item that puts your entire group only 80% of the way through the dungeon.
---
Yeah. Agree. Gear is a big part of it. And guess what else? COMMUNITY. People getting all upset and negative around obviously community interaction towards a common goal.
---
Would they be satisfied if he farmed everything solo? Why are they on Classic and not current WoW then?
---
This shit is what Classic is about, to some extent.
---
Yes, multiboxing with third party program that replicates keystrokes to the 4 other wow windows aka automation is cheating. You are automating your keystrokes to 4 other windows.
---
Anyone else think fights like these look super boring? You have pretty much zero impact over who wins, whichever side has more players almost certainly will. You just spam AoEs and hope that you're on the side with the more players. 
---
I remember before I started playing wow and saw these, they looked super epic. But seeing them now makes me snooze.
---
and you can prove this?
---
Its impresive, its a good job... ow wait it is asmongold lets all watch him because we hate him...
---
Yeah, I tamed one of the Ashenvale wolves, it had Furious Howl rank 2, but I cannot teach my other wolf the skill.
---
I've done a few quests for the Argent Dawn when doing the chain quests for the key to Scholomance! What is Argent Dawn rep useful for?
---
And similarly, what's useful about Cenarion rep?
---
Im a warrior and omg he just ran in
---
The lock is probably lifetapping mid combat, thereby causing you to heal him and getting aggro for that.
---
I have never had a priest ask to do that, not even from my guild mates. But what i would do If i was you is join a 'full run' obviously and ask upon joining 'does this include The 2nd boss', should be as simple as that, no way Im middle of the run, thats too late, people dont like sudden changes.
---
Congrats. You just outed yourself as one of those assholes.
---
Yeah, was the first thing I noticed! I always have my dog near me when I play WoW and check where he's at if I decide to drive my chair in any direction!
---
Magetard
---
Then just find an appropriate quest reward and get it if you're hung up on not spending gold. You'll probably level twice and have access to something better anyway.
---
It was in a parking lot. I was mugged. Bystanders called the police.
---
aha yeah it didn't have cooldown yet in this patch ..but still its random effects?So who knows how many you may need to get slowfall and its gonna waste you a few seconds
---
"Water Boys"
---
bro the one guy that wants the upgrade for himself is more greedy then 5 people all with equal chance at getting a boe they use / trade for one they can. are you rarded?
---
The terms and conditions and EULA, you have to physically read (or scroll to the bottom and pretend you have) then tick to agree to when creating the account.
---
Magays
---
There's no such thing as offspec until 60. You can heal as enhancement up to 55-60 if you have some int gear with you.
---
Thats also shamans and rogues. I have rogues roll on sp int daggers. They are just doing it to vendor it.
---
Yes by definition the party leader sets the rules but if no one agrees with the rules then they can just leave. I understand you argument as it can be sold for gold which is beneficial to anyone but don't you see how allowing the person who can actually use it to need it is the right thing to do? It's a game not the real world. Why can't we all draw a line in the sand and say if you can actually use it then you deserve it. That's how I've done all my dungeons so far and it's worked just fine. I've passed on BOE's because people can actually use them to better their experience. Sure gold is nice to have but knowing someone got a piece of useful gear makes it worthwhile to me.
---
Not even preBIS but ok you have my support
---
Try enabling/disabling hardware acceleration on your browser
---
effin rogues...
---
If a vendor trash item with no use except selling to a vendor dropped for 200g, what's the proper decision here? Should everyone greed, since after all it has no use to anyone except money? That'd be absurd, you could just as easily have everyone need and remove the chances of anyone stealing the loot by needing it.
---
BoE Epics are the exact same thing. They are simply gold drops. When a Stockade Pauldrons drops and it's your BiS and you win it, you didn't win a Stockade Pauldrons, you won 400g you would have otherwise spent by buying it eventually.
---
Thanks for your reply! Really burned out with BRD so its time to move on to Blackrock Spire/Strat/Scholo I guess :D
---
If it wasn't classic that'd be fine since almost every healer wears cloth. 
---
#2 is saying let's do let loot. And yeah...
---
Haha thats extra painful because that takes so much time!
---
I play both, Shadow Priests are far from boring in PVP, they melt face but run out of mana very quick making them slightly annoying in BGs. Both classes are awesome in 1v1s but I feel locks shine a lot more in general PVP.
---
In raids however they are very boring, even more so than a mage which only really cast one ability as you probably won't even get to use your main abilities, instead you'll apply a debuff to increase shadow damage done by your warlocks. This matters because you'll need to raid for gear. 
---
Both have a really cool niche and are neither is a bad choice, however, if it is your first and main character I would chose a warlock.
---
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
---
It trades sustain for burst. The reason you don't see it around is that lots of mobs (especially in MC) are immune to fire. It's tons of fun to use and great in pvp where its burst really shines.
---
It's not very mana efficient and can only single target dps effectively. It also splits some gearing options since neither +fire nor +shadow dmg feel good.
---
Roll succ or felhunter in pvp, imp for dungeons. You can have a viable and fun 5/11/35 if you want to lean all the way into your +fire damage talents
---
Spriests beat warlocks and are generally considered the best. If it's a gank, then probably rogues, especially until pvp trinkets are out.
---
My guild thinks they're an 8-9, but more like 4
---
GLORIOUS
---
What realm is that? Im assuming its the RP one lmao
---
Its always good to have fun :)
---
EVERYTHING IS FREE BUT THE RING FROM FINAL BOSS IS RESERVED, IM GOING TO SWITCH ML BEFORE THE LAST BOSS!!!  
---
since you can mob grind at 50-54 which is before can enter strath or really do any quests in WPL/EPL and overall it rolls pretty well with then doing some quests and getting to timbermaw hold rep grind and doing that. overall i have always found this way to roll rather well into late game and how i like to play.
---
Really easy. Just gather up some int gear. You can even melee while healing.
---
Note that early on some int gear makes a big difference as it will sometimes give you an extra heal or two per fight.
---
I will hit level 31 today after having a subscription for a month. Glad I learned about rested xp early on, on weekdays I pretty much just play until that runs out or a little before and then find an Inn and log off again. It's cool I haven't really gotten sick of any areas, and I don't feel like it's a real grind to get quest progression (yet). Worst is probably the thousand needles/thunder bluff quests where you have to fly back and fourth a few times, feels like I get very little done during that kinda thing, but I switched area to undercity and the quests around tarren mill are pretty dense with small travel times, can get a few of those done in an evening.
---
.....servers have subreddits?
---
Don't think talents matter at that point. Just make sure to keep an eye on the tanks hp. Its a mind numbing dungeon due to lack of variety and you might zone out a bit and suddenly the tank is on 1hp.
---
Nah. In the previous dueling tourneys all of the private server players got shit on.
---
People wore bad gear back then because items were not itemized like they are in classic.  In 1.1 or 1.2 your tier 0 set was actually pretty good.  In 1.10+ yeah it is pretty poor.  Even with Dire Maul release a lot of blues became available that were significantly better but at that point most of the more advanced players were already getting MC/ony drops.
---
Ret in ICC were pretty nice to play. You really needed that T10 and proc chance (as well as holy moly anti undead fuckery) on divine storm for it to get fun.
---
BfaMage
---
Busted :&gt;
---
richest person in my guild has 5k gold + epic mount.
---
5 others have enough black lotus to last them the complete rest of the expansion..
---
thank you layer 1-8.
---
Nice. Oil industry and multiboxing an insane amount of accounts. That's a direct sign of having absolutely no moral compass.
---
They are incredibly boring.
---
Builds are affliction because it boosts your shadow bolt. In PvE encounters, you use your designated curse then press shadowbolt. Destruction is worse because it doesn't have a filler, searing pain is a threat generator, soul fire is inneficient, immolate takes up a debuff slot.  
---
Destruction is decent for pvp though, you're a burstier mage with less mobility.
---
Wailing Caverns is a low level dungeon, having 5-6 points in a talent tree doesn't define your spec.
---
You can heal it 100% if you have all your healing spells, of course.
---
well when you get ninja'd or someone gets a 400+g BoE simpley because they can "Use it now" then you will be thinking differently. if everyone rolls Need then you can't ninja and who every wins can still give it to the guy that can use it OR trade it to get a BoE they can use lol. it's far more greedy to think you should get a 200+g BoE simply because you can "use it now"
---
For PVP you'd be at a huge disadvantage by not going undead. Devouring plague is ridiculous.
---
Technically it's not offline, you still need to set up a local server to spawn mobs and start events. What you can get is questing and exploration, and believe it or not, that's what many casual "BfA tourists" do. They have no interest at raiding or BG, they just come here out of curiosity. Many of them have never experienced pre-Cata azeroth. The fun part, to your question, is to experience the skipped or unknown content in the game, such as Cortella's Riddle, T0.5 set and many more.
---
Indeed :(
---
Whats the 5/11/35?
---
Talents? What is 11 points in demonology do?
---
We have had warriors easily break 1k single target, they definitely have a higher ceiling than rogues right now but rogues are a little more consistent.
---
You need judgement of wisdom on the boss to get mana back when kittycatting and powershifting. Also you do not benefit from windfury at all, which means that youre much better off with BoK, as it actually does stuff.
---
Nah. In my opinion, what drops is what gets rolled on. You aren't rolling on gold for the chance at buying an upgrade. If you're grouped with another player and you roll need on their immediate upgrade because you wanna sell it, that's a dick move.
---
Kill that ally scum!
---
That said, I'd do both these things, apart from the dancing on the body. Killing enemies is fun, no matter the level difference. Notice, kill, move on.
---
One of the places I will visit at 60. Legit no place I died as often as in front of the fucking Yeti Cave and to the east of it.
---
Isn’t lvl 44 considered the “halfway” point in terms of XP amount? 50 is only 6 levels above that. So like... I suppose it’s comparable to leveling to 35 on a day. Is it doable? Probably, but ask yourself... how long did it take you to get to 35? The answer to that is roughly how long it will take you to get to 60 from 50.
---
I have a level 1 horde on that server. Which I will play as my alt. As such, thou shalt not escape my warm embrace.
---
(My main is an alliance on the Zandalar tribe server though. Sorry for being a noble swine) :(
---
Generally though, the atmosphere on RP servers are much more chill, in my experience. People have prejudices against RP servers, but they are unwarranted, since no rules are enforced, apart from their naming policy.

Lets talk about the real reason P2 is important.... The GD mage water is currently so bad!!!!   Pls release Dire Maul for upgraded mage water!!!
---
That looks like a typical pvp spec if you don't need anything specific. Imp. mana burn is good vs healers (gona have trouble killing holy paladins otherwise), imp. inner fire is nice vs melee. If you want to take those you'd have to drop some points in mind blast.

I want my 1 minute of my life back.
---
And if gain in stats is marginal? I'm supposed to remember the whole list of BiS items on all levels for all classes? Or maybe the item IS better but only because the person neglected easy-obtainable alternative? The party supposed just give it to him?
---
Sure, there is a well-known list of late game BoE items that are desirable for particular classes and builds, but all other BiS stuff? Dunno.
---
Nah.  Parties need to be 20% healers and only like 4/24 (1/6) specs are healing, it’s totally reasonable to expect there to be a lack of healers.  Sure, you can say “well but for a lot of those classes, there’s only one viable spec!” and you’d mostly be right, but there’s no reason to think players would be evenly distributed among the classes (and if you did, you’d be terribly wrong.)
---
Doesn’t seem like common sense can lead us to any surefire conclusions, to me.
---
Instant corruption on affliction and survivability in demo. 11 points gets you fel domination which is... nice sometimes I guess. You really want fel stamina an improved healthstone though. Imp voidwalker gives the shield a nice boost which can be a lifesaver but theres no wrong pet for that spec. Your voidwalker wont hold aggro, that's just for pvp against huters of something with a lot if spell pushback
---

Flamelash EU in fact, the realm was pretty much anti-reserving from very early on
---
You *can* sunder, but usually the only reason not to have full stacks of sunder is because the mobs are being focus fired too quick to  bother. That principle would be true whether you were DPS or tanking so probably just leave sunder to the tank.
---
Boy I wish that wasn't the case. I also wish that if someone hit you in town you could then attack them. It's kinda hard not to die when a someone 20 levels higher then you wants you dead.
---
"Ice kings"?... i'm not a mage! You're a mage!

hey mate, I'm alliance on golemagg and id be happy to help you out! I'm at work at the moment but I'll be home later
---
Black Lotus has only a few possible spawn points in 4 different zones. It has a respawn timer of about 60-70 minutes. Finally, only 1 spawn in each zone will have a Black Lotus active (e.g. if the timers both expire, only 1 node will spawn a Black Lotus).
---
Additionally these will be completely camped by people who have the timers figured out.
---
This is probably the reason why you will never find one 'at random'.
---
For locations, check [the Wowhead page](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=176589/black-lotus). It has a total of 41 spawn points across 4 zones (Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, Silithus and Burning Steppes).
---
If I were going to do this for an hour or two then yeah but at some point you just want to finish it and move on (took about 10h of fishing)
---
Explain why Soda got banned for layer exploiting then.
---
Well for now classic is considered a bonus for BfA, and playing it requires a BfA sub. Problem/irony is, all the no change people who vehemently hate every modern feature still have to pay the full sub fee for classic. It's like a special deal of offering a free gift for buying some certain stuff off the shelf. You want the gift and you don't like the stuff, but the gift is bound to the stuff, you have to buy the stuff in order to get the gift.
---
Read this in his voice, have my upvote
---
In Everquest many of the best items came from quests, and most quests could be "multiquested" which means somebody else hands in all the stuff except the last bit which you hand in and get the reward. A lot of players ran around with all kinds of BiS gear and never did anything to get it except farm money.
---
Why is it the mages fault if the healer said go?
---
Except there's a shortage of tanks in *every* dungeon. And strat live is often ran purely for profits even if you don't need anything from it.
---
The best argument I know for everyone needing on high value BOEs is that it makes it more fair for people that already have good gear. Say two warriors have 800 gold each, one of them decides to buy the Edgemaster's Handguards in order to help his guild progress, while the other decides to save his gold. If they drop, would it be fair to give them to the person who didn't want to spend his gold, or does the Warrior who spent hundreds of gold deserve a chance to get his gold back?
---
You can manage to clunkely move by replicating "wasd" and using isboxer formation. But the overall experience is bad for both the multiboxer and his teammates.
---
Ouch...
---
Have you noticed zuljin not in Org ?
---
I'm completly new to WoW, and I'm having an hard time enjoying the movement coming from FPS games, is there any way to make my camera move in the direction I'm walking, or moving it freely with my mouse like in FPS games?
---
Are there any "recommended" key bindings for a warlock that I should use? Also, what is a good add-on for action bars?
---
how do you have this flaming aura on the sword ?
---
&gt; should I chase mobs that go after a caster DPS? 
---
If you have set a clear target priority, and the caster aggros something else? Then no. 
---
Is the mob already nearly dead, and the healer has enough mana left? Then no.
---
Is it a prioritized target and the mage threw everything and his mom onto him before you had the chance to build up threat? Then no.
---
Did you just lose aggro because of level differnces, a series of misses, dodges, resists, blocks, parries? Then yes.
---
Every second you are not on your communicated priority target you can't build threat on it. And your main job is to keep a situation calm, and not let it emerge to a stressful. hectic running around situation. The less you have to move, the better.
---
Nobody will shittalk you out if you lose an occasional mob to a DPS or even the healer (If they do, thogh, it's not worth running with them anyways).
---
&gt; Also, if a hunter's pet has grabbed agro on a mob, should I be concerned and try to get agro back or can I ignore it?
---
Ignore it. It's their job to turn off growl, not yours (Same with Stonebiter weapons on shamans, orgenerally when a DPS uses a spell which clearly states "cuases extra threat").
---
&gt; Also, up to what level is there little to no necessity to bother with CC? 
---
This depends entirely on your group. CC always makes a situation just better for you, since you don't have to take care of that many mobs at the same time.
---
True but I’m a bad warrior. Leaving some margin
---
Not to mention this is how any new player is going to see the system. If you NEED that specific item, you'll roll need without thinking about it. You're new. If you don't, you'll just hit greed because then you'll sell the item for gold (you know, the icon used for greed). The argument about ninja's stealing it was always dealt with via the server community. Tell your guild, chat, etc.
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket about this issue?
---
Most people don't care either way because most people don't run into them.
---
&gt;[/r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/) seems like a weird subreddit. 
---
&gt;You’re wrong here. This is a common misconception. 
---
&gt; That's a you problem, not a weed problem.
---
Sorry if I misunderstood you, I assumed you were responding in line with the earlier comment the thread as opposed to that specific comment.
---
I take it druids can also do this?
---
Thats my boy SonyD
---
3 ways
---
A) have a friend invite you and then log out, and he resets while you are offline
---
B) Have a friend invite you, then log on an alt and have him invite the alt, then convert raid and tell your friend thank you and that he can leave. Now you can reset yourself by logging on the alt and waiting 2 mins for the leadership to transfer to you. Takes 2 more mins but no friend required.
---
C) Pay 15 dollars a month to skip the 2 min wait by buying a second subscription and being your own friend.
---
Or just all need for it so it's not an issue to begin with? Like why even create this scenario where everyone has to trust in each other when a a fair roll already exists?
---
So in reality everything is a paladin item and not hunter?:)
---
So you need on everything then?
---
My cat does not sit on my PC tower. I just checked its top and it blows with cool air. I'm surprised.
---
Stealth is such a fun tool, so nice druids can also get it. Now if only they could pickpocket :p
---
I did the ears on my warrior alt while getting tusks for my whirlwind axe quest. The place was basically a slaughterhouse, players ended up grouping up for safety despite it being only drop quests, and we'd still get overrun by bad pulls and respawning adds. I didn't die much being a warrior I'd just put on my shield and run away (usually another group of players would then pull the adds off me) but a warlock I was with was getting regularly roflstomped. 
---
One of the most annoying things about that area is that the ranged trolls can often shoot through the walls so you can't even LOS pull them, and you can get aggrod by mobs through the walls.
---
You could also dual wield with hunter
---
This is really amazing. Shadow fang and scarlet monetary next!
---
&gt;I understand you argument as it can be sold for gold which is beneficial to anyone but don't you see how allowing the person who can actually use it to need it is the right thing to do?
---
Right is subjective. If you believe that everyone passing on an equal opportunity for all party members to get a large benefit by selling it so one person can equip it, you do you. I hope the other members of your party feel the same. 
---
*I've passed on BOE's because people can actually use them to better their experience. Sure gold is nice to have but knowing someone got a piece of useful gear makes it worthwhile to me.* 
---
As I'm sure everyone has, I know I've done this as well.
---
Posting this from the xpost so it might help someone here too....
---
Hey just going to post this here. This is something that is currently happening to people and a lot of people are being wrongly banned. If you check out staysafes recent classic wow video on YouTube you can see someone else got wrongly banned and got it overturned. Aparently blizzard is banning people without looking too deep into people’s login location history. A guy got perma banned while traveling for business and had to send them proof he was traveling. GL and I hope this helps.
---
I don't think I really noticed my healing to start to taper off until Maraudon. That isn't to say that you can't heal as elemental or enhancement after that, but going in at the minimum level can be hard without a strong group.
---
Is making valuable gifts against the TOS?
---
Not at all
---
This. Typical retail behaviour but sooner or later they'll see.
---
I usually never attack Alliances, or join Hordes trying to gank. By doing so, you're starting a war in that zone ruining the questing for everyone in that layer.
---
That's the scourge of the game. First 4 weeks me and my friend were ahead of the pack, now rl stuff ate us and we are still running brd and Jesus Christ ammount of morons is mind boggling. Compared to our first runs where all you have to say is "remember to not accept rfd escort instantly" and "mb" few times in a dungeon. Now you have pulling hunters, fearing warlocks and melee mages.
---
I'm a prot warrior, I know my class, I get the job done. 
---
I'm also the worst class/spec to farm money. If you're not a guild mate and you want me to tank your run, then yes, I get the orbs.
---
If I still need items in said dungeon I reserve the first orb. Why?
---
Cause finding a group is easy and most people understand the fact that farming money as a warrior (especially prot) is difficult.
---
I thought Vanilla PvP competitions is about having the most Gear and highest crits
---
Oh you finally dinged 60 on your alt?
---
Must be since classic released quite some time ago, and almost everyone is lvl 60 by far.
---
&gt; any way to make my camera move in the direction I'm walking
---
Hold right click  
---
&gt;moving it freely with my mouse like in FPS games?  
---
You can, but it's not recommended since you have to actually click on stuff too.  
---
&gt;Are there any "recommended" key bindings for a warlock that I should use?   
---
12345 q e r t f g c v   
---

---

---

---
&gt;Also, what is a good add-on for action bars?  
---
Dominos
---
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd97o-gEBuk) shows that it is not purely about numbers as a raid of 80 cleaves it's way through a defending force of 120+.
---
Being worried about Ninjas is a big part of Vanilla. Loot drama in general is. Not only does it add to the anxiety post item drop, it adds to the server community aspect of the game. 
---
Exactly 0 gameplay changes are useful (this would be a gameplay change), because of how clueless and surface level thinking the majority of the playerbase is, as demonstrated by your OP.
---
Nobody knows how any change will affect the game, so leave it alone. 
---
Plenty of 'brilliant' ideas were added since 2004 without any real downsides (not dismounting when swimming), that when added up change the feel and pace of the game.
---
Plus bear form is great for consistent dps whilst maintaining mana for when you need to pop out, heal, and then go back to bear form to continue long fights. I still remember how awesome it was taking on two orange leveled ogres in bear form, my buddy who played warrior refused to believe it could be done.
---
I always keep it and use before starting boss encounters in raids. Use the active, then replace it with your ordinary chest piece. It is like a free rage potion on a long cooldown. Bis through all content!
---
Honestly, I only remember the dungeons where you couldn't roll on stuff if it weren't your tier. It probably was different outside of dungeonfinder.
---
I believe that the middle mouse button faces the camera in the direction you are running, and you can probably change this key bindings to whatever key ord mouse button you want to use.
---
Are you guys stupid? Blizzard servers have SO many more people in the same spot due to layering, even if they are on anothe layer their weight still impacts the server.
---
Congrats!!! I will see you on ZT and gank you right away
---
you gotta invest in that droprate
---
No Blizzard servers can handle large scale world PVP. Retail was the same laggy mess (most recent experience from Nazjatar).
---
And that's how you get ninja'd lol
---
Now that's a lotta damage.
---
It is a factor if the servers are housed in the same location, their bottleneck may be network volume, which could be shared by multiple servers.
---
That should be called a pirate loot.
---
Great, by this logic...I'll need on anything that drops BoP or BoE. If I only need another 2g for my mount but Ravager drops...well that's money to the vendor. I'm gonna need on it.
---
I always just live chat. Few minutes response.
---
I have both a warlock and Druid at around level 18. I’m really torn on which one to play. I was set on playing lock but as I levelled thought I wanted to try something different. Now that I’m the same level on my Druid I’m wanting to swap again. Any pros or cons on either of the classes for levelling?
---
If you're seriously suggesting that since gold means more to them, it's more valuable to them, shouldn't Greed rolls just go to the poorest person in the group since they value gold more?
---
How do you even have multiple tickets in one month lol? No wonder there would be a long waittime if everyone is making two tickets a month.
---
Clamlette Surprise is the Artisan Cooking quest, and its in GZ right next to an AH. IDK if this one needs to be on a list, it's such a no-brainer
---
Hmm, fair enough. 
---
I don't play hunter, that's just what I've heard from other hunters in my guild and whatnot.
---
/cast Hellfire :^)
---
Check again, it's ~60g
---
Makes sense.
---
Seperate sub would be objectively worse
---
BoE = need , if you greed it's entirely on you . Can still buy it off
---
well, you know what they say "assumption is the mother of all fuck ups". apology accepted.
---
Ok, but I meant melee classes. I don't wish to roll a hunter.
---
who cares about this epic, when we have devilsaur set?
---
&gt; The immense irony on that last sentence is crazy. Whats even crazier is that it seems you dont even see it.
---
If an 800G BoE Epic drops that is BiS for you or something, and you try to force **four other people** to pass on their chance at that much gold cos you want to equip it, then that IS selfish. Why do you deserve it more? Let everyone get a fair shot at it. 
---
When you win an item like that, you've won a ton of a gold, equipping it is also saving gold you would've otherwise spent for it. Gold is gold in the end. 
---
Maybe they could use that gold to craft a Lionheart Helm or some Truefaith Vestments. Why is that less legitimate?
---
Nope, Blizzard doesn't publish realm faction populations, however up until recently people were able to use census addons to figure this out. Sadly Blizzard disabled these addons a few weeks ago. Here's a snapshot of the data back when it was working:
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms)
---
You're not a ninja you're just a fucking idiot.
---
I've noticed that players have gotten a bit more "assholey" now that I've reached the end level dungeons. So many groups that refuse to do any boss that they haven't decided they were going to do with their duo or trio discord group. A large majority of these groups have had one or two players who just start freaking out at random pugs for not understanding pulls or bosses, instead of taking 10 extra seconds to explain. Have seen an absurd amount of people just kicking players sometimes simply because that player wants to do a boss that isn't 100% optimal for them. It's sort of killing the fun of the game for me and I have been playing much less because all there is left to do for me is deal with these groups to get my gear.
---
Reminiscent of ye olden days.
---
Clamlette surprise was ok-ish. You do it for cooking 300 so it doesnt have to be worth your time in exp/gold. I spent an hour exploring all of tanaris and got 8/12 of the eggs, got the rest on ah for 50ish s. The meat is cheap on ah bc every murloc/naga in the level range drops it and the cheese can be obtained from a lot of vendors for 1.6g. 
---
Bloodscalp ears was the worst, stv is a war zone.
---
I'd suggest searching for quests with rewards that you can use as weapons rather than buying upgrades off AH.
---
No. A BOE is just gold at the end of the day. Anyone can buy their BOE with that gold.
---
Declare beforehand, roll need on your primary gear and only on secondary if noone else rolls for it
---
Literally working early mornings as a valet and it's so dead I could sleep and people would still not need help
---
Luckily you can get better water from argent dawn.
---
I’ve noticed a trend in that players who pick Shaman tend to stick with them, hybrids in general too actually.
---
I’m currently levelling a priest which I’m enjoying, but I am getting an itchy finger to create a shaman...
---
Talk to Chromie, the time traveling gnome!
---
in retail im 100% that way. in vanilla its hunter or nothing for me :p
---
Cool way to do it:)
---
Doenst matter. You can also buy that item from the AH for gold. Need other BOEs and it all works out.
---
"I am a multiboxer"
---
You lost me there.
---
You can't buy the Eye of Sulfuron
---
This isn't about basic vanilla loot practices. It's basic economics.
---
BoE Epics are purely large bags of money. No one is more or less entitled to them.
---
When I tanked with my bear form, maintaining agro was a nuisance because my toolset was limited (swipe plus the situational growl), I ended up having to chase mobs all the way back to mages and the healer (swipe only hits 3 targets, and I'm guessing the fourth aggroed on someone being healed).
---
Tanking was also made harder because we had a hunter who was on a schedule apparently and he kept making the pulls himself rather than wait while I marked the target and tried to set up strategies &gt;.&gt;
---
BT Op against bad mages  who don't use shield or kill pet or cc it, and locks that have time to cast a fear, and to annoy hunters. Everyone else will become immune to knockbacks after a crit or being attacked from him anyway (from talents)
---
Lol
---
Imagine being an orc warrior and probably taking dalrends from a rogue, when you can just buy your prebis axe on the ah.
---
I just got my blue warlock quest chest with lots of stamina on it, so I understand what you are saying now. I can literally sustain myself against more mobs because I can lifetap more often.

Damage per second is not really relevant in open world for killing mobs, I was merely pointing out that any melee will do satisfying damage vs a clothie mob
---
Every drop is my drop. Nobody uses anything. That's how you sound greedy fucker
---
Yea people putting their one sided stories without any proof on reddit is the way to go
---
Brave alliance killing low level because they lack skill (colorized)
---
I guess you're right. If you tell me beforehand that if an upgrade I could use drops, you'll need it to sell for your mount because you can't manage your gold as well then I'll just drop group. I don't agree with your line of thinking at all.
---
Maraudon bosses.
---
Princess runs could be BRD too.
---
Because with items that vendor for 1/2g it kinda sorts itself out over time, and at the end of the day I don't fucking care all that much if my mage decides he wants to need on some plate helmet. When you start dealing with hundreds of gold, like yeah no fucking way I'm gonna risk it.
---
I still have my collectors editions!
---
You are arguing in bad faith here and you know it. BOE epics are worth lots fo gold on the AH. BOP is a different story. Stop being a child.
---
Can't solo them, sorry
---
He still has 0% chance at winning the tournament. Shadow priest will win. Please stop the tears.
---
Oh you ate the bait like a bass, man.
---
"Oh, I'm too small to jump up, you gotta pick me up!"
---
My little bastard does the exact same thing, but when there's food in my hands, he could pole vault without a pole!
---
I m a multiboxer since BC. What you describe don't work, you get out of sync if you move more than 10y or so. The only way to circonvent the lack of follow is to use interact with target. You can simulate follow using interact on 3man mount (not available in classic), interact with the pet ethereal from the wow card game (not available too) or jump from one enemy to an other using interact (really limited).
---
So the only way I see multiboxer would be jackass who camp their base, they will sucks and make their team suck, i don't think you will see one.
---
I play on a multiboxing guild in classic and the concensus was 'do not try that, because that means be an douch with your own faction and it's not like we need that'
---
Can't answer for individual people but seems highly improbable to see boxers in BG.
---
Except if Blizz revert their change from beta and give back follow, but that s a dream. Where is the #nochange team when we need them ? :)
---
I love to see content like this, you sir, have a new subscriber :D
---
Enhance shamans cant dual wield in vanilla
---
Awesome work!
---
I'll have a large glass of what their having please
---
Blizzard is banning botters and cheaters all the time, and they were also paying customers.
---
Every time I ride the boat to booty bay I can feel the hatred rise in me, the gust of wind starting to emanate from my hands, going to my weapon enhancing it with the wind's fury, I shake trying to resist to the urge to kill as my eyes get redder and redder, the blood rushing through my veins, my grip tightening on my weapon. And then it happens, I walk toward this poor alliance low level, I can see the fear in their eyes, it fuels my bloodlust, as I approach them I loose myself more and more, and then it happens. I regain my sense, only to find a massacred dead body, it's bashed skull gushing blood, and I realize, once again I did it. I lost myself in rage.
---
Let’s say I’m in a PUG and say “everyone need” and then need on a high value BoE, before anyone else has rolled.  
---
If there’s a guild out there that will hold that action against me, to the point of not wanting to play with me (not merely disagreeing, but not allowing me in their guild,) I literally do not want to regularly play with those people anyway.  Otherwise, no one is doing a background check before inviting someone to their BRD group, and even if some people are, a majority of people aren’t and don’t really give a shit.
---
why would you leave them like that then? I’m not really blaming, but if you cared and shared so much leaving without even saying goodbye is strange at the very least. Hadn’t anything ticked inside of your after 5, 10, 50 days after this?
---
Would you consider it botting if I have a macro to switch to cat form and stealth?
---
The most badass thing to do is literally getting gray gear on your lvl 1 twink with max lvl enchants. Get summoned to any of the enemy faction starting zones and 1v5 lvl 6
---
According to blizzard you are wrong.
---
Move to a pve server, there's no other answer.
---
Clearly turned in to one, you also tried moving away from the thing I responded to initially with some nonsense analogy. May have used it incorrectly, go cry a river. Stop trying to bitch about my wording and/or phrasing.
---
Also, yea, you might benefit a little, but it is definitely outweighed in this case, Also no shit emotions matter? His friend may have passed away, he doesnt give a shit about the karma or gold at the moment. 
---
If you think: "Oh my friend died, nice, got some gold or money from it" There's clearly some lack of real love/friends in your life.
---
1. Yes, death may have some benefit to some people, but OP definitely did not want this, he wants his friend, he doesn't give a shit about the gold, I don't know how to fucking call it, but OP doesn't give a shit about 'the benefit', he cares about his friend being gone. If you're so against emotions, cool, but don't try to act as if your way of thinking is the only way.
---
2. In many cases people would do anything to bring back that person if they could, of course there are people that don't care that much and want the benefit of that person dying, but thats not the norm, thats morally fucked up if you see that person as friend, or you value that person.
---
&gt; but try to accept that some of us are of a different mindset and think you should not need to sell
---
But that's the whole problem. It's *an opinion*. Yet, some people call it ninja-looting. And being called ninja-looter is a bit more of an issue that "disagreeing on an opinion". If it spread around without any details  you'll have a hard time, even if it all started with a single person who have an opinion about "needing BoE for money is ninja-looting".
---
So you’re saying that people who use a forum to ask questions about subjects concerning WoW are somehow inferior to those who don’t?
---
What you want?
---
What I enjoyed in Vanilla and TBC on my rogue:
---
1. Gank lowbies @ STV
---
2. They log on mains to kill you
---
3. They die again, so they group up
---
4. There is 5-10 end lvl ppl running around trying to find you while you went to make coffee and sit somewhere stealthed waiting for CDs to come up
---
5. When your CDs are up, you kill one or 2 of em, who are not keeping up with the rest of the group
---
6. Keep that up till you or they get bored :D
---
You can’t see who rolled if you’re not eligible for the loot, all you can see is the person receiving the item
---
nerd
---
Exactly. Needing is legit the fairest and best way for everyone to end up with an even share of loot over time. You may not win your BOE but youll probably win someone elses and buy your BOE. Needing also takes away the losses from people ninjaing loot if you had of greeded.
---
If everyone always needs in these situations everyone wins and its fair.
---
Went from 7 dps to 13.3 dps on a gun on my lvl 22 hunter but don’t notice any big difference. White hits are about the same. Both guns have 2.3 speed. Why is this? Should I see a clear difference?
---
Wut, i seem to remember world firsts being massive back in the days, kungen was considered a god of some sorts.
---
Let your friend explore. The biggest fun of wow is finding your way in this huge environment. If you let your friend skip the failures, you're taking away a large part of the game and, most importantly, take away a large part of that feeling of accomplishment in figuring it all out. Wow is, at least in the first 40 levels, a puzzle platformer in a sense. You get very little help other than some vague descriptions from quest givers.
---
Of course, you can search the internet, but why would you? It's like using guides for drake uncharted. Sure, nobody's gonna stop you, but why would you?
---
At level 37? No.
---
At level 45+? Yes.
---
Pretty sure Maraudon is still in retail with the same old open ceiling bro.
---
Except, this wasn't a 900 crit, it was a 3k crit. Please send me a screenshot of you dealing a 3k crit on a fully geared leather user.

People are complaining about loosing 1vs5?
---
If all you want to be is a dedicated dps-class without any questions about being a tank, off-tank etc  go rogue.  
---
If you want to be able to tank, off-tank and dps go Warrior.  
---
AND when in doubt ALWAYS go rogue. :)
---
Hey.... tenths here, i recently killed myself and am now a ghost typing. Also ur momma gayy
---
For you I think it would be better if all needed in all groups for recipes and here is why:
---
The chance of it dropping in your group is small in a given day/week/month. More likely it is going to drop in someone else group that maybe have an alchemist. This alchemist might not be very interested in making flasks and would never spend the money to buy the recipe but if it is free then absolute why not learn it even if I will never use it? If instead everyone rolls there is an 80% chance the recipe will end up on the AH where you that actually wants it, can buy it for what it is worth. And because more non-alchemist will win recipes there will be more supply and probably lower prices. So if you need BoE items you are probably better off if you treat them as gold in more groups. If the item you need drops then I would offer to buy it on the spot.
---
I don't know if alchemy recipes are bound to a certain dungeon but if they are I would propose that you ask when you join if the group can agree that only alchemist rolls on it. If it is a 5% drop for a 100g item that would be an expected value per person of 1g per person and run. I would gladly accept to give up an average of 1g per run to have someone that knows the dungeon and doesn't need the gear from it.
---
Ninjas suck. The other day I had a warrior rolling need on a shield that was clearly inferior to his, had intellect and spirit stats on em, and less armor. But it was a nice BoE blue. His argument was "oh im gonna use it, ill equip it once i enchant it"..
---
Naturally he ignored my calls that it wasn't even an upgrade for him, had the wrong stats, etc and wouldn't even equip it on the spot either.
---
Multi Boxing should be against the rules since it is Pay 2 win and botting.
---
Multiboxing should only be tolerated in pve servers imo. In pvp ones having input broadcast to multiple clients should be punishable
---
&gt; But at least for me, it kinda brings joy that people fucking hate it with passion. I can /laugh at them, but on 5 different chars AT THE SAME TIME.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And really not feel bad if i kill other ppl, because they do deserve it. So thank you reddit, for that.
---
This is the typical attitude of a cheater. 
---
You are using a 3rd party program to replicate your keystrokes to other game windows that you would not be able to do otherwise. Technically, you are manually controlling 1 character while your actions are being replicated by a 3rd party program to your 4 other characters which makes them automatically follow your keystrokes and mouse movements. This is automation. You would not be able to multibox the 4 other character the way you do unless you had this program relaying your keystrokes to your other characters.
---
It depends on your tank to be honest.
---
If it's a Paladin or a Druid (who know what they're doing) they can hold aggro all the time and you can start using Blizzard after 1-2 seconds. Don't forget to help them with a Frost Nova.
---
If it's a Warrior (good luck). They can't hold aggro in bigger pulls so you will have to start your rotation with Frost Nova then go away from the mobs and Blizzard them down.
---
What's also expected of mages in general? 
---
You have Polymorph, use it on casters!
---
Don't forget to give everyone food and water at the start of the dungeon.
---
If you're higher level, make a portal for them at the end of the dungeon. It's not mandatory, but it's nice :P
---
That's one thing I like from retail. If you need a boe item it becomes bop. Would be nice of that was in classic
---
This.
---
There is literally not enough quests on alliance side to ding to 60. I belive the original view was quests to contribute around 25% of total leveling exp whilst grinding is the other 75%.
---
to be fair, you'll be doing a lot of ubrs runs anyways for briarwood, truestrike, swords, fire resist gear for tank etc. You'll have all the dragon eyes you need and then some before you're done farming ubrs with your guild.
---
This was really funny the first 500 times someone did that.
---
I know nothing about sneks besides one story where some friend's friend woke up with his pet snek lying perfectly straight next to him while asleep, which I was told was to determine whether it could swallow him. 
---
My point: are you sure those are kisses? :)
---
We are the same, except ours is a baby that doesn't sleep.
---
Of course it is, much like wrestling— but their sycophantic male followers aged 13-25 don’t know that.
---
My current talent calculated "build" at 60 would be 15 in afflict for insta corrup and drain life bonsuses, 4 into the stamina of demonology, and the rest into destro.
---
Is that stupid? Is putting such emphasis on drain life only effective while leveling? Is it useful at 60?
---
For me it seems like they have some directive that they can only escalate if it's asked specifically by the customer (or they penalised somehow if they cannot solve the problem without escalation).
---
A decent chunk of damage comes from ammo and attack power. You should be getting about 15 more damage from white hits with the new gun.
---
It's a common misconception that continues to get spread because it makes sense to most people on the surface.  Doubly so because people automatically equate rare with quality.
---
I’m saying if you had to ask reddit how to level efficiently then you probably won’t be able to do 50-60 in 24 hours
---
Someone was so frustrated they bought one of my Gizzards for 5 gold while in Blasted Lands. I liked it.
---
I switched at i think lvl 50ish from 2H arms. I like it a lot more since i never really bothered with hamstring kiting or 1-2-1-2 pulling with sweeping strikes.  I'm lazy AF lol. So to me personally dual wield fury feels better. Dungeon DPSin is night and day. Tanking, didn't really notice a difference.
---

No king rules forever
---
Haha reminds me of SM - Armory on Classic. Get one of the dudes low, guy literally walks through the metal bars and wall to the next room and brings two packs with him, Blizzard polish lmao.
---
Fire reflector recipe drops from him. Any engineer will want it.
---
I dunno with you, but I never have time to get two sunders on each mob. I charge in blood rage,  thunder clap, switch to defensive stance, demo shout and then I start sundering armour, primarily on the focus target, and once i feel i have enough threat on that I start casting sunders and revenge on the other mobs as well as new thunder claps when the first one runs out. I am no expert but up until now lvl 40, this has worked great for instancing. There are trouble if the dps opens with large aoe before i get some initial threat or they focus different targets.
---
Farming mobs?
---
They have always allowed it, multiboxers have been in the game since the beginning. I dont think that is going to change.
---
I never understood sociopaths playing an MMORPGs.
---
Not sure what it is actually. Im using the Power Hour UI that's a complete pack of addons already set up to work together. Some dude on youtube. He has a 1 hour video on it. But I don't remember which addon this particular feature is coming from.
---
Skip it thank me later
---
Of course I'm envious. That's cool as shit.
---
There is no ruleset, so drop the attitude, neither of you are right.
---
Goddamn.
---
The dude is literally claiming random bullshit as fact without any supporting evidence. He doesn't 'know better' in any way, shape, or form. He's just another uninformed idiot confusing his anecdotal opinion/experience as fact.
---
Thanks. Lol i somehow absolutely did not notice that :o
---
Had this thing in my mind it needed def stance. Oops haha
---
Yes, there's a tool to repeat your inputs to every instance of WoW. Either a simple AutoHotkey script, or a more advanced tool that also comes with an addon to handle some things within the client itself.
---
You don't you run inside the cabin? You can hide there.
---
Okay, thanks. A related question then: can I see other warriors' Sunder stacks on a mob or only my own? I've had some dungeons with warrior tanks where I never saw the debuff on mobs I targeted and I wasn't sure if it was hidden from me or if they just weren't sundering for whatever reason.
---
Miserable people with dissapointing lives need to get their pleasure somewhere tho. /s
---
I have that addon but I can't for the love of god figure out how to use it? I can't open any options or alike, how do I do? I just want to move the action bars to the right!
---
I understand that you see it as a gold drop, I'm pointing out the huge whole in your logic.
---
Everything is "just a gold drop" the difference here is only the scale - do I roll need on all BoPs because it only takes 50 to vendor to buy my BoE? I mean, I'll probably see 100 BoPs before one BoE, so it's roughly equivalent in my mind... Sorry priest, but we all killed this mob so we're all entitled to roll on X gold that it can potentially bring us.
---
If you truly believed BoEs were just gold, you'd split them equally after one member puts it on the AH, like when gold drops off a mob. But you don't actually see them that way, you just see yourself as entitled to the chance of a lot of gold (ergo greed) and you don't care who else is there or whethee or not they're going to equip it.
---
why do you want shitty loot? :D
---
Well, right now you won't need to raid twice a week, at least not MC. Most guilds are doing a tactic where they clear MC the day before and the day after reset, giving them a 13 day window of using another spec, and you won't need to respec for onyxia.
---
It's not the only path that exists you know. Go to Menethil and take the boat to Dustwallow March, walk to the Barrens...
---
It’s more than just keeping snd up. It’s also using your 2 big cooldowns at the right time (also using AR right before an energy tick), always using your attacks right after a right hand swing, using thistle tea right, using fap/gfpp/resto pots/sapper right, and of course, not dying, which is harder than as a caster.
---
The amount of posts about griefing recently. There's a faction war guys. Don't want to get involved, there's plenty of PvE servers.
---
Arugal is a PvP server mate, no RP there.
---
99% of this subreddits population. This is the inner core of the causal fanbase. Manifested it animal pictures, and lvl 30 characters im full scarlet gear.
---
Need 10 more for my 10 bag quest...LOL
---
Your welcome! :)
---
I started SM chest farming at 40. I’m holding the blues but the greens paid for my 60% mount.
---
[Not enough sound effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U&amp;t=91s)
---
Not on its own, just as you won't get banned for gifting someone 100g. But if they suspect that some account is regularly buying overpriced greens, they might act on it.
---
Hey, I only put points in there to allow me to get closer to opponents and open up safely before they see me. I assume you mean 'Master of Deception' right?
---
Roll pve
---
Funny you say this. Today I saw a post about a dude earning more from low level enchants in tips when giving them out free then when he sold the mats on AH.
---
Clamlette Surprise definitely on the top of this list.
---
The droprate was changed in mid-TBC. I know because from TBC I was always soloing it on my Paladin and never getting the drop. Then whattyaknow after the nerf it finally did drop (sometimes I pretend I got it before the nerf ..)
---
Golden! I wanna play this game :D
---
Yeah but you'll be a farther distance from both so neither will hit you. If you go closer to one then you'll aggro just 1 sure but they'll hit you a couple of times which can knock you off your mount.
---
Why wouldn't you go through the middle?
---
yup, i can rarely get 2 hours to myself uninterrupted.
---
say what you will about lfg, it made runs short.
---
The class that is taking the piss for me this expansion is Warlocks. The amount of times these scumbags have just tapped themselves to full mana 0 health and then stood there 'ready for the next pull" while I drink for 40 seconds just to waste 1/8 of my mana to heal them up before the pull again is ridiculous. These Warlocks can go fuck themselves.
---
&gt;I don't know, maybe your miserable attitude?
---
 I don't know, maybe your miserable attitude?
---
I put my character and target frames where you have them, but for some reason they get reset every single time I log in and it's seriously pissing me off
---
Okay so there are a lot of things to mention here.
---
A Boss has a basic defense of 315. To always hit him  (from behind with yellow hits) you need 8%Hit BUT if the difference between your weaponskill and the enemy defense is larger than 10, youll need one more %Hit (9%).
---
So a human with 305 Weaponskill only needs 8%(because the difference is &lt;= 10) - the Hit he gets from the 5 weaponskill = 6%.
---
One important part you shouldnt forget is the dmg reduction from glancing blows. With 300 Weaponskill the dmg reduction from a GB is ~35%. With 305 weaponskill its about ~15% and goes down to ~5% with a weaponskill of 308.
---
Note: The chance to get a glancing blow does not get lower but the dmg reduction gets.
---
And your chance to miss gets down from 8%(300WS) to 6%(305WS).
---
Getting +5 on Swords/Axes is super huge for Warriors. Rogues have a talent to get +5 for Swords but its still super good because its hard to get +WS.
---
Also you shouldnt forget that the +5 weaponskill changes your critcap. 
---
The formular for white hits is : 100% - 24.6%miss - 5.6% dodge - 40%GB + your hit%.
---
For yellow hits it is: 100% - 8% miss - 5.6% dodge + your hit%.
---
So to conclude everything: Your +5 Weaponskill not only affects your chance to hit, it also reduces your dmg reduction from glancing blows and reduces the chance to miss. Not to forget that it makes it a lot easier to get your critcap.
---
I hope this helped, sry for my bad english as i am not a native speaker
---
Mate, I roll tank Druid and if my Healer wants to go for a boss then they're gonna get their way. You either roll with the people facilitating your health pool or you get naught but a repair bill and a long run back to the instance.
---
For a spec built so heavily around backstab find the 5 points for opportunity in the sub tree
---
I really enjoy Classic paladin. It makes me feel like a mother a lot of the times, because it gives me so many tools to save endangered Alliance scragglers after they pull too much from their greed.
---
It's super simple isn't it?  
---
Some people just NEED to manufacture drama desperately any time no one is paying attention to them.
---
Most of these chests would be impossible to clear to solo.  Rogues already bring zero buffs, a weak cc, and are melee.  You really want to be that selfish over some cheese and a green?  This game is long term and you will not make any friends that way that’s for sure.
---
I like to have both data sets.  I made a few investment purchases based off of one data set before and been dismayed to find it not accurate.  Generally if both are around the same range I'm of the opinion its more reliable.
---
This can be used but two crucial talents are missing.
---
Improved Slice and Dice
---
Opportunity (sub)
---
I suggest moving inproved stealth to opportunity and 2 points from sprint and 1 from poisons to 3 slice and dice
---
"P.s. I know Devout Mantle isn't BIS. BIS lists for blue gear stem from a cancerous mindset and are contrary to the spirit of Classic"
---
this is just bullshit.
---
I tried to get BiS in classic aswell. but it was much harder to find BiS lists online.
---
bloodmoney
---
Yeah that's the one, guess that's pretty useful in openworld single player stuff. I was just thinking in dungeon context.
---
So if it's ran for profit and tanks are the limiting factor why wouldn't they res the first orb? 
---
Tanks can make there own group in seconds with people who need items, meanwhile you'll be spamming lf1m tank live for hours. You have 0 bargaining power.
---
well I don't know what zones you were leveling in but half of the mobs I'm having to kill can take two 5p evisc to kill.
---
"Manipulating the AH" = being too successful at it?
---
It is definitely a big difficult to use.
---
Press escape, one of the options like addons macros keybindings etc. will be named MoveAnything Press that one
---
You will now have a list of things you can change around, press the one called Blizzard Action bars and you will see a list of various things and 2 boxes.
---
The left box allows you to move that thing around, and the right box hides the thing. There is also a vertical or horzontal option so you can decide how the bar should be layed out.
---
You’re going to get a lot of people commenting that don’t know what they’re talking about, I spent 20 hours farming skyshroud legs and black crows for guildies last week and absolutely packs pull from miles away, even when our comp was warrior, warrior, mage, ret pally, pally we had mobs pull from the back wall right before you turn into the ogres. I really don’t know why it happens but there’s no ability hitting that far away, it even happened while 3/5 of us were on the bridge and just me and the other warrior were hitting the mobs being los pulled.
---
Are you me?
---
Greens are more common and often vendor trash. Many people even say "Can I need? It's an upgrade" and there's no issues. Unless the person plans to need all of them, you generally don't have to talk about it.
---
But BoE's, especially early on, can sell for anywhere from 1-30g which could be the difference between getting your mount or not.
---
I went with Devilsaur for the gloves/leggings, because it felt like the more iconic pre raid bis option. XD
---
ElvUI, grid, and Luna all support this out of the box. Probably more as well. It’s easy to implement, they all just use the same shared library.
---
Have you tried customizing the default frames at all? You can change the size of each player bar, sorting, color between class color or health, add mana bars, add/remove pets from view. Honestly it’s a pretty good raid frame.
---
The could be fixed so easily. There is a loot system in classic where you can only need loot you can use. So just make it so that when needing with those loot rules set it auto binds the item.
---
No, system works because everybody will acutally equip that BoE item, because its just a token to get what you will equip. 
---
Think of them like they were set tokens back in cata or wrath. You get the token, you go to vendor and trade it.  But lets say they are not tokens anymore but they are set pieces. But you can actually sell those set pieces for tokens to that vendor and get the set piece you want. So when a set piece you already have, drop, you still need that because you trade that for something you dont have. 
---
It shouldnt be really hard to understand. They are just like tokens. You trade them in for the item you will use. It doesnt matter if you can actually equip that, I will make use of that as well. 
---
The difference between 3 and 300g should be obv. Its just 1 for 1 trade. Im not gonna take 100 items just to get 1. You can see that these 2 situations are way too different right? Its not greed, I need that item to get the item I want. I only need that item though. Im not needing an item to get 1/100 an item. I need 1 item to get 1 item.  
---
Just set the loot rule so everbody can agree what to do when purple BoE drops.
---
Worst in slot.
---
Good point, but your tone of voice was a bit smug.
---
Agree with shiv here, altho I'd suggest making a farm alt for a warrior first. Preferably with alchemy so you can supply your own pots. Just makes life a lot easier, and you'll likely make an alt anyway sooner or later.
---
It looks like a pvp build. /shrug do what you want just dont be pissy at people if they dont take you with on raids
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.0.2_(undocumented_changes)
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deathcharger%27s_Reins
---
Both list it as a 3.0.2 change, in WotLK.
---
Dude that’s an awesome reply, thanks for the info! I think you’ve convinced me that the +5 is definitely worth it
---
You had a sex change? Which is great it’s 2019, live your best life.
---
Does this work with ppl not in your party?
---
lets say it like this, the average player wouldn't notice any difference at all.
---
Well I know VuhDo doesn't. Guess I was wrong about stretching this assumption to other addons, though.
---
It's not childish in the least. It's the very reason a lot of people roll on a PvP server and some would see as the point of a PvP server. Your misery is their pleasure. Frankly, if you couldn't handle that 'misery', you shouldn't have rolled a PvP server.
---
Try the boat to Theramore, or get a friend/guildie or two to help you out.
---
This is awesome - I wish we could have this as a loading screen for WC!  
---
Keen to see more :)
---
Is this mount as much of a status symbol in the horde side as it is for the ally? It's the exact same undead mount. Anybody who's exalted with undercity can ride one.
---
Nobody likes you, and I doubt they ever will.
---
Damn... Seems like i'll have to spend the remaining of my work day binging Nyhm music videos for nostalgia lmao.
---
Aggro distance is edge-to-edge, so for taurens, noggenfogger actually does reduce aggro range.
---
I didn’t “have” to do anything, I made a reddit post because I was curious, I work during the day and got bored so I decided to make a reddit post, no one said anything about solo, put your ego somewhere else 😂
---
Reddit overload
---
Edgemaster's handguards don't improve skill with 2-handed weapons, so you have to use 1 hander + shield to benefit from them. 
---
Weapon skill is also largely a PvE stat (only has very minor effects on hit and crit chance in PvP.)
---
I want to have the same function as dominos and bartender but keep the blizzard UI!
---
Maybe in theory but really hard. Especially the shaman multiboxer that has all of em shock a single target at once which is basically a one-shot kill. I once saw a group form to kill the multiboxer and they all died one by one.
---
Wait, did you just film this with your phone? Why not shadow play or Windows?
---
If I'm doing a run of Strat for example, and I know that every single person in the group doesn't have a single upgrade from that dungeon, then yes you may as well roll need on every single BoP. It's just gold, it doesn't fucking matter. 
---
But that's virtually never the case. To some people, that BoP is an upgrade that they can't go and buy. The only way they can obtain it is by getting it as a drop. Hence it has infinitely more value than the 5g you get from vendoring it.
---
And yes, my group splits BoEs down the middle when they drop. When they sell, we mail each over 1/5th of the cut. I just don't trust everyone to mail me back after a certain period of time, so to combat this you even it out over the long run by everyone being entitled to the same drop.
---
Don't roll on PvP if you can't take PvP. This is basically what you signed up for.
---
If you want fair situation, roll on PvE and do battlegrounds.
---
🤣
---
It's a good learning experience for you then. :)
---
You did the only thing a true alliance soldier was expected to do ! All hail to that cheesy sweet pyroblast
---
[deleted]
---
I understand how it works, but to me it seems like some huge warrior mafia. There's plenty enough of warriors out there, but they're abusing their exclusivity. Just like mages do with portals, though that doesn't normally bother me.
---
Wow has been 15/month since 2004. That has never increased. This is the cost of using a service, not the cost of BFA or continued updates.
---
100% of your ban decisions done by first level GM support were handled improperly, correct?
---
So you're telling me I unlearned and engi and relearned it for 50-60 gold for nothing? Feelsbadman
---
I’ve not done it yet, but I always start casting mind control if an alliance targets me, the cancel and /lol at them. The panic when they think I’m about to do it is brilliant
---
but...but...the priest shoulders are a paladin item, no?
---
Reddit is gonna love this post :D
---
The only thing missing is "GM said it was fine" :D
---
People will then also find out that you can oneshot every MC boss without any consumable at all in a rndm grp.
---
That flute thing from strat
---
I call it “threading the needle”
---
I think I'm playing classic for the community!
---
Love you all :D!
---
I see the /s, but it still got me thinking. I think I need to form a guild called &lt;Switch to ML and I stop healing&gt; or something along those lines.
---
That's not even how it works. You can't ban someone for not subscribing to your loot rules, you can only ban someone who defined loot rules via Master Looter and then lied about it.
---
I mean I do have lvl 45 quests there that I wouldnt be able to complete. It is just half the lvl 30 quests that I didnt do
---
Ah I see. I might give it a go anyway. Worst that can happen is I die
---
Wolf/cat
---
Why did you film this on your phone? It’s 2019 ffs
---
It's actually just friendly for the 4400 mana over 30 sec water. You're thinking of the 4200 mana over 30 sec spirit buff water that gives you a +10 spirit food buff as well.
---
Become the rouge
---
If a vendor trash item dropped for 200g then it's sole purpose in game is to sell. Not equip. If armor or a weapon drops it's sole purpose is to be worn or used. Big difference.
---
Since when can you use abilities when MC in PvP?
---
Why would the majority of horde players want to transfer away though? The only reason the majority would is so they could get faster BG queue times.
---
No, Apes did not, most of the Apes members stream as well if you want to look.
---
So if Edgemasters Handguards drop and it would be an upgrade for him he should in you mind get it?
---
They sell for 700g on my server...
---
Some classes could buy 2-3 upgrades on the AH for that money meaning them getting the BoE would be a bigger upgrade.
---
So what makes you think that YOU should be the one to get it? You can buy yours on the AH as the other would have to do if you get this one.
---
This mentality screams entitled kid to me and that you're bummed out that you didn't get your upgrade for free...
---
You realize wc is like lvl 15-17 instance right
---
Look up the definition of fun, please. Theres nothing fun about reserving items.
---
Is it acceptable to 2v1 gank someone fishing and then proceed to get owned by them instead?
---
now this is glorious battlefield !!
---
EU streamer server. Again the outlier.
---
I know right? I'm seeing so many people taking a weirdly strong stance on this. Needing just makes everything easier so you dont have to worry about ninjas and not equipping
---
Can confirm, this exact scenario happened to me in classic. It was devastating. They won the roll and immediately equipped before anyone could say anything. They were sad too after I told him its worth on the AH.
---
There is a server for that
---
I'm a druid tank and if some fucker dares to demand we skip Solakar I will personally kick the wanker out of my group, good luck on your damn quest for a new tank and healer mate!
---
100% with the priests in this!
---
It's the coding.
---
Whaat?these are epics.And numbers alone won't grant win unless its by a large margin there are still issues of gear,skill and coordinating your group
---
I disagree on it not being childish(I mean if someone is using their time to play to just be a dick to people I dont know what to call it but childish?). But I agree that it is a very normal part of a PvP servers and it's not expected to change.
---
SHAZZRAH EU
---
No, it's unacceptable. If you lost a 2v1 to someone with a fishing rod you should uninstall immediately. /s
---
I do it like this: 
---
If the "rules" aren't established before you start a party, dungeon, raid whatever, I wait until other people roll to see how they wanna do it. If people start needing, I need too. If everyone greeds, I greed.
---
&gt; Needing a BOE would bind it to you if you won? 
---
Twink PVP or leveling would take a heavy hit. Since most items you want for that are BoE's.
---
Have we advanced to a level of screen capture phone videos now?
---

BRM lags with small 40v40 skirmishes

OP be like: What's faster, farming **runecloth**, or **farming gold** and buying the runecloth off the AH?
---
&gt; farm Timbermaw rep
---
??? :D
---
"The cavalry" is busy faring Rend.
---
Yeah. I actually really appreciate how a lot of pservers banned this.
---
you're probably getting downvoted bc these topics are getting posted every single day, it's not new
---
I'm now having people randomly send me tells asking me if I want to buy a level 55 plus boe epic. Happened twice tonight. I was in a dungeon too.
---
Warlocks have a spec that works decently in both pvp and pve, and are one of the better classes to solo farm gold with. You're probably better off than any other class here lol.
---
Then by his own logic, everyone needs it equally, so if everyone greeds he also has to greed to be equal.
---
Fucking moron!
---
Bandages are like 10s a piece. A drink is I think 8s.
---
No idea why I should be tossing my money at them outside of fulfilling my role as an in combat healer. Buy a fucking drink and drink while I drink. It saves tons of time over having me drink twice just so that you don't have to.
---
I usually spec at around 55-56.
---
I like it
---
You can solo it with any amount of Mana, a higher Mana pool will allow you to kill tinkerer faster. And on princess you can't die, you can kite her around the rocks forever.
---
the final boss is 24. nobody is running WC at 15 unless they’re carried through. low 20s is a normal range to run WC before hopping to SFK
---
Not as much as they hate themselves. Why else would you spend so much money and time doing something with such minimal pay off.
---
I say if you’re not happy reroll now. 
---
I rolled on Herod, which ended up having like a 70:30 Horde to Alliance Population. Wish I refilled sooner.
---
Multi boxing works because one player can pay to be able to kill anyone "1v1". 
---
I'd say that is the reason most people dislike them.
---
6 hours for one quest? lol
---
One whole level shouldn't even take 6 hours.
---
You'd go through and roll need on everything? Man, what the hell? You're gonna inspect them and tell them "You don't need anything, so I'm going to be taking all the gold, at least until you realise I'm ninjaing every drop". You're not painting yourself in the light of "not-a-greedy-bhole" that you're trying, here.
---
Yes, if NOBODY really needs the item, all bets are off - Do what you want, I guess, and suffer the consequences from your random needing in LookingForGroup. If someone needs the item, then they need it, and so they roll need. If I don't need the item, but want the gold, I'm going to be greeding it.
---
Stop killing this mans dreams lmao
---
I use mind control sometimes, to put in some extra effort.
---
Open trade window with them
---
Yet to see anyone push for healers over needing tanks. Now both of those over dps? Yes.
---
This is the spec I am working towards it gives you all fun rogue stuff in my opinion.

Did some more testing and noticed that if you try to interrupt it in the first-half of the global cooldown, then it does nothing.  But if you try to interrupt in the second-half, then it does.

It's okay I'm a warlock and I support and love you.

I mean... lol. You are playing for service, you know that right? It doesn´t matter if that service is 15years old, because it still has GMs in it, it still need updates, it still needs ban hammers, it still need some developers.... I mean you people should wake up and realize that it doesn´t matter its 15y old game omfg....
---
Pretty sure any position that makes guards not be able to get to you is a bannable offense, not just rooftops.

I help you, you help me. How fucking hard is to grasp the concept!?!?

If Boomkins didn't run out of mana in .5 seconds you'd likely see 1 or 2 in raids occasionally to buff mages crit rate
---
What is the Addon for your UnitFrames
---
Prove me wrong then
---
You don't think the game should use a need / greed system then.  Blizzard themselves later changed it so needed items get soulbound.   Rule on my old server was equip it in the dungeon if you rolled need to accomplish the same effect.  If it was meant to be used the way use insist why have the game even give a choice.   Selling for gold when someone else could use it is the very definition of the greed roll.   Everything has vaule to everyone so why even have need / greed in the game?  Clearly you want to work under rules not intended by the game and are nijing under the systems design.
---
Damn imagening only knowing Rexxar from HotS. Glad zoomers are joining classic
---
Often times, you’re not running it with your friends, unless you have an entire group of 5 that specifically plans out when they’re going to be running dungeons. I don’t have that, that’s for sure, and I’m a tank! You’d think tanks/healers would be the ones that people would coordinate those things with.
---
Secondly, what groups ever have people in it that don’t need any items whatsoever, don’t get any exp, and aren’t getting paid? When you’re running BRD, everyone needs SOMETHING from it. You don’t ever have a 5-man or warriors all spamming Anger for HoJ, a 8% drop, do you? No, you’re going to have a priest, a couple more DPS, a tank. Guess what? That means you have 4 other people that all need something. Your “gear run” just turned into a 75% clear because everyone needs something from somewhere.
---
Thanks! :D By the time I'm better at proportions and anatomy I'm gonna learn how to draw clothes and armor, but babysteps for now
---
If the other 4 roll need (3 people want to sell it and 1 wants to equip it) then you would increase the guys chances to get the item by also rolling need and if you win you can give it to him. If any of you 2 win there will be no hard feelings from the 3 that wants to sell it, it was a fair roll. If you win you get to be the hero, and if he wins he didn't only have the luck get the item to drop he won the roll against everyone. If any of the other 3 win they are happy and you did what you could.
---
I give water breathing to everyone I meet. More often than not, it reminds mages and priests to buff me in return \^\^

Unbreakable reborn
---
Just wait a while once hype train arrive to the station again.
---
Personally i love rogues in dungeon groups. It's like rogue players are more patient than some others. Anecdotal evidence of course ;)
---
I see your argument on expensive drops. Even if I don't agree with it, I definitely it when it comes to epics. However, I don't agree when the BoE blue item might sell for 40g or 50g on the AH. That, too me, is a dick move.
---
Interesting, didn't realise that was possible at 40 already. Which part would be the best? I know there are 2- 3 chests in the graveyard, but can't remember others.
---
Gear plays a role, but as far as coordination and skill goes, I personally disagree.
---
She got smashed !
---
It is not just a token, it's a literal item that's about to be equipped.
---
To you, it's just a token, because that lets you do some mental gymnastics to explain why it's okay for you to try and take anything of value that ever drops when you're around.
---
To others (In this thread, and in every group I remember being in), a BoE is a BoE, i.e. it is an item that can be sold for greed, or used by need. If the warrior is going to equip that item before he leaves the dungeon, there's no difference between the now-soulbound BoE and the always-soulbound BoP. Only difference was some "potential gold" that you were greedily eyeing up, but didn't want to roll greed for.
---
It also has a Kill on Sight list, which alerts you whenever someone of that is close to you, should've probably mentioned that. You can also set notes to enemy players.
---
THIS, exactly!
---
Got that zombie's vibe as well
---
And this has been pretty standard since vanilla from my experience.
---
15-17 in some areas, 17-21 in others, and with bad pulls you still need a tank, and the moss fen boss hit like a truck. A rogue is no substitute for a tank. High dps but low hp and armor makes for a glass cannon.
---
But the functions of those addons are literally just to change the UI. What exactly do you want to achieve?
---
Alright I will not play with the ninja again, but he already has the epic BoE. That is why in PuG groups this system does not work.
---
70% of loot will not be an upgrade to your current gear.
---
Why do you think greed button even exist?
---
Yeah, you trying to validate the idea that Needing an item for gold isnt selfish, but Needing an item because it's an upgrade apparently is selfish is pretty damn funny. 
---
You do realize this is the idea behind the looting system right? Theres a reason why there are two different roll buttons to begin with, and why one is labelled "Need" and the other is labelled "Greed"
---
There is a significant difference between wanting an item as a gear upgrade and wanting it to sell.
---
The look is less important than the rarity.
---
Except I'm not playing chicken with you on a 800G+ item, I'll roll need and if you want a chance you can roll need too.
---
If you're my friend I will probably pass on it if it's an upgrade for you, if you're a stranger, it's 800G, we all roll.
---
Seems like the link didn’t work I will relink.
---
Thanks, I'll definitely try this once 60. We can I kill only one per run? Is it not possible to vanish and then kill the other one?
---
A warlock in my guild was soloing it the other night and the ring dropped.. I sweet talked him and he let me tag along and it dropped again after another 3 princess kills. Felt very lucky considering I know people who have done 40+ runs for it....
---
Can you tell me the exact gold amount where this logic kicks in?
---
No I'm saying that the group as a whole may as well need on everything. There is no difference from everyone rolling greed and everyone rolling need.
---
Believe me, we followed them quite closely. Every APES guy shut their streams down about after L45-50. And then suddenly all of them were 60.
---
So either it was torch runs, most likely in raids (to have more than the mages get XP), or some other instance spam that they found.
---
I play on Stalaag. I would love to play with fellow night walkers
---
Yea, the classic “hide in the cabin and run back and forth around the wall to break LoS and stop the cast.”
---
skeram is the server, not the player name lol
---
The guy im talking to only does 100% clears. Your example is just like I say; why clear every single boss every time, if no one needs anything from boss X, if it takes 10 minutes to kill x.
---
I usually hate the art on here, but this is really cool. Nice job
---
I just want t0.5 questline for that giant refrigerator thing you can place in raids and annoy everyone. Or was that horde only?
---
Ya'll guys here realize the other guy was sitting, don't you? Some impressive numbers indeed, but the crit was just bound to happen under those circumstances.
---
Are there any good places where the Horde can do this to the Alliance?
---
Right so collect all of it lol. 
---
I have an mp5 set with a shield and a plus healing set with an offhand. Its not hard.
---
We need more!
---
You’re just doing those quests at the wrong time. Either that or you’re just wasting time looking for said mobs when there’s a shit ton of people doing the same thing lol.
---
It does trigger off abilities, but then only makes white attacks off that ability iirc.
---
Server transfers are to avoid server ques.
---
You're probably not going to like hearing this, but this is the norm for a PvP server. In fact I'd say this is the better griefing in PvP servers, other times you'll be unable to do quests because a member of the opposite faction is camped at a neutral quest giver killing people trying to turn in the quest or even pick it up. Other times you're in a farming spot and they'll do it anyway, other-
---
Actually no point in continuing. I'm sure you've experienced all this. I've no idea why someone with limited time would roll a PvP server. I'm on an RP server cause I just play this game to have fun, not to be griefed, and not to then grief others when I have the opportunity. There's no fun (for me) in finding out how low people can go in world PvP.
---
This kinda stuff makes me laugh. My groups warrior that is 60 has an erratic schedule and instead of waiting for pugs we’ve basically figured out what you can kill without a warrior in brd and lbrs and it turns out that it’s the whole dungeon. Hunter pets tank the bosses fine and everyone can aoe kill all of the trash and just blow it up.
---
That other warrior that is too lazy to put on a shield doesn’t deserve savage chain.  Also mind control in Lbrs is bonkers. You can basically 5 dps most of the pulls and just melt the instance.
---
Some Rogue On Dreadmist just rolled Mail Savage Chest Epic BoP from BRD Arena and won. His words "I always need BoE epics". People are so eager for money so they don't even notice BoP. The shaman in my group was devastated by this. The Rogue didn't even apologise.
---
If you feel like moving on, move on ☺
---
You can probably charge gold for arena runs.
---
1g per person and since you can only do 5 runs in an hour it's a free 20g.
---
A Shaman resto (nature swiftness) / enchantment (both advanced totem talents) so something like \~27 / 23 split or so in a pvp server.  The idea is buffed windfury /strength of earth totem healer (i.e., have to give up the mana tide totem for that, presumably that hole can be plugged by potions). Occasional non-solo pvp, occasional dungeons. 
---
I have a question about improved lighting shield talent (increasing damage done by lighting shield orbs by 15% for 3 points) - is it worth it or would it be better to go with .. uhh 3 points in improved shield, for example (+3% block and 15% more blocked, if one is using shield). Seems like this specific question is not popular enough to yield me an answer after some googling around.
---
This looks like a RL Stine book cover.  I love it.

Bluehunters
---
Did you drop tailoring or is there money to be made? Already got my Archmage
---
I'll search for it when I come home! Thanks for the input mate!
---
This isn't rules, this is pure logic and economics. Why would I force myself into blindly trusting people and dealing with a Prisoner's Dilemma when there already exists a logically fair solution? Why invite Ninja looting into your life when there's an easy solution around it?
---
EDIT: Freezing Band is 500g that they would have otherwise spent on it to a mage who is going to use it. If you don't understand that, you don't understand basic economics and there's no point in trying to convince you.
---
Why would I give 500g to a random guy in my group?
---
Name the item please.
---
The issue is he's lazy and doesn't know how to communicate
---
I'd be interested.
---
Ally have it worse on basically every map, stop whining Horde are easy mode on a PvP server.
---
I see... I see so much potential...
---
Alright boys im needing every BoP so i can dust them as im an enchanter and enchanters make us stronger
---
\&gt; P.s. I know Devout Mantle isn't BIS. BIS lists for blue gear stem from a cancerous mindset and are contrary to the spirit of Classic.   
---
this sentence is cancerous. 
---
no, BIS lists are for people who wish to optimise their characters and it is indeed not contrary to the spirit of classic. telling others how to play is contrary to the spirit of classic.  
---
if this doesn't interest you then join a group that is okay with doing solakar - or ask - if you get a no, then you can stay or leave. it's entirely your choice.
---
Cataclysm was still awhile ago I mean 10 years is a long time
---
We had bis lists in vanilla
---
Tell them in the start of the group we are doing X boss for X gear, or im not healing your grp.
---
if they kick you find another grp. you are a healer you will find one. fuck the elitist ass wipes.
---
I too will follow my priest anywhere. If you can heal it I can tank it. Also never not give a healer or a tank first dibs.
---
tbh, leveling as prot was a pain, the reflect damage just isn't all there without the gear for it
---
either go holy and get in dungeons, or stay ret and do whatever you want
---
I’m aware how resists and hit works.
---
Why the fuck would I do that? You think I really care that much to prove you wrong? 
---
I know from past experience. 
---
Here I got an idea man, 
---
You level a character to 15, go do wc and video it. 
---
Prove me right. You won’t.
---
See how stupid that sounds?
---
Then you should have your eyes checked out.
---
1. Is there an addon that will tell me which spell is dealing the damage I'm doing BUT doesn't change anything else?
---
I tried Miks Scrolling Battle Text and I hated it, way too confusing and cluttered for me.
---
2. Why is everybody farming the rock elementals in Badlands so much? Elemental earth really? I got like 2 of them in 1 hour of farming and I really don't see it being worth the time spent to farm it
---
3. I can't manage to sell low level herbs like Briarthorn , Silverleaf, etc and also Heavy Leather/hides on the  AH. When should I give up and just vendor it? It's taking up way too much space. From which point on should I hold onto the herbs/skins?
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-hunter-pets](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-hunter-pets)
---
Now we are blaming the victim.
---
It's such an exteme situation though, that would most likely never occur. Ninjaing is a legit widespread problem that would get solved through this.
---
The point you're missing is that BIS is void of meaning when:
---
1. You're going to replace it in MC in the weeks to come
---
2. There are other items that are just as good
---
Obsessing about items because a list told you it's the best is pretty dumb, will slow you the fuck down, and often just wrong as these BIS lists are often filled with opinions rather than facts.
---
Level 32 from mountain lions
---
That's didn't work that way because everyone deserves gold. Players got so sick of ninjas swiping upgrades from people that BoEs basically became something you couldn't ever hope to wear unless you purchase it, it's a shitty state to devolve to
---
Or go there once at the right time (offpeak, show up at 2am and get lucky maybe)
---
I didnt know that, is there a video showcasing or something?
---
I know taurens have longer melee range, but I didnt think that applied to aggro aswell
---
Doesn't matter what you spend the gold on, bud. All need, you get your one chance in 5, stop being so salty about loot.
---
That takes more mana, a single SoR judgement will get aggro to you and use less mana than healing someone over and over until the mob agros you again.
---
If you’re aware of how resists and hits work then you would know how fucking stupid you sound saying WC is a level 15 instance LOL
---
The hunter in the video is level 40. You can get it at level 32 from these which is like 1 minute away from where they are in the video:  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2406/mountain-lion#abilities
---
Nope, just suggestion as to what may have been the issue.
---
? Yes? That's what I said? 
---
Maybe look again?
---
&gt;  I'll roll need and if you want a chance you can roll need too. With everyone rolling need, no one gets scammed out of a chance at it.
---
That's just throwing wild guesses, and your statement about public companies only reflects your lack of knowledge in the IT field and database administration. Companies aren't obliged to keep a record of each of their hundreds of game versions of the last 15 years, dude.
---
The only elementals that drop trash like grey/green items that can be vendored or sold on the AH are the fire ones, and the essence of fire sells for very little right now due to people spamming BRD and MC.
---
That makes it very, very slow.
---
Spider silk is also rancid. Easily farmed in WPL but a stack sells for 1-2g max.
---
The other silk sells for 30s/stack.
---
Furlborgs are interesting, but I see nothing of value that can be bought from the Timbermaw Hold after exalted/revered.
---
Satyrs have mana burn and other stuff that makes it impossible for casters to farm them. The one's in Felwood are viable but there's not enough spawns to constantly be killing them. Felwood is sold 80s/piece here and have 3% drop rate.
---
Crusader enchant is the most gimmick farming method there is. Either it drops and you get rich or you spend 20 hours farming there for 5g/hour.
---
Yea they set up a macro where they just press 123 while watching movies
---
&gt;but it's BIS!
---
it's only bis if you have all of it. stat prio is a thing in classic too, we just didn't know about it in vanilla. not every piece of every "pre-raid bis" set stands on its own without all of the other pieces together
---
my issue with the "it's my bis tho" crowd is that they're mostly mindless idiots who have categorically refused to do any thinking for themselves and are just reading a guide off wowhead to tell them which bosses to farm
---
That right there is a rogue with drinks on his action bar.
---
You don't need to heal them, they have lots of ways to heal themselves and if they take aggro and insta die so be it.
---
Mind controlling people off of boats is just so entertaining
---
Legendary &gt; Epic
---
Fine, I'll try. How many bosses should I kill? Which ones?
---
That's why I farmed the seal of ascension. When you're the one to open UBRS, people *generally* don't object killing Solakar.
---
I tried swimming from Darkshore to Winterspring. Ended up in Azshara xD.
---
If you think you might enjoy a tanking class, it's highly recommended to play one. They are always in huge demand and get priority in most circumstances. At the end of the day however, play what you enjoy the most.
---
I'd say druid, I was leveling my rogue and its rough. Started a druid and it's a much nicer experience.
---
Calling child services.. ha
---
Blizzard could definitely be doing more to advance their server technology, I'm not saying they're perfect. But we're currently dealing with, as you stated, a 15 year old game running on new technology so there is going to be issues.
---
And as I mentioned before, the sheer volume of players involved within the largest MMO in the entire world with, at one point 12,000,000 player population, is what causes issues. Comparing that to DaoC which had around 200,000 player population at a peak isn't really fair.
---
(2) maybe they're just doing the quests that require drops from these and can take a LOT of time to complete?
---
(3) They used to sell for some silver early on but there's far too many people gathering them now and far too few leveling alchemy, so yeah you're better off vendoring them.
---
Sometimes though, this is still the best idea. when you're in the middle of them, it takes the longest for mobs to actually get to you and hit you. And you may be able to get past them without them having a chance to daze / knoch you off your horse.
---
If you go straight past one so you only aggro the one mob, it definitely gets a hit on you which will daze / stun / instakill you.
---
TL;DW?
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
There will only be one 'stack' of sunder, regardless of whom is sundering.
---
yea there is a pos rogue and mage camping in booty bay on my server. They fucking do not get attacked by guards. I was frost novad ans hit fear. What happens is that the guards attack me. makes my blood boil
---
Hey, 3 more and we have a decent start, eh?
---
Unless they were helping farm the eye.... you don't need any help with the actual quest its pretty easy.
---
I'd just say, i hate them.. and if you are planning on wpvo alot, thats a good thing for you. Close to unkillable in the right hands. U can oom almost any caster and kite/wither down any melee.
---
Baby is his nickname for a guildmate asking him to run another dungeon.
---
ITs cheating plain and simple there is no reason to go that far with this game. of course if you pay people they let you cheat that is how life is.....sad that it follows to video games, wish they would do the right thing and ban these cheaters.
---
His target was sitting: every swing on a sitting target crits.
---
All this was a WF on a sitting target by a streamer that got fed his Sulfuras.
---
Keep your boring retail culture on retail, thanks.
---
His guild decided to give it to him? He's probably one of the founding members of the guild and one of the only players who can use it. Who else was gonna take it?
---
Try the Spy addon, it allows you to track wins/losses versus other players.
---
The difference is that anyone can buy a BoE for themselves, but you can only get that BoP directly from the boss.
---
&gt; (I mean if someone is using their time to play to just be a dick to people I dont know what to call it but childish?)
---
How is participating in pvp in a pvp game childish?
---
it only takes about 25 competent, reasonably geared 60s to clear mc/ony. the rest of the raid can be filled with whatever you want. this is known
---
anyone who thinks people need to be geared properly to do mc/ony is the exact same idiot from retail looking over r.io scores for a normal mode raid, no more, no less
---
Don't be bad then 4head!
---
Use discord instead? Not sure how you would even have a conversation on reddit.
---
You are the horde version of me
---
Who caaaaaaaaares I swear everyone crying never played this game when it was current jesus christ get the fuck over it
---
That’s ass sometimes. Waited 2 hours to find somebody for higher.
---
Uh I'm not sure (not a warlock) but I've seen it mentioned multiple times.
---
Let the group die then drop group when they want a res :P
---
Him "fuck here we go again"
---
I have, but let’s not waste either of our time since you have a single player mentality.
---
This is the attitude I hate about MMOs in general, and why I prefer playing with a group of people who I know, and don't have all the dungeon optimal routes memorized.
---
I would rather spend twice as long exploring the dungeon for the first time, as opposed to speedrunning it and not getting to enjoy any of it. Especially an amazing multi path dungeon like BRD
---
Gives new credence to: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mean_Streets_of_Gadgetzan

I'm glad you made a reddit account to achieve - karma, congrats.

People are complaining about losing 1v1's, where 1 is paying to bring 4 extra characters to the fight
---
Seriously though. Other than the video playing in the background, what does this have to do with Warcraft?
---
\*pats old bullet wound\* Mmmhm... Yessir... gold in them hills...
---
&gt; 25 competent, reasonably geared 60s to clear mc/ony.
---
So you need 25 people who are competent and are reasonably geared... So you need 25 people who have at least 1/2 of their pre-raid bis....
---
You’re not being limited to one though. You choose to limit yourself. The biggest argument people use is that it’s unfair but it’s really not because anyone can do it, they just choose not to. Everyone has fun in their own way. I’ve seen a few multi boxers running around but they’ve affected me 0. 
---
It is nice that they got rid of the botters though. That can easily ruin  the game for others. Two people I play with used to use one back in classic and the amount of stuff it can do, from damage rotations to gathering to questing was insane. That was stopped(afaik) once blizzard started scanning your computer though.
---
Barrens general.
---
They dot all at once to conceal their numbers...
---
IIRC there is an addon for extensive character notes that shows up next to their name in chat (or when you click on them, don't remember). It also let's your set green/yellow/red color on the notes I think, so you can quickly see if you had a good, bad, or neutral comment about them.
---
I'll have to remember to get it for myself.
---
What class?  
---
Did you get the eye drop ?  
---
Sulfuras is better than nightfall for your own output, but worse for the raid (unless someone else picks up nightfall).  
---
That being said, if you ask this I don't think you fully understand the commitment and cost obtaining sulfuras requires.
---
How can one man pay so much subscription per month just for this ?...
---
Purely dependent on sub numbers and the bonehead in charge at the time.
---
If it offers the potential revenue of retail or even a significant portion, it may get the classic+ treatment or we may get dedicated expac servers. Too early to tell atm, considering how much attention a "you think you do but you don't" release got they may change their tune down the line.
---
I was in what I thought was a pretty chill guild for a few weeks. This guy announced he’s officially going to be in the service in Discord so I said “gratz now go kill some nazis!” because who the hell hasn’t seen inglorious bastards? He deleted my message and privately messaged me telling me that’s not okay xD. Called him a square and g quitter right away. Anyone else have this experience with overly sensitive guild leaders?
---
&gt;I don't like BiS lists so they're against the spirit of classic
---
Anti-Competitive witchhunting needs to die already.
---
Just let people do their best JFC
---
In the right context it could be. 
---
I don’t understand why people have a problem with being called a dick when they are doing ducking things. 
---
Do I think this rogue did something Dickish? Fuck yeah I do and it was awesome because fuck the horde.
---
RemindMe! 4 hours
---
Skinning could probably give you more gold. You are going to kill a looot of creatures which can be skinned. But if you have never played before just do what you want. Getting to 60 and getting gold is going to be hard enough - why not have a little fun on the way?
---
Probably not but here take my ⬆️
---
If you think that im accusing them of something, im not. So if you are a fanboy you dont have to defend them. But they sure as fuck did find and do something that nobody else did. Their leveling from \~50 to 60 or close to it was easily 3x faster than anyone elses. And it wasnt streamed, thats for sure.
---
So if it just was something like torch runs or some spot in other instance, does it really matter.
---
Lol.
---
The main trick is to pop the Tremor Totem in right spots, as some of them critters like to put people in sleep for a long while and if its you as the healer its trouble time.
---
I’m a hunter. Dungeon groups are a bit harder for us as we don’t have much AoE and can’t play as a Tank or Healer. However, the extra time finding groups for dungeons is offset by much quicker grinding and quests solo. I recommend playing whatever sounds fun to you and going from there.
---
The game isn’t going anywhere so you can always make a second character to fill other roles.
---
While I support your post, your P.S. is one of the dumbest things I’ve seen on here. ItS cOnTrArY tO tHe SpIrIt Of ClAsSiC
---
Tanks are in the highest demand and therefore have the easiest time finding groups. With that said, you will still be able to find groups as a hunter, so your best bet is to just play what you like best.
---
Because for the gear I have right now, not some imaginary future state that may never come, Devout Mantle is BIS due to the 4pc bonus.
---
I'll keep an eye on this thread. I don't mind which server and faction is chosen, I'll happily roll a new server.
---
I did a priest to 37, then rogue to 34, then decided pvp servers were killing me and moved to a pve server, made another rogue and got to 33. somehow decided to try out multiboxing, got 4 locks to 18. then decided to get 4 mage and 1 priest to 18, then went 1 warrior 1 priest 3 mage to 18. now i decided 4 lock and 1 priest is the way to go.
---
im havin fun!
---
as a fellow holy priest i have gotten in the habit of confirming a grps intensions before making the journey or even accepting an inv.
---
I've had issues with wowhead being open in the background eventually makes my computer grind to a halt.
---
Idk but I think the class that makes the least amount of sense for orc is a rogue. I just can't imagine a big, brutish rogue being able to be stealthy.
---
As the PvP players keep telling everyone...
---
PvP is not fair.
---
In other words...  Git gud.
---
Nearly could've joined you as we rolled shazzrah at launch but rerolled day 2. I'm trying similar on flamelash-EU alliance. Our guild is roughly the same size, and early on from DM I was fortunate enough to friend up with a few friendly people who have their own guild of a similar size. We've taken the decision to just merge at this point in time (majority of people are level 35-45), and we'll probably either recruit or trying and team up with another similar sized guild. We're all quite laid back and similar ages as well (30+ vets of vanllia) so it is promising and no childishness. 
---
It's worth posting something on the official forums to see if you get any bites. That's where I browsed first but alliance flamelash looked to be severely under representated.
---
If you do find someone you can always setup a chat channel for cross guild talk. That's all I can offer really, interested to know how you get on.
---
This logic doesn't work if more than one person is following it. It becomes a Prisoner's Dilemma that could be avoided simply by always rolling need.
---
Why is the fishing pole worth so much?
---
Relax
---
Why don't Blizz put a sitting guard on the rooftop or smth..
---
He's a complete idiot. Don't worry about it. People who can't understand that everyone in the group can use gold aren't worth arguing with.
---
Don't make me get my main!
---
Imagine playing in a streamer guild so you can waste 10 hours a day helping Streamer Zoom farm his hand of rag😂😂😂😂
---
Taurens can use only kodo's and wolfs (with reputation with ogrimar). Except from it - only Deathcharger.
---
All the mobs share spawns. Kill everything. Especially if you're looking for basilisks
---
I support the cause for a TL;DW.
---
You, uh, need more minimap buttons there buddy?
---
You serious? 20g? Pretty sure i chucked or vendored some lol, I'll have to check the AH, that seems hard to believe
---
Oof thats some bold claim but I get it, every person an in this case player is different!
---
What I can say is, I have played this game in almost every way possible, meaning: I have played super hardcore on high end guilds competing for server 1st and on top 50 EU boards, I have played on strong guilds, decent guilds, very casual and/or IRL friends guilds where we didn't even managed to finish the content in time for the next patch. I even had times where I just used the raid finder to see a specific raid tier and mostly just did transmog runs and/or PVP. I also had times where I didn't even play the game at all...but besides BFA, I have never skipped an expansion and very rarely a patch alltogether! The only reason I skipped BFA was mostly because I was getting married and then going for a 2 week honeymoon so I decided it was best not play it...when I came back every single one of my friends were shitting on it, redditors were shitting on it and the people from my Bnet friends list that were actively playing it? They were also "its very meh" so I ended up skipping it and lost interest.
---
All this wall of text to say that I find it very odd that you as an hardcore  player consider Classic one of the worst "expansions"! For what is worth, here is my ranking, as som1 who was viewed it from pretty much every prespective and who played them all except BFA:
---
Wrath - Burning Crusade - Classic - Pandaria - Legion - Cataclysm - WoD - BFA (?)
---
I am also aware that my case isn't unique, as some casual players now are old washed up raid veterans and get more casual each expansion due to a combination of not having time, getting outskilled, or you name it. But I feel thats not my case tbh, the ammount of time and dedication I put on each expansion is usually deeply connected to the quality of the expansion (personal opionion ofc) and it didn't get "worst" by each expansion pack. For exampe, I was competing for server 1sts on TBC and Wrath but was a "regular raider joe" on Cata, went hardcore again on Pandaria but was as casual as it gets during WoD...to be back at serious raiding on Legion (2timer p/ week).
---
Sorry for the rant my brother, I guess it stings me a bit seeing a fellow Azeroth Veteran comparing WoD quality to Classic! But again, we are all different!
---
A very sane, well-put, and agreeable point of view.
---
Nice post. Have an upvote.
---
Thank you. If people weren't so bad with maths and economics they would understand that any BoE that can be bought from the AH has a specific gold value at any given time. You are not entitled for free gold any time a rare boe drops. If you really want it you can always get it from the AH if it's worth that much to you. In fact it's a much bigger dick move to need and equip the item for yourself. It actually implies that it's worth LESS than it's gold value to you. (otherwise you would have gotten it from the AH) If you don't have the gold get farming.
---
Guys ony want one thing
---
Yeah man, I played vanilla-wrath. Tried a few other xpans didn’t like them. And I’ve x2 runs on p servers for the first 3
---
They aren't. Stick your 'sounds like' up your butt.
---
That is the “Fiery” enchant. It makes some attacks do 40 fire damage. It’s actually pretty frequent.
---
Correct. Half of the most upvoted posts in this sub are naive casuals complaining about things they don't understand.
---
Imagine thinking healers that dump excess mana dpsing in dungeons should be ridiculed and kicked and healers that sit at 80% wanding and never drinking are preferable. This sub overwhelmingly does.
---
And now needing on high value BoEs is ninjaing and everyone who does it should be shamed. Casual wow police to the rescue.
---
But it gives people time to agree on the what to roll, if everyone waits. Win:win.
---
It also puts your hearth on cool down though, and you've then wasted a minute of your life waiting to be teled out.
---
I'll keep this addon in mind, at the moment I've used ignore - but if I forget why I added them, I assume it's because it was a minor thing.
---
But I do love me some notes just in case.
---
I posted over on the Battlenet forums as well, and also had a hit there for some interest. Hopefully I can get this idea here to take off, and we can all have a good time and grow a good core group for leveling &gt; dungeons &gt; eventually raids and PVP.
---
will get behind in dps heal and tanking, BUT!!! DPS is overall strong if you know how to play it (i'm talking about moonkin, dunno about feral), Tanking works fine for most in a right group setup, and healing as druid is always strong, but not the strongest one.
---
Brah this would look so gnarly on my wall
---
I also multibox and have the same philosophy. I never pvp, it would be pointless. I love doing dungeons though, and I wanted to just be able to rely on myself and log in and start running one right away. What is your team? I'm 1 warrior, 3 mages, 1 priest, just hit 60 this week.
---
Almost every character at that level is squishy, and paladins have the slight advantage of Mail + Two Handed + Heals, I’m guessing.
---
These things almost always go to a specific person. Usually the GM, MT, or an Officer. Most streamers fill those roles, that is one reason they became streamers in the first place.
---
Then start prepping for uldaman, Mara and ZF. Get all the quests for these dungeons. And since you can tank, would be easy to find parties for multiple runs
---
Exactly. This is an insane increase... 6% damage increase is more than any other proc I know.
---
And how you're going to enforce it? Make them wear it? And what if do, but actually wanted to sell it. The only result it achieve is spoiling a big sum of money for everyone. 
---
And define "upgrade"? One additional stamina point is an upgrade? 1DPS on 40+ level? Who going to decide it - 100+G vs 1 stamina point.
---
"If we all ninja it no one can!"
---
Imagine the "no changes" people tagging over it.
---
I didn’t say a thing about bottling first off. Second macros are a thing provided inside the actual game not third party software to control your character.
---
Never delete anything that’s quest related/dungeon... just add to bank.
---
Pvp on a pvp server
---
They aren't. And I'll have to wait for 3 mins for them to corpserun and reg. The Warlocks are predominantly destro spec as well so there's just not much drainf or siphon life going on.
---
They're going to claim you as a ninja, but that doesn't mean they're right to do so. I got called a ninja for rolling on leather as a warrior, doesn't mean they were correct.
---
Who cares what people think if they're wrong?
---
This is STUNNING. Blizzard, do you see this? Hire this man!
---
I can't speak for the validity of that *specific* story, but I can confirm that there's a lot of weird people on RP servers. And this isn't RP hate - I'm a LARPer/RPer myself.
---
Throughout the past year my fiance had at least one situation every one and a half months where a friend turned out to be controlling, toxic, or even downright abusive. From gaslighting, to guilt-tripping for not wanting to RP a specific character duo for some time, to missunderstanding romance RP and taking it OOC.
---
My favourite is when a roleplayer she was interacting with in normal RP suddenly started asking her: "did you ever want to try out knotting ERP?", to then proceed to explain it in great detail, and then tried to get her kicked from their mutual guild because she said it sounds weird.
---
I'm not saying everyone is weird. I'm not saying RP is weird at all. But I've probably encountered some of the weirdest people/stalkers on RP servers.
---
Rip.
---
It's a quest reward too so you can't get another one. :(
---
I didn’t say it is against the rules just that it should be
---
or 40 people who have a decent smattering of appropriate stats while having farmed zero of their "omg it's *bis*" list
---
This is too true to be funny.
---
lot of idiots that dont understand this lol, they think "layering doesnt affect server cap"
---
I can't complain. I mean, it's like what you'd expect an RP-PVP server to be: people jumping others and getting jumped and every now and then a bit of RP, with the majority really not caring any little bit about RP.
---
But in general, a very nice experience so far.
---
I mean, if you want to think about it that way sure, but the outcome is the same.
---
custom chat /Lookingforgroup/ world  
---
Tell em that you will no longer heal this group if they can't be arsed to get you your loot that you require, and see who in this group supports you, you might be able usurp the party if it's only the tank being unreasonable and get them to leave party and join a new one with you, then seek out a new tank.
---
Addition, you see the chat I mentioned aboved? Post the Player name in those chats, no one should be expected to be play with such unreasonable players, we're all in the same dungeon for the same reasons.
---
Ninjas can't wait for everyone to roll greed if people are correctly rolling need on high value BOEs. Everyone needs gold. If the person who wants to equip the item wants to buy it from the roll winner, they can.
---
I've ran armor about 10 times now.  No ravager, i would be pissed if i lost a roll like this!
---
Running around badlands on my level 44
---
See a level 41 running down a level 37 to gank them
---
#OH YOU FUCKED UP
---
Why wasn’t it okay?
---
What class are you? For warriors/shamans/hunters all of the Herod drops are huge upgrades, so personally I'd keep grinding until I have the lot - the dungeon isn't that long, but feel free to break it up with questing inbetweeen!
---
Dont I need a few more lvls to do those?
---
I did uldaman and we couldnt do the last boss
---
Streamers are the 1%.  Any competition where gear is not accounted for means the streamers have the advantage.  They can afford the most expensive equipment and enchantments.  If you think that a competition between someone in full raid gear against someone is quest blue/greens is remotely fair, you don't understand anything about classic.
---
momma raised no bitch.
---
I mean yeah you hit the nail on the head. Except for pictures of the characters, what does Simpson'swave have to do with the Simpson's?
---
what is KoS?
---
Hes stupid not the guy who cant work out he should run SM for ravager. 
---
Right
---
Hold up....how the hell are BIS list cancer? I forgot all about it until today and Its like my leveling block disappeared. It was fun looking up what pieces drop from where and thinking of ways to get them. My motivation to hit 60 is back literally from looking at my pre raid BIS list.
---
I hate you lmao. Spent so long killing those guys for the tuyere that I didn’t even notice right away when it dropped.
---
it's not enjoyable to die to a high lvl character while questing, it's not funny to get 'revenge' switching characters.  it's all a waste of time, there was never any room for skill in any of this. PLEASE explain the appeal of pvp servers to me
---
Sorry bro. Feel better
---
What did I just read? I have no words.
---
Pure logic and economics i NEED more gold for my epic mount gonna need on all BoPs for vendor gold
---
Honestly, WC is my favourite dungeon so far, it felt like a bit of a jump from RFC (LoS being a thing, the raptors calling, and DPS jumping a lot), but it’s such an interesting and fun dungeon. the only contender for me has been BFD.
---
I will specifically help classes get their special quests done.
---
Wow sounds like a fun guild
---
Care to explain why? Hand has higher max damage and the procc is nothing to scoff at either. Dps is higher and speed is slower.
---
Roll on a pve server you fool, and wait for whatever phase introduces bg's.
---
Depends on the group. Usually I just set loot rules at beginning and people agree or we work out a problem.
---
So let's say Edgemaster's drops and I'm a druid and you're a warrior.
---
Why should I let you have them just because they're bis for you  when I can sell them and use the gold to buy a Warden Staff that's bis for me?
---
You're not more entitled to boe's just because you can equip them.
---
How much can you outlevel quests before it's not a good idea to do them? Is maybe 2-4 levels higher still okay or should you always try to do quests of your level?
---
When I hit level 39 I only had 20 gold so all i did was fish deviates and sell them by yelling on top of the org bank. Took 12 hours of fishing and trading to get it lol
---
Of course you can, but these people in those groups have pre-raid BiS, at least 1/2 of them have at least half if not three quarters pre-raid BiS or straight BiS.
---
People are trying to say Pre-Raid BiS isn't needed for MC and you can just walk in with a 25 person pug and down Rag with ease.
---
I've tried it once and it felt horrible.
---
Yeah, the whole back of this dungeon is a giant, verdant crevasse. It's really cool to think about it in contrast to the desolace outside.
---
Another one a lot of people miss is the giant gryphon statue that is Aerie Peak in the hinterlands. Also the shear scale of Dire Maul. And the looking up in Sunken Temple.
---
I just put em on my ignore list
---
Alot of people aren't good with math and economics so stuff like that happens all the time. Let me explain something though. (I dont study economics or anything it's just common sense)  
---
First of all every BoE has a market price which is set following basic market rules (supply/demand) at any given time in the auction house. Lets take the epic ring "Freezing Band" as an example. It's a very rare ring, (small supply) and BiS for mages (high demand). This ring can go up to 500g or more. If this rings drops in your group and you are the only mage and you expect everyone to pass on it you are dillusional. It's the equilavent of passing on 500g. In fact if the ring is that much worth to you that you want to equip it rather than selling it,  (your need &gt; value) why don't you just buy it from the auction house? If you think it's too expensive then clearly it's not worth more to you than it's market price so you are fooling yourself. (your need&lt;market value)  
---
This is as simple as it gets.
---
I thought for sure he was going to miss
---
Thank you for this!
---
I mean a lot of warriors are miners, you can gather most the mats while leveling and questing
---
Edit: plus mats on my server are about 800g not 1500
---
The only person who is crying about losing a BoE is the person who was so upset they made a reddit thread about it. If it is not a big deal, then just roll need and get on with it?
---
Wtf this is like some 30s movie poster type shit. I want this on my wall.
---
Why is she a unicorn and has a crossbow? Lol. Also not classic syl
---
I don’t stress about this at all.
---
So you move your hand from the arrows to the rest of the keyboard every time you cast a spell? That's... interesting
---
BG is phase 3. Honor system is phase 2
---
Not available for 3 phases
---
But the other guy might not be as consistent of a raider or do more for the guild.
---
Sorry dude but your logic is wrong. I’m not a fan of streamers either but if they put in the work they deserve items like anyone else, and just because they get a good item doesn’t mean “it’s been funneled to them because they’re steamers”.
---
hawt
---
So I'm pretty new to wow and picked up tailoring to make money. I was told to sell bags. Alright. My tailoring skill is at around 125 right now.
---
But when I check AH, the bolts of silk cloth sell for as much as the silk bags themselves...even though it requires multiple bolts of silk cloth just to make *one* bag. What's up wth that? Shouldn't bags cost way more than the bolts?
---
Is it worth it for me to just start buying silk cloth en mass, turning it into bolts, then re-selling the bolts in packs of 20? I can make a bit of profit doing that but nothing crazy.
---
Or is there some point where tailoring gets more profitable?
---
If you want to be a dual wielding dps machine then rogue. A well geared fury warrior is no joke, but during levelling it’s a pain. Also be expected to tank dungeons even if you don’t want to.
---
A shaman putting in hours and hours of work every single fucking day got hand of rag. Shocker.
---
You ever stop to think that maybe the reason some of these people get the best gear has something to do with the insane amount of hours they put in?
---
Majestic!
---
Brilliant
---
The only problem with Paladin is that people listen to the memes. I ran Lower Blackrock Spire last night for the first time and at 58, and as a Ret Paladin, yes my damage was about 25% lower than either of the two Mages (they each parsed about 30% and I parsed at about 22%), but there were two and almost three times where I managed to save a wipe by curing, BoPing and stunning mobs chasing down the healers. Two of those near wipes it was just myself and one mage left alive at the end dealing with 2-3 mobs and I had to resurrect the team. 
---
During Blackrock Depths we had a healer death on Emperor at 50% and I had to take a step back and rotate into healing mode to keep the tank alive. We killed it and got a Scepter drop.. ironically for the main healer. 
---
Paladin is great. Maybe you don't want to bring one to a dungeon where you have it on farm and are trying to push out multiple runs very quickly, but for most dungeons where no one has voice chat and people either don't know what to do, or aren't communicating about it, Paladin provides useful buffs, a reasonable amount of damage and a fairly comfy safety net.
---
A little cringeworthy but thanks for doing a good deed.
---
nost had 15k peaks and more crowded areas due to no layering
---
Not if a single rng event at 20% chance happens.
---
I'm a tank and I support the priest in this 100%. The rest of the party has to follow me anyway.
---
I love WF (my shaman is named katrina ffs) but the thing is the Ele is one of the best specs in the game once you have gear.
---
Ok. Now, find E.T.C.
---
I'm lvl 32 and have 7g, my bank alt had 10g though from playing the AH a little bit so hopefully i will make more money there soon but i think i will have to grind some gold somewhere.
---
I disagree.
---
Epic BoE's with high value are a definite grey area and were clearly not considered when designing the "need/greed" system. If an item drops worth 500-1000g and someone in the group can use it for an upgrade, I still think it's perfectly reasonable for all members of that party to take their shot at such a huge reward. I would feel the same if I was the person who could "use" the item, I would expect nothing less than 5 need rolls.
---
Needing an item that vendors for 5g when it's not an upgrade, that would be being an "asshole". There is a threshold here and it would be stupid to blatantly ignore that, expensive BoE's when sold can help towards epic mounts, be traded in for different, equally good BoE's, yeah, you get it.
---
I would even go as far as to say if you needed one of these items in a situation where you could equip it, and the rest of the group needed it too regardless, if this annoys you or makes you think they're assholes, you're probably the asshole for being so entitled to think you somehow deserve that kind of benefit without allowing the 4 other people in your party the shot at also greatly benefiting from the drop. (which they most certainly can)
---
Bring on the downvotes, that's my opinion.
---
Of course the douche was a night elf hunter.
---
Maybe THEY don't know how to play. They're not draining and you're an obnoxious asshole for trying to strawman me by bending my story so it fits your wannabe witty world view.
---
I notice when I have a decent WL in my group but sadly most of them just don't want to spend money on water/food.
---
Not even sure why you feel so offended if it doesn't concern you. If it does concern you, dw, you're so fucking unpleasant to talk to that I wouldn't do dungeons with you anyways.
---
That was the point of the title "There's always a bigger fish"  
---
In this case the bigger fish is the multiboxer.
---
We're not playing vanilla :P
---
Still caster/healer priority.
---
Comparing countries to homes is always dumb but yes I still agree with that. 
---
Don't assume I'm a hypocrite just because you are.
---
When I took a break from wow a couple of years back my account got hacked and banned by Blizzard because they suspected it was hacked. At this point in time I had to send a picture of my passport to get my account back, the picture quality wasn’t good enough for them to unban the account. 
---
I wasn’t interested in playing wow anymore at the time so I just said fuck it, I’ll do this when I want to play again.
---
A couple of years pass and I want my account back. I contact Blizzard and they say that the account is registered to a battlenet account that isn’t mine (I never connected the account to a battlenet). They also tell me that too many years have passed so I can’t get MY account back. I contact 4 GMs with tickets until I get a reasonable GM who actually confirms everything I’ve said and gives me my account back. I can see that my main character with a lot of unobtainable items/titles/mounts was transferred off the account. He would not give me that character back because he was level 120 and frequently played by the hacker.
---
During all of this I made a thread on r/wow where a overwhelming majority of people tell me that blizzard is right and if I wanted my account back I shouldn’t have waited. It’s the hackers account now because he probably paid for subscriptions etc. I lashed out on a particular individual that was extremely rude in the comments and I got banned from the subreddit but he didn’t. 
---
For some reason when it comes to bans people trust blizzard 100%, while the same people doubt blizzards every decision of the actual game development.
---
It was broken for a while but it works now. Make sure you all update
---
Alright then.  Cue the streamers shitting on everyone and claiming they are skilled when it's the gear that makes the difference.
---
I am going to ask: has there been *any* conversation about loot rules before this?
---
I know that some big guilds used to lock down certain items for members and said that "randoms get to roll if no guild member needs the item." It's a shitty practice, but it happens.
---
World bonfire u meant ?
---
Hunter Aggro and kill both 
---
Ah no just fd
---
Look to my coming on the first light of the fifth day, at dawn look to the east!
---
Love it
---
So his answer is farm gold, runecloth, and rep at the same time.
---
I just like it better and it’s how I did it back in the day
---
this is now my phone background and you've got a new instagram follower. amazing work
---
I dont think its devilsaur, if it is then its bis.
---
Edgemasters for mace???
---
Yeah but if that's the case then you dont link the item in raid for a roll off.. you simply just loot it to the guildy because its reserved and move on.
---
Even if you do aggro them, by running straight through the middle you maximize your distance from both mobs, meaning you will likely not get hit or get hit once, meaning you won’t get dazed.
---
Why is multi boxing even allowed?
---
&gt;	You’re making presumptions. Even if for the sake of argument we pretend that thousands of people lead a hunt to find this person, in no way can that be reasonably used to dictate OP’s personal intent.
---
Intent is not the whole picture. Consequences of actions is the whole picture.
---
&gt;	You did. In your original comments you claimed to be asserting the “realistic perspective”.
---
The realistic perspective is not a singular position. If someone doesn’t call you back immediately and I say maybe they were busy, does that make me the arbiter of realism?
---
&gt;	Anecdotal evidence ≠ objective evidence. It’s not a legitimate argument because it’s based on personal accounts rather that facts. Even beyond that, under the pretence of your own argument personal anecdotes cannot be used as evidence because as you said, “you can’t believe everything you read online”.
---
I don’t think you understand what I meant. These aren’t anecdotal stories, I could link you many real examples. At this point though I’m out of steam on this. 
---
&gt;	But you must recognise that it’s a non-statement and doesn’t actually add to or change the discussion. Which is my point.
---
Considering I was see many comments asserting how real this post is and how anyone who doesn’t agree should have comment deleted, it seems like a statement to me.
---
&gt;	That was part of the basis of your original argument. It’s your words not mine.
---
But you’re extrapolating that to mean things I didn’t say.
---
&gt;	I recognise that, but you must recognise that personal anecdotes can not be used as a legitimate basis for claims against others.
---
Personal anecdotes inform our world views. If someone tells you that bleach is healthy, do you tell the personal explaining how someone close to them died from it that they have no basis? Much less these experiences are not personal, but well documented events. I’m tired though, and I’ve made my case many times. So I’ll leave it at that. Unfortunate that stating the obvious seems so contentious.

the definition of streamer RNG

I bet you play on some twitch streamer server

I’m fury right now, and while I’m having an absolute blast, I will say that it is a COMMITMENT. So much different gear to farm, respecs between fury and Prot on occasion, less bag space for situational weapons.
---
That said, I execute crit Rend Blackhand for 5377 last night so...worth.
---
Except for the people who it's an immediate upgrade for, because they can actually use it and are in the group where it dropped. That's what the Need/Greed distinction is made for. Greed is for when you are *GREEDY* for gold.

You have the exact same issue with the copper node (in the same place of an identical cave) in a cave in southern Darkshore.
---
How did you get the alliance warrior flair there?
---
That brought joy to me this morning.
---
He needs for vendor spec
---
They can use it like what 45 mins before I go and sell it and get my BiS? Don't think that's a big difference in the grand scheme of things.
---
I think what you say here is reasonable.
---
But how do I know that everyone thinks about it like that? The reason I don't need on BoE's is because people would start flaming me as a ninja looter.
---
Well when he is constantly pulling aggro and dying due to how his core dps rotation works with bursty unreliable damage and he is completely worthless on rag due to rag melting anyone with mana that stands next to him. He is literally a crutch to the raid group. He as the raid leader should understand that he may want to do something to help the raid rather than hinder any future progress. Even on fights that he doesnt have these issues he is still just worse that 80% of the rest of the dps in terms of output.
---
I recon you dont remmember the name.
---
Lol, I'm guilty of this myself. I try to pickpocket the enemies, I didn't realise tanks weren't crazy about it, I'll definitely avoid it in future :p
---
Triggered over a joke
---
5 weeks, 5 chances to get items with a 1% drop chance. Doesn't matter how many hours you push.
---
Yes, it was stated that "Raider &gt; Trial" and they were both raiders. They gave no explanation whatsoever.
---
Character notes?
---
I recommend just staying at the rock, she bugs out very rarely, like 1 in 35 for me. While it feels bad when she resets, you save more time by just sitting at the rock.
---
Five boxers use things like ISboxer software. Where keystrokes are echoed. There isn’t any tabbing involved.
---
The economy is still kinda broken and the early tailoring stuff won’t make money since everyone else is leveling it too. The good stuff will be making mooncloth at max level cause it’s on a cooldown and that will sell pretty well. Also high level bags should do well too.
---
I believe you have two separate bars in bartender4, one for xp and one for rep. You should be able to turn either one on/off in the settings, then move it as usual.
---
Blurred his name but it shows in who recieved loot
---
I don't think you're following this discussion very well and there's probably not that much point in continuing it at this point, right?
---
Giving gold away for free and greeding on a BoE are only equivalent if you're utterly and totally ignorant of what an item is in this game.
---
"If you greed on items you're going to sell, you might as well be giving gold away for free, because you could have just needed and taken it from everyone else"
---
This isn't Atlas Shrugged, it's a way to enjoy your evening with your friends.

And sword spec extra swing and windfury, although only one can proc per hit and they cant proc off each other.

You're a turbo pussy and should quit.

There sure were a few weird scaling issues on a lot of different patches/levels.

I remember a lvl 1 twink (night elf hunter or rogue) that had 80%+ dodge chance or something.

Must be nice, free sulfuron ingots, dark iron ore, cores, and arcanite crystals.  Is pampering this guy so he can make money streaming the point of vanilla now?

It's the first rogue I've played this long, the toolset they have at their disposal is genuinely amazing.

Why can't Blizzard do like those EU nerds?
---
No I can't Blizzard-Nova-CoC-repeat endlessly entire mob spots, but why would I? It's a busy server. 
---
Everything is really smooth compared to the Druid I tried before.
---
As a priest healer, make sure you have the best wand you can get. BfD quest has the gravestone scepter which will last for quite a few levels. Wand pretty much all the time you are not casting a heal. Try and snag running mobs with mind flay for the spirit tap proc.

It’s only because it happened much more often because account were free

Absolutely amazing.

I think this is more of a you problem than ignore list capacity

The servers should be able to handle large crowds in a single area, regardless of whether every server gets crowds like that regularly or not.

I am not going to get my mount at 40 lol (even if I had the gold). I am farming SW rep so I can get a horse as a night elf. (strangely enough nelfs looks better on horses for me than on tigers)
---
Yeah it's really frustrating since I think it's so obvious to so many people, but at the same time I still feel we're a minority and any time we try to convince people otherwise we're met with "you're taking this shit too seriously" or called greedy ninjas who only care about themselves.
---
And was the person who won the roll a trial?
---
After getting the Truefaith Vestment, is there any reason for a priest to keep tailoring?
---
It's still like a 2% drop and we've only had like 5 mc clears very lucky
---
I can get off two smites before the mob hits me and i suffer from push back. If I waste a GCD on SW:P, I have to retreat for a GCD to make up for it, or suffer a push-back on smite. For most enemies it's not that big of a deal, but for those annoying dualwielding dark iron dwarves in searing gorge and burning steppes, they'll land like 5 hits before you finish your smite.
---
You mean the evil one who was oppressing hyenas?
---
Not to get you back to nursing your altoholism, but classes offer a really shallow taste of what they have to offer at 60 during levels 1-15; if you want to really know what's up, watch streamers or gameplay for each class instead.
---
Alright, thanks. so maybe it’s worth it to drop some money now to level my tailoring to a place where it’s actually profitable.
---
I do not get it.
---
Ezpz. I already got the /spit down from ganking level 8s and camping them relentlessly.  Just a few more days played doing this and I should be pro
---
Getting or getting gifted?
---
It's simple really, as most chests are guarded by mobs. If noone opens it, then those pack will be simple skipped. We doesn't clear around a closed chest.
---
How many actions are performed in each account per key press?
---
There was a hole in your logic, I pointed it out. In your mind that means I therefore totally disagree with your point and agree with the person you were replying to? You must be fun to be around or work with.
---
Every single day there are new threads where someone ninja looted because everybody greeded, and one person needed to sell on the AH.
---
Yet you people still insist on allowing this to happen.
---
then use a fucking computer
---
I don´t know, but I play mainly for social interactions. But still I have like 20 friends in game and we are doing every shit possible in game.. so if u don´t have friends... I don´t know if classic is for antisocial people anyway.... There is no fun in single player after you have done quests like 5 times already. And I think the whole idea of game was made to get people together even for a simple quest like Hogger.
---
Uhhh, guess an inexperienced party. You can pull the boss out of the room so you dont get swarmed by the adds
---
You say that but like the druids using manual crowd pummeler is fairly recent discovery, like less than 2 years I think?  Its entirely possible for new stuff to get found.
---
So again, there is software, that you buy, that echoes key strokes. There’s no tabbing or following involved. A person who is five boxing and using follow is a shit multi boxer.
---
He's probably levelling his first character and doesn't have the cloth for the profession. This is how I leveled tailoring through wool.
---
I am on nethergarde keep eu (alliance ) will happily play horde either
---
As Ret Paladin, I've been first or second on every DPS chart until the levels 50 range. Now the mages and Warriors are starting to pull away and there's not really anything I can do about it. Granted, I have followed guides to a T and have numerous preraid BiS pieces already, and have been using an epic weapon since level 44 (bought Kang the Decapitator). That weapon was amazing in the 40s and the reason why I could out damage most other DPS at the time, but it has fallen behind now -- still waiting for a Dreadforge Retaliator to drop --  and I'm looking forward to an upgrade.

Yeah exactly 3g is 3g and I need 3g more towards my mount therefore I need that BoP
---
As a Priest... No one uses devout gear there is better gear in BRD that you have access to 10 levels earlier.  Asking people to waste their time for the benefit of no one is just silly.
---
Hmm no, Stealth is trainable at lvl 1 for 10c. Lvl 4 is Backstab and Pickpocket.

Cleavetard

It's a thread arguing about whether it's botting. Clearly, it isn't - if you agree with that, there is nothing to argue about.
---
Disappointed. I was expecting a miss.
---
You say 'most people would consider you a ninja' but many people in this thread would not PROVIDED everyone else had rolled need to.
---
That makes sense though.But p servers could handle 40v40's pretty well.
---
Druid is jack of all trades master of non. While Rogue is in top DPS vise and one of best PVP classes.  the thing you want to asm yourself what you want in lategame.
---
EDIT: personally i would go rogue.
---
Plot twist. He has a [Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18638)
---
He's a keeper
---
With the right gear there is no need to ever go Resto if you want to heal dungeons.
---
"All strangers should expose themselves to high risk like I do, otherwise they're bad people and we should shame them publicly."
---
It is normally used purge, movement impairment effects like root, and slow.
---
For cat and bear it is also used to trigger Wolf Hat + Furor to get energy/rage, or to remove movement impairments.
---
Opening trade is the best :)
---
Rule 3 bro
---
EU realms = Undercover scandinavian realms.
---
I would like world peace too.   
---
Look, human nature being what it is, you can continue to roll Greed and complain about ninja looting.   
---
Or you could just have the group agree to roll Need at the start, then sort it out with a side roll if you really feel it belongs to one person or another.
---
Right now there aren’t many. The agi enchants from Timbermaw are not available in phase 1 for example, so don’t feel like you have to grind it ASAP.
---
Distract has to be one of the most evil and silent tools we as rogue have. I been throwing afk walkers in booty bay to the sea so many times with it.
---
That opinion also keeps ninja looting going. It's impossible to ninja loot if everyone rolls need.
---
The guy who has it horde side on Herod was charging 200g per craft.
---
Look I don't think I can convince you that BoEs are simply equivalent to gold, so I can see why my argument fails if you don't want to realize that. If you don't like my argument that passing on BoEs is the same as throwing money away, then I can easily say that:
---
"I promise you, you'll feel better after helping that warrior get his item that he needed than you will from that same item that you needed. Items aren't important, people are."
---
All I see is beta priests complaining at alpha chads ordering them around like the betas they are
---
It’s obviously not bottling but it does violate the idea of one action per input. The rule is written per account specifically to allow this but it shouldn’t be. In order to multi box you have to use third party software to duplicate your input. That is considered cheating in any other use case.
---
Yeah because Cdew isn't one of the best pvp players in the game?
---
Wow does not have the strongest baseline for single player honestly.
---
A game like Secret World Legends is an example of a single player game with multiplayer optional content.
---
Ah, fair enough.
---
&gt;I was in what I thought was a pretty chill guild for a few weeks.
---
hmmmm, not what it sounds like. Imagine quitting guild because of your only just relevant joke didn't land
---
Less cool Warlocks
---
I’ve been looking for a good place to farm since Jadfire run is ALWAYS contested. It’s a great spot but we have a very aggressive guild who has a lot of players in my time zone :/
---
hey look we killed a bunch of afk
---
I went back there at level 55 as well to get my revenge and there was a full on 30v30ish war going on. That place isn't a questing zone, its a warzone most of the time tbh.
---
He shouldn't have to buy that item form the AH. It dropped in the group. The system is definitely intended to press need when you actually need it as an upgrade, and to press greed when you want the item but it is not an upgrade.
---
Applying the logic of it can be sold for gold and gold is needed by everyone doesn't work. Yeah, you can buy an upgrade with that gold, but that's not what dropped. Gold didn't drop. A usable item did. Just because it can be converted later is irrelevant to the intended purpose of the system.
---
It's obvious there's a huge difference between a BoP item that vendors for 2g and an BoE Epics that sells for over 100g.
---
If the Exalted robes in UD strat vendored for 300g do you really think people would just give it to the priest?
---
Maybe it was your PC
---
WC LF tank and heals then GTG
---
Where did I say that? If you actually think that only 50 people out of possibly 10000 in a server are assholes, then you do you I guess
---
Yeah with the game being so populated and everyone out leveling the AH is a bit weird. You’d lose money buying all the silk and not worth the time farming. You can do that sure, or just make bags when it’s convenient with their mats + tip.
---
It's a joke from Half Baked because you're acting like a smug prick about how your addictions are the only ones that count.

Am I the only one who was expecting to also die on his main?:)

#NoChanges. Lootdrama is part of classic.
---
Lmao isn't it :-) best time to do it is right when the boat is about to leave the map so they have to swim extra far lmao ... There is a skill and science to insure maximum fukery
---
And you met someone like me who went back at level 50+ to get their revenge. The cycle must always continue.
---
I am actually curious how you think someone gets a hold of Sulfuras?
---
You realize this isn't *just* a drop?
---
Everyone who has Sulfuras in classic will have it been gifted to them.
---
And then everyone starts "oh but they deserve it".
---
CDew is an established PvP-er, who even became a Blizzcon Champion. He has been part of e-sports since 2009.

He is being helped by people who _want_ to help him, who want to be a part of it.

No changes. Loot drama is part of classic.
---
Priests don't normally ask to do that because there are multiple better shoulder options.
---
That said it's a whatever boss on the route anyway, I cleared him earlier today because a druid wanted to do a quest. It's fine. Not sure what cancerous groups OP has been in.
---
It does seem like a good experience. I've been tempted to transfer but i'm also enjoying Ashbringer so far.
---
Always roll need and than trade the item to whoever rolled the highest roll even if it was a greed roll. If they call you a Ninja just ignore them, they don't live in reality. It's BoE, don't treat it like it BoP.
---
I went to one of the starting zones and gave out sets of four linen bags to level 1-3 people, after I'd gotten to the point where I didn't need the linen cloth anymore. It's super nice for a low level to have, and not a lot of money for a higher level character, so why not?
---
Exactly, hoping someone knows something to help. lol
---
Im razorgore alliance and noggenfogger horde, is alot of swedes on razorgore though
---
My point is they gave the PvP item to the PvPer in the guild who has been putting in bonkers hours and work for the team. My post had nothing to do with the odds of seeing an eye drop.
---
I find it hard to pickpocket enemies without it :/
---
you made me lol, have my vote hahaha
---
This is a perfect explanation and I can't believe that so many people disagree with this line of thinking.
---
If the CEO of WoW asked me to join his guild Id tell him that he THINKS he wants me to join his guild, but he doesn't.
---
I'm seeing too many Orc warriors use blood fury thinking they're einstein but really just letting the healer oom
---
&gt; Anyone else think fights like these look super boring? You have pretty much zero impact over who wins, whichever side has more players almost certainly will.
---
lol it's proves that you have little experience in world pvp...
---
felstriker is an amazing fury weapon for a warrior. there is no reason not to roll for it. and "consider suicide" over a virtual item isnt the best thing to say even as a joke.

Printscreen is your friend :(
---
Then it's not really Simpsonswave, is it?
---
Aggro and threat is still a bit fiddly before 60, especially for warriors that are tanking on a non-prot spec, I wouldn't blame yourself too much about pulling aggro, as there's only a few tools at our disposal currently. Usually it's more a problem of DPS spamming too soon that the tank can't build up enough rage to maintain aggro. Just focus on healing the tank and notifying if you pull aggro, and you should be fine!
---
I'm genuinely curious why everyone thinks this is cheating, or griefing. Who's to say what is considered "fair range" for guards to go to? I feel like if this isn't intended, then blizzard should just patch it. Magically knowing where guards are supposed to go?? or what is considered fine, and what isn't, seems really arbitrary.
---
Come to Westfall Alliance, I'm looking for the same thing OP. Currently level 19 warrior, this is the only character I'm playing.
---
I have been doing this for over a decade and have no plan on stopping now.
---
BoPs are literally just money too, I could sell that epic for 5g and it can go toward my BIS!!!!
---
Your explanation is garbage, there is no "my" 2h for expensive BoE items.
---
I do not know what this is, could someone explain?
---
Did I miss the part where they were claiming this made them skilled or something?
---
Yeah! The germans are off on their own thing. Dont know if the french got their own servers by now.
---
But that leaves us with the UK, scandinavia and some baltic countries on the EU realms. And Scandinavia have a pretty high density of gamers.
---
How does the rock method work, and is it only for druids? I’m planning on doing some runs tonight on my lock
---
Honestly, I'd keep doing what you are doing. I did the exact same with my first character during vanilla. A warrior with blacksmithing and mining. It's not easy, fast levelling or cheap, but end game it's totally worth it. Sounds like your having fun and that's way more important.
---
2g vs 800g, ya that makes total sense.
---
Isn't there a 300 tailoring requirment to wear truefaith?
---
Yeah if everyone agrees to all need there's no problem.
---
Those guys are mostly doing it for farming, probably to sell gold, so they don't wait anywhere, they just bulldoze the single players who are in their way while farming/questing.  Most common I saw were 4 dwarf hunters and a dwarf priest.  I imagine stoneform and fearward was the advantage?
---
You and every other miner is doing the same just have to get lucky on your route. Thats why arcane crystals are so expensive on the AH.
---
Nope not really. There's little demand for crafted cloth stuff - fire resist for MC is unnecessary and Naxx is miles away (and patterns for cold res gear aren't hard to get).
---
You still have mooncloth cooldown, which is decent passive income.
---
Everyone seems to be hooked on the finances of the situation, it's not about the finances.
---
It's the volume of players, servers having to deal with hundreds of thousands, if not millions at peak time is an inconceivably difficult thing to deal with as far as server allocation and how those servers deal with data. Those same Europeans can use much lower power servers at a significantly cheaper price, you see there's a point where the power of a server doesn't become the bottleneck of data but instead the way the data is handled within a server. That's why quantum computing is the next huge goal for big tech corporations.
---
I'd recommend farming WC for deviate scale and perfect deviate scale. When Warsong Gulch comes out you could flood the AH with deviate scale belts (level 19 twink rogues, hunters and druids will want them) and earn tons. Get preparing.
---
And ehh if you're horde on EU Nethergarde Keep, boost me through while you're at it. :D
---
"don't want to realise that"
---
The literal basis for your position is that you're right, but I just don't want to believe you that being selfish is always better. Get some perspective, man. 
---
Go and enjoy the game your way, but if that means taking whatever you want and putting it in your bank to wank over your epeen or big auction sales, I'm glad that we are separated by a large body of water.
---
And the quest giver makes you blue and fast just for shits’n gigs...  that buff would have been great while I was running around the world and back to some reclusive lazy green twat in a tent! ... these totem givers are total trolls... More than me! And I AM a Troll!!
---
It's mad isn't it? It's almost like the symbol next to the greed button isn't a stack of gold...
---
me...started a warlock with a pally friend. warlock is 34, pally is 32.   
---
somewhere around level 18 i made a warrior alt, warlock is still 34, my warrior is 32 (along with the pally)
---
Strange, this was incredibly common in vanilla and tbc on my servers. If it was disallowed then it was extremely loosely enforced. I honestly don't mind exploiting terrain to avoid guard aggro if it's just for pvp. World pvp is never clean fighting.
---
I would recommend asking friends you made along the way up who happen to be in different guilds. Set up a chat with their guildmasters on the idea of a 20/20 split for raiding. This is how one of my guilds on a pserver did it until we were big enough to raid alone.
---
The downside obviously is loot distribution on specific items like bindings or key BiS items. You'll have to negotiate with them on how that'll work.
---
What skill level is recommended not to miss any catches anymore? I'm at 156 now and can use nightcrawlers to get it to 200+. Would that be enough for Tanaris?
---
Or spreadsheeting landmark gear pieces to obtain while leveling and where to obtain them, what skills to buy at what levels, talents, etc.
---
True shit right here
---
If there is one, I've never heard of it. Would be interested to know as well though. Really surprised that healing numbers above a target wasn't a thing in classic, I rememered it always being there
---
Hey I'm from Westfall too! It's cool to see screenshots of places you know, but seeing them from the same realm gives them a sense of realness that's hard to explain. Those are the *same* cobblestones I walked through this week.
---
I had a positive experience with my ticket, I just didn't see any reason to post about it. Probably the case with most tickets
---
Feign death is fine.
---
There are addons that give you unlimited Ignore list, some allow you to add notes, some even apply themselves to their entire battle tag account.
---
I don't use them myself, only got 3 people on ignore for old server and 0 for new server.
---
Where do you farm it?
---
Make greens and disenchant them \[with and alt, if necessary\] to sell those mats on AH.
---
Literally every server I played on in Vanilla TBC and WoTLK did the same, roll need on expensive BoE's, everyone worked for it, just cuz it's an upgrade for you doesn't mean 500g can't upgrade 3 pieces for me. Same with nost and multiple private servers, maybe you remember some rosey tinted glasses in classic, but you definitely didn't get them playing vanilla, since it has literally always been this way. I raided from Classic to Mist, did multiple sets of Pre-raid BiS, and it has ALWAYS been done this way.
---
Thank you. the bad news is that my only other profession is skinning and I never bothered to level it. The good news is I’m a lock so I don’t think I need mount money right?
---
It depends whether you want a pvp or pve realm, but if you want pve there are quite a few of us british on EU Pyrewood village (PVE). Both factions are well represented I think.
---
Otherway round for me. Too tired after work to play for more than an hour:(
---
he was using the MC'd mage to cast int on himself, instead of trying to buff the mage.
---
Ah right - I am on a normal pop server and was only up against one other dude.
---
You could go for Runecloth Belts, or Headbands like vaekar mentioned. Maybe disenchanting them on a bank alt might get you a better return if the price of Eternal Essences / Small Brilliant Shard is high enough on your server.
---
Gz
---
Get Consecration from the Holy tree so you can tank and then go into the Retribution tree so you can DPS. You can heal without any further points in Holy by just having gear with intellect and spirit on it. Now you can do all three roles into your upper 40s !
---
Rank 1 AI - don’t waste mana on these ppl 😆
---
Look... before ANYONE Rolled EVERYONE said Need the item in char to prevent a ninja looter. No one wanted the item they wanted to sell it. So that’s how we did it as it was a  pug group.
---
Now I have a reason to use Unending Breath outside of swimming underwater for those scarce water quests for nagas.
---
Yea I've made a couple tickets, gms dont even whisper you in game, and they clearly dont read the ticket, I've asked to talk to someone in whispers in my ticket and got the same copy pasted response, really disappointing
---
Christ ona cracker! Spilled muh beer when the rohirrim arrived
---
Doesnt Spriest beats lock ?
---
Main boss is level 22. That puts the lower threshold at about 17-18 for casters and 19-20 for the tank. I guess they had a 25 void walker in this case, which is not a bad alternative at that level...
---
&gt;Why should I let you have them just because they're bis for you when I can sell them and use the gold to buy a Warden Staff that's bis for me? 
---
Because doing that is an absolute dick move.
---
You can rationalise and justify all you want but it doesn't change that fact that if you act in this way, by the standards of the community as it exists today you are a ninja looter, unless your group as a whole agrees to operate under those same rules. The default viewpoint you should be going into a group (or hell, any social situation) with is "What are the commonly used standards for this situation", even if you personally don't agree with that standard. Disagreeing does not entitle you to act however you want.
---
If the group agrees that you should operate under those rules, such as everyone agreeing to all need, then it's fine. But that is **not** the default perspective you should assume.
---
If you need on every bind on pickup item you can vendor them to buy a Warden Staff much faster. That doesn't make it OK. It's the exact same deal, just you're going to get called out on it more quickly.
---
Not if that person equips it before leaving. The situation you're describing is one where a warrior would need skull flame shield and then go and sell it on the AH anyway. But that isn't the situation I'm describing.
---
Thing is - it's a common way of looting. Only problem I have is if they agreed on loot rules beforehand &amp; a player breaks those rules.
---
It’s a 1000g weapon that your guild might provide you (but you might have to get yourself to secure a raid spot), vs a 10000g weapon you have to grind out yourself. 
---
What are you even asking?
---
Mounts are the money sink
---
Tbh most of the intense stuff happens client side. Server side usually just processes simple data packets.
---
Also if that was a factor, it would apply all the time, not just when 40+ players enter a single area.
---
Exiting the caverns is super simple:  
---
All you do is follow these path turns  
---
For the rest of your gaming life
---
nah we are not the minority. all those guys that cant distinguish between boe and bop are noobs. well shit, i guess we are the minority.
---
Gold is at the bottom of the totem pole though because at that point the whole group should roll on it so they can get gold for what ever gear they want too. 
---
So in your situation it goes from Druid Vs you to Druid Vs the whole group. (Why would you earning gold matter more than the rest of the group?) Are you ignoring the fact that the greed button by definition is exactly what you're talking about?
---
With your logic you should roll need on every single thing ever to drop, even BoP. You can DE those items and get gold from them right?
---
Run with guild groups. You don't get to keep a BoE epic worth 800g for free just cuz.
---
Levelling a warrior is HARD but stick with it; it'll be worth it when you're tanking endgame like a boss.
---
Imagine if a need roll made it bind to you, and a greed roll didn't.
---
Never played a private server but maybe layering is causing some issues?
---
This movie, the soundtrack and the books will always have a special place in my heart. /cry
---
lmao thank you.
---
There is a key difference. You aren't rolling for a bag of money to buy a BiS. You are rolling for an item, and the item might be worth something on the AH. The extra steps necessary make the indirect benefit to you in the form of gold irrelevant. A direct upgrade for the player from the item takes precedence over any one's desire for gold, whether or not that gold can buy you a BiS.
---
It's obvious the loot system was intended to hit need on being able to use the item and that greed is for wanting the item but doesn't directly benefit you. 
---
Item --&gt; Upgrade = Need
---
Item --&gt; Gold--&gt; Upgrade = Greed. 
---
Why? Because the chain of events can change. Who's to say you *won't* buy a BiS and are just hoarding gold? Who's to say you don't waste gold on stupid shit? Your gold is not something you need from the dungeon. Your gold is your problem.
---
It's the entire reason why the "Need Before Greed" system was made, and why it's been used in RDF since its inception. Because Blizzard obviously wants people who can get upgrades to have priority over people who can sell it. The only reason why players don't manually set Need Before Greed is because it has a major flaw. Someone can actually have an upgrade and even a BiS of a lower armor type.
---
That movement speed is a lot more tolerable for a feral druid @ level 21 with Feline Swiftness 2/2. You might might enjoy your Druid a lot if you can get him to 20. It's a crawl to get there, but the shift in power and pacing feels godly.
---
MC is boring af. I don't need to be 60 until I can go BWL.
---
Thank you! I will try it tonight, me being level 34.
---
I mean, this is the first time Cdew even allowed people to give him gold. He didn’t want help but it dropped so early compared to what anyone expected it would. He has been grinding mats for it but obv the needs become insane. 
---
His community and other streamers and guilds came together to help him get it the night it dropped.
---
You can choose to look at it as sTrEaMeRs get everything, or a cool community moment. This dude has been busting his ass, and this is the first time he’s let anyone help him.
---
Who are you even going to sell it to? EVERYBODY'S BROKE!

BoPs are worth different amounts to different people depending on whether or not they can equip them. BoEs are worth the same to everyone.
---
Having ghost wolf makes it much better.
---
I leveled my Warrior to about 33 and had ~30g... so I leveled a Warlock with mining/skinning to 40 and sent the gold to my Warrior. Wound up with about 130g total by the time I hit 40 on my Warrior. Worked pretty well.
---
yeah I agree less experienced players have no way of knowing the true value of an item, in a perfect world people would tell others when it drops, but that won't probably happen since people usually just sit totally quiet not rolling and waiting for others to greed.
---
&gt; There is no right or wrong answer, it all comes down to loot rules
---
You never know how things would have played out if it was a different item. For instance a Warrior may advocate for Need on all for a BoE Epic cloth item when he may have argued for Class priority if a Plate item dropped. 
---
It is best to always have everyone roll /need on every BoE Epic.
---
The problem is it has no real scaling. By the time you hit 50 it's useless unfortunately, and it doesn't really start strong in particular.
---
Other responders are accurate, but remember that quests also give items rewards (which you can sell) and sometimes rep, so some are worth doing when they're grey, but really only after you're 60.
---
The Rake. Run to Mulgore. 1.2 attack speed and starts at level 10. Best levelling pet.
---
 Hello there
---
That's u/wrel
---
It was raider &gt; trial then just normal roll for it. They completely ignored everything we said about it and therefore over 25 people left the guild leaving them in the dirt. Which is why I'm making this post to warn other players thinking about joining since they have to recruit.
---
Greed/Need was implemented way before the AH in beta.
---
Reddit is so weird. I said the exact same thing as you on a different thread about a week ago and initially got downvoted to oblivion.
---
Depends on your server, on Sargeras city raids happen pretty regularly, and on RP servers giant PVP events are hosted all the time.
---
To each their own I suppose. I respectively disagree because not everyone wants to only worry about end game and that item is essentially a win to anyone whether they use it or sell it. Now I'm not personally gonna mind if the group I play with is good and decided a certain class earns a priority but overall everyone should get an equal shot at the item.
---
Oh, yeah. Missread never mind.. although I wouldn't wanna play without strafing.
---
yes. marriage with, not marriage to, nice try though :p
---
Seems bugged.. try to delete your character and create a new one
---
this guy aggros
---
It kinda happens in Nazjatar. Although I haven't really played since Classic launched there usually were spontaneous raids that went between the Horde and Alliance towns. Not any leading or organizing though, but 20~ people on each side wasn't unusual.
---
Druids can be pretty fast at levelling once you get a few levels behind you. That combined with the fact you can fill all roles sounds like what you are after. I wouldn't discount that class. (Plus it's hella fun)
---
Sounds like 90% of people, including how it was done in Vanilla. If you don't think so, you're lying to yourself.
---
Well they are Alliance, this is how they get to win a battle in World pvp
---
I haven't been able to get SUF to work in Classic, for some reason. I install it, it shows up in my addons, but when I load the game there are no unit frames at all and I can't make them appear. Bizarre.
---
This was something I saw on Pservers but not ever, ever in classic.
---
F (pays respects).
---
You can farm beasts and skin them! You can stop learning abilities past lv 34 or so.
---
You can bake food and sell for 3s a piece
---
If your character is sexy, you can dance naked on mailboxes.
---
If you're good friends with a guildie, he might wanna help you out.
---
20% is not negligible, that’s more than I was suspecting
---
Stop abusing that man's time with stupid questions that can be answered by 10 second google search. Let him tend the more serious issues.
---
Don't gnome shame!
---
Instead of ripping on you for minimal buttons, I'm actually just curious what they all are?
---
Some of the BIS lists are subjectively wrong, too. They assume vanilla boss kill times, which are MUCH longer than classic due to prioritization of damage.
---
Now thats a warrior spirit right there :D
---
&gt; As mage, check out a fire/frost hybrid spec. Haven't tried it myself but it looks absolutely amazing for pvp. They say it is very gear dependent though.
---
Yeah, the "elemental" build. Yup, I love to play that way but problem is as you said, very gear dependant. Also, cant go PoM/Pyro early because of eventual pve content fire resis... so probably just gonna go hunter early and mage later
---
It wasn't so bad. Tho I forgot to do the final step and had to run all the way back to silverpine from barrens...  'cause I'm dumb.
---
Just to craft, not to wear.
---
Just roll need on BoEs while in a pug. If some1 says to roll greed before any1 rolled, just say "were rolling need" then roll need.
---
If they then dont roll need as u did, thats on them.
---
The opposite of selfish isnt elite.
---
Why would I bother to continue trying to convince someone who has prejudice against me since I'm from America? You're actually toxic and I have no reason to try to convince you as to why my logic stands or listen to your opinion.
---
Need is need regardless of boe/ bop status
---
I think it's because the geometry/nav pathing of cities/buildings in Vanilla is just bad (for multiple reasons). 
---
They would have to either redesign these areas (which isn't really an option) or they probably have to add a stupid amount of guards because of the above mentioned mesh issues (Like 10 guards on a roof type of sillyness).
---
The other option would be to give the guards extra powers and stronger attacks but that takes away the balance of the neutral cities. Any city/town can be taken over by one of the factions, if 2 raids want to go to BB and slaughter enemies and kill all of the bruisers than they can do that within the rules. So making the NPC guards more powerful would throw that balance off.
---
Obviously blizzard went for option 4 which is probably the easiest for them, just let the report/ban system handle it (lazy).
---
To be honest I have never MCd anyone in my career. Maybe someone who plays a priest can chime in?
---
&gt; i'd get a hunter to 60 and then casually roll another alt w/ a different playstyle so it's not 'boring'.
---
Yeah, I'm probably leveling a hunter as soon as my warlock is 60. Then another after that, nice change of pace.
---
Yeah PC lag and server lag does not share the same effect.
---
yep twitch is ABYSMAL for VOD streaming
---
Try heart of the wild spec, with that you should be able to do most forms of content.
---
people who think you die a lot in dark soul games, clearly never leveled a warrior in vanilla/classic...
---
prepare to rage because you cant beat a mob of same level or 1-2 levels above.
---
beside that, what the others in this post said are good advices. specially FIRST AID.
---
Then it will be just like vanilla I guess because AQ opening was a fucking disaster back then too.
---
But you didnt though. You intended to spend hundreds of gold on the auction house for the item, but because it happened to drop now you dont have to. So by demanding you are the only one that should roll on the BoE you ninjalooted several hundred gold.
---
Isnt finkle skinner very good for tanking also
---
and draw distance is still tiny even when you're in a quiet area.  it's weird as fuck
---
No problem. I've never been keen on playing rogues, but druids have really surprised me. It's a lot of fun shifting in and out of forms, especially once you get macros up that let you transition between your forms without having to first de-shift from your current one. But it's a very acquired thing. I'd say 20 levels is about right before it feels natural. We'll see how I feel once I get two more forms thrown into the mix.
---
Because you can use that argument for literally any item in the game, even to vendor it.
---
Need is for using. If someone needs on an item to use, they're getting instant use out of it. Just because I can also need, throw it on the AH and get a bigger upgrade for myself doesn't change the fact he's getting an upgrade that very second.
---
If you all greeded, one of you would win and get to sell it and buy something else. That's the fucking point of need or greed.
---
Get it? "GREED". Need = "I" can use this. Greed = "I can use this, but only to sell/vendor/disenchant to go towards something else". I don't know how much simpler 'Need' and 'Greed' can be.
---
So you cannot refute my point, yet tell me I am wrong.
---
Please prove to me how a BoE is not just money as I just wrote. It has the EXACT same value, wether you can equip it or not.
---
&gt;not an opinion that results in people wanting to be in a group with you when it happens.
---
Do not think that reddit is an accurate representation of what people think. This "BoE is all need" has been around since the launch of Vanilla, and this sub is just discovering it.
---
Every pick up group I had followed this rule.
---
And you've been able to obtain this information via his text-based responses how? Oh well, enjoy the report for being uncivil and off-topic.
---
Get a fucking life lmao this is pathetic
---
And you can find templates at wago.io
---
What about the entrance to the deadmines? Right in front of the Instance door there's kind of a bridge that overlooks a little flat area where the duels can happen. Assign a few people who are 30+ to take care of the spawns during the fights and they won't be disruptive, and anyone 40+ should be able to 1hit them.  
---
Only problem is the arena may be a little small and disadvantage ranged players.
---
I don't think you can miss against people sitting down, always a hit and always a crit as far as I know.
---
I have to disagree , the only items anyone “needs” in the long term is end game gear. Green BoE drop? Blue BoP drop? Sure if it’s an upgrade need away. It will be replaced soon not just for you but anyone else who needs it. But the amount of gold that Blue BoEs and higher go for is something everyone actually needs. Sure it might be an upgrade for you, but at that value it could be 5 upgrades for the warrior still rocking level 30 gear.
---
What weapon are you using? Do you have mortal strike?
---
&gt; P.s. I know Devout Mantle isn't BIS. BIS lists for blue gear stem from a cancerous mindset and are contrary to the spirit of Classic.
---
That's the dumbest thing I've ever read. How the fuck is it cancerous for people to do research into what is the best gear available? Just because you don't mind having sub-par gear doesn't mean you need to push your mediocre mindset on other people. The spirit of classic...fuck off. As if there weren't people optimizing their gear back in vanilla. Get real.
---
Oh yeah, you're right. I was wrong, ignore me lol
---
So our first guild event, race to ragefire, we ran through stv to booty bay and the biggest issue was mobs getting pulled from wicked far and killing our low level guys which is kind of what I’m trying to avoid. Otherwise if everyone was 30+ gurubashi would be the first pick
---
And people say pve servers are the same game.... lol no.
---
Well that's it then.  I hit my daily dose of cringe pretty early today.
---
When you say normally, are you referring to their initial launch cap before the increase, Or the old vanilla 4k~ cap per realm?
---
And if it's the second do you have any source on that info to backup that?
---
That was a perfectly timed sneak attack. Well done.
---
No, it wasn't a "fair fight" in an open field where everyone was ready. But that was the entire point of this attack. It was timed to take this raid when they least expected it. Most of them were caught completely unaware. Seemed like 70% of them were AFK.
---
It's not an example of a gentlemens dual. Or meeting on equal terms for honor, fairness, and glory. But it was a perfect example of warfare. You attack when you have the advantage and the enemy is at a disadvantage. That's war.
---
Tis but harder to get than the ones I listed and it's desired by others so you can skin corehounds in MC
---
Start with a 2hander. 
---
Charge, Bloodrage, Sweeping Strikes, Berserker Stance, Berserker Rage, Whirlwhind, Defensive Stance, Demo Shout, swap to 1hand &amp; shield. Sunder / revenge as you do now.
---
just like how on elysium all the warriors in the really tryhard guilds had BRE in week 1 while our guild never saw one in like 6 months of MC... totally legit!
---
Lmao chill out man 😂. I’m not saying to do it. I’m just saying it is. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
&gt; Those people needing shit for gold and trying to explain themselves are assholes.
---
Why? There's no difference between a warrior winning a BOE they need and winning an equivalent BOE they don't need, selling it, and buying the same BOE that they do need.
---
Seriously I wonder who some of your brains work. It's really simple logic.
---
Congrats! welcome to the most asinine argument on Reddit classicwow! Where half the people claim that needing on a item that you want to sell is the correct way to play just because somebody else might get that money if you don't click need! Cause everybody \_needs\_ gold but it only matters on BOEs even though a level 55 BoP weapon is worth 10 gold thats 1% of my epic mount and i need my epic mount.
---
You should have pointed out that in instance you have to need for the item itself, not the related gold value
---
This deserves more recognition.
---
I just did this yesterday as a fresh 40 Warrior...
---
Irrelevant if they used to do it or not, telling people how to play is cancerous gatekeeping either way.
---
I didn't mean that as an imperative, I meant that the tank is the most difficult role to fill, so if you find one and he wants to do something aside it's better to help him than to wait for another.
---
If course if he leaves after doing what he needed he's an even bigger scumbag, since he could have easily made a group for that
---
Imagine passing on a SoJ because your mage wants to use it while leveling.
---
It doesn't directly relate to the game. This will get deleted for being drama.
---
If you are new to the game you should enjoy 1-60 and not speedlevel it. I never played wow before. I would solo quest and try out most dungeons but dont xp grind in them.
---
I am lvl 60 warlock now. Doing the last dungeons and getting attuned for mc/ony is fun but lvling and being noob was an adventure.
---
For classes i enjoy Lock alot, many cool skills
---
wait, what? how come? what phase are they going to come out in?
---
Depends on how many warlocks you have. IIRC the breakpoint is about 4 warlocks as to when Shadow Weave gives a great enough dps boost to warrant the raid slot. If there’s less, it’s better to bring someone else.
---
Just you wait for P2 and Honor being implemented. Noone safe in Hillfsbrad and STV
---
Agree, and a need on a BoE is a need on the gold it represents, wether you can equip it or not.
---
Therefore, everyone can need on it.
---
You can't see the difference between the only two distinct types of drops in the game? Really?
---
Greater Blessings are 15 minutes so it's not bad.
---
I will just never group with a player who thinks reserving is a good idea, I'd rather not deal with that side of the community.
---
"It's their choice, they are making the group"
---
As it's my choice to decide to not group with those players.
---
Here is the best example for why personal loot exists in BfA. Because people can’t handle the idea of loot not being a total roll chance for them.
---
We should be able to climb the mountains of Desolace and drop down in there.
---
Because greens are not worth much money, so if they are an upgrade its just straight need and equip.
---
\&gt;Its like you are making an effort to not understand it.
---
It's like you literally cannot comprehend that I don't see it the same way as you? This isn't a factual position, so acting like you have a privileged perspective to dictate reality and then saying "You just don't understand" is so utterly opposite to the point of discussion that I don't even know why we're talking about it.
---
\&gt;**the guy who sells the item need that item as much as the guy who can actually use that item this is not selfish**
---
Yes, it is, that's why we're having this discussion. Not everyone sees it your way and you're missing that fact. You're taking items from those who need them so you can get the gold. If that's not greed then I have no idea what the word is.
---
If you agree loot rules before, great, go ahead and need what you want. If there's no agreed rules and you automatically hit "NEED" on everything you can sell, that is the absolute definition of disregarding others.
---
WoW is not real life, it's not economics, it's not a randian race to get the most gold and leave the other four members of your party behind. It is a way to enjoy your evenings, less so a place to employ objectivist philosophy to excuse your selfish behaviour. How you find needing gold and taking it from those who need the actual item fun, I'll never understand.
---
Community &gt; Gold. I guess we can agree to disagree on that point, though.
---
It's very odd. People seem to think we had warrior using int and priests meleeing back in vanilla. The serious raiders  all knew how to play the game, what specs to use, what was bis, etc.
---
Look how many fuckiwts are downvoting the comments that are telling it how it is, absolutely 100% fuck off and do something else, imagine reporting people for this holy christ get a grip.
---
As a Nelf hunter, this makes me laugh. 
---
You wanna troll low levels in wpvp? Fine. But don't gloat on them lol
---
I think you're too fixed on the idea of making it a case of who needs more, and trying to define some complex limits on whether to need or greed. If you look at BoEs as bags of gold, that should make it way easier to understand, at least it did for me. How would you do roll on a bag of gold? Equally of course. 
---
Also think about an example of a Warden Staff dropping, with a druid in the group.  If the druid should automatically get the drop, why should the group even have a druid then? Nobody should be entitled to bags of gold. It's only FAIR (and fun) for everyone to be on the same level.
---
I hope you're right
---
That's when you hit them with the SpongeBob meme
---
It's cute that you think you can assign some arbitrary value to my need of, lets say devilsaur gear, vs say a warrior's use of a boe weapon. 
---
If this weapon buys me both pieces of devilsaur gear, why in the fuck shouldn't it be considered an upgrade for me? Or even, because it's 2 pieces, a better upgrade for me than the warrior?
---
If the mage demands he is the only one that get to roll on the 600g freezing band, the Mage is a ninjalooter. Its pretty basic logic.
---
Thats just not true. Technically quest reward but the Crescent staff for WC is BIS for some for a wicked long time.
---
I felt this trying to get a 7D run going in BRD for the Hammer of Grace. Everybody be doing lava runs and angerforge
---
IMO it's not to do with spell batching as this type of thing exists in retail.and existed back in the day too. I'd place more of a bet on their server architecture or client.
---
this thread demonstrates exactly that. a lot of noobs and retailers on reddit that are new to procedures that have been standard and undisputed for years on private servers.
---
Gathermate2 atleast displays all possible location. But no tracking
---
Literally go and do something else lmao???
---
I know but I can't poke fun at him since he's not here so you'll have to do.
---
I watched a sodapoppin stream for a few minutes in the first week or so. He was checking his mailbox and was just having free shit sent to him. I got a little frustrated, but then I closed it and went back to playing. The people hating on streamers here aren't capable of doing that. They obsess over it, that someone got popular enough to have a following, and they bitch about it at every opportunity.
---
from 40 to 45 I spent most of my time healing dungeons in uldaman and ZF.
---
And Skullflame Shield is worth 250g.
---
BoPs are worth different amounts to different members of the group, ranging from vendor price to priceless (think Ironfoe). Need rolling BoPs over someone who can equip them is like deleting gold from your group. Need rolling BoEs over someone who can equip them is not.
---
So you’re saying... in Classic WoW, Blizz gave them the weapons, or just let them cheat to get them? That’s delusional.
---
This is more the case with BoE Epics, but simply for the fact that a lot of BoEs go for quite a bit of gold, and since it isn't soulbound, it's fairly agreed upon that everyone should have a chance at it.
---
However personally, if it's a BoE someone is going to equip and use, I don't have a problem passing on it, sure sometimes they'll sell it anyway, but I try and give the benefit of the doubt.
---
This guy rogues!
---
But now you're giving the ninja a 50% chance to win, everyone else has a 12.5% chance of winning. Why would you risk those odds?
---
90g for mount and training
---
Rolling 2 and winning is insanely lucky
---
There's pretty heated discussion over this topic with good arguments on both sides. One camp is saying essentially blue/purple BoE's should be viewed as gold and everyone should roll for gold. If a BoE drops that costs 200g on the AH but a person can use it, it's essentially the same as them winning 200g to buy that item off the AH.
---
This argument works more for higher level/rarer BoE's because some can sell for several hundred gold.
---

Not really, I did about 5 full runs 40 bridge runs and 35ish arena runs. You don't have to clear everything
---
All the conversation I saw leading up to classic was people saying how hard classic is going to be.
---
That level asshole may exist, but they were going to ninja anyway. The plan didn't create them, it just doesn't stop them.
---
It would stop many others.

I use bartender4.   When I was running BRD and I Mind controlled an enemy I knew had buffs, none of them came up to click.   Is there any way around this without having to use blizzard default ui?
---
Hey, you might want to look into the mirror, mate.
---
I understand why people hate when folks like Asmon get freebies from their zoomer groupies. He's a mediocre at best player who has been carried to every achievement he's ever had, and he shamelessly takes advantage of his status to get shit from people. 
---
But cdew is one of the most legit dudes in the history of the game. Pathetic reactions in this thread. Take the game less seriously, yeah ?
---
Buying all class skills, paying for profession mats _and_ for gear will do that to a wallet
---
I like to respond to them with: “You are the telemarketer of wow classic”
---
It works really really well. Anyone that has attacked you sis up in a recently attacked list for quick addition to the KoS list, a prompt appears with the note prefilled with "attacked [your name] [date and time]. Anytime they are in detection distance of you it will alert you and show the note. This list can be shared with your guild, where it shows who's list it is coming from and their note. Super rad add-on.
---
Sell, maybe later on when people can focus more on things like twinks.
---
As a warrior you want more hit than just the yellow hit cap, more white guys mean more rage.

In my scenario you are on an epic fight with your friends from various classes, battling together and picking up and distributing loot to those who're going to use it to help that epic fight be even more epic. In yours, you are with a bunch of strangers that you have 0 interest in and the only thing uniting you is your individual selfish interest to get the maximum profit for yourself and minimum for the others.
---
It's a community game, one built entirely around social activity. To say that your social responsibility to be nice and have a good group is lesser than your personal "responsibility" to take all the gold for yourself if the roll allows you to, is to turn the game into retail.
---
You are full of yourself. You dont understand the logic.
---
it's not the same exact game. private servers were running actual vanilla clients and classic is running off of a modified 7.3.5   
---
it's gotta be something to do with that
---
Yeah but corruption is
---
What was the item anyway? Usually it's not even worth a discussion.
---
Just getting the ticket sent is a mess.
---
lets be real, you suck at pvp and need an instant 5X advantage to be able to kill people that you get by paying blizzard a shitload of money
---
Yea gold gets way easier if you have 13g at 28 you are doing well
---
One of the bars needs to be enabled. Can't remember which it is. Might be the pet bar.
---
No, but listen to u/grawwler
---
obviously you haven't read a million similar threads which have been rampant in the last few weeks... and no, it's obviously not that straightforward for many people, sadly. here, have some links:

and many more, as you can see the vast majority believes that everyone should "Need" an item to sell it on the AH.
---
Objectiveley, Kartoffelsalat.
---
You think people are dense for assuming DM stands for (D)ire (M)aul? Why are you such a fucking asshole?
---
No U dont
---
U can avoid these grinds and be just fine
---
Oh no, the void walker was a bust immediately, it couldn't hold aggro off two rogues, myself and the rogue tanked WC. The moss fen boss nearly killed the two of us, but thankfully we managed to beat it.
---
&gt;Shit was whack, yo
---
Very succinct TLDR
---
Reserving items is just entitled players who are saying their time is more valuable than everyone elses in the group so if this item drops it has to be mine because I'm not doing it again
---
yikes at people buying the pattern. Its not hard to farm, has a high drop chance, and you get two chances per run of lbrs.
---
The difficult part of the robes imo is the mats. Warning: do not buy the pattern for anything over 10g
---
Gold come much much faster after 35.  You're on track.
---
I'm not making it up. Let me go look up the year my mom died. It was a horrific period of my life.
---
The AH in Everlook is just as bad. On my server chances are if you go in there you will die within a  few minutes. People just standing behind bookcases killing everyone who walks in. Not sure why Blizzard hasnt done anything about these spots yet.
---
would you prefer the clip of 140 horde camping brm for us?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyLivelyAsteriskDuDudu
---
I don't think level matters, if an Assassin's Blade, sentry cloak, Shadowfang, Feet of the Lynx etc drops they can be worth epic riding or a BiS epic at 60 depending on server economy.
---
This sub needs a bot that just comments "DAE think streamers are bad?" on every streamer clip that gets posted here. It would probably be the most upvoted comment on every thread.
---
I've never seen a gaming so toxic about people streaming their game as this one is. It's a salt mine.
---
oof. this didnt age well
---
Oh but don't you understand? Their experience IS universal and somehow you're a fucking retard because you had a different experience than this mouthbreathing loser
---
which server?
---
Maybe he equipped it later or maybe he's just an asshole. One asshole won't change my moral principles.
---
Yikes, good to know
---
Well that was a good move considering your talents
---
This is what someone who only watches streamers and desperately tries to get onto a server with them thinks.
---
Thats the same thing with more words. The point is these people who are idiots will tell non idiots that you are a ninja looter. Eventually word will just get around that you are a ninja. Rep actually matters alot in classic.
---
If the rest of your group is decent you should be able to do everything except the emperor.
---
This happened on stalagg yesterday. It should be noted that alliance on this server have all been ganked relentlessly while leveling so now that they've turned 60 they've turned into vindictive assholes. I felt bad for them for awhile because they server is so disproportionately skewed to the Horde side, but after this and endless corpse camping in BRM I actively go out of my way to ruin the day of every single alliance player I come across.
---
Moderation here is awful.
---
Whenever folk complain around me about this I just point out “if you don’t do it now then you will later”
---
Actually it is the default perspective of any party I’ve been in that doesn’t consist of total noobs that don’t understand BoE vs BoP and the auction house market value of items. 
---
If a boe epic worth 100+ gold drops, it has the same value to everyone in the party.
---
The point is that they stop being randoms when you have that good experience with them. The person who "wins" the dungeon is not the one who got the most gold at the end, but rather the one who had the most fun. Is this really so alien a concept to you?
---
The reason that they all seem like random strangers to you is because when good stuff happens, you're only thinking about yourself and how much gold you can get.
---
I feel like you just want a single player game.
---
you forgot to add "sell to vendor", people won't greed on pricy boe that's just not how it goes.
---
I love how they went through the effort to come back with a mage just so they could buff you, dedication!
---
For some items yes, for others, definitively not. There are several pre 45 blues that will be worth hundreds of gold due to twinks.
---
I wish it happened more tbh, Many game subs are just about useless to actually talk about the game due to being majority meme posts.
---
Yuh

---
This is still a sad mental state to be in. I can't wrap my head around how your retail vanilla progress affects your classic playstyle. I hope you can overcome that some day.
---
he did say _a_ bigger fish, singular, meaning his main. the multiboxer was just insult to injury
---
Yea tanking for a group of randos can go either way. I was tanking as arms when i did instances mostly. I was able to dps a few by pugging a warrior tank into my group but wasn’t often.. I prefer to try to pug into a 3/5 guild group if I’m tanking for randoms
---
Staff of Jordan is epic though
---
#lmaoOOOOO
---
Yeah that's exactly what I said. Now get to it, let me know how many greens you need before you get kicked from the first dungeon. Haha. 
---
It's funny cause we've never had a problem allocating loot in any group I've been in, and you make out like I must be one of the fucking sticky bandits from Home Alone. All because I understand that there's a difference between the only two distinct types of drops in the game and you just... don't? I know both acronyms start with BO, but it's the last letter that's different. I'm positive youll get it soon.
---
I appreciate your criticism and can agree to disagree there; but just enjoy the content or don't brotherman, I'm not here to argue about the semantics of web cultures. I just put some chillwave over rainy goldshire. I spent my hard earned money on booze just for the memes and its really not much more than that
---
But that's not classic if the game runs smooth.
---
So is all pvp childish since there are no rewards at the moment?  I stand by my statement.
---
That's such a strawman. Nobody is insisting on rolling need on BoPs. You are either being willfulling ignorant or are just plain silly.
---
If people insist on *everybody* rolling need on BoEs, everybody gets a fair shot at the market value of the item.
---
Just because people liked your content does not change whether it is against the rules or not.
---
People go nuts over every ninja that gets posted. Still against the rules and should be removed.
---
It could still be a lot of accounts over the course of wows life they would have banned for something that only annoys people immediately around the multiboxer. If only 1000 people multibox and average 10 accounts that’s still a lot of subs.
---
Wow, didn't expect as much traction as this.  What started out as a simple nostalgic post about my old warrior toon 15 years ago, blew up a bit.  I'm getting whispers from folks on my server about this post, saying hey you're that guy.  I forget that a lot more players do check reddit in terms of reading and not posting directly.
---
I dunno, I personally don't think taking the time to edit a gif/video is any less effort than any other meme I've seen on this sub. Can't say that I agree, and I've seen some really lame shit left up because it had a ton of upvotes before the mods saw it.
---
I think the mod in question personally didn't find it all that funny and has mistaken "I didn't laugh at this" for "low effort". Editing a gif/video is definitely not as low effort as a lot of shitposts and lame memes the mods allow here.
---
But i need gold to gets BoE off the ah, so its need all the way appsrently
---
There are more than two causes of lag, there are different types of lag, they have COMPLETELY DIFFERENT effects. What on earth are you talking about? What symptoms do "pc lag" and "server lag" share?
---
Regardless of how little you know about lag, no it wasn't my PC causing rubberbanding, desync, slow (or no) server response to actions, etc.
---
You can look up any video of Dark Age of Camelot PvP and see how atrocious it was, and still is (from a technical standpoint; it was still extremely engaging and fun).
---
Set the rules in party chat before doing anything with group. If everybody agrees, then you are good to go. If somebody disagrees then either you or that person can leave.
---
Good thing you are only tempted to be a huge arse, there are already too many players that go "Selling w/e item cheaper than the other guy" just to piss the other guy off in trade. If you want to give out free shit, cool. Just don't do it to piss people off.
---
them being listed for 20g means nothing, as no one will buy it at that price now... many otherwise very costly twink items can be bought dirt cheap now, I myself have a bank stock of lvl 19 BiS items that I bought for around 3g a piece. they will surely be more valuable some time down the road, but it could be a long while (a year or more). it all depends whether you need the money now or if you can afford to wait.
---
that said, green 5-5 pants aren't that good anyway.
---
But the shellfish grinding is one of the best ways for gold, so you didn't waste your time! I did that for a few hours and managed to find one pole.
---
I sent an email to Blizzard yesterday reporting 7 different people (5 of whom are gnome mages..not that its relevant but just saying, I now kill gnomes on sight. Especially gnome mages)
---
Sent a zipped folder with over 30 screenshots of being killed in Everlook.
---
I doubt the players get perma banned. I just want a temp banned and a rollback for em. 
---
They have completely fucked the market up for runcloth bag patterns.
---
&gt; I’m so sick of people complaining about classics mechanics
---
Some of them are quite shit tho.
---
Whenever I think the same thing, and decide to run straight through one of the mobs instead of avoiding both, I end up getting slowed by said mob, panic, pull two or three more mobs and eventually die.
---
&gt;That guy in gadget was warned because he ended up using that same exploit to defend himself. Exploiting to combat an exploit doesn't make you right.
---
Just no. GM's later overturned his warning and admitted doing the wrong thing.
---
at lvl 40+ with 5 points of HotW you can heal just as well as a Resto specced healer, since you will most likely in the +int gear have significantly more mana (20% in fact)
---
The only real benefit that the resto tree has is the natures swiftness or whatever that lets you insta-cast a spell, and the 15% mana regen in combat. (obviously the others are good to have like the healing touch cast time and the mana reduction, but they are 'nice to have' and not 'required to function well' talents like swiftnes and mana regen).
---
Unless you really want to use the swiftmend spec, I'd stick with feral and put 5 points into MotW and heal predominantly with healing touch.
---
Had luck with some items drops plus proffesions
---
&gt; Ignoring rares
---
I have an etiquitte question.. was doing WC on my rogue who has terrible gear. I won 2 of the first rolls for loot and the party leader tells me I can't loot anymore because it was supposed to be a guild run but they didn't know I wasn't in the guild. So then the 1h mace drops that was a GIANT upgrade for me, a warrior in their guild says he wants it so I greed roll, but then he decides he doesn't want it and they give it to a goddamn warlock.. Do warlocks EVER need to use melee? Also would I be in the wrong to just need it considering they didn't mention until we started that they were doing a guild run?
---
Level your main damage skills and anything that can increase your uptime to the max possible rank always. This will enable you to grind more &amp; quest faster and will return the gold u spent in time saved which u can use to farm more.
---
Ya no shit lol.
---
Basically you take the princess to one side of the rock, and you go to the opposite side of the rock, then just spam AD and use moonfire every 12seconds.
---
I dont think it is worth for a warlock to do it, since you can kill her faster by just casting spells, and kiting her around the room.
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
You're a whiny crybaby.
---
Laughs in warlock main from which I can transfer the gold
---
Peonidas Stop them!
---
That's what this convo is about bud, BoE's come in epic and rare.
---
Sounds like a PEBKAC issue to me.
---
Whoa, careful not to cut yourself with that edge...
---
or just download Healcomm !
---
It's like these people forget they're on the same server as you...
---
You can make a name.for yourself really easy. Theres a few on my server that can't find groups anymore because they're notorious ninja looters,  and dicks to other players about it.
---
I spent a lot of time in SM and RFK just grinding away there. If you are a tank it shouldn't take too long to find a group in the LFG channel. 
---
I also looked at a dungeon guide for each instance and grabbed all the quests I could. Hope that sorts out your level problem.
---
As for your mount I can't help you there, I didn't get mine till 45.
---
And you've been able to obtain this information via his text-based responses how? Still haven't answered the question. I take it you realized you had no arguments to support your claim and now you're just trying to divert attention from that fact? Cheers.
---
I just got bored of the game and didnt feel like explaining myself
---
Can only speak from my experience, but Ashbringer has a large pop of UK players (or EU that speak English). Good server with a pretty even split of Horde and Alliance.
---
The Dream
---
Why do you have to make ridiculous examples to make a point. There is CLEARLY a difference between needing on BoE items and selling them on the AH and needing BoP items and selling them at the vendor. It already starts with the item being used by someone.
---
It really is not that difficult to understand.
---
Just have to disable border flashing and mess with the sounds.  Both under configuration
---
Not even a slight FPS drop. My god.
---
Look at all those Crescent staffs.
---
It doesn't stop there, there's certain depths of water that will dismount a gnome but not the taller races. To be honest though if you play a gnome you kinda deserve this kind of stuff to happen to you mate
---
ah, thanks for the clarification.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the rule, but at least it's clearly noted and applies  here.
---
besides that he has no clue about classic shaman he is a bgi sellout. at first he was like no i dont take donation because it feels better when you manage to do things on your own, and now bam donations. and hand of rag doesnt make a difference in the tourney he will still get rekt because of enhancment duel shitness and his inability to play properly
---
Cdew is actually a good player and sulfuras alone wont make a difference between winning or losing. If you think so I don't know what to tell you.
---
I'm pretty sure you need to be level 5 to even learn professions in the first place
---
This is the reason I waited almost to lvl 30 before finishing it. God damn those moss gaints and spiders near the respawn point.
---
C: I'm I'm sick of Retail I'm going to try classic.  
---
C: Classic is horrible it needs quality of life changes.  
---
R: Then it would just be Retail. Aren't you sick of retail?  
---
C: Fuck you and your logical conclusions.
---
An Alternate Reading.
---
I personally don't play Blizzard a dime to play WoW. Tokens on retail and millions of gold keep the dream alive.
---
I think he is, my leader went around fishing for feedback about me and told me people were praising me. The exact opposite should be possible. I didn't do anything particular to earn a rep except playing so i'd bet some people already have a hard time getting into groups if they are assholes.
---
I think that was his point. The search should be able to find it either way.
---
You'll want more than 6% hit as a fury warrior.
---
How is EVERYONE rolling need a ninja thing? It's also not a retail thing, everyone has had different experiences. I started early TBC and on my server the standard was everyone rolled need on BoE blues &amp; epics.
---
Well you just had a shitty warlock. Usually I tell the healers dont bother healing me unless Im below 50% and dont waste any good heals/cds on me unless its a crazy pull and I get aggro.
---
A simple renew with life tap and life drain should be enough to sustain a lock through normal pulls. The warlock will never be at full health/mana doing life tap/drain life but they will never be out of mana and health either
---
Dude! Been like 2 days and to get a reply saying you got broken tooth made me smile. Big gz my man
---
If it mattered to you to win so badly you should’ve rolled need?
---

---
After reading these comments I think it's a good choice to keep them, it's just tempting to respect :P
---
Druids are best as healers
---
Druids are good as tanks
---
Maybe being DD is the most difficult. Especially if you pull group of mobs, cat is a good single target dd, but one of the worst for multi target DMG
---
One thing I never noticed, is that their model is basically Kodos without head/legs.
---
Even the animations are the same.
---
You do know that a 1% drop rate drops for every 100 guilds to kill him right? Do you know how many people are clearing rag weekly?
---
Keep up on your gear. I find warrior to be very gear dependent. When my gear is at my level, I sail through 1v3 against mobs at my lvl.
---
On a similar note, green quests are your friend.
---
Fucking deviate hides man. If that quest didn't reward a 10 slot bag it would not be worth all the grinding on the mobs outside the instance after running it.
---
They’re a low: 1% ish drop chance from the traps. You just got really lucky
---
What’s the addon you use for battle shout / execute reminders?
---
Is it weakauras? If so can you post your profile? 
---
Thanks
---
Then he can talk to the person who won the roll about that and maybe they can work something out.  But generally it's not smart to equip an item that sells high that you will replace in 3 levels.
---
I think there could be a better job done of the mods deciding what should stay and what doesn't. But without the rule there would be a constant stream of memes we have seen 100s of time, except the lady is yelling at pointing at a cat druid instead of just the cat.
---
It's a partial run anyway. What's the difference between doing only the initial 30% or only the final 30%?
---
The riders of the rohirrim did ambush the orc party carrying the hobbit bros, so it could *technically* be considered "LOTR" style.
---
Im sure if you search classic warrior macros you can find some. I like to keep my macros as simple as possible. Its hard to type them out because reddit thinks I’m trying to change my text.
---
A sample one would be
---
(Hashtag)showtooltip charge
---
(Slash)cast battle stance
---
(Slash)cast charge
---
The showtooltip is great for actually showing the spell you will be macroing. I always name my macros with a single period so they blend in with my other spells. A simple shield bash macro would look like
---
(Hashtag)showtooltip shield bash
---
(Slash)cast defensive stance
---
(Slash)equipslot 16 sword of thousand truths
---
(Slash)equipslot 17 sheild of virginity
---
(Slash)cast sheild bash
---
Keep in mind for wep swap macros like these it does a single global cool down after the swap, so press it again to bash. Also, dont put in the ranks of spells, or they will break when you upgrade the spells to a diff rank
---
Then why not have 1 type of rolling UNLESS its BOP? 
---
Because its always been greed for gold unless you are trying to avoid ninjas then you all need. 
---
Needing for gold is literally ninjaing in anyother context I dont see why you'd suddenly change the rule just because the amount of gold you get has gone up. Either its a rule about needing the upgrade vs being greedy or its not. -- you can't just say the greed rule doesnt apply if the money value is too high thats literally the definition OF BEING GREEDY roflmfao
---
Pretty disappointed that you didnt get replys: "At home" or "in UK".
---
Sometimes i wonder what the internet has done to me.
---
That succubus post was a high quality compared to some shit that keeps hanging here. Making that is much more effort than cropping a chat window..    
---
Anyway, what else than upvotes should decide if it's low effort (bad) or acceptable meme? One mod? Or 1,3k people who like it? Mods should moderate, not dictate their own opinions...     
---
Feels like there is something personal between you and the mod, or the mod is just poorly chosen person who is compensating something.    
---
Edit: Mod's flair is "Saltypaladin", that sums it up the best I guess..
---
You see any game time tokens is Classic?
---
Exactly. Not sure why everyone gets so bent out of shape over it.
---
I have like 80+ light feathers from grinding harpies. I am set as a priest.
---
Meh. Not the epic voice guy, pass D:
---
So everyone is cool with donating gold/items to streamers now? Oh ok
---
Any DKP based raiding guilds on Herod (horde)? Having problems early on with my current guilds loot council system and I want to get out before resentment has a chance to grow more. 60 rogue with most pre raid bis.
---
So happy to see him wrecking shit again. Watched his videos all the time during Wrath.
---
Amazing! More more more! Haha
---
Are people not allowed to name and shame because if this happened to me id 100% name and shame them including their realm name. No reasons for this person not to be put out there for everyone to see and avoid especially with reddit and the wow forums. Scumbags deserve to play with other scumbags.
---
yes SM ruin is what many locks run in endgame works well in PVE and PVP
---
I was shaking with frustration.  I wasn’t seeing clearly as you can tell
---
Sure, change your name to BehindBag.
---
The spirit is there, but I think it's SFW enough to get past chat reports.
---
what i find sad is that this has been posted many times before by others, and the whole time you were running around un goro trying to fill as many compeleted quests as you could, you were thinking OMG I am gonna post this to reddit once i get all these quest done.
---
Pretty much describes the last month of my life.
---
Fairly certain you can do that with bartender. I think you need to enable the option called "Blizzard art bar" or something, and then move everything back into place, but definitely possible. Or was, a couple of years ago when I used it.
---
Ah great advice for the macro, that would be super helpful! Been on a pickpocketing rampage to level up lock picking, hoping to be able to start making some in tips.
---
Undead, if you happen to loot it off Rivendare
---
About 12g on my server. I wouldn't hold onto them, either use them or unload them now.
---
/sit = big crits. Nothing new to see here.
---
Which class has the smoothest levelling experience to 60 for an alt while also having the easiest gold farming capabilities (i.e., not gear dependent, low skill floor)? 
---
I'm assuming Mage, Warlock, or Hunter, but can't decide which one. My main is a Rogue, for reference.
---
I was coming here to say this ^
---
Are you sure? Have you seen the chain pulling, wand-slinging, never drinking shadow priest mlg pro madness?
---
Better dead then red!
---
wolf IIRC
---
I'm not sure what he's using but you could get the same setup using Bartender and Vuhdu together.
---
Sorry for the stupid question, but what is the armor cap in classic? I tried googling it to not look dumb, but only found TBC/WOTLK data.
---
They can't. Hunter tags mobs faster @ spot farming. After 20 minutes, every lock / mage / priest leaves the place.
---
I wanted to say it's expensive as hell to experiment. But if you just take some time to farm some gold, it's not that big of a deal.
---
Wanting to be the best you can be is what the game is about. It's when people start forcing it into every aspect of the game and expecting everyone else to follow suit that's the problem. Telling others, we're not killing that boss because those shoulders aren't bis is bullshit.

---
Lol I need the hunter chest off it for some fr and  no one will do it. What a shame
---
yes
---
The name (and all variants using special characters of it) are inappropriate and you are getting the reports you deserve.
---
If you continue to insist on remaking the same name, you will eventually get a ban from the game. Someone else in this subreddit got a ban for remaking the same name over and over recently.
---
Best to just move on and choose an appropriate name.
---
Some think it IS ninjalooting.
---
You think its not. 
---
Both are valid, and this is an issue that clearly divides the waters.
---
Yep. This. It not only makes your hits more damaging, it can proc big Overpower crits. 
---
For the OP who might not know, heroic strike is way more expensive than it appears because you give up a whole swing worth of rage generation in addition to the 15 rage you have to spend. It's best to just sunder instead and overpower when you can.
---
I’m level 33 right now and I’m pretty sure I have like... 6 gold?
---
Maybe all the greedy goblins want to keep this their secret
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Disagree completely. If you work your ass off grinding for something it's just as much if not more of an accomplishment.
---
Winning the lottery would give me far less of a sense of pride than working for the piece over a period of time.
---
Recovering altoholic here. Never reached 60 in classic because of my alt problem. Now I'm at level 49 and refuse to even make a bank alt. 
---
I'm gonna hit 60 and have a main eventually!!
---
shimmering flats in thousand needles, leather for days, plenty of mobs to keep grindin on.
---
It's really picking nits when you get down to these last points but general consensus is imp vamp embrace is bad and mind blast talent is the least bad thing to advance the tree. My suggestion would be drop imp vamp embrace and three points out of imp mind blast. Then put them into meditation and then either mental agility or imp inner fire. Inner fire if you are scared of melee, otherwise mental agility hits the mana of a lot of spells so its nice.
---
depends how far you want to go.
---
If logic makes sense, but people are too stupid to follow it, why should one care if they think you're a ninja or an asshole? This is fucking amusing.
---
Exactly this.
---
Someone further up had another good way to put it. He said that if you really do NEED it (to equip it), then looting it is just saving yourself the gold it would have cost you on the AH. So, essentially, you're just rolling for the money anyway and it would be greedy to assume that you deserve the money more than anyone else in the group.
---
Wow, you guys get to wait until your late 20s before seeing dickhead ?? players? Alliance start seeing dickhead ?? horde players at lvl 15... Which is really crazy, because the horde don't even have any quests in redridge, but the alliance DO have a quest they get from southshore to kill yetis.

I know the quest is intending for alliance to go to alterac mountains to kill yetis, but the ones in the hillbrad cave also drop the loot needed for the quest. Which, since most players are using something like questie and they get the quest from southshore (which is in hillsbrad), means a lot of alliance players end up just going to the hillsbrad cave instead of alterac mountains, because that is where they think they need to go for the quest.

225 i believe requires you to be lvl 35 or higher

So much [Salt] in this thread. Fun video, loved the 2nd group unexpectedly riding in. Great to see world pvp happening like this again!
---
Me and a friend spent 1 full day there to get our nifty stopwatch because of all the pvp going on. Had tons of fun though
---
I looked it up. It was 2000. It may have been just Warcraft then. My player is Tyrq on Shattered Hand. I just looked at her on my son's account the other day. She's still there.
---
What’s funny is that it’s simply not the case. I love helping people in game. It jacks me up to give away greens to people after I inspect them and see I have a random BoE green that’ll be an upgrade. I enjoy helping people in general chat with quests, even if I’ve done them because I know how difficult it was by myself. I just don’t get how people can’t see how everyone having shot at the BoE is more fair/fun for the whole group. 
---
 No one “wins” a dungeon. The person who wins in your example is the person who has the most fun. You know what is fun? Getting upgrades to your items or an item you can sell to apply towards character progression (mount, professions, new gear). Telling four other people they should pass so you can have more fun is selfish.
---
My rogue is 55 and I'm wearing those.. I bought them yesterday in ah
---
Raids can be cleared by less than 40 people. So it's not about the class being viable. It's find a raid group that has room for a another Druid.
---
I believe there is a setting in interface, I think under combat, it should be “reactive abilities.” I think that’s what you are looking for?
---
Without the epic voice guy these are just meaningless rants.

---
I dont think you can graveyard skip anymore... I died in felwood outside that timbermaw cave, then ran to the spirithealer in moonglade. Instead of rezzing me in moonglade, it insta-ported me back to the felwood spirit healer.
---
One of the great things about classic is that there are firm BiS lists, that are actually achievable. You don't have any of the titanforging/tertiary BS of BfA. 
---
If you want an item, you farm it, you get it, and it is exactly the item you wanted. And, then, you don't replace it until you can farm the next item on your list. It's a great feeling.
---
No, you just misunderstood that it's applicable to both situations rather than just one.
---
You should be moving forward and strafing with WAD and turning using right click and mouse.
---
Road through wetlands heading toward loch
---
Yeah no, you gave 1 reason you choose not to use it. Nothing you stated came close to reasoning it as pointless. 
---
Mount up, jump off cliff, slow fall, rocket forward slowly and thus turn high cliffs into mini flight points.
---
Your reasoning is basically "I am just a noob mage leave me alone"
---
Geezzz I thought I was the worst roller around

Fish nightfin snapper at camp mojache, cook it's soup and AH them.
---
Cdew himself said he didn't really deserve it and plenty of people put in the hours he does.
---
He got hand of rag cause he's a streamer, simple as that, you can't sit in Ogrimmar and say i need gold and people just trade you gold unless you have a legion of fans.
---
Can't really blame him, i'd take advantage as well.
---
BoP items can't be bought for the vendor price. BoE items have the same opportunity cost for every class regardless of whether they can use it, BoP items do not.
---
Damn son haha the first thing I do is spam purge on everybody haha it's super OP.
---
Just play it if you like it.
---
That being said, it seems like a backstab-based spec. As such, you're missing 20% backstab damage from opportunity.
---
Vigor is also pretty underwhelming for a 31 point talent.
---
I leveled with this build and it was fun for pvp, and alright for dungeons.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#fGxcoxkZGcZVMecc0o
---
Ambush/backstab. Ambush has 100% crit after killing something. I was constantly trying to get the killing blow in dungeons, it made it more fun for me.
---
Improved sap is also useful for dungeons, ambush is alright for killing mobs and pvp, and stealth speed makes pickpocket farming doable. Cold blood + improved eviscerate generates a lot of controlled burst.
---
buzzard intestines :(
---
i really dig your friends art style and talent but there is something wrong with anatomy here. Why is her ear on the top of her head?
---
I’m talking about cross faction communication, not sure about the spot this guy is on or any idea about what’s “unreachable” by guards and such
---
We started really early on Warcraft and had the Orcs and Humans and all the follow-ups after that.  My kids could tell you the names. I can't. I may have played Tyrq sometime after mom died but not in years now. It just made me feel too horrible remembering I was gaming when she was lying there with a stroke. We also played Kings Quest as one of the earliest games. I'm 62 so my memory isn't spot on.
---
You can pickpocket enemies just fine without it, you just have to be careful or distract your target.
---
I would switch improve stealth for Opportunity.
---
If you'r playing Horde imp poison is... OK if you're not planning to play with Shaman /WF often. If you do PVE with a shaman you're "wasting" half of that talent (only main hand will have poison)
---
2 in Vile 3 in imp kidney shot, assuming that you're a dagger rogue you get 20% dmg from your backstabe + 9% while the target is Kidney + it benefit party member if you use it in PvE.
---
Vigor is still a questionable talent without the other +10 from set bonus, because you still have to wait on energy tick on your opener in pvp you can't ambush then backstab chained. 
---
You could remove it then put it in combat ;
---
Endurance 
---
Dagger specialization
---
Dual Wield
---
are viable choices, they all cover PvP and PvE situations
---
&gt; Who are you even going to sell it to? EVERYBODY'S BROKE!

i though this until i sold a skullflame shield for 800g in under 10 min
---
This is how I started raiding during vanilla.  It worked ok for a bit, but it ends up being too much of a hassle for most of the people involved.  Short-term is can work as a means to set up some raids and get people experience, but realistically it would be best to try to be forming the people taking into the raid into your own, or a new, guild itself.  Being in the same guild simply makes it easier to organize and plan.  There are less people serving as points of contact to make sure you get everyone in the raid.
---
If you want to try to set it up, I would say try to figure out what you have in your guild who can/want to raid and then find out if there are other guilds in the same boat.  Dtermine which ones fill your needs best and work with them to find out what days/times work out and start going.  I'd suggest to them possibly merging into one guild, but I would definitely make it an objective to move towards.
---
I'm from a pve server and I don't really get all these world pvp posts. There was this tauren once who was flagged for pvp somehow so I thought I'd fight him and see what all the fuss was about. When I attacked, he just waited and died. Now I feel like a jerk. What's the bug deal?
---
It’s not the same value though. Why are you trying to say that someone getting lucky with a rare item drop doesn’t have the right to use that item as intended? Not everyone can afford to buy items on the AH.
---
I mean as someone else pointed out, that’s why the greed icon is a gold coin. And as someone else pointed out your attitude is what led to getting personalised loot in retail. It’s a lack of respect for other people playing the game.
---
I was going to craft mine and drop tailoring. But I crafted mine and kept it for the mooncloth cooldowns. There's a chance I drop for alchemy or engineering at some point. But for now I'm keeping tailoring and herbalism my secondary. Just farm the herbs you need to power level alchemy and you'll be fine waiting until you craft the vestments.
---
Of course I am. Not even implying, suggesting it openly.
---
Man, more time is spent on watching the environment, not the health bar :) This is why ui space is minimized.
---
Man wow got greedy reading these comments :/ Who knew need vs greed was so complicated -_- and something for debate.
---
Aren't the spots always crowded?
---
Go off queen
---
It has nothing to do with streaming or idolizing anybody. There were no streamers back the and yet the same things happened 15 years ago. It always went to the most popular or the person who could use it the best while the rest of the guild or even server worked together to give or sell the required things. The Warrior who got the hand a few weeks ago on EU Firemaw is not a even a streamer. You are wrong.
---
It forces you to quest in different zones than you may be used to. It does get better as you get to a higher level and can fight back.
---
Lvl 38, 67g. Gonna be tight but I think i can do it, got a few stacks of fadeleaf sitting in the bank too do hopefully I got this!
---
It's not going to last you until 60, why would you even bother with that shit?
---
120 horde in BRM, supposedly.
---
True, its just for enemies I think
---
Anger Management + Unbridled Wrath + dual wielding = enough rage to melt your keyboard. Sub 40 MS fanbois don't know shit.
---
You mean like how your whining right now?
---
1. You can heal but you don't have a reliable rez, people will hate it when you say that they have to run back because your rez is on cooldown.
---
2. You can feral dps but it will be inferior to most other dps class except moonkin druid
---
3. You can balance dps, but see the above point
---
4. You can easily feral tank any of the dungeons, but your itemization will be horrible, as there are no gear sets for you and very few gear pieces actually designed for a feral Druid tank. Endgame Raids will only compound the issue.
---
All that being said, it's still an very fun class to play.
---
I would check out the server discords instead for a better indication of popularity and quality. All the server subreddits seem pretty dead.
---
Respectfully disagree. I'm in the camp of Need = for that character to equip as an upgrade. Greed = I don't need this particular item to equip but it would provide gold or trade mats etc.
---
But I do see your point and for the people who are on the other side of the fence from me it makes sense.
---
Oh gotcha, well I'm curious for that too
---
With a guild like that that's reasonable. I've also quit abruptly in a different mmo but I had some friends I said goodbye and gave my stuff to.
---
You mean a 30/9 build...
---
Are you on about the mobs down below after the first fight and/or the mobs under the spiders?
---
I'm jealous of younger me who got to play on Vanilla servers back in the day when they weren't tainted with ~~digital panhandlers~~ streamers. Didn't know how good I had it.
---
Seems like retail might be more your son's style, you are what vanilla/classic is made for, dont rush, enjoy :)
---
Repost it with this edit, absolute gold lol
---
&gt; You should probably look up what ad hominem means
---
&gt; This is a you problem
---
Yeah ... I'm fine, thanks. Never forget that you first brought in mechanics. If you want to explain it as part of community interaction, do so in the first place.
---
Look, I am not the guy that said being prepared is something you shouldn't be expected to do. I merely pointed out that that by shifting the argument from:
---
&gt; You can beat that with game mechanics
---
to
---
&gt; You signed up for this thing because, really you can't beat it with game mechanics
---
is bad form and indeed ad hominem if phrased as
---
&gt; My dude, you're on a PvP server. You signed up for this.
---
Implying the person did not know what PvP servers mean.
---
The core of your argument is fine. This is an RPG. Not everything is equal. Players will ambush you ingame. You will ambush others ingame. It's all good. That is why most of us play the game. I actually like it.
---
Besides, I play WL so all yall stupid rogues in BRM can suck it! :P
---
Yep just did this myself the other day, a big wtf moment for sure then a good laugh after.
---
Are you 12?
---
Only that chests drop random pile of unknown shit (and it's considered good tone to give out any trade mats to the people in a party who can use them), while nodes drop very specific, known in advance trade materials that people without profs has no use of outside vendoring or AH
---
I know a paladin that also needed those Devout shoulders ;) It didn't end too well.
---
&gt;Because you can use that argument for literally any item in the game, even to vendor it
---
No you can't, you can't buy an item for the vendor price. The opportunity cost isn't the same.
---
yeah they probably shoulda just been friendly /s
---
FOR BEING TOO AWESOME
---
I'm not even sure how that comment came close to implying that. Try to be less butthurt before you write something.
---
Lowkey, it kind of depends on the zone. However I am a video game completionist. It’s why I hate Redridge and Wetlands so much haha
---
I find it depends on how tough the mob is. Weak mobs that down quickly are better off being Heroic Striked. But yeah definitely use sunder.
---
Not trying to be mean, but did you train up your demons skills?
---
That was a lucky greed roll then 
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Go usually means tank goes in first. If one person asks if the group is ready, it doesn't automatically mean who ever asked ready first is assumed to be running in first
---
People post cellphone pics because they are on reddit using their phones and are too lazy to login from pc.
---
That's the one and only reason behind it.
---
What's your talent build that lets you DPS that well and tank too?
---
Blizzard has changed a lot during the years, and it has strayed quite far from the Blizzard I use to know.. But its good to see Blizz Customer Support are still the real deal. You guys have always been one of Blizzard's biggest boons. Keep at it!
---
It's 16-17g each on horde Gehennas, highly contested and there's horde and alliance guilds working together camping them 24/7 in order to have a monopoly on them.
---
I deliberately buff warriors as often as I can on my priest as my partner plays warr and when we are running about together I get a shitton of buffs and he only ever gets mine, and we're next to one another.
---
Complete with the Ride of the Rohirrim.
---
"Choppy" how? Are you talking about FPS (frames per second)? I can't think of any instances of "PC lag" looking like network/server lag or vice-versa.
---
Yea I picked mine up for 2g at alliance AH after grinding and killing horde for hours and hours
---
We've played Retail -- 2015-2016. He has said multiple times that he likes Classic much more, because it's challenging. He has no interest in going back to Retail.
---
Was it the AQ opening when the boat to theramore kept ending up in stonetalon? (Yes, stonetalon. In the middle of the woods)
---
Non contested. This guy is really trying to hype his video but a bunch of it looks staged. No reason to be flagged at this spot, its one of the very first quests out of the starting zone
---
Orcs can increase damage at the cost of 50% less healing
---
As a Priest healer... Who is Solakar Flamewreath?
---
No, cancerous is the Priest stacking blue mp5 gear beating me on the Eye of Divinity roll as Im carrying the raid on my shoulders because he has no fucking clue the sort of gear he should be going for.
---
Nobody cares about bis, but you should at least understand what stats are good.
---
Until leveled out. I do all of the quests that grant me XP, then move on to the next one (or dungeon spam through a level or two).
---
As long as you state it before starting the group, there is no problem with agreeing on loot rules like this.
---
I told my friend that the entrance to RFD was the shape of a pig snout and he was surprised that he never noticed that.
---
&gt;Classic PvP isn't like retail PvP where your level gets you instant kills on lower level guys.
---
Ironically this isn't the case in a lot of situations in retail either because of all the pvp scaling fuckery that's going on. Right on launch of bfa it was a big issue with geared legion 110s absolutely obliterating level 120s, and similiarly at lower levels because of all the stat squishes the power level between a 20 and a 40 wouldn't be very large I don't imagine
---
And live close to death.
---
they needed layers while the population caps were increased or else every zone would be unbearably crowded. when layering gets removed, they're free to return caps to normal levels.
---
Could just be few people are flooding AH at the moment with silk bags. On my server they tend to sell very well. 
---
I don't list them to undercut, I always list them at a stable price where I am making a bit of money. They don't always sell right away but there's enough turn around on the bags that they never bounce back to my mailbox. 
---
Remember you don't always have to undercut the lowest buyout. If there's a decent demand for an item it will sell eventually.
---
Is it fair that a rogue should need on strong boxes and get locked chests seeing as they went through the effort of leveling lock picking?
---
Ain't no mercy in this war.
---
You don’t like the chat frame being halfway up the screen? 
---
The part that bothered me the most was he never used Battle Shout even though there’s an add-on screaming in his face to do so.
---
When it comes to BoE Epics/Rares I just tell everyone to Need it.  99% of the time it's not "worth" equipping the item, there's a quest item or dungeon drop that's just as good.  It's especially frustrating when it's a good twink item.
---
if you bind your spells around WASD with modifiers you dont need to click and you can easily use your mouse to your likings.
---
Because you wouldn’t drop anything to get a rare/epic BoE worth hundreds of gold... OK
---

---
WRX and a horde player, my fucking man!
---
You could try to use something like Reshade and find a darker filter to apply.
---
Problem is that nobody ever confirmed or denied if it can get you into trouble. Based on the way it works, which is not modifying the game client at all, it should not get you banned. But there's lively discussion around it...
---
the amount of people i see in my server with both of them seems really wrong, i don't think i ever saw one drop in vanilla
---
Probably late to the party, but here we go.  I am only 43 (Priest).  I enjoy spriest pvp/leveling, intend to heal at 60.  I played resto druid in vanilla and then resto shaman as my main into CATA.  Had a warlock, rogue, priest alt.
---
Right now my guild has a ton of priests! and it kind of makes me want to start leveling an alt (I'll still get priest to 60).  We actually have very few mages it seems so I am leaning that way, but in my WoW experience I never carried a mage past 70 (I had a gnome and undead).  Just never stuck, but I don't mind the "boring" rotation and soloing is fun as a mage.  Just not a fan of downtime.  
---
Also thinking rogue because 1v1 PvP as rogue is fun.  Warlock too, but I am Alliance and don't feel like dealing with undead.
---
I should probably push my mage alt and see how it feels.
---
Yeah, thats amazing so cool to see that
---
RemindMe! 2 hours
---
Yeah Whirlwind is shit don’t even bother learning it
---
Thats a very inaccurate way of interpreting what Im saying. Good job.
---
This phrase is becoming massively overused
---
So technically speaking, I can still farm the alchemy recipes and get a full set of herbs to power level it in quick session. Pretty much all critical elixirs and flasks have to be farmed anyway, only a few recipes require questing (like restorative potion). OK, maybe it is worth just boosting tailoring at this stage... get some bags, craft any prebis... etc
---
I build my Codex Level 5, it's a blessing as kill steals make me thrive.
---
Some say I'm a lamer, but I don't care. Cuz stats are my [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAKPqpN85-I)
---
You're the first person on reddit to bring it up. Now I've got that on loop.
---
Hell based on some of the videos I've seen, sometimes you can't even count on guildies.
---
He’s probably following a levelling guide, a lot of guides will redirect you to new zones after a set of quests then come back to that zone at a different level to do the other quests
---
&gt;Haziiyama96 -4 points 7 days ago 
---
oh no not 4 internet points how will you survive now
---
Because it's called etiquette.  Need/Greed is based on etiquette.  Need an item you need.  Greed an item you will sell.  You all turned Need into "well I NEED this gold to buy other upgrades".  That is the very definition of greed in need/greed.
---
Ha ha ha .... I wonder does the alliance have there version of barrens chat ?
---
Why is it wrong? The opportunity cost is the same for all classes if it is BoE.
---
Problem with leveling guides is that you have to follow them from the get-go otherwise you miss a lot of pre-req steps and have to skip a lot. The game by design jumps you over from zone to zone and backtracking those quests can be real a pain.
---
don't worry. the mods here seem to be a little strange. as in many other subreddits too.
---
Can you link me a video of private server having 15+ raid groups in one area and not experiencing lag? There’s been some serious revisionist history posted about them. I’ve seen videos on classic of 5+ raids fighting with some lag but nothing unplayable and I’d be surprised if many servers are going to have more than that
---
In actual vanilla there was always massive input lag when large scale battles happened as well
---
yeah the awesome classic environment
---
That's not how statistics work.  1% drop does not mean one drop in 100 events.  Even in 100 events, that's only 63% chance the drop occurred.
---
Later in the game you will want to respec into Protection.
---
The best way I know to gain and hold threat is to sunder Armor, tab to the next target and sunset again.  Keep doing this til you’ve hit the entire group.
---
Mocking Blow/Taunt let’s you get mobs to refocus on you but you’ll want sunder or another high threat ability to make them stay on you.
---
A shield is 30ish percent of your armor and it adds a block chance.  Two-handed or two-weapon tanking increases the amount of damage you take way more than it reduces the damage you deal.  The healer will not thank you for it.
---
Speaking of which, keep an eye on your healers health bar (is something attacking?) mana bar (can he keep going or need a water break) and Line of Sight.  Ankle high walls can prevent him from healing you (I’m thinking about Stockades here)
---
Man, he should have sniped the LH instead.
---
Winterspring or Blasted Lands elite demons
---
With the population on Faerlina theres no way its getting 1 layer any time soon
---
What about a person who tries to hold a group hostage?  My group openly stated we were looking for heals for Mara Princess runs.  Pick up a priest.  Half way into it, he asks if we are also doing purple side as he needs Vyletongue.  Personally I didn’t care but the other guys said no, we’re doing princess runs.  
---
We get to Princess and she’s got maybe 1/2 life left when I noticed the tank is below 1/4.  The healer just sat there and didn’t heal.  We burn Princess down and manage to kick the priest before we loot so he doesn’t get a roll on anything.  
---
People like that are just as bad as people who leave early

Ingenuity. Sorry this happened to you but its the risk you took.
---
Meanwhile i have 0 on ignore...grow some murloc scale maybe? I hear AH has 100% drop
---
Wow classic is much harder because you can actually die during leveling, you have to pay attention to things and its isnt streamlined garbage like retail where everything gets handed to you.
---
Retail is in every aspect a joke in comparison to classic. 
---
Also retail mechanics hard btw lmao, nice meme, there are less spells for mage to begin with and just the same rotation over and over.
---
Greed just means you desire something, the dictionary doesn't say greed means that you will equip the item on the spot in world of warcraft. People desire both gold and gear, I don't see how that supports your argument. Especially when gold buys gear.
---
The opportunity cost for BoE items is the same for everyone because they can be traded (except for greens which are hard to sell and will cost you AH fees so you may as well vendor). Someone who needs a BoE blue/purple when everyone else greeded is essentially getting 100g for free, even if they equip it. They now no longer have to buy that item, and they probably wouldn't have bought it anyway because most BoE items are overpriced crap.
---
If say in real life you and 4 friends found a free Ferrari, would you let your friend who doesn't have a car keep it or sell the car and buy something more practical?
---
For group play, Warriors are probably the highest demand class (as tanks) and Hunters are probably the lowest demand. If you can find a guild or some friends to dungeon with you should be fine, otherwise finding a group may be frustrating at times, especially when leveling.
---
Use the item "as intended"? What do you think the "intended" us of an item is that doesn't bind on pickup? They're there so that they can be useful for everyone due to the fact that they can be traded/sold. Getting that BoE loot is only doing one thing, either saving you the gold it would cost to buy it, or giving you the gold from selling it. It's literally worth the exact same thing to every single person that is able to roll on it.
---
If the "inteded" use was to equip it then it would just be a BoP item like boss loot. It's quite obviously designed in such a way to NOT be treated like a BoP.
---
Lmao nice.
---
Oh wait I’m in /r/classicwow
---
Streamer bad!
---
Great clip. Lighten up you guys, it's world pvp, you make it seem like the only acceptable pvp is when you're attacked first by a higher level.
---
Holy shit, flying mounts sound so dumb. Blizzard gonna break their own game all over again wtf. Someone explained to me in discord how it broke world pvp, didn't realize it broke open world questing even more jesus.
---
Hyper capitalism ruined that, what percent of people do you think work because they feel any kind of desire to do their job
---
Op said it was from a world drop in a group with 1 random person - op has to need in this situation case closed. I’m not even counting this as getting ninjad this is just bad common sense
---
I had around 30 at this level iirc and I barely made it (I had exactly 90g and 5s, and it was after selling almost everything i kept). So yeah it feels like you're a little behind, but it depends on what you have stored.
---
Go as a mage and throw water balloons at everyone saying, "Here's your damn water".
---
Don't advertise to people without first spending time with them or in a channel where they're looking for a guild.
---
People don't like door to door salesmen.
---
You can also bind abilities to mouse wheel up/down (I have Life Tap bound to mousewheel down)
---
Good suggestions, although many of them are incredibly crowded.
---
Luna and Dominos, it's what I use.
---
you mean how is destroying everyone and everything you come across? its wonderful. Until a rogue sneaks up on you...
---
The tier .5 quest line is one of most iconic from vanilla.  Expecting people to skip large chunks of content because the reward isnt absolutely optimal is just silly.
---
Say "my daughter is my little Horde" 5 times really fast
---
Fine.  Now equip it so I can inspect you and confirm.
---
Nice, I like your version of the talents. I got rid of vigor, youre right, its not really worth it.
---
Thanks dude
---
That’s exactly what I do when I’m running in groups
---
With phase 2 there will be world bosses. At this point it doesn't matter if it's a streamer server or not as most raiding guilds are going to go for the world bosses.
---
There’s a Shaman on Whitemane that has Hand of Rag too.
---
The point isn't the killing, it's the other raid showing up coincedentally, you tool
---
AWS and the like are designed entirely to handle spike in demands, that's the whole purpose. If you see an increase in resources required, you allocate more resources to it... Whether Blizzard are utilizing this is a different question and I'm not here to speculate.
---
I got  20 days /played on my shaman and my guild doesnt give me any enhance loot :)
---
I have seen people say it is no longer against the ToS but havent checked myself
---
I didn’t do it until I was level 50 lol. By that time I had every flight path I need unlocked, my mount, and astral recall/Hearth set to taurajo. Did the entire quest in one hour.

Typical Alliance driving in to Horde children

Ur atking a mob near a node or a chest and ur not done, its mine cause you aint looting it, its fair game.
---
It is.. not ;\^)
---
I've placed multiple tickets in game throughout the years. It is definitely not an issue. Is it 100% perfect no, but in my experience no ticket system ever is.
---
Its hard to come up with different replies when youre generic
---
I think y'all should come to an agreement on it before hand, if you're at end game. BoEs before 40 are not important
---
That would be Durotan's crotch
---
Can you even complain about boomers in a subreddit for a 15 year old game
---
Or pinecones and LIGHTNING BOLT
---
Not entirely. The lockbox/chest contains loot that everyone should have a chance at, but I make sure to tip my rogues!
---
Yeah I can see it thanks, its a nice build but not going into the assasination tree isnt something I want to do, I like ass :3
---
Stop buying spells! (Not joking)
---
Stop buying professions! (Not joking)
---
Stop dying! (Joking)
---
By this time I had roughly 60 gold, I was super under powered. I got all my gold before I hit 41, it’s been a rough road.
---
You can level prot just fine if you want to, so long as you're getting 98% of your exp from dungeons.
---
Our first 60 in the guild was prot warrior from level 10 and all he did was dungeons. When you're a tank you get dungeons whenever you want and that's some good exp.
---
I went prot around level 35 and I haven't regretted it, tanking is easier too.
---
Aimed shot is not subject to knockback.
---
Yeahhhh, I kept my old vanilla macros in a text file and a few don't work because they were deprecated in this retail macro version.
---
Mouseover did exist though, I had several poly/cs/tidal charm/etc. mouseover macros back in Vanilla.
---
Most greens aren't even worth auctioning.
---
Tell that to the BSF drops :D
---
Oh man lmao
---
Are you using twitch app to watch it?
---
If you're  trying to do a full Emp Run, I'd say 57-58. If you're just farming the first half, you can do that at like 52-53
---
Alright go back to retail, we wont miss you
---
Lol why would you have to do a re-roll. He only said that because he lost. You know if he won he would not call for a "manual roll".
---
You could ask a guild member or two to spot you
---
Assuming esfand
---
That's because that would be being a ninja....
---
Saw a timeline can't confirm but p2 was around 12/10. They matched up vanilla dates and times with current. It'll be ok that we don't have information, blizzcon is coming up.
---
which layer? FTFY
---
That's the risk you run transfering stuff through the NAH.  Your risk management is terrible.  You lost your test mats and still proceeded to continue.
---
I understand the need to want an item early, but you still gotta be smart.  If the crafter was willing to work with you, set up a different time or with different characters (friends).  Or just be patient and wait for the pattern to become available on your side.
---
... needing a piece of gear that you will wear for 10 levels before it vendors for 1g meanwhile could likely buy your lvl 40 mount. 
---
Again if no rules were set my entire group needs every time. No one has an issue with it. It’s not like I’m the only one who needs the drop lol, before I need I say everyone need and literally everyone needs. Shelf yourself.
---
I have noticed a bug with ranged attscks sometimes, where the will take significantly longer than usual to go off.
---
I have also had aimed shot bug and stay "casting" infinitely until you cancel it and recast.
---
It's not implied.  It's how need/greed/pass is meant to be used.  Just look at BoPs.  You all change your ideals on the system when it comes to BoE because money.  Plain and simple.
---
End of the day, I'm watching the rolls and deciding what I want to do based on what I see.  If the group sticks to a true need/greed/pass, I will too.  If not, then need it is.
---
Why is it moral? He could have just bought the thing for the same price you sell it for. How is it immoral to not give people free crap that you would benefit from equally as much?
---
ooh thanks for the site! Says Natur not updated damn it was the best :&lt; Any other enemy cast bar like that people are using ?
---
I've done 100 runs for my buddies ironfoe and we have never seen. Brd has killed me inside.
---
What are people supposed to do when they see these bsby/dog in car stickers? Honk? Drive up next to them and wave?
---
You’re allowed to have your opinion just don’t wonder why people don’t want to play with you
---
An alternate option would have the need button automatically disabled for BoEs.  This could even be a settable threashold.  Greed only purples or greed only blues, etc.
---
You asked for a solution that is my solution. It will carry you till Post ZF when tanking is back to a thing.
---
... y'know, you make a good point there.
---
Yeah if you do blizzard aoe do NOT take frostbite ever.
---
If a righteous orb drops, what is the default? People who can craft with it get priority, right? 
---
Nope. Everyone rolls. Because everyone recognizes that the gold value makes it worth the same to every player. 
---
Or if you have two enchanters, and one wants the orb to enchant a piece of their gear (making them stronger just like a piece of gear) and one who wants the orb to enchant others, does the first enchanter get priority on all orbs? 
---
If you act this way in groups (everyone roll on boe items, they are worth the same to everyone) you absolutely aren’t breaching community standards. 
---
Needing after everyone greeds is ninjaing, but needing and then offering to allow those who didn’t need to roll isn’t and won’t be viewed as such.
---
Good, stick with your guild, one less problem
---
Well, he does have a point. Who doesn't need gold?
---
I explained to the guy above why item locking is bad. Yes the other melees didn't have to join if it is advertised as a locked run. 
---
Just trying to give a perspective that locking in general is bad, since everyone in that group worked for it
---
I would probably have ~35 if I didn't buy spells and the next level of skinning
---
You are behind where you should be to get it right at 40, but who cares? It isn't worth it to spend extra time farming gold (instead of leveling), since the purpose of buying the mount early is to save time.
---
What's pre-raid BiS from there?
---
Mana totems are the juice unless you're being lazy on resist gear in MC
---
Free action too
---
From everything I've seen it seems skinning is better than blacksmithing even with being able to craft my stuff. Skinning is just a lot of income while leveling. Idk what to do rly.
---
This is why I put emphasis on the technical aspect of the auction house itself and how it works. On the surface, yes, I put something up, and the wrong person bought it. The importance is HOW that other person bought it, which is where the TOS breaking comes in. In which case this can be reverted.
---
I personally have an attention span greater than that of a newt &amp; enjoyed the read.
---
Voidwalker is a waste of a pet for leveling outside of a few situations. Use Imp or Succubus.
---
Yes if you strawman my comment then that is the conclusion you would take. Or you could react to the spirit of the comment, which is that people should stop and smell the roses instead of robotically speedrunning the dungeon on one unchanging path every time.
---
As long as everyone knows to need on boe then it’s fine. If you have unfair advantage well then...
---
I've done all the quests before so I'm not too worried about exploration - I've already seen it all. I am planning to do them all again but I'm going to go back and do it at 60 when I have my epic mount. I leave a zone when there are no more quests that are yellow to me that I can complete in a reasonable time. Sometimes this means I'll come back in a few levels to complete quests that were previously too difficult to be worth it.
---
I changed left and right strafe (Q and E default) to A and D cause I don't really have a need to turn my character since I can do that with my mouse, and then that frees up Q and E for abilities to give you a couple easy keys to hit.
---
As opposed to what..... level 1 epics? Blues? Are there even level 1 greens?
---
Tip: design your costume so you won't have parts falling off while running on fours or something like that.
---
Knee-high robes may give almost the same look while being a lot less trip-hazardy.
---
Consider handing out cans of blue soda and yelling INNERVATE. And carry a pouch with 5 very precious but otherwise plain acorns, then complain about how ridiculously expensive they are.
---
Maybe hide behind an obviously too thin pole and tell people you're Shadowmelded.
---
Maybe order 50 Mark of the Wild icon stickers and hand them out. YOU GET MARK OF THE WILD! AND YOU GET MARK OF THE WILD! ERRYBODY GETS MARK OF THE WILD!
---
Hell I’ve ranked as Arms all the way to 60. 2h tanking all the way up to ST. 
---
I’d still say Arms for preBiS grinding until your first raid. Sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind is just too good for AoE threat.
---
The gold value that this rule kicks in at is when the opportunity cost for all parties is nearly identical. If when leveling a mediocre green drops that is better than what someone has, let him need. However if that green is the rare +healing wand everyone should need.
---
Mediocre greens are mostly vendor trash that aren't even worth walking to the AH to sell, so they don't apply.
---
Well this is my new headcanon.
---
Are you seriously asking if there is a difference between 5 different people versus 1 person imputing commands into 5 accounts simultaneously?
---
So edgy
---
Please do this so that you can be kicked from party and nobody will have to play with someone so retarded
---
This. Wait for Phase 2 release day, then sell when demand is highest.
---
Same but I have seen it a lot in the fightclub docs :D
---
thats not what I am saying at all. If I roll greed its "This item is not needed by my character but I would still like the loot because I can sell it and make gold which is useful" 
---
needing it would be "Wow I have not had an item upgrade in that slot for a bit and those stats would increase my characters performance in all content -I need it to increase my stats" 
---
Im even OK if you can;t equip but itll be an upgrade very soon (youre lvl 22 roll need on a 24 item that will be an upgrade - fine). but if youre jsut going to sell it and not use it - Greed roll. its why it exsits. If you didnt care about the loot at all you could just pass on it.
---
Rated PG-13
---
There’s a plethora on my server’s neutral AH for around 2g
---
Streamer culture hampers everything.
---
first u have to watch these streamers make more money than doctors just sitting there playing the game then they get fed everything in the game.
---
makes a lot of people mad I think
---
I'd rather die than use reddit on desktop.
---
Because you press need when you're gonna wear it.
---
Man I’ve been questing in Azshara and didn’t even see this.  The whole zone has this lovecraftian vibe to it.  Something feels “off” about it, wrongness.  Love it.
---
Buddy try rune cloth
---
Yup maxed all professions, but I also spend a lot of time helping guildies with lowbie dungeons as I only level with my girlfriend, so if she's at work then I just occupy myself other ways
---
Hey guys thanks for clearing all of these mobs I couldn't get here without you.  Now imma just take this loot. 
---
Seriously if you can't get there by yourself you aren't solely entitled to that loot.
---
Then those people are stupid. Vanilla/classic isn't hard by today's standards, it's just waay more grindy, slow paced and unforgiving. These things along with the lack of the community breaking stuff added over time makes for a game with a very different vibe. But not harder.
---
I would say give it a try for 20 levels or so (it doesn't take that long, I did it on a weekend day) and see how you feel about it. Having a pet to tank for you really does help a lot. The macro was something I did because pets don't automatically attack when you start auto-shot like they do in retail, and figured since I was already starting a macro, I'd up my attack power a little by using Mark on each target. It can be a mana drain though.
---
A lot of the reason why people like classic so much is because it brought back the RPG elements to the game. Hunters have had a lot of QoL improvements over the years; ammo removal, pet auto-attack, automatically learning pet skills, dead zone removal, shooting while moving, etc. and this version of the game brought back the things you had to manage to remain successful, in addition to the other stuff everyone has to manage (gold is a big one) and so it's a unique class with strengths in solo combat, but also unique challenges and approach to the game.
---
How does that greed definition support your argument? All that says is that greed means you want something. If you need something you also want it and by that definition are greedy.
---
Someone was selling that for 10g yesterday in my server..
---
Always need on rare items so you can counter ninjas. If no one rolls need, have them re-roll.
---
I also model edited back in the day, but there was recently a pretty big ban wave for model editing. [Relevant blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-to-recent-suspensions/161149)
---
Cleft of Shadows is not a cave.  It’s got no ceiling.
---
Played since vanilla and never did need on all BoE's. This mainly applies to PUGs, but in the situation where you need and everyone else greeds, you are the dickhole. If that happened then it would be kick you out of group or leave group and find a new one or just play with people you know/guildies.
---
Thanks for explaining.
---
Another question: what about Holy Shield and it's mitigation and threat for high lvl dungeons? 
---
For example take 5 in 1h spec and get holy shield
---
Haven't seen a single person actually refute why gold from selling a BoE wouldn't be equal to the BoE upgrade that drops. People have said they disagree, but no one has actually said why the gold to buy their own equivalent upgrade is somehow a less valid use of the item. It's unfair to just call people assholes without engaging with their logic.
---
I know, but when the census says "English" and a bunch of other languages, usually English means English (UK).
---
Kinky
---
Everyone in my old guild had the tier sets, too. There was no mention of BiS
---
I didn't bother doing the quest till I was around 30. Ended up escorting other shamans that didn't know where to go, how to start the fight, etc.  It was like some kind of extra violent school field trip.
---
Always travel and jump between zones, it's more fun relaxing, and definitely how the game is designed its "go here and there and then come back" quests.
---
Are they really that upsetting? I’ve seen a few in town just hanging out but have never had any gameplay interaction with them at all.
---
Every group I'm in we will need rolls blues and epics for just that reason
---
Yes but layering will be gone by then and I’m starting to think that could be the issue here.
---
I don't know why everyone is downvoting you, you're just acting according to your username
---
And here I thought it was being able to play.
---
Honestly it's probably a waste of money to just equip something you're going to replace in 10 to 15 levels. That's my opinion, but my whole point here is that people should communicate their desires before rolling for BoEs. Come to an agreement so everyone understands.
---
What is cheapest weapon glow that I can buy for my 2h Mace? (don't care if it's useful, just want the glow)
---
Not even slightly
---
I’m confused as hell as to how anyone can defend this.
---
I too lost my job for failing to meet the dress code and indecent exposure after showing up to work naked under my uniform.
---
i ran my lvl 80 palladin in there a few mos ago and got BOTH bindings of the windseeker to drop in his very first run.  i'm not saying it's any sort of skill to have good RNG. To this day he still has only that and 1 other clear for mats lol.  to get HoR crafted in 4 clears is astronomically more likely than my scenario.
---
For a BFD blue worth 2g if that? Why wouldn't you just give it to them? It's not edgemasters or something, who gives a shit?
---
What talents should I take then in this case? Thanks for the reply!
---
I like a more discipline build. Helps you just not be complete shit. Little more robust of a squishy too.
---
I read the pvp server lines in the voice of the hormone monster from big mouth. Made it really funny.
---
Weird recognising names from your server on reddit lmao. Mirage Raceway reppin'
---
Ah it's a good thing you're not a crazy cardiologist.
---
Yeah it really butchered the game. That and welfare epics and the notion that everyone must be able to experience all the content of the game (after people moaned when statistics came out that only 1% of Vanilla players saw Naxx). 
---
TBC was the start of the slip (at least summoning stone PvP existed a bit, and Azeroth was still a no-fly zone so Karazhan world PvP was great), but Wrath was the true final evolution of WoW becoming a casual game. 
---
Honestly like so what if most people don't get to see an instance, it gives people a goal, something to aspire or fantasize about. When everything must be able to be experienced by everyone, your alienate the hardcore players. 
---
Sorry I'm ranting lol. /end rant
---
Someone sitting at any AH running any auction addon configured to snipe auctions would pick up your stuff.  This is not bannable.  You lost, move on.
---
Clearly I’m going to get shit on for this, but I hope you find some sort of resolution. Regardless of fault, you grinded your ass off for something you wanted, and some greasy asshole knowingly took it from you. I can never support that type of behavior, and shame on the rest of you for not being even a little empathetic.
---
But nobody is lying, the rules are entirely fair.
---
A coffee and a smoke is the best way to start a day (tobacco for me) why would I want to ruin that by doing a pug dungeon?  Tanking with randoms has almost made me quit the game twice so far :(
---
I'm currently leveling a 44 enhancement shaman. 
---
Is enhancement any good in dungeons and raids once I hit endgame or should I aim for a respecc before that?
---
Why would repeater software be illegal? It just sends the keystroke to multiple gameclients. 
---
Im fine with multiboxers. I dont know why people see them as scum of the earth. Yeah they will reck u in pvp just like any group would. But they cant do much in the game, gl getting into a raid etc.
---
Your own fault.  
---
TSM has been around for years, its not against any rules. 
---
And putting things on the AH makes it free for anyone to buy.  Cheaper or more expensive.
---
Yeah not learning abilities is such a big deal, especially as a warrior or classes that mainly use spells from 1 school (for example mage). Higher ranks of things like cleave/thunderclap/overpower/slam/rend/mocking blow are unnecessary and just saving that money to buy your mount first before ranking those up is a good idea.
---
.
---
I see a ton of BoEs on my server and have yet to hear or see someone blacklisted due to the possession of one.
---
6 hours? .....what?
---
You're always supposed to need blues and epics.
---
Sorry, not accurate unless there's only 4 inside and the 5th member dicking around in Undercity. "Be right there guys!"
---
What a waste of fucking time
---
You should've stuck to one class and played it so you'd be at least somewhat good with it now.
---
/r/HerodClassic
---
Maybe I misunderstood you. Or maybe you don't understand what it means what you are saying.
---
So you are saying there are 0 situations where BOE's are direct upgrades for someone that can last a few levels? Ok. Completely false but OK. 
---
Hey what are yall's in game names so I can not party with you ? lol
---
Except twink items
---
You arent giving up a large sum of gold - you are rolling for it correctly its not giving anything up.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxdIboxzVZxfzs
---
I would use this if you’re going to be tanking &gt;60% of your leveling time. 
---
Start with the 5 points in fury for the crit, then work your way down the Arms tree, until finally hitting the prot talents.
---
This spec allows you to solo out in the world, while still being able to be Tanky.
---
Depending on group, you should be able to tank with a 2h - do not dual wield until you get at least 6%ish hit, or severely out level the mob. Keep a 1h and a shield handy in case things aren’t going well with a 2h
---
Where in that comment do I say they were boting? No where..
---
And they fucked up the market because they are killing all of the opposing faction. Meaning the opposing faction cant get the pattern..because they are dead. 
---
Are you following along?
---
I understand what you're trying to say, but the logic doesn't really work that way. Again, you're trying to justify why it's okay for YOU to take something from another class, and the short answer is it's not. I'd be fine with everyone rolling Greed on Edgemaster's Handguards in one of my groups, and I'm a warrior, but if I was a DPS warrior? I'd be very upset, because odds are I'm not going to pay the 800g for the upgrade. Especially considering if you're TRULY that worried about min/maxing, Edgemaster's aren't BiS anyway, because you would have rolled a Human or an Orc. So anyone rolling need in that group would just be trying to steal from each other, and I'm not okay with that. 
---
Regardless of the value of the BoE, my point still stands, and you helped prove it right. Imagine farming for HoJ for 30 hours, and finally getting it. How much loot would you have won in the interim by rolling need? At a rough estimate I'd guess at least 10g an hour just from boss loot from Arena/Angerforge, that's not counting any other drops you get from trash. And that's just for one BiS item - if you followed this trend while farming all your BiS dungeon pieces, I have no idea how much money you'd make, but I'd wager you would have more than enough to buy all your BoE BiS. I'd question whether or not you'd find groups at the end, because your reputation would be in tatters, but it's fundamentally no different than what you're advocating, just spread out over a longer period of time rather than in one fell swoop. 
---
If you're trying to justify it by efficiency, it's more efficient to just roll need on everything. That's not a very fun way to play, and I for one would not group with players that believe that way.
---
You can get a pretty good dark night effect by playing with the brightness/contrast settings. Isn't it possible for an addon to automatically adjust them when night falls, and put them back in the morning?
---
Just got rava. Some herod gear and some plate there. Full arms with spec on axes. A dwarf
---
How does this have close to 1k upvotes?
---
You should have zero expectations of random strangers giving other random strangers giving up potentially hundreds of gold.
---
Ninja logic is for someone needing on BoPs or if loot is FFA taking all of the drops. Or saying “everyone roll greed” then they roll need.
---
Crybabies
---
this brings back memories of 3 full raid groups trying to down Azueregos in Classic. My guild and a horde guild were trading tags back and forth. Then all of a sudden another alliance guild allied to mine came in to help clean up the horde, allowing us to kill Azuregos. It was intense but it felt like a scene from LOTR.
---
Aaaaand I’m a Patron. Keep up the great work!
---
Yikes - Wellp hope we never party together. Enjoy classic &lt;3
---
I nEeD iT fOr GoLd To BuY bEetEr GeAr.
---
Not trying to be a dick, but why not play on a pve server if you have no interest in pvp below 60?
---
You can die during leveling, sure, that does not make the game hard. Know and play around the limitations of your class, it's not complicated.
---
If you think Retail raids are easier than Vanilla raids, you've simply got no clue what you're on about.
---
Also, your mage argument has got to be the worse of all of them, given that the Classic mage "rotation" is spamming frosbolt.
---
But hey, think what you wish, I am not arguing opinions here these are all simple facts.
---
I enjoyed this quest, you get to see the sites and utilize that fresh new ghost wolf form.
---
Cause its natural. You cant beat what players do naturally..
---
do you play a gnome warlock named Rofo for Alliance Herod??
---
&gt;I feel like if this isn't intended, then blizzard should just patch it.
---
Are you just ignorant?  You can call them lazy if you want, but even in the *early* days of vanilla I remember them dealing out punishment for people rooftop camping in Duskwood.  It's an abuse of mechanics to them if the guards can't reach you
---
Nice! Love seeing large scale world pvp; especially with no lag!
---
I was a little disappointed though; seeing the title and that you were in the badlands made me think "Oh sweet! They organized a faction fight at the searing gorge border to recreate the gates of Mordor!"
---
It's a Boe, which is sellable. So yes it's the same as giving up gold.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Nah, easy fix is never be the first one to greed/need if it is Blue/Epic unless you are okay with not getting it.
---
&gt; I don't like EVE so I could care less
---
If you think WoW pvp is tough of course you wouldn't like EVE lmao
---
&gt; The only downside in Minecraft to dying is that you lose your xp
---
Uhhh, you definitely drop everything your holding and permanently lose almost all your xp. Is the only kind of Minecraft you played were modpacks with a grave that drops upon death that permanently protects all your items? You never played vanilla??
---
You ~can~ permanently lose items even playing solo in Minecraft, and in Minecraft PvP forget it you always lose everything every time you get killed by someone.
---
Please, WoW pvp is literally the most pansy form of any pvp in any games. Stop trying to pretend it isn't lmao. There are mobile MMO's that are magnitudes more punishing when you get killed by someone.
---
Anyone who says this didn't play Vanilla. This is a private server thing. Thanks for trying.
---
Asmongold wasn’t around in 2007 when this was commonplace and I guess nobody else in this thread was either. Everyone here will bitch about ninja’s and continue to trust every random they group with. Almost nobody is going to equip an epic BoE worth ~500g.
---
It's because of money.
---
It wasn't allowed on private servers because it was cancerous to have to deal with. Servers like Nost cared about integrety. You were not allowed to have more than 1 character logged in at any one time. If you did, they both had to be in a capital city.
---
This was to prevent people from using different accounts to farm herbs/mines while doing other stuff on their main. For example, in Classic WoW you'll be able to both farm gold and rank at the same time. Wasn't possible on Nost. You had to commit, etc.
---
Many more examples.. such as using alts to scout with and so on.
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with streaming or idolizing anybody.
---
That dude literally rushed to say "HE CAN BEAT YOU!" That's idolizing.
---
It wasn't, no. Sulfuras was never a popularity contest with people feeding it to you. You have literally no idea what you're talking about and ignoring stuff like the dude above straight up fanboying.
---
The stat weights float based on fight length. Shorter fights (which most fights are at this point) value large int pools and less regen. The last tab of that spreadsheet has an adjustment for fight length and as time increases, relative order of items swaps around.
---
Then undercut it by a bit and still earn hundreds. Why do I even  need to explain this?
---
&gt; So you are saying there are 0 situations where BOE's are direct upgrades for someone that can last a few levels? 
---
No, I'm saying that despite it being a direct upgrade for you, winning it is nothing more than winning a sack of gold.
---
&gt;This is preschool level economics to be honest. It's not high level shit. The problem comes from entitled players (notice you say "my item"). It's not your item. It's gold.
---
It's my item if it drops for me. Yours is it drops for you. If there are two people who can use it, you then roll for it. I consider the drop to be the RNG where everyone "rolled" ( had a chance at loot dropping). Now that it's dropped, those who can use it won the roll. I don't think we need an additional roll for everyone just because you're mad nothing dropped for you. 
---
Again, I'm not treating the game as an economics simulator. I'm playing the game.
---
Thank you. This was NOT done when I played vanilla. and hubby and I were there for launch through Wrath. You Need if you are going to equip and use the item, Greed if you were going to sell it. Period. WTF are these guys talking about?
---
Hmm would avoid playing with everyone that doesn't understand need/greed. Very selfish and you would be blacklisted for me too.
---
Oh you are amazing.  Thank you so much!   I'm trying that tonight!
---
That is an anecdote. When I played on both retail vanilla and private servers everyone needed BoE. In researching the WoW forums I believe this attitude changed mostly during Wrath+.
---
 My anecdote outweighs your anecdote. /s
---
&gt; . I am saving money for a different item. Professions. Mount. I owe someone money. Any money problem in the entire game.
---
So basically you're "needing" because you want money. Got it.
---
How is this different from anybody else needing on it because they want money?
---
If the gold you get from selling an item you can't use will buy your BIS, then you need that item. That is why you press need. The Greed button is for people who have everything and has more gold then they know what to do with. Which is literally no one.
---
Good god classic is my first time rolling a shaman. Whoever made the water totem quest line must have found out their spouse was cheating on them that day.
---
So am I.
---
Like they said:
---
&gt; Those who press need and those who are naive.
---
I didn't know he was sitting before opening the video.
---
Yeah I remember seeing 10% and even from a rational standpoint that seemed way too fucking high when you compare it to items like HoJ.  I figure it'd be in the 5% range *at best*
---
You didn't even read the post
---
&gt; Are you just ignorant?
---
Yes? That's why I started a discussion?
---
If a game has a bug that is unintended, it makes complete sense to patch it. Obviously that's not always easy to do, but these bugs are very very arbitrary. Who's to say where the guard lease range should exist and shouldn't?
---
Roofs is obviously dumb and shouldn't be abused, but behind banks, or behind fences... it gets muddier and muddier. What about on a road where a guard can't go around a tree? There could be countless areas that "aren't intended" but the player just magically needs to know.
---
Awesome!
---
it only takes an hour or two with some smart hearth stoning.   
---
Don't let it put you off !
---
Thank you for the correction :-) much appreciated! I hope you have a wonderful day . . . Happy Friday-eve!!!
---
Add-ons that are made dedicated to classic.
---
Nope was a warrior who was the first to say everyone just need on it
---
i know that its not a real stun and i knew that it breaks trough damage. i put my pet off him and let the dot wear off before i used the scatter shot. but it infuriates me that that enemy char is wandering around aimlessly for the full four seconds while im casting this so said 3 second cast time ability and even after that he can shoot me and kill me before my aimed shot has even left my bow. aimed shot is not even affected by the damage knockback so it makes no sense. this also happens really often which infuriates me even more.
---
There are pleanty of guides out there, especially from private servers, and you choose the one site that just chonks your computer?
---
I agree the smart thing to do is WAIT. Then type 'everyone need' in the chat if that's how you wanna do it/don't trust the group.
---
I'm not sure if you can read, or if you have no idea what you're talking about. But there is much more than just raiding.
---
No it's not.
---
Can we stop having these threads? Obviously nobody is gonna change their mind at this point.
---
Part of this sub thinks it's ninjaing against the guy that can effectively equip it, other part thinks it's fair that everyone gets a shot at a couple hundred golds, and that's that.
---
I did it around 56 without much issue. As a caster it sucks because you won't be able to do much damage to Emp for another \~2 levels.
---
“Resolution” doesn’t mean restitution. Even if blizz doesn’t help him out, maybe other players will see his plight and help him. Who knows
---
how long did it take? I mean in retail, we could do Mythic 10 in shit gear but it took 3 hours lol
---
Depends on what you are. I played as a rogue in vanilla like this using my left hand exclusively for movement, targeting, and camera control, while my right hand was almost exclusively used for combat. I bound my main skills to the arrow keys and numberpad, and made heavy use of the right hand control. Mouse will still be needed for quick turn arounds, so it is good to have your meat and potatoes skills bound to your mouse at some capacity. I also had some command that made it so I could do a 180° aboutface easily, and I used that quite a bit. I got a lot of shit for this, but managed to play that way until I quit in cata, raiding competitively the entire time, and even getting gladiator status in 3 of the first 4 seasons in BC.
---
I would say don't try it if you are playing someone who ranges a lot, but it can work fine for melee.
---
it has been like that in-game for me as well! though I've only seen some 4-5 blue BoE drops and no epics.
---
Please elaborate, rather than just writing a meaningless comment.
---
Fuck knows fam
---
Is that why I see health pools dropping?  Nah they were ambushed and then overran.
---
Dang ZF until 51? I did it last night at 48 and got like 4 bars for the run
---
Yep because I certainly said everyone.
---
Yeah.......Not one single person here believes you.
---
I agree. But we dont think someone trying to take advantage of naive or nice people isnt?
---
Clearly it is. Greeds icon is literally gold. If you want it for gold, you roll greed. Like ANY sane human being.
---
Kind of annoying I guess but who really cares? You just avoid going to the bank for a little while. Not really what I would call “cheating”, since there isn’t really much benefit.
---
You can grief someone alot worse out in the open world by camping them, the walk to gadget from the GY is like 30 seconds.
---
you should listen to this wise man, my friend. I'd always been on pvp servers during vanilla, tbc and wotlk before I quit wow at cata.
---
This time around, I rolled PVE ... Game is already frustrating anough at times, with ultra low spawn rates of mobs on some quests causing congestion and having 20 players waiting for each spawn, you end up having to give up quest or spend 2 hours to kill your 10 murlocs.
---
Getting ganked on top of that, no thanks.
---
World pvp is NEVER fair, the one opening the fight is 99% of the time doing it because he has an advantage : you're ultra low health, you're alone and he is 5 persons, he's higher level, or simply your class is no match for his (remember wow 1v1 pvp is rock paper scissors), so it's only going to be fun to you if you like being one of those, and it's still going to stink when you're on the wrong end of the slope, so you got to REALLY like unfairly killing people or else it's just not worth it.
---
Reroll pve. 36 levels can be done in under 2 weeks, being casual about it, if you're focused during your actual online time
---
Fun stuff but I use Linux kek
---
Nice.
---
DAOC was amazing, but flawless it wasn't.  Relic raids were a shitshow.  It did get  LOT better after frontiers though (the smoothness, not gameplay).
---
If that was the case then it should apply to more classes than just rogues, no?
---
&gt; Except that's not what he is saying, because vendoring an item does not nearly give the same upgrade as for someone who can equip it.
---
&gt; Say that Edgemaster's drop and you have a warrior in the party. That's a goddamn sweet upgrade for him. But if a mage needs it, and then sells it for 400+ gold, then that's also a goddamn sweet upgrade for him in terms of the items he will buy with that gold. Without having a specified loot system, I think that is justified.
---
So, someone that has every BiS item, isn't allowed to roll on the BoE epics then? Because he can't use that gold for an upgrade. What if there are no BoE items that would be an upgrade? What if I'm a tank doing dungeons to earn money for example? 
---
&gt;
---
Will listen thanks.
---
Because selling it for gold is the definition of greed. That is why the symbol is a piece of gold. 
---
You don't need the money, you want the money. 
---
People in the group may need this piece of equipment and you are limiting their chances of obtaining it. Why party with someone who is intent on taking something that is an upgrade for me or a friend?
---
I'm the (current, most of the content was done by Krug before I chimed in last week) writer of the guide in question. 
---
Thanks for the great feedback! Wasn't completely sure if I had written that you should frontload your damage on the pull and finish enemies off with your melee attacks in order to let your Mana regenerate as much as possible (also, about avoiding refreshing Lightning Shield outside these burst windows because it breaks the 5s rule). Will add it tonight, cheers!
---
I'm gonna demand some proof for that one.
---
I think Classic + is what has my interest, as long as it went down the path of how Runescape did it, where the community gets to vote.
---
First time I've seen it used.
---
Yep you still can! It actually doesn’t even require wallwalking.
---
Aren't Trolls and Elves related, too? It fits so well. :P
---
Multiboxing instances in general is slower than 5 people doing it because there is only 1 brain behind everything. For instance i usually stop to loot between pulls when a normal group would be doing it all seamlessly.
---
You didn’t realize that the tournament being put on by streamers would have streamers playing in it?
---
Fair enough
---
BS needs arcanite keys to open the highest level chest.
---
No fucking way am I wasting my arcanite bars on that shit lol
---
Most BfA addons work for Classic. None of the 1.12 ones do.
---
Yeah dude suggestions are missing some vital info and many of them extremely crowded. Demon farm is duo farming elites for the cloth, runes and also for Eye of the Shadow. You go with a hunter since they buy Demonslayer and enchant it, which gives a huge boost against demons. They need it for their MC bow quest anyway.
---
I never took holy shield (would have hurt my raid healing more than I am comfortable with) but the general consensus is that it is not a great ability for a number of reasons.  
---
1) It costs a lot of mana.  
---
2) It has limited charges so in an AOE situation it dissapears very quickly for little benefit.  
---
3) It is not guaranteed to block so in single target situations, especially against slow hitting targets, it will often not block or not block for all its charges, meaning you do not get the threat or mitigation return for the mana spent.  
---
4) Getting that high in the prot tree forces you to give up good talents that can help you be a better hybrid.  
---
For a full raid prot paladin it is a requirement, but you're not realistically going to main tank raids as a prot paladin. For dungeons, it doesnt really provide any significant benefit....or at least not something you need.
---
It's just...meh.
---
Warlocks can't even use maces.
---
I agree, just because someone can pay 5 subs they shouldn't get to play all accounts AT ONCE. But people will defend this bullshit to the death so it's a lost cause man.
---
Literally every group I've been in has needed on BOE drops, what you do with it doesn't matter, it's a chance for gold for everyone. Doesn't matter if it's an upgrade or not, sell it or wear it. Definitely need BOEs and this doesn't happen.
---
You'd need to install it on your PC as well as your phone, so you're stuck until you get home.
---
What on earth were all those Horde doing there? lol
---
Time to start needing on BOP objects you don't need to! Same gold value boys!
---
I need specifically to counter assholes like you, so I can make sure it gets rolled on and goes to someone who is actually going to use the item rather than sell it on the AH like a collossal dip shit.
---
Warrior is unstable killing machine and rogue isn't?
---
Literally no one in this chain including me said "everyone" you seem a little defensive my guy
---
If you're farming for twink items then you're most likely doing it as a lvl 60 which means you don't need to worry about ninjas.
---
I tried to do this to Ally, but they right clicked it off and /no at me :( so i just killed him instead.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/smallindiecompany] [\[r\/classicwow\] \[Streamer\] CDew gets Hand of Ragnaros in preparation for an upcoming duel tournament. This is his first swing](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallindiecompany/comments/dcres8/rclassicwow_streamer_cdew_gets_hand_of_ragnaros/)

---
Yes, eventually it will respawn in the same spot once the timer expires. However, if there is currently one up in another spot (in the same zone), it won't spawn until there are no Black Lotuses up in that zone.
---
Thanks, that's encouraging. I figured that I would have to do a *little* bit of grinding to get it, and that's okay. Buying spells is the devil though.
---
Assumptions are sometimes warranted.
---
Supply and demand man, this item will literally last you through *all* of vanilla.  Given how few sinks there are in the game anyway, it sucks but it does make sense
---
I can't recommend one, but there should be addons that do just this.
---
&gt; because they have equal value to everyone.
---
That is *not* market value. That is individual value. He doesn't understand basic economics and thinks that stealing 5 to 20 gold from a group member is fine, but stealing 90 gold is somehow not. As if the magnitude of the theft means that it's no longer theft.
---
Nope your Tauren can ride it!
---
Why are they worth anything if people don't need them?
---
Could you elaborate on how the client affects the server response time?
---
Rich Thorium Veins? You mean Poor Thorium Veins, I have probably farmed 20 of these mofos so far and only two of them have dropped more than two ores and a gem.
---
That little frozen lake outside of ironforge? Flat open space
---
Cool, rogue, you go ahead and use your class feature to solo loot a chest in a dungeon you needed four other people to reach. When we get to that boss that drops that sick ass dagger you want, we'll be sure to all GG and hearth out cause clearly you can handle this all by yourself.
---
It's simple : If you're in a group, you are contributing to that group's well being and loot. Just the same as the mage polymorphing the mob running after you. Or all the buffs you get from Druids/Mages/Priests. Or that beefy tank taking all the hits for you, etc ... Otherwise, we can just replace you with another dps that has more group utility.
---
To say that PvE servers feel like a single player game is complete horseshit
---
Alliance dominate us in STV on Kromcrush if you wanted to be with your people.
---
I had a friend say he saw stat page that showed Kromcrush as 50/50, but im not fully sure it's accurate.
---
I play on Skeram, a US East server. 
---
Pros: Everyone speaks English \[well, American...\]
---
Cons: Raid timings can be awkward.
---
I love playing a Druid - I too picked a Druid up because they seemed extremely versatile and fun. I primarily heal so I’ve been leveling up as Resto - most people will suggest leveling up as Feral for an easier time but I haven’t had too much trouble as of yet following a Resto build. 
---
Like other people have said, you can pretty much play any role you want to play as a Druid, but you won’t be the master at any of them. 
---
They’re definitely viable as tanks or off tanks, OK-ish at DPS (you won’t be topping damage charts), and great healers. The only down side is the lack of a rez, as you only have one Rez every 30 minutes, so sometimes you won’t get invited to a group for that reason.
---
Back your opinion up with data please. Here's mine.  
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15heFli2p4yjWeOVR8VtLPM9jIKRlBwlYcjC4BH6gOzw/htmlview#gid=842610744](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15heFli2p4yjWeOVR8VtLPM9jIKRlBwlYcjC4BH6gOzw/htmlview#gid=842610744)
---
That is not the answer I wanted to hear! :P anyway what's a good Android client? Remote chrome or remote desktop?
---
You guys can argue all you want but the thing is it's called prisoner's dilemma because there is no definitive answer. Sure it has more of a flavor this time around but it's still a question that everyone will answer however they feel in the moment. 
---
Now as for the argument, it's misplaced in this case and it's gonna go on forever. Our answer will be Need. I do not make a distinction between upgrading from trades and upgrading from world drops. There is no way you'll convince me they're 2 different things. I believe that if the process (character loots an item) and the outcome of it (character equips an item better than it had before) are one and the same, then a distinction is purely a perception issue.
---
Furthermore, the easiest way to settle this argument is to announce loot rules beforehand, which, while it sounds nice and honorable, *cannot be enforced*. So my only logical conclusion is - if it gets everyone an upgrade (or a mount, or a profession to 300, whatever goal they might be working towards), then everyone will partake in a fair 1/X roll that cannot be fooled in any way, the winner will be congratulated and the party moves on with their dungeon or quest.
---
I think this is fair, prevents theft and reddit posts like this one, and makes BoE items into something everyone can be happy about when they drop. That said you're welcome to set any loot rules you want as long as you're playing with people that trust each other, and you. And while I might respect you as a fellow player when we randomly meet to do a dungeon, I do not have to trust you, and if you trust me then that's on you.
---
Some are though, like Truefaith Vestaments recipe.
---
this is getting downvoted because it isnt against the rules and never been
---
Download a click to heal addon like clique or healbot and then sort the frames however you want it will alert you when someone has a debuff and you can click their frame to remove it without having to target them and then use your spell.
---
Came here to see this comment.
---
The only ToS violation is you communicating with a member of the opposite faction.
---
I also play on a pve sever, not because I hate stuff like this. I hate getting destroyed on the road by someone 10+ levels. But I have such fun when I see flagged things. There was a pally yesterday messing with a Druid 6 levels below him. Idk what the context was prior to me running by. But he just kept healing himself and laughing at the Druid who had no mana at that point. So I aimed shot him, which crit, then used a combination of an iron grenade, and scatter shot to kill him before he could bubble. The Druid was super happy about it. Idk it’s just fun to engage in same level pvp. But again, getting destroyed by someone who has no business in the zone ruins it for me
---
It's called an analogy. You have missed the point.
---
If you value the item more then the gold, go buy it on the AH.
---
Had a skull hunter running around hillsbrad the other day killing everyone for no reason. Danan, you little bitch I won’t forget.
---
It’s like being star struck without the star ⭐️. 
---
You’re just struck
---
My name in game is Toox 😄
---
Exploiting may be fun for you, but it it's a bannable offense.
---
if everyone follows this rule then no one hits anything. If everyone hits need then the winner can decide where it goes.
---
You know, that makes sense. I always wondered, it's not like I was planning on crashing into them but seeing the sticker, think, oh, maybe I shouldn't do that!
---
The irony is this is how you come across to everyone else. You actually care about this Reddit post enough to make negative comments and try to bring down the enjoyment it gave to everyone watching it. You are pretty clearly projecting your own life scenario onto other people right now. Take your own advice child. It’s a game, treat it like one, have fun. No one cares about skill in the real world unless WoW is your world.
---
Even if I am not going to use it?
---
Yeah I've even seen people do this with green items (especially on 2 handed weapons that sell for a lot to a vendor)... lol
---
I'm currency relocating from Europe to the US, so I started on an NA server. It's glorious, all the popular spots are empty. Grouping is a little tough but you'd be surprised how many people want to run instances at 6am server time.
---
My SO found a couple Recipe:Savory Deviate Delights on our second day of playing, like two hours apart... I was so mad. I’ve never found those before in all my years of WoW. 
---
They gave one recipe to me though, so from early levels I was cookin and slangin them delights. Bankrolled ‘em some upgrades, skills, and big bags for their luck ;3
---
I have ShowMeMyHeal.
---
These have been some of the coolest pieces of fan art I've ever seen. I've been using the RFC one as my lock screen and now I have one for my phone background. You rock!
---
Or Thorium Point. Although I've not played PvP before so maybe it's different
---
Good lord the clicking

---
Here is what I did and it isn't min max.  The goal was the get shadow burn ASAP then be in SM/Ruin spec for raids at 60 with zero respecs.  I put 6 points in affliction for instant corruption and 2% hit.  I put 12 points in destroy for shadowburn + succubus lash of pain cooldown.  I put 30 in affliction maxing out fel concentration and going 3/4 imp CoE, 3/5 suppression, 2/2 imp life tap and the rest of the later talents seem obvious.  I then grabbed the AOE interruption in destruction and picked up 3 yard extra range on destruction spells + Ruin at level 60.
---
Same guy did the same thing to me the other day, died a few seconds later from 5 shadow word: pains.
---
It most definitely is.
---
\[citation needed\]
---
Username is appropriate. I forgot that all BoEs were just endlessly sold on AH because they're not for equipping.
---
I have presented that argument. Multiple times. Stat upgrade. Its not more or less an upgrade than a BOP other than the ONLY way to get a BOP item is to run the dungeon. And the reason for that has nothing to do with selling and buying items it has everything to do with gatekeeping content becuase if you could just buy the best BOP weapon in the game off the AH someone who never raided or touched high elvel content could just slowly save gold and have the best shit in the game which would be completely fucking stupid.
---
0 to do with the logic behind a need greed system. if THAT were the intent then why not have the system ONLY show on a BOP item since all other items are auto-need by your standard. But thats not how its done. 
---
why have a need and greed option at all other than BOP if you are supposed to need on anything that isnt BOP?
---
I enjoy world PVP which is why I took the imp LOH and Reckoning. Played around last night with it and felt impossible to kill though damage is struggling. With my war friend it was too easy. Did ST as my first tank attempt since vanilla as war and I have to say it was soo much fun and very satisfying. I'm definitely lacking not having holy shield but it feels like as long as the rest of the group is pulling their weight I shouldn't have any issues.
---
We don't know yet, anyone who tells you differently is full of shit.
---
well as the intention yeah. Otherwise why bother putting two buttons and not just have it roll automatically?
---
In practice with a bunch of randoms however...
---
41 forsaken warlock.

I feel like I am wasting a tremendous amount of time chasing down quests - I go to a new zone, do the 2-3 quests offered at the hub and then I run out. It seems like I have to travel for huge chunks of time just to pick up quests and it's really inefficient. Would it be a good idea to just hunker down and grind? I honestly don't mind grinding, it's pretty easy slapping two dots on a mob and drain it to death, just want to be efficiently spending my limited time.
---
I rage quit the Karnitol quest a couple days ago. Not enough spawns to continuously grind them and swimming is so annoying. Not worth the trouble if it doesn't drop quickly.
---
I leave the zone for the next zone, when I've done all the quests that gives XP.  
---
If they ever put achievements back in the game, that is when I'll care about exploring the entire map.
---
As a rogue I am just happy to be running dungeons with all these spellcleave groups that only want mages and warlocks. So I have no problem opening boxes or chests for free.
---
Ninjas are Gold Spec
---
What are you on about, man? That's literally what need and greed are shorthand for. Hell, the greed button even has money on it. What do you think need and greed mean, so?
---
I’m thinking the same thing as everyone else. You did something risky and got burned and that sucks but it is what it is. And there are several snipping addons to achieve this, not illegal. 
---
What did catch my eye is that you started killing people to prevent their access to the NAH m just in case they might try for your stuff, and that kinda seems like a dick move to me. Sounds like they were probably there to do that but it would be ironic if they were there just swapping their own stuff but got mad about you killing them so decided to snipe your stuff haha. Probably not the case but it would be funny.
---
The pvp "community" hates a lot of things. If we banned shit they hated, everything would be banned. Y'all a bunch of whiney bitches who wants everything that beats you nerfed so you can win. "Paper is fine, nerf Rock plz - Scissors"
---
I forgot to flair, so yeah
---
Interesting spec there.  Might have to try that out myself.
---
There was this "class choosing helper" linked on this subreddit that I can't find anymore. You chose the aspects of the class you find important (PVP, PVE, healing, utility, ease of levelling..) and it suggested you classes based on that. Anyone have the link?
---
The hilarity of you calling him a liar. Only takes a few months at most to run into this problem at least once, let alone 15 years. You are either playing in a way very outside the norm, or more likely completely exaggerating and talking out of your ass.
---
Some gray quests chain into red quests, so check to see if a quest chains before abandoning it.
---
This is epic :D and now I want to play a warrior who can just charge and AOE :( dunno what even i can do as a priest in such massiv pvp battles...obviously its unreal to heal ur raid cause everyone is running somewhere in thie massacre, too far away
---
i'm not allowed near children... So no! I will not wipe them.
---
Tbf, the PvP community hates everything.
---
But multiboxing is a very minor portion of the population. Small enough and (more importantly) such low impact that it can be ignored by an overwhelming part of the community.
---
Still sounds like you're jealous.
---
Good thing it's his UI and not yours then, right?
---
I never said golem.
---
relevant in what way?  in terms of the odds calculated? it would matter if it was just the odds of beating someone by 1 then it would no longer be 1/5000 it would simply be 1/100 (aka the first number rolled doesn't matter at all and then you simply have to roll exactly 1 number.  It changes the odds by quite a bit
---
&gt; You guys can argue all you want but the thing is it's called prisoner's dilemma because there is no definitive answer.
---
Sure there is. But the ninjas obviously don't want to listen to it, otherwise they wouldn't be ninjas.
---
not the rude dude, care to share your theory?
---
Or if I truly feel it needs to go to a specific player I can hit need, then give that item to the person it should have gone to. I help protect the person from the ninja by hitting need.
---
Ya used to play it a lot, had pretty high rating and played competitively. Miss those times a lot, sad the game died
---
Ah, makes sense. You lack the self-reflection to even realize you are. That’s kinda sad :(
---
You are correct that there aren't many engi items above 260, I think reflectors are the only ones. So if you want those then level it up further, if not, then there's no reason to waste the gold.
---
Report language 
---
Report cheating
---
Double whammy
---
The dude has multiple rank ones and is a blizzcon champion so yeah, he could most likely beat you. Based on his achievements in wow he's factually better than the vast majority and, statistically, you are also in that majority. While that user probably does admire Cdew, nothing in his statement requires him to "excessively admire" him as your use of the word "idolizing" implies. Its just a matter of likelyhood. If you somehow still think that its idolizing, you are a moron. 
---
Yes, Sulfuras was a popularity contest, it always went to either the leadership of the guild or to the most popular/skilled member.  The eye was rarely rolled. At least on my server. Now, I did not ignore anything you wrote, I also do not watch Cdew and I doubt that I spend more than an hour on his stream since he started streaming. You should stop being so salty about someone getting an item, lol.
---
You miss my point entirely.
---
A competition like this is entirely dependent on gear.  Someone who shows up with greens/blues is unable to compete.  And it seems that people are either overlooking this or don't care.
---
There are no secrets in WoW PvP.  BiS is known.  Strategies are known.  This isn't just after a balance pass.  The match ups are known.  The win ratios are known.
---
Obviously, whomever signs up has BiS or close to it.  Because anyone who doesn't is automatically excluded by the tournament design.  That's my point.
---
This competition is more about who got their gear and was able to afford all the items than it is about raw skill and ability.  The rogue in quest greens might be able to take on anyone but because his playtime is limited, he has zero chance to compete.
---
This isn't a competition about skill.  It is a competition about skill between the 1%.  The analogue would be millionaires competing in a yacht race with a $1 million entry fee.  You must be this epic to play.
---
There is a reason that sports and actual esports ensure the playing field is level for all competitors.  And you get actual upsets where highly skilled newcomers and kids are able to beat top players.  This is just watching no lifers pretend they are the best.
---
I just got enough gold to afford one for my Druid. Waiting till I can get it for 300 or less
---
Community driven rules are a waste of time. 
---
If the chat doesn't specify loot rules, roll however the fuck you want.
---
It's repeatable... So you can just grind as many shellfish as you like, and get 55s per 5 you deliver. You can make like 8-10g/hr if you do it smart
---
I just bought my mount last night, two bars shy of 41. I dinged 40 with 73 gold, and just grinded mobs for a full level until I got to 90 gold.
---
And now I've got to grind some gold to afford my level 39-40 spells. And I've got to upgrade skinning past level 225. And I'm out of healing pots so I've got to buy some of those. And I really need to upgrade to runecloth bags, as my silk ones fill up pretty quick. Probably need to buy some gear upgrades as all my gear is low 30s greens. Also need one of those +20 fishing poles. And gotta get tailoring capped for my mage chest. And probably should start thinking about saving for my epic mount.
---
I mean shit I can see where you guys are coming from in your own logic but I think we just have a fundamental disagreement. I dont see us going anywhere here. you do you and ill do me and we will never group &lt;3 enjoy classic my friend
---
That IS an unpopular opinion. Movement speed is literally the most important stat in any game like this. Nothing is more powerful than mobility. It’s the thing I try to maximize as much as possible in games like this, Diablo, other MMOs, etc.
---
Took me longer than it should've (over an hour) but I eventually got MSBT to give me something very minimal.
---
In Europe, they use a comma in the same way we use a decimal point. 
---
So in the US, 61.46gold == 61,46gold in Europe
---
The monetary value of the item in the AH is very typically much less than the value of the item when equipped. As such, rolling greed when you want money (the very essence of the word "greed") and rolling need (when you need it to progress through the world) are very clear and distinct.
---
If you see a BoE that's clearly and absolutely better than your current item, don't you think that you'd need it for your character? What if a mage rolls 98 Need on plate shoulders that give 150 Str? That'd make me bitter if I were a warrior. I don't care if the mage intends to sell it... It's clearly a warrior item.
---
Hahaha imagine wanting to name your character hot dog, so much so that you're willing to put an X in there!
---
Then why is there a need/greed/pass system for BoEs?  By this logic, it should just be lot/pass.  Or the item should be automatically rolled and put into someone's bag.
---
I'd love to see us take the fight to the Scourge in Northrend -- but a classic wow styled Northrend. Redone without flying, Lfg, etc. They revamped some of the classic world for Cata.. They can do tbe same to Northrend for classic.
---
Hey blizzard would always implement automatic binding on needed BoE items. Would solve the problem in one sense, ninjas could only vender it then.
---
It also breaks sub rules, so delete it again
---
wow. Ok,now i need to install it! ty alot &lt;33  
---
cause i like to filter scum horde players and nice  horde players. :3
---
/assist tank
---
/cast Frostbolt
---

---
Bam. I just used a third party program.
---
&gt; i dont understand why people would skip leader of the pack for natures swiftness.
---
So that you can hybrid into healer.
---
It's very useful as an emergency heal, especially for PVP.
---
The point of the build is to be able to play any role in pve or pvp. you necessarily sacrifice somethings for that.
---
&gt;It’s not about precedent, it’s about accepting reality. Some people prefer to complain about an item being stolen from after the fact while others ~~prevent it from getting stolen in the first part~~ steal it first. 
---
FTFY
---
The best defense is an indiscriminate offense, right? /s
---
GM wasn't letting multiple people on his account, as the GM, I can assure you of that. Regardless we got Rag down and we're happy with it. 
---
Haters gonna hate!
---
Go farm wardens then not edgemasters lol that’s why they deserve it, bc that’s the item that dropped.
---
Well because it's subjective and many people would disagree with you, yes you should.
---
BoE are essentially piles of gold.
---
If the user absolutely needs that BoE epic, why isn't he buying it off the AH?
---
It was the craziest thing actually! Bought two in the AH for the large sum of 2g. Kept one for myself and sold the other to get my mount. I’m actually an avid pet collector in game and finally got my sprite darter last night! Just spent all my gold yesterday afternoon renewing my Gnomeish engineering for Lil Smokey. Fingers crossed I get the schematic. 😅
---
Imho multiboxing should totally be allowed but not the apps that duplicate keys and clicks to multiple clients. If I was in charge I would allow it as long as you play with an alt-tab style. So you are only ever in control of ONE character at a time. Anyone who's ever been hit with 5 simultaneous frost/earth shocks will know how unfair this is. 
---
I think in a group fight situation it's not so bad as 5 players working as a team will stomp a miltiboxer but this is 5 humans vs 1 human. The solo guy questing being attacked is a 1 human vs 1 human situation but 1 side is able to output 5x the normal damage instantly, it's not right.
---
He got waaaayyy to into the Horde vs. Alliance mentality. I wouldn’t even call it RP’ing; it was more like transference of some RL hatred he was holding onto the other faction.
---
It's not about needing the gold more than the item so stop using that as the argument.  The only reason to all roll need on the boe is because the option is a classic prisoner's dilemma and the logical choice is to all roll need.  The moral choice is definitely to roll greed if you don't intend to equip the item.
---
This comment will never make sense with the morally superior nonces who think they are entitled to an epic just because they can use it, like fucking 100% of everyone of their spec on the server.
---
They drop from the owlbeasts in hinterlands pretty easily
---
Likely, although very dependant on server. In the devilsaur thread people are reporting leather prices from 4 to 20g.
---
how is an addon saying "stealth player detected" ok? genuine question. it seems that hearing the noise and seeing the faded player is one thing, but to have a notif in the middle of your screen seems weird...
---
How about people who needs for disenchantment?)
---
Cant pick locks in stealth
---
If I could upvote this a million times I would.
---
T-T
---
Yes. Look up twink guides for your pvp bracket (X0 to X9) ie twink rogue lv 19 or twink mage lv 39
---
Other than that, there is no point for best in slot because all your gear gets replaced along the way.
---
everything is worth gold.
---
B A G S
---
Anyone blindly following any guide, for whatever it is, is doing it wrong, especially on a game like Classic where there are a lot of personal preference talents / options that are equally viable.
---
Maybe this disclaimer should be the very first thing to be written on any guide? Because on the guide itself, you simply end up having to choose something because of the way the wowhead talent calculator works, even if there are plenty of viable choices. No matter what you pick between, say, Shield Specialization or Ancestral Knowledge, there will ALWAYS be people disagreeing and calling out the guide on it. Its literally what this thread is all about, as there were plenty of comments on the guide complaining about the previous version taking Ancestral Knowledge (5 talents for less extra Mana than needed to cast a single spell btw) and now that its been changed, different people complain about Shield Specialization, of course.
---
I remember seeing a guild that had advertised itself as a night owl guild with their raiding times at like 2am.
---
I really enjoyed TBC. Arenas, viable specs, fun new abilities, some of the more annoying things in Vanilla were fixed. But once you go down that road, you also get:
---
1. Obsolete old world.
---
2. All gear you got in classic is now replaced by level 68 greens.
---
3. Obsolete travel due to summoning stones.
---
4. Portals from Shattrath means the worst city becomes the de-facto world capital
---
5. Flying mounts. Questing becomes flying in like a hawk, getting what you came for and bolting out.
---
6. World PvP is never the same.
---
Why would we want this? I'd argue, take the best things from TBC and put them in Classic+. We get Karazhan, Zul'Aman, Hyjal raids, better talent trees, spec-appropriate gear and tier sets. Arena for PvP.
---
I did this on every single green in my first RFC run back in 2005. Didn't want to be greedy so didn't press greed.
---
Nobody said anything.
---
Wasn't until WC someone called me out on it and explained how the system worked
---
&gt; I have presented that argument. Multiple times. Stat upgrade.
---
And I have told you, you could get that very same stat upgrade at the auction house faster and easier and at the same cost.
---
&gt; Its not more or less an upgrade than a BOP other than the ONLY way to get a BOP item is to run the dungeon.
---
Yes, it is, because BOPs you *NEED* to run the dungeon to get, not so for boes.
---
Becase keep the old loot frame was not a priority for blizzard when they added the need/greed rolls.
---
Well on my sever the horde and alliance work together to prevent anyone from getting devilsaur... so I guess it isn’t against tos because the rest of the server has reported the hell  of if them.
---
They absolutely do. It's the assholes who don't understand the difference between direct and indirect benefit.
---
Some people just don’t use discord. But we might have different idea of what serious/dedicated means. I play this game everyday after work until I’m tired (I think it’s fair to say you’re dedicated if you spend the majority of your free time on the game), and in the free time I have I’d rather just play the game itself than talk in a discord. Also kind of undermines the immersion of being in a game world.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcrta3/new_to_wow_trying_to_decide_between_warlock_and/). 
---
Imagine thinking those +3 strength for the next 6 ingame hours are worth more than 100+g.
---
But i need gold. Like i have repairs and consumables to pay for and they are equally important to my play.
---
Furthermore, Id be all for your assumed need/greed system *IF* the need rolls automatically binded the item to the person. So if you roll need its binded to you, no selling on the AH *AND* no vendor price available.
---
**also no disenchanting. Meaning the only use you have for it is to equip it.
---
Fuck this quest, I finished it at 32 lvl.
---
Look for any mats that seem to be lacking in the AH... light feathers, shiny fish scales, iridescent pearls, stuff like that. Farm for them.
---
only works on 1h weapons so take that into account
---
It's a lot more likely than OP's story.
---
Gold can buy gear and gear is worth gold either way getting a boe makes that player stronger.
---
&gt; Doesn’t increase your tanking ability, dps or healing sitting in the ah. 
---
It does when I buy gear with the sale money. Why do you ignore this point?
---
My guild and I held Dazar'alor with like 40 people and we were fighting off dozens of Horde coming in to defend the city. It happens plenty but, like classic, the more congested an area the more pvp there will be.
---
Precisely. If an item was meant to be strictly a reward for a party member to equip it would be bop. Boes exist because they can also be sold or sent to another character or traded away and therefore everyone has equal rights to it.
---
If anyone wants full control on who gets a boe, do guild runs. That's the point of guild runs.
---
They don’t have to be synced to echo keystrokes. Just within range to cast a spell. 
---
And to be honest, a person who can do five boxing is most likely someone who can focus on one of his characters and whoop most people’s asses. 
---
The amount of skill that goes along with multi boxing is pretty high and impressive.
---
Lolll. This shit would have gotten you /ignored by a majority of the server in classic. Too bad our servers are full of casual retail players.
---
This just perpetuates a hostile community. Just because there are ass holes in your neighbourhood doesn't mean that everyone should be ass holes. In order to cultivate a beneficial community one must act accordingly.
---
What can beat a shaman with hand of rag? Seems like a pretty good investment towards that $40k.
---
So let's do some critical thinking here
---
Are you gonna use 1h axes daggers or swords? Then it's a good item for you. 
---
If not, it's not good. So basically are you a prot paladin?
---
No , because this is not the same value, as no one can buy good gear at a vendor (and the gear you sell to the vendor will not be sold to another player, thus is destroyed)
---
If you need on a BoP to sell it to the vendor, the value you get is inferior comparing to the person who would have equipped it.
---
It is not the same with a BoE, because the object has the exact same value for both people : the price of the object on the AH.
---
(use your brain before trying to post a smartass comment)
---
Paladins don't have dual wielding and don't have the hit penalty furies face.
---
because its fucking expensive? are you retarded?
---
I had some hope for you after starting with such a promising one-liner, but yikes another huge fail. You really have zero clue what you're talking about and also seem to have some severe reading incomprehension.
---
Way to miss the point regarding the paying attention part. It meant that retail is so simplistic that you can do other stuff without being punished, while classic leveling even with full attentuon will be difficult because there are many things that can fuck you over.
---
Next to that, no you wont just spam frostbolt at level 60 as mage. Maybe in mc, but again thats such a small part that your argument is already irrelevant. Pvp, aoe goldfarming, other pve content. You will use many more spells than you will ever in retail.
---
It seems like you have played so much retail that every aspect of your life can only be seen as a one-dimensional process, lol. No wonder you mistaken 1% of the game with 100% of the game.
---
Another comment ridden with garbage for the world to see, get a clue and try again. Embarrassing.
---
I do the same but only to guard against ninjas. If somebody rolled a higher greed then I give it to them.
---
I have up with the 2 quests that need 10 of a item. Doesn't help we level in a group
---
It's quicker to pull both and run than slowly creep your stealthy ass through them. 
---
Or you could pull them at running speed and fear them *laughs in priest*
---
Not sure, but if you find a casual raiding guild, the classic raids are easy enough where you will be fine raiding as a PVP spec.
---
this is not true lol. There's no reason to make shit up
---
Or write that everyone should need and then be the first to hit need. That way everyone has a chance on it.
---
Just be aware Hydraxians from Neutral to Honored (what you need for quintessence) require almost 2k mobs. That's enough XP to take you from 57 all the way to 60. It's a really long grind!
---
Also, the mobs drop very little (Essence of Air is the occasional valuable drop) and can be annoying due to their high Nature damage.
---
&gt; Because people are generally assholes
---
No, people are generally not. What a sad world view.
---
There goes the baker with his tray, like always.
---
Why bother censoring names
---
If I sell it and buy a Boe that works for me how is that any different then them needing it and equipping it.
---
The main issues with fire is just that it doesn't work in raids (and a few of the higher level dungeons have fire immune/resistant mobs) and it doesn't have a threat reduction talent.  It's a fine option, but frost is generally better until aq.
---
I saw this as a defense in a prior post, sickened me.
---
What about the leather armor dps warriors wear? What about the cloth holy paladins wear? This isn't retail, there are plenty of times classes wear things that aren't the highest armor rating available.
---
PvP like this still happens in retail.
---
No art, tattoos, cakes, or my girlfriend/wife/mom/sister/mistress/hooker made this posts please.
---
&gt; I'm not sure on the best method, but from what I saw of the other priests farming, the common tactic was to fear them, slap on DoT's then use Mindflay, if the fear ever broke then you just reapplied that.
---
priest fear have a CD...
---
you saw wrong.
---
Or maybe, and this is the reality 95% of the time and everyone here knows it damn well, that person will equip it for a day then replace it. And another 4%, the person just sells it anyway.
---
A wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to
---

---
All you describe may be symptoms of the corporate environment support operates in now.
---
lv41 is a pretty tough level range. You might want to do a bit of grinding. However I highly recommend doing green quests as your priority now. They are fast to complete and mean you are less likely to run out of quests while ensuring you complete as many as possible.
---
This item reminds me of vanilla as a kid a lot. I used to level off these whelps for a chance at the pet. I always thought the area was so close cause youd have level 24 whelps and then all of a sudden you head east and there's a bunch skull elite dragons lol. 
---
Now I understand what that area is used for I just thought that the large door at grim batol was so cool back then.
---
In an ideal world, I wouldn't have to roll need. In fact, I think most people may be willing to go along with the mantra of everyone greeding for a BoE that's worth something as long as it was made clear.
---
Unfortunately, in life and in this, we have to accommodate for the assholes that will ruin it for everyone.
---
&gt; Bitch im loved 
---
Not by the people you screw over, you're fucking not!
---
Do that shit on my server, and the only people who will love you, is yourself!  After a few months, you'll be leading a solo life, because no one, will group with you.
---
Welcome to being blocked!
---
Yeah that's kind of the point. Most people would sell it for several hundred+ gold because it's a BiS twink item and doesn't do much to increase your leveling speed, especially if you're AoE grinding, and especially considering the level 42 staff from ZF is just as good, if not better.
---
This is a great example, actually.
---
They are 2 different things, because it's obviously the intention of the developer for dungeons to allow players immediate upgrades they can need on. It's why there's a roll system in the first place. It's why Need Before Greed exists as an option. It's why it's the only option in RDF when that was introduced. It's why they eventually introduced soulbound on need in later expansions.
---
&gt;I think this is fair, prevents theft and reddit posts like this one, and makes BoE items into something everyone can be happy about when they drop. That said you're welcome to set any loot rules you want as long as you're playing with people that trust each other, and you. And while I might respect you as a fellow player when we randomly meet to do a dungeon, I do not have to trust you, and if you trust me then that's on you.
---
I've had zero issue with the intended usage of the need/greed system in Classic, in a WotLK private server the past 7 years, and in retail whenever I played.
---
Traded mine for devilsaur set because gearing up our tanks early is important for future drops (definitely not because our server economy is absolute trash)
---
They're not wasting a damn thing. The only one wasting anything is you, depriving someone of loot they can use and enjoy for a few levels so you can get a few more coins you can easily get doing literally anything else
---
For me the intention wouldn't be truly malicious.
---
I just don't enjoy tanking for juvenile, chain-pulling DPS who don't want to take the game seriously.  Given that I'm also a busy tank, I want my computer to take care of as many details for me as possible.  So if I can essentially divide the children into one list, and the adults into another, it will make my experience in game much more enjoyable and productive.
---
If everybody needs, it's literally impossible for someone to ninja the item. Unlike if everybody else greeds and then someone needs. Greeding is the only action that allows the possibility of someone ninjaing an item.
---
Greed means you want something. Need means it is required for something.
---
Need/Greed is an artificial loot system. If Blizzard thought otherwise they would have made all needed items BoP.
---
\*hearthstones out of the dungeon\*

I always think about this video when I see discussions about ninja loot.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-MhIZ8qEZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-MhIZ8qEZU)
---
I do that too. I often park my 60 Warlock somewhere near where I quest with my Pally. I got nearly ganked with my Pally in Swamp of Sorrows yesterday and then had to gank the fucking shit out of that smelly Undead to show him not to try and mess with me.
---
Sulfuras horde. Got a decent thing going with decent people, we do discord, music, good chat, guild members helping eachother out and on our way to a dozen 60s or so.
---
no, english is not my first language. my point was world pvp is inherently imbalanced because 5 players can one-shot you just the same, for the person getting ganked there's no real difference.
---
I believe it looks through the battle logs somehow. There is also one that tells you when enemy players are nearby and estimates their level based on skills they use. It's low key cheating to be honest, but I don't see a way to fix it without getting rid of the log.
---
Get used to it. This is better on a warrior than rogue lol.
---
Hilarious
---
This is why I wait to see what everyone else is doing. If everyone needs, then I'm doing the same. If everyone greed's, I'm doing the same. If there's a disconnect I talk it out and see how everyone's feeling.
---
If you want a specific item and the group you join has it reserved just leave the group.  That's an easy fix.
---
Understanding and predicting the aggro zones of mobs is an art by itself. I imagine circles around them as i dodge through them.
---
You might want to look up the nostalrius PDF and retract that.
---
i know the point of the spec is to be a hybrid, but natures swiftness alone doesnt make you a healer. you can function perfectly fine without it
---
Wow it's like you don't even spot the irony in your post, and end up with ad hominem.
---
Godlike reply.
---
You missed my point. Need before greed is a mechanism put in place because people need gear and they don't need money. People WANT money, and that's why greed is called greed. Otherwise, it'd be called "Selling" or something dumb
---
Did you read them all? Its an insane amount of text :)
---
Then skip by it.. these genuinely made my day. My girlfriend knows absolutely nothing about gaming or WoW and surprised made these for me.
---
Sorry you have nobody in your life who would do the same.
---
i like these videos, keep going
---
There is always [https://classicdb.ch/?item=12252](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12252) from a vendor.
---
A lot of people are literally making this argument here. Oh well. I'll continue to tell people BoE's are need rolls in my groups.
---
Leathi was 13th on the chart for the kill.
---
That is the reason. My character needs gold. 
---
I need a faster mount so I can farm better. 
---
I need a better piece of gear thats a buyable upgrade. 
---
I need gold to buy my class abilities. 
---
I need gold to buy my profession skills. 
---
I need gold for repair costs. 
---
I need gold for travel. 
---
I need gold for rep cloth turn ins. 
---
Sure you can say “you don’t need those things”  but with the same token you don’t need a wep upgrade. Your old wep will still work fine and does dmg, maybe not as much but you dont need it. You want it because you want to do more dmg and have better stats.
---
Saying “I need” is 100% subjective to the individuals priorities within the game. 
---
If I never raid and only rp, i don’t need gear because thats not what I value but then again technically I do **need** gear its just not a priority **I** need.
---
Try sixtyupgrades. It's not perfect but it should have what you are looking for.
---
Either continue leveling like normal or grind gold for a while. You'll get there, don't worry :)
---
This guy's higher than me... That's very upsetting.
---
Omfg I love this style this made my day
---
Wouldnt that be terrain abusing then.
---
Oy
---
Leveling a warrior solo is miserable, find a healer to level with and it becomes good.
---
Don’t tell me that I just picked up the quest
---
Everyone just rolls need, on a boe worth any gold on the AH.  Easy fix.
---
Shame your character looks like shit.
---
:O
---
We took about 7 hours to do a full clear, with a break for people to hearth out and turn in quests mid way through.
---
Congrats you beat the game! Now you can go spend time with your girlfriend.
---
&gt;they've turned into vindictive assholes
---
We literally cannot walk into any of the major dungeons in the game without corpse running on Stalagg or having like 10-20 ppl.
---
It took 3 Alliance raids holding down BRM to get 10 people into MC the other night, and they started the raid with 75% durability due to being MCd into lava.
---
Foh with that shit.
---
A fantastic Story, sounds really really fun ! Thanks for sharing. :)
---
Reading your comments I'm curious on why you think there is a NEED and a GREED (and pass) button? 
---
Sounds like you think this game should only have two buttons: Roll &amp; Pass
---
Except for half the community who agree Need on BoE is the right way to go.
---
Then roll Need on everything. BoE. BoP. They all sell for gold and late game and weapons sell for some good gold.
---
Agree to disagree, I guess.
---
Hey I’ve got all sorts of bread. Whatchu need? How much? Best bread in the whole world. Conjured daily.
---
this, lol
---
Not everyone has tons of gold to buy a BoE from the AH.
---
That is your interpretation. That BoE item is a pile of gold. Anyone can use that to purchase upgrades. Just because someone is going equip it does not mean the other classes didn't have equal use for that item.
---
dang thats a whole day. I will wait a few more levels then.
---
Experienced players can do it, not experienced players will do it automatically. What I'm saying is that if your goal is to level fast and you have experience with the game you could do so in a pretty reasonable amount of playtime since the game's been out so long.
---
W.. what? Why do you think leeway exists? It was compensation for shitty systems and networks haha
---
Zzz. Just leave the group? Why create more drama?
---
Guards out of range of aggro = okay
---
Guards evading = not okay
---
lmao dude hes a horde, google it
---
A bot is a robot a multiboxer is a human
---
Here's the thing, for most BoE stuff I follow the need vs. greed rule and generally like to discuss with the group beforehand when I need something. "This is an upgrade for me, I'm gonna need this"
---
Upgrades should have priority when we're talking about disenchanting/vendoring items, that seems to be fairly common courtesy and I think is the core of the need before greed loot system.
---
When we're talking about 100+ gold, I doubt that most people will actually even use it. It's like a golden toilet, do you really want to shit in it? (As in equip it, therefore dooming it to only fetch vendor price). I feel like when we're talking about a lump sum of money that big, in a game where gold matters this much, it is totally fair that everyone should be trying to get it. I mean lets be honest, most of the items that sell for a ton are extremely gimmicky and really only marginally better than more commonly available dungeon drops. The funding potential is too good to pass up, doesn't matter who you are. I would wager that 50%+ of people who need on an item that is technically an applicable upgrade for their class just end up selling it anyway, because it's just so much god damn money to make on one item.  Expecting other people to pass up on large sums of gold just to convenience our gearing progression is somewhat narcissistic in my mind. 
---
Saying all this, I do love when we get a really rare drop in a dungeon or something and someone equips it right away. It's very wholesome and really makes me appreciate how well the gear system makes every new piece feel important and valuable.
---
Truthfully: nobody cares. Everyone is going to have a bad experience in game.
---
Also there is literally a sub rule against it.
---
You're equating random greens worth 1-2 gold to BoE epics that can sell for hundreds of gold and lead to someone else getting an upgrade or their epic mount. It's not like that item won't translate to an upgrade for someone else if sold on the AH for a nice premium.
---
Good luck with this mentality if you ever get so unlucky to group up with someone who doesn't care. Hope that never happens, but you're setting yourself up for it.
---
Establish loot rules before the run. If that can't be done or wasn't, default need to avoid ninjas.
---
Hunters mark was up. Aimed shot was already being cast
---
Haha how come you know me? Gotta represent bro
---
Lies! :)
---
At what point should I switch to Fury? Or prot? I’m planning on tanking most 60 dungeons, or at least off-tanking in UBRS. I’m not near raid-ready yet, and I’ll play whatever the guild wants me to when I get there.
---
I leveled 10-59 as Arms. It’s been fine for tanking, dpsing, and soloing. However, if you look at Arms, I’m really wasting like the last half of the talent tree when I’m tanking. Two hand spec is useless, axe spec is useless (and will stay that way for a while once I get Mirah’s Song), Mortal Strike is rarely used while tanking because I’m spending most of my rage on sunders/shield block/revenge most of fight, then the boss is dead before I have the luxury rage to MS. Sweeping Strikes sees some use while tanking but it’s niche and ineffective when compared to 2h.
---
My thoughts on going Fury is that the last half of the talent tree would be more effective for tanking. Enrage is a good dps boost when I get crit which will make aggro easier, Flurry is good, Bloodthirst doesn’t suffer from 1handers. I’ll still dip into Arms for Tactical Mastery / Anger Management, I’m thinking.
---
I’ve heard someone say to go Fury when you have 6% hit. My DPS gear isn’t quite there yet. Will my DPS suffer drastically if I make the switch?
---
Current weapons are:
---
Dreadforge Retaliator (+7 weapon damage)
---
Trash Blade
---
Hanzo Sword (Fiery)
---
How did a sniper not get that? Most servers have people botting TSM to auto buy out any mistakes like that.
---
it's a terrible platform ran by even worse people
---
once on a world quest I was in a Pug horde group for ulmath in najzatar and our group of like 12 was engaged in a battle with a similar sized alliance group. Only time its ever happened for me since the sha beast one in pandaria.
---
Must feel like a real dumbass now, huh.
---
Gotcha. Even me who doesn't get much playing time I'm hoping it's 2-3 years before I reach Naxx. Your saying it's going to take you 6. I mean I can understand. I'm a total wow virgin so I have so much to learn and find out yet.
---
With most used spells, especially instacasts, I use easily-reachable keys like 1, 4, 5, Q, E, R. Also Shift+R, Shift+F are really easy to press while holding W or S. And it allows me to use my mouse to rotate the camera if I have to be aware of surroundings (like if there are more enemies), or I can click some rarely used buttons with my mouse.
---
Not sure if you're trolling or just that full of yourself. I hope you get better either way.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say here...
---
I'd rather a ninja take advantage of my good will ONCE and then be able to report them to their guild officer and add them to ignore. I am not going to be a ninja just because some other people are ninja looting
---
You see, I'm okay with this too. If rules are set out beforehand then I don't see a problem. The problem arises when rules have not been set and everyone abides by a different standard
---
Literally anywhere with beasts, which is most places. Personally I'd say start in dun morogh, i remember the croc island in loch modan being great for levelling skinning
---
Reroll on a PVE server. You will be much happier.
---
When referring to a set of things, the spelling is suite.
---
That’s because guilds want to be server first. I can guarantee that this won’t be the case going forward.
---
Oh. Yea that's a bit over the top then. I thought you just meant he hates gnomes or something like everyone else do.
---
Goes on the AH for 450g on my server.
---
Noob question but what addon do people use for that nice party health on the top left? I had kui and now tidy plates but both don't do it.
---
Pretty cool by Progress, certainly better than colluding with New Gen on the daily.
---
OP does it for a C dungeon first just to tease you.
---
The great and powerful RNGeesus has heard your prayers:
---
RNGeesus says no.
---
So then you belive you should always need every item in the game unless its BOP?
---
Also need/greed is specifically NOT equitable. It very specifically give Need and advantage over greed which is the exact opposite of the definition of equity. Very intensely NOT impartial lol 
---
If you want an EQUITABLE system then its always need all the time for all loot always no matter what. Everyone would get a fair roll on the item regardless of their intent to use the item (which doesn't factor in to what you just said you want out of a loot system.)
---
It’s a shitty argument in about 80% of cases. I understand harping on someone with a blurry, angled photo that is hard to see, but most people that post non screenshot pics take decent ones. Then in the comments it’s like oMg TaKe A sCrEeNsHoT
---
Well a 500g BoE = an upgrade for all classes
---
Every single time in every single town where you kill people at a place where guards can't kill you, it's a bannable offense.
---
Don't mean to double post on you, but to answer your first question, I do whatever the rest of the group does. I'm not here to ninja items based how things can or should be done. I'm not an asshole.
---
But on reddit we are discussing how things should be done.
---
tellmewhen
---
Bid dkp for eye is pretty lame. You already have to pay 4000+ gold for hand to your own guild
---
Yeah but I'm not using them on every pull or trash. I'll use them for good attempts at bosses and not when people are learning.
---
We had this.discussion over gchat couple days ago. 
---
Freezing Band dropped to one of our gmates group. Everybody went need without hesitation, and there was a mage on group wich ofc wined hard bout loosing the roll.
---
While my logic on the matter was to give it to the mage and make sure he equips it. Lots of people on my guild claimed BOE epics 400g+ worth are something all should need
---
at least :D
---
Time available... I killed Gerstahn 10 times now. I can either keep wasting time killing him or do ubrs runs for a chance at other stuff I need. And if I can pick up a shoulder upgrade for my green quest shoulders in that run too, then big bonus.
---
Is a big upgrade not worth it if it's not the top of the bis list? I disagree with that.
---
Malice.
---
Actually gold is need. A BOE is worth EXACTLY THE SAME to everyone.
---
I'm a feral tank and if a warden staff drops, I'll tell everyone to need. I can sell it and buy another warden staff, maybe for less. Maybe I'll sell it for healing BoEs instead. 
---
Regardless, it has the same gold equivalent value to everyone in the group.
---
In principle, you can't ninja BoE's - you can only opt-out of rolls yourself.
---
I like this route
---
https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/leatherworking-leveling-guide-classic-wow
---
I actually think act of copying keystrokes through software is in fact automation ( even if you do it by keyboard splitter thats still automation). Slave boxes copying master box are closer to robots to me. If we consider slave boxes to be the same player as the master box ,then that means you have pay to win situation with godlike player. To me it  borders with cheating. At least in Eve multibox could be explained lorewise, because future high tech could allow it. How do you explain it lorewise in wow rp servers ?
---
it's clear people get triggered by it by their inability to focus on the purpose or content of the screenshot, and instead the method it was taken. either that or they want the karma that goes with calling it out. either way, it's a pretty stupid trend on Reddit for something that has such little impact.
---
That's called greed.
---
Why would you put the Arcanite bars up after the sapphires got instantly sniped?  Why wouldnt you put the bars up for a high price and refund the crafter the cost? You could have easily waited or paid the NAH fees, being impatient and cheap got the best of you and you paid for it, nothing more to say really.
---
Im not talkin about 2004. It was the same in BC. And like i said its been like that for years in retail. You are telling me that there were more people playing wod than BC?
---
This makes me want to re-roll on a PvP server. I wish I wasn't so terrible at it.
---
When you get right down to it, the other side of the argument, is merely an opinion to.
---
From my POV though, I believe I am right.  It's what makes sense to me.
---
This is how it should be. Blizzard really screwed up by not forcing items to be bound when you roll need.
---
Well that's a shame.
---
The fact that they're directly worthless doesn't mean much tough.
---
I definitely see a 300g epic as being worthwhile for anybody involved, regardless of what it is. I'm not asking you to share my opinion either, because you won't.
---
Calling us scumbags isn't warranted though, just group with like minded individuals and everyone will be happy.
---
Daggers is great for burst damage, CB PrepH is excellent for keeping a target locked down with stuns and high evis damage.
---
I forget what the daggers CB variant is, but CB PrepH is just your normal 21x/x/24x baseline.  Also an excellent build for doing pick pocketing / dark iron farming to make money on the side.
---
You don't really need a certain crit or gear threshold to do either, and I would recommend solo farming the barman shanker at 60 with LoS abusing. Makes the fight quite easy.  Once you have the barman shanker pvp daggers gets a lot better.
---
If the item is not worth purchasing off the AH for you, than it is certainly worth selling it on the AH for you. Yet people still equip dropped BOE's.
---
Hell yeah! This is great!
---
Sounds like that person doesn't know how to play a lock.  I hardly use mana since I just throw my dots on and then use my wand.  I also use my imp when running a dungeon.  Thats just common sense.
---
/cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck /cluck
---
If it's some shitty leveling item, sure who cares.  If it's an endgame viable BOE epic, why wouldn't everyone roll need?  It has the same value to everybody in the party.
---
Just do areas for a while at each level...  in Elwynn do the wolves/bears, then west fall kill every boar you see, Duskwood kill those stalkers or whatever on the Southeast part of the zone, Loch Modan go to the South Island with all the crocodiles, Wetlands go crazy on the raptors at the excavation site, Hillsbrad go hit the Yeti cave, etc...
---
Also you’ll get a ton of people that leave their kills along the way.
---
Skeram has like 30k players dude. It doesn't matter when servers are that big
---
Why cant we skin anything with a skin?
---
If that's the way his server rolls....that's fine.  My server doesn't roll like that.
---
Oh no!! How could they!?!
---
I HATE when that happens!!
---
They steal my Hearth Stone, remove stealth from my bar/skills and root me in the ground so i can't even MOVE!! Somehow, and i already reported them multiple times for it, they also manage to BLOCK my mouse from clicking in the "leave group" so i can get teleported from the dungeon in 1 min!!!!
---
Worse part is, even the Logout button wont work, or the Power button on my PC or alt+ctrl+del.
---
There is absolutely NO way i can leave or just ignore/block these people.
---
It's game over man. I had to give them what they wanted.
---
Side note: they threatened to kill my cat if i didnt comply, i did, and they still killed my cat... I'll miss you Frida.
---
If you mouse over the owlbeast, does the tooltip say Humanoid or Beast?
---
Sub seems to care so much about ninja looting but when something like this happens, the consensus is it's okay?
---
Requires 300 fishing.  I close vid.
---
This is glorious. All is fair on a PvP server, but this is exactly what I look for in world PvP. Not the 3v1 ganking and camping bullshit that happens most of the time.
---
Ah, how I miss Oceanic guilds
---
Basically you have several accounts with a subscription, each one has a character, you have several WoW clients at the same time and use a program that will replicate your keystrokes to each client. So if I have 10 priests I'll bind Shadow word:pain on 1 and when I press 1 the input is sent to every WoW client on my computer and all 10 priests will do that.
---
No thanks.
---
Manners and a social contract are hard things to abide by it seems.
---
Are you new to Reddit?
---
I want devout mantle :( i didnt tryed dungeon yet, want level 45 lvl first, never thought it will be a problem :( ehh.   
---
and yeah, not everyone hunting BiS items :( other items are good too...
---
It also helps to be the last person who rolls. 
---
Then you can see if someone is being a skank or not and chose need or greed from there.
---
On Faerlina there is literally a ninja guild called clc and they ninja everything.... So I almost agree with you that needing would put douche bags like that on the streets but rolling last is just a better way to not join the douchery...
---
dude its strat. just find new players lol jeez la weez
---
This isn't what ninja looting is. Not every time someone takes an item you don't think they should is ninja looting.
---
If he's repeatedly grabbing them they're waiting a factor of 5, not the minimum time.
---
Once or twice isn't when people get frustrated and start messing up pulls.
---
Requires 225 fishing if you use lures.
---
Damn... That's actually a good idea. I'm wondering if I can get the other guys to make the trek though.
---
Staged?
---
How would this logic have applied if every item in the game was BoE? Would everyone be stuck in this loop of needing everything just to buy what they actually need later?
---
Please leave and come back when they release your race in Cataclysm. Getting to use a rare item while Leveling is worth a helluva lot more than gold.
---
no
---
&gt;The price of it will skyrocket when PvP is released for the aforementioned reasons.
---
Well it's not released and I'm not going to play WoW on an infinite timeline. 
---
&gt;People also bring a warlock in most spellcleave groups.
---
&gt;Sounds like you're unfamiliar with ZF GY runs.
---
I avoid aoe grinds like the plague. I don't hate myself.
---
Yeah no shit I was talking smug about their employment when they are being an asshole. What am I supposed to do, just ignore them and let them get away with it?
---
How's your dps on bosses when you don't use them?
---
No it's not. It's called a disagreement over loot.  Normal people just leave, put them on ignore, and form a new group.
---
You however ended up making yourself look like a moron as well as them.
---
if it’s important to you to be the best of your role, it might be a good idea to go warrior. between warrior, paladin, warlock, and druid, warrior is by far the best DPS, as well as the best tank.
---
Another deflecting comment, gosh color me surprised. I hope you get better and more educated on stuff before you make garbage comments on the internet.
---
I prefer snickers.
---
See, every time I buy bread from a mage, when I go to bed at night and wake up in the morning ready for my toast, the bread has magically disappeared. Coincidence? I think not.
---
A labor of love... I think youre doing rogue wrong
---
It represents an item they can actually use?
---
Could of but you werent there so it's not your trade to comment on.
---
So this is the secret to get everyone to attack the same target, don't even need to use a skull marker!
---
The dude dresses up just like a mob and walks like one,  thing is he is enchanted out the ass for a lvl 8. So, when the horde come to do their quest, they tag him, he equips his fire enchanted sword, and griefs them. Pretty hilarious, honestly.
---
Trials in classic, really?
---
Having buttons on 5 keyboards pressed with one button is in fact automation.
---
O thanks for the tip. Hopefully it's the same in many months I'm max lvl haha.
---
Yeah I'd just wait until level 10 like mentioned before. Maybe everyone else but him can start together
---
The "I am going to sell this shit" is literally the definition of the greed button.  It's self explanatory.
---
Yeah, this wasn’t a real raiding guild. This was a guy and his buddies getting gear while 30 pugs carried them through the content. Y’all got baited.
---
You mean log in once and never do it again, because of cached credentials?
---
Tell me how this is functionally any different than a high level player camping a low level player in a lower level town where the level 45 guards can't do shit to him. Apparently this is fine in Astranaar but not ok in Gadgetzan because the mobs have different names?
---
Nah, it was really weird. I’m all for a “if it’s red, it’s dead”and even making cracks at people (jokingly) irl if I find out they play as Alliance, but what he did was on a completely different level.
---
Haha
---
Good, I don't want to play with crybaby entitled players who expect me to conform to flawed loot rules either.
---
Hi, /u/daddycoull
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcs7z9/recommend_a_eu_pvp_server/).
---
I feel that this depends also on how dedicated the player is. For lower level dungeons a person who already has a lvl 60 toon with decent amount of gold the argument that you could just buy it holds a lot more weight compared to a player leveling his first toon who couldn't afford to buy it on ah
---
I mean there's been done tons of stuff; towers in plaguelands,  bases in hellfire peninsula, Winterspring and so forth.
---
That was just sad.
---
Retail just created the perfect storm of quality of life changes that ultimately destroyed the game. War mode was a step in the right direction but it's an uphill battle.
---
If multiple people want it how would you decide who gets it?
---
I actually killed about 7 of them to skin while leveling on my warlock, but this was almost a month ago at this point. Every time I've had to go back to Ungoro I've dedicated about 15 minutes on my epic mount to finding another only to come up fruitless every timem
---
Its at least 93 (called out at 3:52 in the video), and I am counting the extra raid running in after them that gets wiped after dropping down as part of the same fight as there was no rest time between the two engagements.
---
There should be a druid trainer in the park in SW. If you do Dwarven starting area it's a quick tram ride.
---
You understand this applies when im not the on who needs the item yeah? How does that make me entitled? 
---
I am approaching it differently than you sure but if anything you are the one saying sellers are entitled to roll on gear they dont need?
---
where as I am trying to apply the ruleset consistently in all situations? Pretty shitty set of rules if I have to have asterisks next to it eh? 
---
"roll greed instead of need ****UNLESS THE ITEM IS WORTH SOMETHING THEN ITS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF*** isnt exactly consistent eh?
---
And milk anything with nipples.
---
When I tank, I tank everything the party wants. If one person wants it, it gets killed. It's just that simple.
---
What does the word greed mean to you?
---
But like...why
---
&gt; Not by the people you screw over, you're fucking not!
---
He's not screwing over anyone though.
---
cause dis real shit bro
---
The name thing really annoys me.
---
My other half had a character called Ocranus (Ok-ran-is) and logged in at about level 7 to find he was forced to have a name change because the same  letters can be used, re-arranged to spell Orc Anus. Yet I have seen multiple characters with names which are blatantly skirting the naming policy using spoonerisms, and clearly have been around for a lot longer as they are in raid/pre-raid gear. They have no issues.
---
Yeah but the timing is way better.
---
You seem to be playing the victim in all the scenarios you are talking about, while also saying you will Need on all items. Please pick one.
---
Stop saying Demand, you sound like a troll.
---
And as a member of the Alliance, we are proud of *you*.
---
2g is 2g. Obviously you give a shit on the otherside of the fence as well or you wouldn't have bothered commenting.
---
Hell, you might not even need to kill that many.  I get a pretty good amount of leather from skinning animals other players have killed.
---
Anywhere there is a quest where it's "get X drops from these animal mobs" there's a good chance there are free skinning opportunities.  Darkshore is a great one (the wolves along the coast), same with Westfall.  STV obviously (but with both factions there's a greater chance to come across other people skinning).  
---
It's also a good time to work on Cooking (which does mean you have to kill the mobs of course).
---
Side note...I've come to really dislike spiders.  As a Rogue I usually pickpocket any humanoid mob and as a skinner I skin every animal mob.  Those damn spiders don't have pockets or skin!
---
Exactly! If you need the drop as an upgrade it's available to be purchased, even from the winner. Needing it away from someone because you can equip it is essentially taking the trade value of gold away from everyone else.
---
This reminds me of DAoC AoE bombs. Where an 8man group manages to wipe out a zerg because they got the surprise jump on them.
---
There are a ton of viable PvP specs. 8/11/32 swiftmend is probably your go-to dedicated flag runner spec. 30/0/21, 29/11/11, 19/11/21 and even 1/29/21 HotW are all great PvP specs depending on what you're looking for.
---
As a healer, if I'm grouped with you and you're a warrior, and you need on an epic healer staff, I'm not healing you anymore.
---
You must be on a RP server?
---
On Faerlina there's wayyyy worse names that are chilling at lvl 60.
---
I'm levelling a Rogue with a friend, basically duoing 2 Rogues. We want to do wpvp on the way to max and at max level. 
---
What would be a good talent spec to pick if we are duoing ? I was thinking about Assassination because if 2 rogues open from stealth we would one shot every mob, but maybe Combat is faster? 
---
And what about pvp, is combat worth to pvp ? I don't know much about classic rogue, I played an Assassination rogue in MoP and WoD
---
top kek
---
Keep deflecting, boy.
---
&gt;But you could turn that gold into an equivalent BOE epic for your class too.
---
That's pretty much what I've been saying this whole thread.
---
Nobody needed it. No one in the group could use it.
---
Oooo what unit frames are those
---
That made me lol out loud
---
I mean, I haven’t whined and complained about anything. I just told you what I saw. But thanks.
---
Being good in something can be fun.
---
But playing the way you want yourself is more fun. My end goal isn't to be the best player in the best guild. It's to have a good time. And that is what I'm having.
---
And that gold can turn into an upgrade for someone else. ?
---
If no loot rules have been established then need for the sake of avoiding those unsavory types.
---
There used to be a druid trainer in SW, I am not 100% if it was there during classic though.
---
You're names pretty memorable lol and Kaiser (the warrior in your pic) is from my guild haha
---
BoE=need, only way to real ninjas and it’s fair
---
Unless they mislead you somewhere, you all went in knowing it would be a loot council. That's the risk you take, some councils will always make sure their officers have priority access to loot.
---
Personally I think it's a dumb way of doing things, especially in classic where MC and Ony are facerolls and gear is near-meaningless. Still, whoever didn't quit will now have their raider spot. Sounds like the officers had a plan to weed out people who weren't ready to fall in line.
---
Wow down voted?  Nice.
---
Yeah maybe. But since they don't have anyone on their faction who can make it I would suspect you could charge a hefty premium.
---
The difference is, you can fight back without the guards attacking you as well.
---
Thats 20g!
---
This crap happens to me all the time.  I swear to God druids have a super special side agro aura going on haha.  Anyone and everyone sends agro to me!
---
It's funny seeing cassandra's grace go for 120g+ on my server, but some 55 green +healing helm that's actually better than it go for less than 20g because "that preraid BiS list"
---
How the perfect Hunter's pet roster should look like? Broken Tooth for PvP and Leveling / Owl for the Solo dungeon farm / Worg for raids? 
---
Planning to raid mostly with my alt warrior, so farm is priority.
---
Anyone recommending hunter for new players doesn't knows what he's talking about.  
---
  People recommend hunters because they're easy to level, but that's just one part of the game, the class has one if not the highest skill ceilings in the game in both pve and pvp.    
---
  The amount of tools and little tricks the class can use and SHOULD use make a good hunter player invaluable, although hard to find.  
---
 There's also more room for error than any other class, if you don't know what you're doing at all times, you WILL pull more mobs, you WILL break cc, your pet WILL run off and aggro something, you can also cc with fear beast AND freezing trap, that's why there's so many stories of "huntards", because they're recommended to new players by people that don't know how many aspects you need to manage to not be a problem to your group.  
---
 You're also a necessary addition for raiding due to tranq shot and kiting, tranq is easy, kiting things such as majordomo isn't, need to know exactly where to drop and when to activate cheeta, then there's bwl kiting and kiting drakisath in ubrs.  
---
  Pets are another aspect you can master, one example would be making wolf come back to you, use his howl, then send him back to boss while you cast aimed shot for the most amount of damage.  
---
  On pvp, sky is the limit, so many ways to approach every situation and feign death shenanigans make that twofold.  
---
  Even farming has a high skill ceiling, with current classic maraudon being much harder so you need to kite perfectly and with almost no room for error, and do it better and better each time so you squeeze it down to 12ish minutes total for all the last 3 bosses.  
---
  This is just the surface, there's so many things to work and master, while some consider it frustrating, those that love the class do it precisely because of these reasons, there's so much room to grow and improve it never feels like you're "done" with the class, I've never ever gotten bored with it.  
---
  I've played hunter for 15 years.
---
Its being a ninja, I bet you do it YIKES
---
&gt;level 15
---
Really too early to farm...
---
Level up and then if Horde, go to desolace and open traps.
---
it was in the NW corner, park area.
---
If they didn’t say ahead of the raid exactly how looting would work, they really were just getting gullible people to pug for them so they could get all the loot.
---
Get truedtrike shoulders from ubrs and mask of the unforgiven from dtrst
---
I’m confused because on US-Skeram I pugged 10/10 clear. Did this server launch later?
---
It’s minor because it’s so infrequent that most people probably won’t come across it. The odds of you seeing more than one seems to so far be close to zero according to this thread. Then there’s the chance of it being the opposite faction, then him doing whatever you’re doing and then him actually griefing people. 3 people can easily win and 2 decently organized can beat him. Sure it sucks, the one time it happens. But it’s crazy that the outrage makes it look like this is a common occurrence. This is the call for a vaping ban of classic wow
---
I'll sacrifice 1-6 gold to make someone happy. 500g is another story.
---
I'm glad you got your accounts back.  I've been seeing so much bandwagon jumping on this sub lately attacking people who are looking for help with their wrongful ban, I think it's just mob mentality and the current cool thing to do, it's like twitch chat sometimes.  
---
Anyways, I find this kind of jarring.  This system must work differently in retail because I have multiboxed in the past with 6 accounts, and currently run two accounts full time; one main account and one auction account.  I have mailed and traded millions of gold a multitude of times between characters on different accounts (although on the same Blizzard account) and also done many zany things on the auction house over the years (cleaned it out of certain trade goods, sniped, accidentally bought a worthless green bow for 250k, etc.) and never had an issue.
---
It's not ninja looting! And yeah we all want the gold sorry but the other party members being able to get their epic mount is far more important than you getting to have a BoE that you'll replace before 60
---
guessing the allies were 2v1ing and now will scram with it being 2v2
---
Typical streamer, get a job
---
Have you not ever had someone ninja loot on you? If so you’re incredibly lucky. Granted, the majority of the classic WoW community won’t ever do it, but it’s not some overwhelming supermajority.
---
So you'll just spam about that movie?
---
At least no shitty intro music in this one.
---
I’m not sure why you posted this thinking it would make you look good and the other guy bad.
---
All I see here is 2 internet tough guys 😂
---
you realize that druid dps is not based of weapon damage right? Giving hand of rag to a druid just for the fire resist is the biggest waste of gold you could possibly think of
---
It’s 4 strangers per dungeon. A few dungeons a day, that’s 20+ Strangers. I wouldn’t let 20 strangers into my home for no reason and let them wander around my house while I’m gone. 
---
Does that mean that I preemptively treat them like criminals? Obviously not. But I take due caution by *not inviting strangers to my house while I’m gone*. Excercising simple loot rules isn’t treating people like villains, no matter how many times you say “sad”.
---
That's why I love druids! Thanks!
---
Because I think it's in poor taste to literally try and extort someone to continue a run? We all left, that's not the point. Shitty stuff like this shouldn't be okay and brushed off as "drama" or blowing it out of proportion. If we don't agree with ninja'ing an item this shouldn't be cool either.
---
I don't view it as stooping to their level. Imagine a mail boe blue drops. First person greeds, then a mage decides he "needs" the money and hits need. Then the warrior is like wtf why did you need I was going to need that.
---
So now this warrior has a 50% chance to win. 
---
Now the remaining 2 members see this injustice and decide to need too so that if they win they'll give it to the one who will actually need it. Now the odds are 3:1 favoring the guy that will actually use it. 
---
How is that not a noble pursuit? Why do you think it's stooping to a ninja's level to do this?
---
Yup and all the trials who leave will be replaced with new trials who also will not be allowed loot till gm/officers/raiders no longer need anythng.
---
As others have mentioned shamans are typically brought for their totems and amazing group healing via chain heal. That said you can also find spaces in raids occasionally as the user of debuff weapons such as Nightfall (though that weapon isn’t until phase 3 I think). I think the community is already starting to chill out a little on min max specs I have seen a few guilds already looking for boomkins so I can’t imagine it would be too hard to find a raid group as full enhancement.
---
Bingo. The stigma around druids developed when their trees were garbage in vanilla. After the tree rework, they are actually quite powerful healers among their other great utilities. There's still some confusion about them though.
---
Innervate and mana regen. Druids have bad mana regen compared to priests, but priests get godly returns from spirit overall so it's to be expected. To make up for this, druids get innervate. For most fights, this easily puts you on par if not better in terms of mana compared to priests. Technically, it's more advantageous to cast innervate on a priest though since it scales with their regen. This leaves the druid oom and perceived as useless. People don't consider that the druid literally just gave away their regen to a priest, because otherwise they'd just have an oom priest instead.
---
Healing touch is insanely mana efficient. You probably won't match a Paladin in terms of ST because they're broken af, but you get -19% mana cost on it, +10% healing, and it scales 100% with +Healing whereas priests only get ~87% (due to shorter cast times). Druids scale wildly with gear, if only it were itemized correctly...
---
Just like feral spec, resto druids should be in cat form dpsing. A 40-man with 6 priest/pally/shamans don't need everyone healing at once. There's a tendancy to heal snipe, where all the healers waste mana trying to pad numbers or unnecessarily panic. As a resto druid, you're better off dpsing until the other healers start getting drained, then rotate out with them. You won't be the top of DPS or healing charts, but you'll be one of the few on both at once.
---
Do those things actually create more "natural" PVP encounters though?  Or do they just incentivize one side steamrolling the other and camping to protect their advantage?  It's a contradiction in terms to say "incentivize" and "natural" when talking about PVP.  Either it happens organically and without incentive, which is what natural means, or it doesnt.  If you incentivize it, you just created a battleground, essentially.
---
My mistake then, thought the MT that needed it was in group.
---
You kicked someone for not agreeing with your looting system? Everyone should just roll Need on BoEs from the start and not give the chance for "Ninjas" to exist.
---
Reminds me a lot of grimes’ art
---
&gt;I do love when we get a really rare drop in a dungeon or something and someone equips it right away
---
I was in a group last night and some BoE leather pants dropped. Everyone greeded, I stated that "I'm going to Need, but i'll equip it immediately." All the responses were "you better!" and "I want to see it on your inspect screen!"
---
Which i totally understand, i just found it funny. As soon as i put them on, everyone congratulated me on the major upgrade haha
---
Why though? The rules that apply to normal BOE's should apply to patterns as well
---
If that happens to me? I guess i could do NOTHING like i explained above.
---
Also, it's completely different from Ninja. Search the concept of Ninja in WoW.
---
This could be called "douchebagging" but not Ninja'ing.
---
You missed the part where I had to dismiss it in order for the ogres to attack the node thief instead of the pet.
---
The thief had to die.
---
So instead lets act like my side is perfect and the other is terrible, amirite?
---
I wish I had a good job so I could keep it to myself when in an argument over the internet. But man can barely afford 2 meals a day... dont question my wow subscription.
---
In order to beat the ninja become the ninja.
---
Minus the cost of repairs from potential deaths which may br small but does add up.
---
That's not the point 1 in 1000 vs 1 in 5000 still means you are at the mercy of RNG - it's so rare that a few logged drops could cause 'spike' in the drop chance at a given time. At the moment 1 in 1000 seems way more likely than 1 in 5000.
---
Are you sure 1 in 5000 is not factoring the '5' ppl in the party rolling for it?
---
Was there ever any confirmation from Blizz what the original drop chance was for this?
---
Why though? They wanted a quick stomp. When you want to win, you have to exploit your enemy's weakness. There's really no such thing as bravery in wow. There is never anything at stake besides a slight loss of time.
---
38 Troll Shadow Priest. 75 gold. Alchemy - 150, herbalism - 225, fishing -175, -cooking -150, first aid - 225. 3 days 17 hours played time
---
If by "intense stuff" you mean graphical rendering then you're right. That's all done client side. But almost every single calculation when it comes to spells and interaction with the game is calculated server side which can be pretty intense when you have lot's of players. It's a lot more than processing simple data packets. If that was the case I could have the game tell the server I just obtained 2000000000 gold and my sword hits for 1000000000 . This is not the case. The simple way it works goes something like - my game client says "hey I just cast frostbolt" server says "okay it just hit for 200 enemy health reduced by 200" my game client then updates what I see on screen.
---
There is a universal nature to power, and those who wield it. How frequently it is abused may be up for debate, but the potential for it is not.
---
Not sure what you are expecting from reddit.  Sucks this happened but thats the risk you take when you use the neutral AH.  You can't prove he was using some sort of bot, and I would consider anything auctioneer or AUX provides to you (be it buyout scripts or w/e), is fair game.
---
You could have just waited until someone horde side got the pattern.  Instead you played it risky and luck was not on your side.
---
The beach definitely blows.  I fell in there as a ghost and it felt like forever til I could get out due to the sheer cliff walls.
---
Stuff like AS buffs and windfury drastically increase how often you see single digit % procs, especially for fury who wield two weapons.
---
So giving everyone a fair shot at an item is screwing people over.
---
But denying 3 people a fair shot is not screwing people over, nice logic you got there.
---
You're an idiot of gargantuan proportions if that was how you interpreted the comment. Must be a human.
---
Clever use of game mechanics.
---
But that's not the mentality for other BOE drops, like if an epic drops that's worth 500g, the unwritten rule is that everyone needs.
---
Wait, why can't you fault Blizzard?  If the support staff are underpaid that's entirely the fault of Blizzard.
---
PvP servers are almost an entirely different gaming experience. It causes for a lot of annoyance, conflict, but also fun stories. 
---
As for the tauren, he could be just having fun or messing about.
---
jokes on you, he already had one in his bags
---
Same end result tho. Ruins a run because of someone greed. Why is one more shitty than the other?
---
Or if you're lucky with your role, I can't guarantee that the druid is going to equip the warden staff, we all worked together in the dungeon so we all get equal opportunity on valuable loot.  There's a reason those items are rare, you don't go into a dungeon expecting to farm for your warden staff or other BoE BiS item
---
Dude, I'm using an rx 580. Ultra all the way. 5700xt will max out graphics and framerates on Classic with ease.
---
And your method is a great way to exclude people who actually need the upgrade. You go from relying on good faith rolling, to an even worse mentality that "if the roll winner wants to give their item up to someone who needs it they will"... which just results in ninjas still ninjaing but the biggest loser is the player who actually needs it for gear reasons
---
Yall forget this is a game and these items are just pixels you feel you need for pixel money
---
&gt; They wanted a quick stomp.
---
This is supposed to help your cause?
---
Couldn't agree more. It's quite childish to think that the "other side" isn't as bad as your own.
---
Stalagg but still horde ;)
---
Its so hard on reddit man. I truly appreciate that I can have some complex discussion or at least indepth discussion like this with another user genuinely trying to find some common ground or understanding. 
---
its easy for us to all just play tribalism and throw names and it takes a lot of effort to take the time to present honest arguments with the intent to find that common understanding and I do appreciate you for sticking with me long enough to hash our 2 sides out despite our ultimate disagreement. 
---
You rock man! Bring civility back to discussion! XD
---
Holy shit
---
Oh boy. You are dumb.
---
It still doesn't make sense.  No first responder is going to check your stickers but not your back seat.  Plus people don't exactly take them off when the kid's not in there.  They're meaningless noise like a stick figure family.
---
We are absolutely not talking about how the system should be used. It is blatantly obvious how it should be used and I agree with you, but because of ninjas it is flat out too risky to use it the way it was intended. 
---
If you run with people you trust or know, then this conversation doesn't even apply to you.
---
People can talk all day about how they will use the system properly, but when those Edgemaster's Handgaurds drop, you will think twice, and so will the other 4 random people in your group.
---
Bottom line: establish loot rules before the run. If they haven't been established or no one could agree and you went along anyway, well, good luck rolling greed.
---
Well the game would have required assistant in the multiple thousands of dollars to even come close to running at this well back in 2004.
---
Therefore what they were attempting to do was greater than the technology allowed at the time for the general populace and consumer. Particularly once they redid the whole engine.
---
That would in fact be being ahead of the times.
---
the game runs on any system from the last decade well and efficiently at high or max now pretty much.
---
When world of Warcraft first released there were many people playing the game of the computer that really couldn't handle it and plenty of healers and tanks had to stare at the floor while raidng or doing dungeons.
---
Where did I say it was flawless?  Obviously the system has flaws which is why this discussion is happening, but the flaw in my eyes is human greed.  By saying a BoE provides the same value to the whole party, you're removing the intrinsic value of the upgrade for the given person who actually needs the item.
---
I'm sure it is, but that's the problem. 15 years of updates have destroyed the ability to have more than a few people in the same area without causing insane lag. Blizzard broke something and they should fix it. Maybe it's not relevant for retail (although I argue this is false as people like Asmongold have failed to host large-scale events on retail due to the lag issues), but it should at least be fixed for Classic.
---
Because everyone having a fair chance at loot isn't ninjaing?
---
I'm not sure what mental gymnastics you have to do to think that.
---
Focus on green level quests and enemies and you'll be fine.
---
If everyone is silent I usually say, “so you guys on MySpace or...” 
---
Gets a laugh like a third of the time, nbd.
---
That's fair feedback, will get that sort of info into the guide tonight, I took the guide from the previous owner just recently so obviously that got overlooked while going through the 10 pages of info already there. Wish you could have given that feedback on the comments rather than make a Reddit thread to farm easy hate karma at the expense of one of the oldest / most helpful websites throughout all of WoW's history but alas, it is how things are done in 2019. In the end the only thing I really care about is making my new guide as good as possible, cheers!
---
That’s fair enough, I stopped playing at the start of MoP and I just used the in game system and it was fine.  Same as Private servers, it just worked.
---
On Classic, it didn’t work
---
I engage in skillful pvp every day that I play, simply by fighting played that are at their keyboards.
---
This is what the Legion pvp towers should have been in BFA. No NPCs, no cooldowns on ownership, no mercy. If you want your faction to own that spot on the map you gotta roll in and take it and hold it.
---
It's staggering that they never continued the towers.
---
A lot of Australians were on Proudmoore until they offered realm transfers. It was sad to see so many go.
---
We're still in phase 1 right now.  Hardly anyone is geared enough.  Your normal opener of abmush then backstab will take a really good chunk of their HP.  Followed up by kidney or eviscerate will probably end them.  Even if you fail you have vanish and Prep to do it all over again.  
---
What i'm saying is that dagger PvP does not have a high gear requirement.  Go for it and you'll see the HP of your target melting in front of your eyes.
---
How hard is this to understand. Bring attention to what? Everyone knows assholery happens all the time in this game. It’s the internet. Nobody needs to be educated.
---
You tell me: what exactly is there to learn or do differently after reading your post? What new information or knowledge was gained?
---
I start in battle because of charge generating alot of rage, cast sweeping, then swtich to berserker stance with a macro that also casts berserker rage at the same time, then whirlwind followed by switching back to Def with a macro that equips 1h/shield.
---
This really only works if you have the talent to maintain rage when changing stances, since while swapping back and forth your autoattacks are still going off and generating rage.
---
You’re just a miserable human being. That’s the difference.
---
Because if you immediately need it and everyone else decides to greed it because the loot rules weren't established, you have now made yourself a ninja.
---
My rogue friend sneaks past as many mobs as he can and always gets lucky with drop quests, I get very unlucky with drop quests. We're the same level with very similar /played except he runs dry of quests in a given zone much faster than I do
---
Does anyone have some good ways to farm gold?
---
I'm a 35 priest with only 32g and i'm sick of running..
---
Have alchemy &amp; herbalism as profession.
---
Any tips would be nice !
---
Yep. Proc chance was 40% so you only had a few free globals per fight if played properly
---
When it comes to boe greens and most blues, sure, don't be petty.
---
If its an epic, you're a fucking idiot to think NBG is fair.
---
For example, staff of Jordan drops. With 3 mages, a war and a priest in the group. Everyone contributed equally.
---
If a mage typically wants a staff of Jordan, they have to shell out 300g at the AH. If a warrior wants a belt of might, they have to shell out 300g at the AH. For a liquid asset that everyone contributed towards, it literally has the same amount of (obscene) value to the mage as it does to the warrior. If its a guild run and that epic helps everyone in the long run, then let the mages take it, but if you think you're entitled to 300g over another pug because a liquid asset "has spell damage" and some stretched rhetoric of a loot mechanic designed for BoP vendoring convenience, you're definitely an asshole.
---
Same concept? Tank refusing to let the dungeon run continue unless they're given the shield.
---
I found 3D portraits on SUF tend to bug out from time to time back when I used it on Live, and even now on Classic. (Things like this screen from OP, portrait not changing when targeting different mobs, no model loading at all, etc).  
---
No issues with the 2D portraits though.
---
Warrior main since vanilla here. Leveled a few Warriors to 60 on private servers in the last few years as well.
---
A lot of guides will say level as 2 Handed Fury, I disagree. Level as Arms. Tactical Mastery and later on Sweeping Strikes are so good.
---
As for fighting, don't use hamstring kiting. It's such a hassle in Classic. Charge in, keep Rend up, and use Sunder Armor instead of Heroic Strike. Try to avoid executing and save the rage for the next mob.
---
Get some "of the Boar" (Strength/Spirit) gear from the AH. The Spirit on this gear is a game changer. You will hardly have to eat between pulls. In general try to keep your gear updated through dungeons.
---
Get a gun/bow/crossbow early. It will make pulling one mob at a time much easier. Don't worry about the damage they do, it's just for pulling.
---
Level cooking. Spending less on food will get you toward your mount at 40 a lot faster. There is a very nice guide on Youtube to level Cooking and Fishing together and get them both to 300 at level 35.
---
First Aid. Level. It. Use. It. Live. By. It.
---
I would suggest getting Mining and Skinning. Bank the ore, sell the leather (for mount money). At 60, or when you have your mount at 40, respec skinning for Blacksmithing and use the banked ore to level Blacksmithing.
---
At level 30 try to get some guildies or friends together to help you with your Whirlwind Axe. Get the Axe, not one of the other weapons. Together with the 5% axe crit from Arms talents will give you more rage froms crits, and more Deep Wound procs for the DoT. This will change your life and can potentially be used all the way up to 60.
---
Playing a Warrior needs more investment and sometimes feels like playing the game on hard-mode. But in the end, when you get the gear, it will be worth it.
---
That's a BIG point that needs to point out up front.  Else it looks like you ninjaed it from a warrior tank.
---
Could also be a WeakAura.
---
Definitely not the word lmao
---
Because that gold is completely worthless. Getting cool gear is the entire point of the game.
---
Meanwhile at level 30 I ran all the way to desolace and got it in my first trap
---
or Weakaura
---
I guess you mean alchemy. Can't P2W with Herbalism.
---
sounds like you people didnt roll need on a rare/epic drop. 100% your fault.
---
LOL downvoted in less than a minute.
---
I really don’t understand why this comment is confusing so many people. It’s a very obvious statement in meaning.
---
In reality I don't think anyone is planning to build it but even if only 1 person wanted to build it they can just min bid for it.
---
Ya I always wait for unyielding maul. I definitely wouldn't pay over 400 gold for the staff.
---
Just go to the auction house and find cheap upgrades
---
Hey man, it’s your life and it’s now or never. You ain’t gonna live forever.
---
Healbot or Vuhdo or Grid + Clique.
---
I have been messing around with Vuhdo some lately Healbot has been around for a long long time.
---
As long as you are horde we can still be friends.
---
Have a great day.
---
*Laughs in PC older than 2004*
---
Finding groups for dungeons can be hard too. Playing at odd hours has its benefits, but also drawbacks.
---
I wouldn't either! Congratulations!
---
&gt; bloodvine
---
Did you play any of private servers as a lock?  Why is bloodvine so good?  I was using the warlock discord gear sheet, and when I swapped mc/bwl/world boss gear to blood vine it was only a 15 dps increase, or 25 dps with the tailoring 2% crit bonus.  Is it because you need the very sought after ZG items as well to boost hit rating above crit rating?  Is bloodvine better with world buffs or without them?  
---
To me, as a skinner and enchanter, the 30g per mooncloth is super expensive and I can't see the benefit, unless I start a tailor today to craft mooncloth for 84 days of cooldowns.
---
Westfall-PVE doesn't have queues at all anymore and it's usually listed as high pop. :)
---
i cant believe you beat people 40 levels lower than you, amazing work!
---
Oof, pincer attack on people trying to pass out waters and potions (or in my case probably trying to scarf down dinner).
---
I know right, you'd think its making their eyes bleed
---
I can understand having multiple accounts and alt-tabbing between them to play them all, but 1 button press affecting 5 different accounts is fucking cheating.
---
As mentioned before, the "only raiders get loot" part wasn't mentioned until after the whole fiasco. Before that it was just "loot council".
---
Faction evangelists really are silly
---
I can't fully answer this because I haven't been camped by skulls yet.  Best few things I can think of to temporarily get around this:
---
\- Get other friends to group with.  While going through STV it was a drastic difference for me when I was in a group of people questing vs solo.  Yes we would get attacked sometimes but no where near as much as solo (and usually by groups of 3+)
---
\- You already mentioned that you have 2 characters.  Switch over to the other for a bit, then go back.  I know this sucks, but it happens.
---
\- Get in a big leveling guild that you can group up with people like level often and quest with them
---
If you absolutely can't stand any of this, then as others have stated, maybe it's a good time to reroll on a PvE server.  You will obviously not lose these characters so you can always come back to them if you want.
---
Another little tidbit to discourage you even more, Phase 2 is going to be a fuckfest because honor kicks in but there are no ways of getting it besides open world PvP.  It's going to be freakin' madness.
---
I decided to fight my way through, still took a death or two to get it.
---
S.Prs - Strat was also a major source for my old world enchanting mats for the twink market.
---
I don't agree.
---
Hi all !  
---
Is blacksmith unproductive? I've been leveling it but now I'm 5 golds behind my friend... Crafted gear don't seems that cool and is expensive. Should I drop it or keep going (It may be better later?)  
---
Thank you.
---
he can't because hes new to vanilla and doesn't understand the loot or the game
---
9% is the hitcap for cat, I imagine it is the same for bear. 
---
2% Truestrike from ubrs (or wyrmhide spaulders from Taste of Flame)
---
1% Blackmist Armguards from ubrs
---
1% Stormshroud gloves (although it's stupid expensive to make, you're better off with devilsaur if you can afford it)
---
1% Blademaster Leggings from ubrs
---
1% Blackstone Ring from Princess in Maraudon
---
1% Impervious Giant from brd (2h mace for when you're not using MCP buff for threat)
---
1% And if you're on the horde side, Rune of the Guard Captain from the hinterlands quest "Job Opening: Guard Captain of Revantusk Village"
---
I don’t remember how the server I played on in classic handled it , but in my opinion everyone should be able to roll need. It’s valuable to us all . I seem to remember crafters offering those in the group gold if something extremely valuable dropped . Essentially buying it cheaper than they would get from the AH and the party members also got a few G , win - win . Maybe that was an old PS server tho , it’s been years and I’m old now lol
---
&gt;This photo is literally in focus, not angled and is cropped well.
---
If he wanted a picture that was in focus, not angled, and well cropped he would have just taken a screenshot and uploaded that instead
---
This is a totally fine and healthy stance to take on loot ettiquite. I'm on board with  "everyone needs" if I know about it before I walk in.
---
If someone can learn it right then and there in the run, need. If not, greed.
---
Uh no? I expect a full dungeon when I join a dungeon group. If the group is only doing specific things it's THEIR job to say that in chat before inviting people.
---
An argument could be made that having money increases your chances for an opportunity to get a BOP item you need.
---
You can use money to get items you need that will in-turn give you access to running Dungeons you otherwise could not. And in-turn that money can in fact help you get a BOP item you need. 
---
Is it Nuanced? Maybe, but the logic remains. 
---
Money is KING and there should only be two roll options: Greed &amp; Pass
---
Well they did gain gold because now they don't have to buy that item.
---
Then roll alliance rofl, server pop and years of bullshit says that wpvp will never be fair.
---
Why bg and arenas became the pvp focus.
---
Because you're on Reddit and people are retarded.
---
Don't forget it early anybody with an access point can post shit on this website. Even some kid in a special ed class when the teacher forgot to go back from lunch break and they sneak onto Reddit to start posting retarded shit like this.
---
I don't care what people do on rolls for cheap greens. They aren't valuable enough to be worth 
---
Rolling need only counts for valuable items: blues and purples, generally. The shaman doesn't deserve the gold value of shaman gear more than I do.
---
You'll be real sad if you read the comments above you lol
---
First off, I'm not the OP. 
---
Second, if the boe epic is an upgrade, its an upgrade, despite your protestation to the contrary. 
---
Third, if most are shit, why would you think you can get 500g for them? And in that case, why would you bother needing?
---
Rolling on an off-class item is actually poor form though since the value you'll get on the item is way less than someone else. On the other hand everyone gets the same value from a BOE epic, so why shouldn't everyone roll need?
---
I still do, granted most of my runs are with guildies and I'm nowhere near BiS items yet. Hell half the time we'll pass instead of greeding so the enchanters can squabble over it and pay us back in free enchants later.
---
There's something to be said for the excitement of seeing a blue drop and getting to actually use it as an upgrade for one of you as opposed it being just another pile of gold, even if it is leaving money on the table.
---
When queuing with randoms or once we get to the point that single drops will pay for an entire mount on their own I guess we will reconsider that policy.
---
Did I state what my behavior is? I only pointed out why your analogy is flawed.
---
Keep a few things in mind: 
---
VW sac is the ultimate anti gank tool. While levelling I’ve taken on 2 ppl multiple times, in large part because in total I had more hp than both my enemies together (sac, hearthstone, soulstone, and a 2nd sac while I was soul Link spec). Time spent not ganked is effectively xp.
---
What lvl did you test at? VW gains a new lvl of taunt every 10 lvls, so it will be weakest at 19,29,39 etc. 
---
With a void walker you can handle just about anything. In a new area and accidentally way over pull? Even at 4+ mobs at a time you’ll be okey between the VW aoe taunting and then turning into a shield as needed. I’m 55 now and I don’t think I’ve died 10 times yet - counting quests and pvp encounters.
---
As for guides, no afraid not. I can recommend the classic wow warlock discord though, try asking there.
---
Was on auto-run through the northern barrens heading NE, ran through a pack of lions on accident, almost died, and another player, with his own pack of lions, also shows up right nearby. We managed to keep each other alive but oofda, being killed by a pack of lions 7 levels lower than me because i wasn't paying attention would have been a rough way to go. Pay attention when running folks.
---
The pop balances are basically even and the ones that aren’t are just as likely to favor alliance as horde.
---
I think it's just a Reddit thing, haven't heard of anyone actually using these greedy all ninja rules in game.
---
"Have you read this thread? People are threatening ignores and "blacklists" left, right and center, not that that bothers me because anyone who would do that I wouldn't want to play with anyway, but they're still threatening it."
---
I don't think you understand what the word threat means. 
---
"Why does the existence of the loot frame matter?"
---
So you are petitioning Wow Classic to add a loot frame to silk cloth. 
---
Should we extend this loot frame to all profession materials? 
---
Should we extend this loot frame to ALL items?
---
It does not work like that with mobs.
---
Locked chests for the rogue 
---
If he doesn’t need sth he can let there be a roll for it 
---
Simple as that
---
That seems like a good pace. Quest rewards and vendor values go up quite a bit around this level, you should be able to afford you mount at or soon after 40.
---
Yeah it was like my third or fourth kill. Didn't realize it was considered rare.
---
You don't seem to understand that BoPs are inherently different
---
They aren't tradeable, so they aren't worth the same to everyone. The BoP upgrade is more valuable to be used than sold or d/Ed. Obviously this is because of the opportunity cost:
---
You can only get BoPs off the boss that drops them. You have to kill only that boss for them. BoEs are random. 
---
That's why the policy only applies to BoEs, because they have the exact same value to everyone.
---
But hey if you want to open yourselves up to ninjas and have to blacklist half the server, be my guest but don't pretend to have some moral superiority
---
But you're also describing any game with performance issues.
---
Theres no laws in wow, no lawyers to sue with. Just trust. With anonymous people you may never group with again. That's a recipe to be taken advantage of.
---
Maybe I'm weird but unless it's a pre raid best in slot for someone I'm totally on the "ninja's" side. I typically tell the whole group to need whenever a boe blue or purple drop. Even if it's an upgrade for me I am still going to sell it.
---
Got two guys 
---
Lvl 43 hunter tauren 
---
Gold: 80 legit poor as shit after i buy mount 
---
Professions: skinning 225 and lw like 50 
---
Gear: lvling 
---
And a 
---
Lvl 21 rogue orc
---
Gold: 7 
---
Professions: BS and Mining
---
So glad I play pve
---
If you want hamstring I'd drop the two in charge for it not OP. You'll be okay dropping the points in defiance but you'll probably want them back once bwl and beyond comes out. I'm not sure how effective iron will is, most people are just going to run a PvP trinket. While toughness would help reduce melee damage in PvP and pve.
---
Why bother trying to get that when you can easily get Kentic Amice from BRD which is an easy boss to get and drops like candy? And is arguably better than the Devout Mantle, anyway?
---
If only they just used it for emergencies...
---
&gt;It’s not the same value though.
---
It's value is literally quantifiable in gold. The item is worth 500g to someone who needs to equip it, and worth 500g to someone who wants to sell it.
---
If you equip a boe you are essentially spending money, because you just deprived yourself of a chance to sell it.
---
Runecloth Gloves is the way too go imo. 20 Runecloth, 4 Rugged Leather and 1 Rune Thread.
---
Look at how many people respond to this, you need to put the ninja on blast. I'm gonna need a name and server name, that way you increase the odds of shaming that person. If they happen to be on my server then even better. We can nail this sob so that nothing he sells on the ah is ever bought and he is excommunicated from any group or guild. Bam, guess that gold wasn't that necessary after all.
---
people aren't sure what your point is because running like shit isnt really a "good" quality of a game
---
The glory of earthbind is using a swing timer to dip out of mob range after you swing and then go back in when you are able to swing again.
---
Only use spells to pull, drop totems, then autoattack. This resets your mp5 and allows you to regen some mana during the fight.
---
While leveling as enhance, I would drop my totems near the mobs I would fight, shock the mob, then Autoattack it down and continue like this until the totems expired, then I would move and start over.
---
It's probably both. We know for a fact Blizzard is trying their best to limit expenses (which is the reason they came up with phasing to begin with). For years the current retail client (and now Classic client too) has been developed with LOW COST in mind. How to fit as many people into a server as possible with the least amount of workload.
---
It was a red flag on day 1 for many people when they told us they were going to 'down-port' the retail client to Classic. 
---
I was hoping a multi billion dollar company had some foresight and invested time and resources into making the client able to perform WITHOUT just phasing people out... but I guess that was asking too much of modern day Blizzard Entertainment.
---
The question is then, will they get away with it or not? I fear they will because the amount of Blizzard apologists is unreal on reddit. We may never get better realms.
---
But isn't that mostly end-game ? What about levelling, do you have a talent spread ?
---
I disagree that it's being nice to trade it to them if it's an upgrade. Even if it a BOE if someone intends to equip and use they are entitled to that item over someone who would just want to sell it. Same as a BOP
---
Which means that you’re all right, right?  
---
I won’t contest he’s a dumbass, but he clearly raises some valuable issues which everyone wants to ignore for some reason. Probably enjoying telling others they’re wrong.
---
My example was a 400+ gold epic BoE item no where did I say anything about any and all BoE upgrades read what you are replying to
---
If the group is upfront about always needing got blues/purps at the start of the dungeon, does it matter?
---
This is spoken like someone who has yet to actually be confronted with the option at this stage in a server's economic life cycle.
---
Steal it from who? The 4 other people who also rolled need?
---
Lmao
---
But I'm a priest though?
---
Mana spring are only really beneficial for your party, not you.
---
You reset a mana/5 rule and only actually gain mana 2/3 into its duration.
---
At least the adorned water spirit trinket totem doesn't cost mana and has the same mana restore as if it was mana tide rank .5 , with the added benefit of a shorter cool down. If you also happen to take the improved mana totem talent, it makes it restore quite a bit of mana over its relatively short duration.
---
then you dont understand the purpose of boe
---
"There are so few multiboxers that you literally won't ever even see one in-game."  
---
\*meanwhile they are literally everywhere in this thread trying to defend their obviously shitty hobby\*
---
// points //
---
Here, in the bathing suit area.
---
I think perhaps we disagree on what need means.
---
I see need as a grey area in cases where a BoE can sell for 30g+. The item can either be a direct upgrade for the person who can use it immediately, or if sold it could be used to purchase an upgrade for someone else. At lower levels, damn near everyone actually needs gold. The economy in Classic is far more impacting on progression than in Retail. Additionally, everyone earned its value by working together as a group - it is not necessarily more valuable to one person if it equates to someone else purchasing an upgrade from selling it on the AH. When it drops and the roll box show up, it is a *potential* upgrade for everyone.
---
But we do agree on the most important part which should happen every time anyway - set the loot rules before the run. My loot rules will be different than yours (need BoEs to avoid a bad experience) and that is based additionally on what I wrote above. But if people have a problem with that, either they or I will leave the group to avoid conflict.
---
Happened to me with this guy, ran him all the way to town, finally just had to kill him.
---
These are all great i enjoy them all thank you OP
---
Yeah I miss the old days. I remember being in a raid when we’d have a problem we’d open a ticket and get a response in under an hour. It’s always a day now. And the new system sucks fucking ass. You have to get Super specific can’t type your problem anymore. Half the time I have to click a random subject. Then I enter too many sentences and it won’t fit. I have a way around that though. I write in a wordpad file my situation then save it as .txt this way you can attach it to certain tickets and I tell them to read the attachment. It works.
---
Maybe you should've gotten vaccinated.
---
The Zperl addon I’m using also does it
---
It is not ninja looting if everyone has agreed to it before hand.
---
Thanks for the additional info. I forgot about yellow hits.
---
cuz there reddit losers
---
In principle you should.. but generally greens are common and not usually an upgrade so it doesn't matter. 
---
It allows people to get a little upgrade without having to waste time pestering whoever won the roll
---
What is with some of the flight path logic? Horde Felwood to Ashenvale is the most retarded thing I've seen in a video game recently
---
The only correct answer to this is to discuss this with the group before the run and see what you can agree on. 
---
Stop blowing this out of proportion people. This conversation is like people being against other guilds running loot councils because it’s unfair to the raiders, but they aren’t even in the group.
---
You can look at /r/classicwowoffhours there are a few guilds who look for early morning raiders. You will likely have to tramsfer your character.
---
You could do prison runs at 49 but you may have aggro problems. 
---
I was doing arena/prison runs with a 49 tank and me healing at 52, it was a tad slow but we managed just fine.
---
I play rogue lol :D
---
Nope, it's a way to shield myself from tricksters who say, "I am rolling to equip" and then auction it.
---
Or people who say, "everyone roll greed to sell. It's *greed* that makes us want the money therefore we should roll *greed*"--as though matching that up thematically matters at all--and then they roll need and sell the item.
---
Everyone rolling need is the only way to protect against these people. 
---
You're basically saying to me "locking your front door is a creative way to justify your own greed. if you weren't so greedy you'd leave that front door unlocked so that someone could potentially steal your stuff."
---
Please. Ride your high horse off a cliff.
---
Then need it anyways because it's just a bunch of gold.
---
That’s what I’ve done as well removed her invisibility from auto casting and the problem is fixed. I find the succ better than the hound personally. 
---
That being said I want bliss to fix the bug.
---
Warriors can raid with 2 handers.  That said, the eye should go to whoever can realistically craft it, whatever class they are.
---
I never said it was impressive. Obviously it's a sitting crit just for the clip. You still sound extremely jealous.
---
&gt; I consider that a large enough sample size to speak for the server. 
---
It's not.
---
&gt; as per my experience 
---
Mmhmm, there it is.
---
&gt; My server doesn't roll like that, as per my experience. 
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Exactly, most people consider a boe epic to be exchangeable/ a down payment on another
---
Did you roll need?
---
Did they roll need?
---
Undead mages are the equivalent of undead rogues. I've encountered way more asshole mages than rogues playing Classic.
---
Can't speak much of gnome mages since I'm alliance and unfortunately can't kill them, but all gnomes should be drowned in the nearest puddle anyway.
---
yeah, all of this was done straight. No questing inbetween. It probably took like 17 hours or something
---
Lol, I mean 34 is a bit low for the mobs that spawn on you.
---
But yeah, there was a HUGE glut of these fishing pole on Hordeside AH for weeks, I assume that's still the case now but I haven't bother checking Ah for these fishing poles specifically anymore.
---
It's not though. 
---
Want to know why?
---
Your "logic" only benefits you. It's okay for a party member that I group with a lot gets good items, because they can help me! My D&amp;D group can get items because I'll be there too. Other people? Fuck you give me money.
---
Stop being so selfish, and maybe you'll understand that your attitude is the problem.
---
I've also found this, im priest and I'll heal an arm run if there's a cath run after haha
---
You’re an idiot
---
&gt; So you are petitioning Wow Classic to add a loot frame to silk cloth.
---
&gt; Should we extend this loot frame to all profession materials?
---
&gt;Should we extend this loot frame to ALL items?
---
You're the one who wants to make arbitrary factors decide who gets an item and who doesn't, so I'd ask you that question.
---
But you seem to have a hard time answering questions so I'm not sure that's much help.
---
&gt; is demanding people give you the silk they looted any less reasonable than demanding you pass on edgemasters?
---
Everyone needs money is Ninja Justification and it doesn't fly. 
---
If it were a Warrior Tank in the group the protocol would be everyone roll Greed and War rolls Need, then equipping in front of everyone if he intends to use.  If he intends to sell he should also roll Greed.
---
Get that lame ass shit Ninja thinking outta here.
---
Here's the fallacy in that logic. You are stuck on making 1 player stronger with a boe that may sit in the ah until phase 2 or 3. The player you are currently grouping with can use it immediately. The net gain for your faction is about 10x that if the player gets the item than it being sold in the auction. And if that item gets sold at a lower price it's probable that it'll sit in auction by some ah farmer for weeks or more. This is classic not retail. You have to understand how there are only a few thousand people and you are forced to interact with them unless blizz let's you transfer servers. If I were you I would seriously reconsider your thoughts on this because you are going to develop a bad name on your server and once that's gone it's all downhill.
---
Thank you, this is a good tip.
---
Ironically, I *just* found a guild that popped up that raids at 8am, just 30 minutes ago lol, fate I guess.
---
Ten runs, dropped once. Lost to the warlock. Ubrs has 3 or 4 drops I need so I go there.
---
I know what greed means. It means you roll on something for greedy reasons. But my point is that for most BOE's it's an unwritten rule that you all need on super valuable items. 
---
I don't think you need or greed applies to BOE's that are worth a fortune. 
---
It hasn't on my server at least. Every time a very valuable drop has dropped someone has said "All need" and we've all needed.
---
Good to see you have the time to respond to nearly every comment here.
---
You are very misinformed if you think server lag and PC lag are the same.
---
Do they both stop you from playing properly? Yes.
---
Do they function the same? Hell no
---
PC lag= Frames are very low and it looks like a slideshow at times. Not caused by the network or server at all
---
Server Lag= Rubber banding, people walking in place, high latency that causes your actions to have massive delays. Frame rate does not affect this at all. You could have the best PC in the world but if the server you are connected to is having these issues you will feel it.
---
Please don't act like they are on in the same. I've played with crappy PC's and been able to manage it. Playing with high latency is near impossible at times.
---
No no no, you don’t get to just assert what I have or haven’t experienced. The performance here is better than it was in vanilla wow. You said the performance got worse instead of better but that’s not true. Anything that makes the game come to a standstill now would’ve done so far sooner in vanilla. I can understand wanting it to be better still, but your assertion that it is worse is obviously just not correct.
---
Your logic is fucking terrible. 
---
How is them passing on that bag of gold so someone else can likely have a big upgrade "entitled"?
---
Clearly you only focused on them needing for an upgrade because the heart of your viewpoint and argument is being a selfish fuck.
---
You're the kind of player I pull the entire instance on then feign death :D
---
Personal loot exists because Blizzard got tired of getting ninja looter tickets on cases that weren't even ninja looting, like OPs.
---
Should be.. but they should just leave that part out.
---
Of course they're appreciated
---
Warlock sending their succubus in to pull: *Watch this!*
---
For rohan!
---
My advice would be to level as [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05002-00505-5002) spec till 40 (continued into [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0502301-00505-50023)). If you have already committed to other talents, it's fine as long as you have 5/5 Wand Spec and 5/5 Spirit Tap.
---
At 40, you should respec for [Shadow Form](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0502301-00505-50023). Your solo killing speed will increase drastically at this point. For the next 5 levels, put points back into Wand Spec. After 45, you can either keep putting points into Discipline like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0502301--5002325100511051), or you can put points into Blackout like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05001--5502325100511051). Personally, I would put points into Discipline.
---
After 51, I strongly suggest you continue on into Discipline like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0502311305--5002325100511051) or [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023113--5502325100511051) to get Meditation (which will start being more useful as your gear will have more and more intellect on it) and Mental Agility, which reduces the mana cost of instant casts like Renew, SW:P and PW:S.
---
Alternatively, if you decide to switch to dungeon levelling to get your pre-raid PvE/PvP BiS, you could respec to a Disc/Holy spec like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0512301305051-2050510203) in your early to mid 50's, although if done properly, you can definitely heal end-game dungeons as Shadow (it's just a bit hairy at times).
---
I feel like I have to mention this too: Make sure you have a GOOD wand! After 40, try to get a Shadow wand to take advantage of Shadow Weaving.
---
I hope this helps!
---
Oh I guess it must have been a private server thing , the rest are true tho , ill edit in the correction
---
Yeah I've had them not show up from time to time but never crotch shot like this before haha
---
Imagine how everyone who **doesn't** get a free mount feels about the travel ;)  But really, if you're afflic, grinding is just fine to move through the 40s drudgery. Questing is beneficial if you can find many quests in a small area, and if the gear is a big upgrade over what you have.
---
You have to bounce around because of the fact the level ranges are so big in the zones...you will come back
---
Do you fall over a lot? I wasn't talking about BoE's in my little example.
---
&gt; That could literally be said for any item.
---
Thats been happening since streaming was a thing.
---
Because it is greedy. Saying you are entitled to an expensive drop just because it's an upgrade to you is greedy and selfish. Nothing odd about it.
---
Wait, wait, wait hold on a minute.
---
"And if the person who would get the most benefit of the item got it over others, isn't that better for everyone?"
---
You lost me here.
---
MONEY IS KING
---
Are you saying that we should loot on who benefits the most, and in turn that will benefit everyone as a whole?
---
The only benefit is the benefit of MONEY. Nothing matters more than money, always roll need.
---
It was from a chest
---
Sad or not its reality.
---
What happens when you get grouped with a ninja? You lose the item, and get nothing and can DO nothing. No police, no laws. For these kinds of drops, blizz wont get involved.
---
Basically you're saying it's sad that we have to lock our doors at night. Yea its sad. But that's reality. Never been burgled but why leave myself open to it?
---
Talk to people, run UBRS a bunch. Basically just network with people.
---
If you inspect someone and they are in a guild, with a handful of epics on them ask them if they raid, what times and if they are recruiting.
---
Check the log since it says they learn X ?
---
I get that, you were literally a third poster on this subreddit about that same thing yesterday, so I said that the odds were pretty good yesterday.
---
A joke. :)
---
Doesn't mean it isn't fun to root for the underdogs
---
Yeah, I think this is because of our DAre bear form :)
---
I usually see “the spirit of classic” referencing add ons that contradict why we want classic instead of retail.
---
I use Quartz and ClassicCastBar. Using the twitch desktop app.
---
They actually didnt knew another guild would flank them from the other side, so it makes it even cooler.
---
Why not do those things on your Hunter?
---
&gt; Botting is a program autonomously doing an action. Automatic meaning a self-regulating system without human input. Multiboxing isn't botting because there is nothing automatic
---
All accounts except the first one are being automated, by definition, and in reality. Nothing you say changes this fact. It IS automation. It is botting, again, by definition.
---
Indeed it is, but unfortunately I don’t plan to spec holy :(
---
&gt; Every post since has been what I describe as "feeding the troll"
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg
---
&gt; Cmon bro, are you running out of arguments?
---
Arguments to be laid out? Yea, I have.
---
Arguments that has yet to be responded to? No.
---
&gt; I thought we were talking about needing vs greeding and how you greedy bastards only care about MONEY
---
Yes, wanting an equal split of the loot in a dungeon is greedy indeed, way more greedy that demanding you get priority on part of the money, that's absolutely a reasonable stance to hold.
---
Yeah but I will miss out on BoP items
---
Then all roll need.
---
Offical? I'm not talking about going by Wowhead / Aalakazam which has users logging drops and submitting their data points. Sure this pretty accurate with enough submissions, but they didn't reset the data to my knowledge for any adjustments in the loot table,
---
That arrow turning :D
---
I’m not sure I understand the logic behind this. On one hand a lot of the bis lists are flat out wrong, but on the other hand they’re a great starting point for what to focus on getting. Go ahead and get your full t0 set if you want, but when I’m chain running live strat for orbs or scholo for runes I want to be able to keep the group rolling as the healer. Having that +healing that allows me to downrank means I quite literally never need to drink in a 5 man unless I’m doing damage as well, which I’m most often doing since renew is usually enough to keep a tank alive for 90% of 5 man content when you’ve got a “proper” healing set.
---
What the fuck are you talking about
---
Buy, it's camped to hell since the devilsaurs are static spawn points, and static respawn timers very easy for a handful of people to camp them on cooldown.
---
Hand of Ragnaros is a pvp weapon and has no practical use in pve.
---
And what if he's just practicing fearing people off the boat?
---
Yeh that’s what I was thinking. If I had recently turned 60 I would absolutely roll on it (as undead).
---
I'm not butthurt. "Technology bad" boomer humor has never been funny. The amount of people jerking eachother off and patting eachother on the back for not understanding the appeal of livestreams in this sub is retarded. Dude just said he enjoyed live streams and you guys bullied him into deleting his comment. Let people enjoy things.
---
Suck on this kick, clothie!
---
Same man! and I agree. Sometimes you want to have a good, well intentioned convo and it gets derailed becuase you can't really give a stranger on the internet the time out of your day to really get into it. 
---
100% I fall into this all the time. I think I called someone in this thread a ninja because both of us were just kinda arguing like dicks instead of really having a convo like I did with a few others. 
---
We are all trying to get better always &lt;3 Hope you get some Phat Ass loot tonight my friend
---
Grouping with you is obviously never worth it.
---
There are more ways to get an upgrade than taking the gold from somebody else.
---
&gt; The brilliant design of WoW is basically turning all of the zones into their own Disneyland-style contained area. A brilliant design choice 100% ruined by adding flying mounts.
---
This encapsulates everything that makes the Classic Wow map great.
---
They use oversize trees, buildings, and hills to hide sight lines even within zones to make them feel larger and more diverse than they are.
---
I hope whoever is designing whatever will become Classic+ understands this and doesn't drag us into BC and the rest of the expansions flying over this great design.
---
Just ignore them and convert all your screenshots to phone pictures. Until they stop being a minority and gain the ability to downvote phone picture posts significantly, they can whine all they want.
---
I did 0 of the hillsbrad quests on one of my characters.  Not every quest is needed.
---
A lot of green quests require killing grey mobs, which should be avoided like the plague.
---
You are literally saying that someone rolling Need with the intent to use is more greedy than someone rolling Need to sell. 
---
The opposite of the intended use of the features described mechanics, and the opposite as intended by the people who made the damn game, as evidenced by when they made rolling Need force BoP. Hell I even agree with the people that say everyone rolling Need is the practical way to go.
---
I most certainly don't give a shit about you telling me to not reply, pathetic.
---
No sir, I play on Old Blanchy
---
Not really. If you give everyone a chance of gear there is a possibility that people will leave with that gear. People are flighty and and having that gear gone will prevent that guild from even taking off. I was with my guild back in the day for a month before I was even considered for receiving gear but after showing my dedication to the group I'm a core member and I have been raiding with these guys for years now and they are actually pretty close friends.
---
I love ElvUI, but I have to make a conscious effort to not dive too deep into the settings or I end up spending hours on configuration.
---
&gt; I think there’s a general rule of if it’s worth a significant amount and is BoE, then everybody should value it as gold rather than the item’s use.
---
There is not. Unless you're talking about the ninjas, who do generally follow that rule.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'm mainly concerned with how engaging the end game will be with the debuff limit, so mainly only casting shadowbolt. I think I've got it down to either warlock or warrior though. 
---
Why would alliance warlocks have less gear competition vs horde?
---
That's not how multiplayer networking works. The server receives every players action, but it only sends updates to players within range of each other. So, if you have 10 players in 10 different zones, those 10 players send their actions to the server and the server sends updates to those 10 individual players. 10 in 10 out. However, if they're all in the same zone, those 10 players send their actions to the server and then the server must send 10 updates to each player. 10 in 100 out.
---
Thats a funny way to spell C'thun.
---
No it is not the same as that. There is no input to display outputs.
---
Yes, all accounts except the first one are being played without direct input. That input is being relayed, through a program (bot), from the master to the slaves.
---
Now you know why multiboxing is botting.
---
Auto run is a specific function the game allows. Macros are also allowed so long as they don't automate more than one action, IE cast this then cast this (fishing). All your arguments are invalid.
---
/ignore also works wonders
---
Exactly my point. It's as simple as adding one word to clarify what's going on and to avoid issues.
---
I have this issue at work when dealing with sales people, I don't need it playing video games.
---
So it's just an "I have sex" sticker. Neat. I don't give a fuck.
---
So it was you, huh. YOU TOOK MY NAME!
---
It's not about you being sneaky..discussions like this indicate that it's not given for granted that everyone agree on needing on BoE.
---
 If I press greed (not pass, greed, it means "I want the item to sell it") and you press need without agreeing the rules in advance and you refuse to roll it again once clarified that you're not deliberately stealing from me you're still a ninja looter. 
---
Make a macro if you don't want to lose time writing but when you join a party please say "Hey guys do we agree on needing on any purple/blue BoE we will drop?". It will make clear the rules you want the party to agree with and avoid unpleasant situations
---
Get a mount asap and start questing. Gold rewards really start to scale after the 40’s. Get about 15-20g an hour while questing in Feralas atm and I’m 47.
---
Because it was objectively terrible DPS compared to everything else until the last patch before WotLK launched and it only really offered 1 semi useful buff that other classes also offered an alternative to. I also raided and PvPed as a retadin, but I'm not so blind or naive that I don't realize that I was hindering the raid by playing the spec I did compared to rolling anything else lol.
---
Oh shit don’t post that on here. All the min maxers will get you!
---
Please dm me if you have luck bc that exp tracker that tells you how many kills to level sounds amazing
---
When it was first formed yes
---
I’ve never had this problem in 5 man’s
---
Paladins too, so so many guilds looking for paladins Alliance-side right now
---
So before the raid it was decided that the council could distribute loot however they wanted. Everyone agreed to it when they ran the raid. The council decided only raiders get loot. What is the problem here. They did exactly what they said they would.
---
"Don't make me get my mmmmaaaaaiiiinnnnnn"
---
brilliant argument.
---
Since you might not know how valuable a boe is, then the safer bet is still to need along with everyone.
---
All need is the only option that makes sense for anyone that wants a chance at the item at all. It's a prisoner's dilemma. Just roll need.
---
Or dont play with strangers. That too.
---
Because you're the ninja trying to get other people to roll greed so you can take it. You're not fooling anyone.
---
Well, and as it stands right now, I'd agree with you that something like this does need to be discussed ahead of time, since it isn't the status quo. But I'd be in favor of it being a community-wide expectation.
---
Why do you think you’re “1337” ?
---
Edit: mobile is slow.
---
What damage/threat addon is that?
---
This is great content. Thanks for posting. Im new to wow, but under manning dungeons was always a favorite pastime of mine in other mmo
---
Use the appropriate channels, but start your own group as a druid tank. You'll get people pretty quickly. Just add "can teleport!" if you aren't.
---
*Tons* of Horde skip gnomer because they don't realise they can teleport directly inside from BB.
---
Worse. Phasing is a system that completely removes the 'realm' from the equation. On retail WoW it doesn't matter what 'realm' you're on. The server just spits people in and out into your layer/phase as it pleases. People from other realms will pop in for no reason and leave again for no reason and you'll never see them again.
---
Whenever something interesting happens (large amount of people in one place) it'll spit the people out into different phases so it doesn't overload the server.. etc.
---
That's what the retail client is made to do. It's literally designed and coded to avoid having to perform.
---
Classic WoW is using that same client, so it's no wonder large battles lag. For the past many years absolutely 0 improvement has been made to large scale fights. (because there was no need, because of phasing)
---
Roll need on any blue or purple boe.  If half the group rolls greed let them reroll to see if they beat your need roll.
---
I'm assuming you're not a ninja, and the group would be reasonable.  Of course, it's also easier if you just tell the group at the beginning of the run to roll need on blue and purple boe because then nobody can ninja.
---
I’ve been making bank selling steel and mythril bars
---
I believe you can link your profession recipe book in chat. Which also lets you check to make sure they don't already know the recipe.
---
What? It takes like 0.75 seconds to pickpocket 3 enemies.
---
Well, that is your opinion man, but it still does make you an asshole.  Needing on BoE's that you can't use DOES make you an asshole.  Hands down.
---
It's reportable and Blizz can yoink the loot back for you. That's how.
---
As far as i know most easier content and by that i mean like most dungeons, maybe everything thats not a raid essentialy, is tankable while in dps spec as a warrior, just put on a shield and maybe some tank gear if you feel like it and you're practically good to go. So respeccing shouldnt be anything you have to get used to.
---
No you are dumb
---
&gt; So the fact that this feature cost a raid tier
---
They already said many times that the selfie camera was made by one dev, in his "free" time (not exactly free because it's still work). So saying that this "CoSt A rAiD tIeR" is just plain wrong.
---
&gt; I'd say maybe the guy had a legitimate beef
---
He didn't even know the item EXISTED, it's clear from his post. Read the thread you are posting on.
---
I pass on jade
---
Wow that's interesting, I notice when I commanding shout the roaches or rat do run away towards mobs. I will have to keep an eye out for this tonight, I wonder if UBRS has some mobs with the same problems ?
---
Lol if you say so buddy
---
The way the loot system was designed is that it leaves it up to the individual player to decide whether the item is something they need for character progression, or something that they would just like to have. If your concept of the game is such that you don’t feel gold can help progress your character, you don’t have to roll need I guess, but you have a weird concept of the game and sure aren’t in any position to force anyone else into that silly decision which clearly goes against the way the game was designed.
---
Well, can you handle the elites on your own? Is your server high pop or low pop? are there optimal times where there are less players where you can adequately farm the leather without being interrupted? Will you be ganked? Is this outweighing your ability to farm gold outside of the leather ie will you be hindered in other reams of farming/pre-raid if you sink all your gold into someone else's leather?  
---
More, at 11, in the next episode of "Un'Goro Escapades"
---
No, at that point you get kicked it I am the group lead,  maybe ask the group to kick you, and add you to the blacklist.
---
Yea, I seriously can't believe people want to screw over 4 other people and claim "priority" just to get a bit of money.
---
&gt;Intent is not the whole picture. Consequences of actions is the whole picture.
---
I never said it wasn't, I was directly addressing your claim. Don't be dismissive.
---
&gt;The realistic perspective is not a singular position. If someone doesn’t call you back immediately and I say maybe they were busy, does that make me the arbiter of realism?
---
Again, you're arguing against a point I never made. No, saying that wouldn't make you an arbiter of realism per say, but prefacing or ending your statement with a claim such as "that's the realistic perspective" would. Which is what you did.
---
&gt;I don’t think you understand what I meant. These aren’t anecdotal stories, I could link you many real examples. At this point though I’m out of steam on this. 
---
Even so, that isn't a justification for making claims on someone else based on the actions of another and it's got nothing to do with the intent of OP, something you claimed to know.
---
&gt;But you’re extrapolating that to mean things I didn’t say.
---
I'm not. Logically speaking, you cannot say what's realistic or not if it's impossible for you to know the full context. That's what I said. 
---
On the other hand, if you attempted to imply that simply listing off possibilities is the "realistic" thing to do, then that is still a false claim.
---
&gt;Personal anecdotes inform our world views. 
---
Doesn't matter, that doesn't change the nature of what a personal anecdote really is. Saying "I got my world view from stories my nan told me" doesn't make it factual.
---
&gt;If someone tells you that bleach is healthy, do you tell the personal explaining how someone close to them died from it that they have no basis? 
---
Not online they don't, because it's not verifiable, I thought that was one of your points? In that case both of them are making personal claims that have not been verified, if you're going to make a legitimate founded argument it would have to be based on fact.
---
&gt;I’ve made my case many times.
---
You've changed your argument many times and have become quite dismissive
---
&gt;Considering I was see many comments asserting how real this post is and how anyone who doesn’t agree should have comment deleted, it seems like a statement to me.
---
I haven't seen that personally, but regardless that doesn't alter the substance of your argument. 
---
&gt;Unfortunate that stating the obvious seems so contentious.
---
It isn't contentious, it's just utterly pointless. Like stating the sky is blue and acting like you're offering a unique perspective. 
---
Anyway, I'll respect your wish and won't be responding anymore.
---
Purple Lotus is barely selling above vendor price on Grobbulus, but the Wildvine from PL nodes is still demanding a premium.
---
The difference here is that there was no warrior or anyone in the group that could use it.
---
When you run with pugs it's best to have everyone roll need to reduce the temptation for someone to wait till the last second to roll need and then hearth out.
---
Amazing tool, thanks
---
I'm fine with that.
---
I had a 60 hunter sitting on the top of the bank build at ratchet killing people at the flight path.
---
Fish the pools in the barrens
---
You moonlight as trans?
---
Man, your username is spot on.
---
They won't be banned they'll just have the item taken away as it's seen by Blizzard as legitimate griefing to go against loot rules. You just need the chat logs.
---
&gt;I had someone get angry at me because I needed an item instantly like I always do with all BoEs.
---
&gt;Easiest ignore of my life... people are morons
---
I dunno dude, you kind of sound like the moron here. Just roll greed unless you actually need the item.
---
Gratz! For The Horde!!!
---
My guild made sure the raid got loot before officers. So I’ve been skipped tons and that’s fine by me. I’ve gotten one piece out of 10-15 potential items. Some people don’t know how to use LC effectively and it doesn’t surprise me that a wipefest guild is ran by those people. You want those trials showing up next week, so give them loot. In other words, their rank shouldn’t exclude them from loot. Sometimes it’s a factor but it shouldn’t be the deciding factor EVERY time. 
---
Find a new guild.
---
Then why is there even a need/greed system?
---
&gt;It actually, is
---
Considering almost every server has a "High" to "Full" population, playing with 500ish players (benefit of the doubt) is absolutely not indicative of any server wide behaviour whatsoever.
---
&gt;Obviously, the more experience you have, the more accurate you'll be.
---
Agreed, 100%. However, unless you've done a server wide census that quizzes the stance of your entire server, you have no right to speak on behalf of every player on your server. You're just one man, with one ideology. I might play on your server, don't force that ideology on me.
---
I would say, however, that I personally agree with you on this unless Need on BOE's is agreed upon before hand. Regardless of whether or not you've blocked me, I hope anyone who reads this understands how silly it is to claim to be a representative of your entire server.
---
anyone that can kite them.
---
I am bringing an example, also I have seen a few 100g+ BoE drops myself. But good to see that you are admitting that there is a line after what it is reasonable to need for everyone, at least we are getting somewhere. ;)
---
They wanted to use the same client because of b.net integration.. but obviously nobody thought about performance issues.
---
Please point me to the actual definition of in game automation, I'm very interested to read what it states.
---
Otherwise what you're just stating is opinion, which I've already covered many people have differing ones.
---
They’re level 39-41 so 195-205 I think. And they drop heavy leather and tough leather. Heavy vendors for 30s a stack and thick leather is like 50-60s a stack vendor. Don’t do AH myself right now prices are too low to turn a good profit for time invested
---
And suddenly OP disappears.
---
I have an addon that tells me that will check what it's called when I get home.
---
It also tells you how many dungeons or quests you need and time to level etc.
---
&gt; "Even if you intend on using an item, winning it is literally nothing but a monetary gain."
---
&gt; and follow up the comment with
---
&gt; "No, I'm saying that despite it being a direct upgrade for you, winning it is nothing more than winning a sack of gold."
---
So what I'm saying is consistent? Is that where you're going now?
---
Oh that's all? Then a huge portion of games are ahead of their time.  
---
That's a very optimistic way of saying that the game was poorly made for the hardware that existed when it was made.
---
Ha yeah, but you see it all the time amongst the Chuck Norris and Keanu Reeves jokes in the Barrens chat.
---
You must be on about counter-strike, but my reference was to Epic Games (Fortnite).
---
Failing to understand the lengths publishers are going to squeeze extra cash from gamers (in a predatory manner) is the insanity here. There are no tin foil hats, this shit is happening. 
---
Blizzard included, and Overwatch / Hearthstone are great examples. They are now being forced to disclose probability of items, to comply with regulations in some countries. US will probably get on board by enforcing compliance with gambling laws.
---
Oh hey I'm undead rogue too. Thank you friend!
---
.8ppm, if it were 1ppm it would be 4% and human fury bis until CTS.
---
That doesn't mean much coming from you.
---
That's not it. I have that addon and the one on this picture looks different.
---
Is Molten Core and Onyxia raids already available? Why am I not seeing them on LFG channel?
---
Help him outside of party. Let him get the first hit on things. Full XP for him, twice as fast questing.
---
Dual bro. Dual.

---
&gt; If a player wins a Need roll under the Need Before Greed system on a Bind on Equip item, the item will become Soulbound to that player. The item will remain unbound if won via a Greed roll.
---
Only 4 expansions to go until it does again!
---
So is that same logic also true for BoE greens?  Since they can be bought on auction house?
---
the only issue i see here: if you don't have a brain, don't use neutral AH to transfer mats.
---
This has nothing to do with layering or botting. Any sniping addon would have picked this up. TSM has been around for years, just because he's salty now people should be banned for using TSM? lol
---
As a Karen, you should ask to speak to their guild leader.
---
So it's fair for someone to get to do what they want with an item worth hundreds of gold because they could potentially use it? Cause I could potentially use that hundreds of gold and get a boe that matches my class too. Seems like too much trust to put on some random guy but what do i know? I'm just a weirdo who also locks his doors at night, regular old curmudgeon that I am.
---
Same lol
---
Alright well most people aren't you. The world doesn't revolve around your specific situation.
---
I played on nost, elysium, and ascension. Starter zones were pretty much the same type of shitshow. You could not move. On ascension you had to leave to reroll abilities because everyone kept having the ding effect go up. Cant imagine what large scale pvp would have been.
---
The trials who leave prove the point of not giving trials loot as the gear wouldn't stay in guild, thus not making future runs easier.
---
If you have even 25% PUG, you should just be rolling for loot (mainspec only), and have a -15 penalty to rolls for each piece you've won.  
---
You start to gear the most reliable raiders once you're doing nearly an entire guild run, and some people will fall out because they joined later than other raiders/officers, but that's the point. Shake out the dead weight and people with no patience early, but not in a pug group.
---
You don't need to be in a party to help him.
---
As long as he's the one that attacks the mob first, the kill will count to him, the exp and loot.
---
That's what we call *"tag the mob"*. Attack it first so it counts for you, and I'll help you kill it.
---
As a mage AoE grinding this has happened to me I just frost nova the mobs on the chest and they attack the guy.
---
In Runescape everything you do in a group is free to trade with no binding or anything, it usually drops to the player who contributes the most towards the kill. You sell it and split the gold outside of ironman for the most part.
---
The chicken in westfall is pretty fun.
---
Not at all. As long as everyone has a fair chance it it, it's free to take.
---
Kinda getting sick of the Pre-raid BiS Champions.  Let me use what drops, it's not like the content is terribly difficult; squeezing that extra 0.5% effectiveness of my character isn't that vital.
---
On the flip side, whoever owns the site that made all the lists of pre-raid BiS gear for each class/spec is making bank.
---
 Job Done.
---
Np - I had the same issue myself initially. Realized I prefer the aoe threat of screech (Plus small pet survivability boost) over the damage of claw.
---
I just tamed broken tooth and using him over my owl is a huge huge threat difference -- the lack of screech is awful and the damage increase isn't as noticeable as the frequency of me pulling agro and the inability to use multishot on groups without pulling everything onto me.
---
Census has been broken for weeks, no way to tell how accurate any of that info is at this point
---
This is false, the stickers are legit so first responders will go to save the child. If they are responding to a multi car pile up the one with a child in it will get focused on first to Save the child as they cannot help themselves and are the weakest. New born and toddlers  are rushed to the hospital right away to under go tests while adults can be waited on. Especially since a baby in an accident can lead to internal decapitation which needs to be taken care of right away.
---
Grind, dont quest, unless the quest is close and asks you to grind.
---
Those were fan projects run on passion. They bought the servers they knew they'd need to have it run well. Blizzard is a profit driven company, they buy the cheapest servers they can get away with.
---
Because I'm not going to support you dipshits who ninja?
---
Seee Thun as my friend called it for years lols.
---
I did strat at level 59 last night. Quite a few BoE have dropped. Everyone respected gear drops based on class and who needed. Gauntles of Valor dropped for our tank. I'm a hunter. Nobody rolled need on it because it was an upgrade for the warrior. Even if Plaguehound Leggings have dropped, I would have rolled greed because I already have Devilsaur leggings.
---
Thats nice. Is it repeatable? does the whole server have enough gold to support that transaction over and over and over again? I have had things I priced at or below the "market price" sit on the ah for weeks. Still no guarantee it will sell for that price, so I'm not "false" or "ignorant". Your one sale doesn't make for an entire server being able to afford that one sale.
---
I’d start doing dungeons to collect gear. As for zones you have wpl, epl, ungoro, parts of hinterlands, blasted lands, swamp of sorrows, and silithis.
---
You will regret going full resto if you do any solo content/quests
---
My guild does which is the only thing that matters. Thats how most serious guilds operate. People are free to add me to their shit list based purely on speculation. I'm a level 53 tank. I'm gonna be in high demand. Its the replaceable dps that are gonna get the boot when there is a dispute.
---
&gt; Then you blacklist them, after a while they can't play anymore. 
---
Lol, what a meme. There's *thousands* of players on each server. Even if you spam LFG with your message about X being a ninja, even if a few people do blacklist him, you really think he's never going to get groups again? You really think he wasn't aware of that risk ahead of time and actually cares..? Especially if he's a tank, people will  *happily* group with ninja tanks so they at least have a chance at gear.
---
Everyone agreeing at the beginning of the instance to roll need on expensive BOEs is not "everyone being a ninja". It's making sure everyone has a 1/5 shot of getting a stack of money rather than trying to play nice with people who will never play nice.
---
This is awesome. It took me a second to get the stormwind tune, but once I got it I was jamming out haha. Great work!
---
Yes, actually it stop stacking after 1.5 levels. But we're talking about time /played here, so my point still stands
---
How many strat runs did you do?
---
Again, this link is for paper prints. Jesus Christ, what is the deal? Scams dude..
---
&lt;3
---
Long enough that i cant be bothered. The problem lies with you
---
I like the way you think. I mean, if we wanna assume you're not gonna get anything out of it, a little bit of gold would make it worth your while.
---
If you don't mind not getting anything and are just trying to help him get some exp fast while questing you can.
---
Stay out of his group and then wait for him to tag the monsters (their name plates will turn grey for you).  Once he has you can blow them up.  He should get full exp.
---
That's awesome! All my wife got for me was a divorce filing.
---
Crafting professions are a money drain.
---
The only way to make money off of them is to have recipes that are in high demand, such as counterweights, spurs, or shield spikes, but even then you are likely to make more money just by selling the pattern. The only real reason to level blacksmithing before 300 is because you also took mining, and don't want the ore wasting space in your inventory.
---
Now everyone can view Princess Theradras strutting around in her little bikini.
---
I paid 130g on Herod alliance and would do it again so fast. 
---
Seriously guys it's bis forever. In fact it's bis until you hit 70!!
---
They're available. You don't see many pickup raids because most people raid them only in guild groups. The lockout system in Classic means that entering the instance with one person who's locked out means you're locked out for the rest of the week too and you've lost your chance at loot even if you don't kill any new bosses.
---
I cant wait to be ostracized as a druid.
---
Everyone keeps telling me raids are a joke. 1 guy being bad is a real problem?
---
Bought mine for 220g. Just gotta watch the AH
---
I agree
---
If an expensive BoE drops, I'm going to let people know beforehand that I'm needing so they should as well. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the "it's an upgrade for me" comment only to see it in the AH a few hours later because they realize that 100g+ is worth more than a temporary upgrade.
---
I don't care what etiquette you, your guildies, or your old sever follows. I've always played this way and you shouldn't expect me to follow your rules if you haven't specified anything.
---
You have to be a troll or an idiot if you think people on the internet are generally nice.
---
My online character is female, but that’s not the joke  🤷‍♂️
---
Why is it hunters were considered the worst group in classic and now its unanimous that it’s mages.
---
Because everyone participated and therefore they should have the opportunity to roll for high value items that can be sold to fund their mount or for whatever purpose they want to use gold for.   
---
There are plenty of no-drop or quest armor pieces and weapons, and very few BoEs that are BiS for level 60s among all purple and blue items. So when people say they need that level 35 blue boe, they're going to vendor it in like 5 levels if they equip it, or they're just going to sell it on the AH themselves.
---
Yeah that'll happen! I'll go do a quest half way across the map, get back to whatever area to turn in, and realize there was a follow up to a different quest that wanted me in the same area I was just in. Knowing which quests follow up to where just takes experience, or a guide. I noticed you have warlock flair. Grinding mobs as a warlock can be very efficient, so there could be a slight learning curve in regard to pet control, dot rotation, etc.
---
I think that devs putting the burden on players instead of fixing their own problem is epitome of developer stupid-thinking.
---
I saw a thread on /r/wow not long after BfA came out that was similar to this, with a caption like "14 years later and I still agro them both." And I can only imagine some Blizzard world designer who placed those mobs sitting at his desk with a satisfied grin after 14 years of a job well done.
---
See you in 3 hours! Lmao get the Dr. Scholl's boot inserts for your shaman you're gonna need em.
---
I would say all people that aren't me, aren't me. Regardless, I'm not saving for my character's retirement in WoW. He's not gonna quit his job as a Warlock and spend the rest of his days watching daytime tv. There is practically no advantage in sitting on gold or potential gold or whatever you want to call it.
---
Thank you :)
---
Then its dumb to give them an item they may not use. I am specced as tank at level 53. Its not that ridiculous.
---
Yeah because it's actually pain in the ass and you can't really do much.
---
Multiboxers are good for farming, but gearing them Up is super difficult as you can't do quests and even dungeons are painful.
---
Are you arguing in bad faith?
---
Because you also hold the stance:
---
So, please pick a position on this post. 
---
Need vs Greed
---
yeah i’m not sure why this is surprising. as horde, you get your buffs (ony head, songflower, rend buff etc) and hearth to karg as a guild to run to the mountain. it’s kind of a known thing to wipe guilds so they don’t have their buffs for raids. it’s the same reason you see trains of people running from karg to BRM at once. kargath is the closest hearth spot to MC.
---
They just sell for a lot. I'd ask the group before rolling on one of those.
---
As long as you are out of court by the time your guild is running MC all is well.
---
Hurry up judge give her whatever I need t1 helm let's go.
---
Worgen can be skinned which makes sense yet still blows my mind.
---
They probably would make needing it change it to a bop now in hindsite.  Like they did that on retail.  Maybe for a Classic+?
---
It does add an interesting dimension   to the choice.   Is this enough of an upgrade to give up the chance to win it for sale.    
---
As for why make the distinction, there are reasons that can be given, but the flip side of that, is why does the game offer the need/greed options.  Personally I view it as a character test for a pug.  Learn who you can trust for future dealings at the cost of potentiality losing some leveling gear.
---
LOL Damn. Classic problems require classic solutions.
---
There really is no longer a reason to have a Need, Greed and Pass button any longer. The greedy players have beaten the unselfish so just do away with the Need button altogether.
---
If you're in it for the experience efficiency of it, as a hunter it's easy to knock out quests so do those.  If you know it's a quest that makes you travel a lot of places, skip those.  Join the LookingForGroup channel as you can read it while questing and find groups to complete dungeon quests.
---
Let people enjoy the game how they want
---
That's fine for bop where the alternative is censoring it for a pitance.
---
But a boe that's bis for him can easily become another boe or two that's bis for me. Class doesnt play into this because theres no rule like there is on retail where needing a boe makes it bop.
---
Lol this dude is so salty.
---
Ah, so you're confessing to be a ninja looter. Personally I think it's never OK to need for gold. Everyone needs gold, and if you don't care about the gold you can press skip. I'll blacklist those who need but don't really need it.
---
&gt;But an item that AHs for 500g is an upgrade for every player and that value is not any higher than for players that can equip the item and use it for a couple levels before an upgrade.
---
I personally don't think this takes precedence over using the item. That's just how I view the game.
---
Oh f'real? Dope.
---
I'm starting to think the process of getting anything from them is post it on reddit.
---
People mess around by being bored on boats. This kind of thing isn't TOO unusual.
---
Figures
---
*guitar solo intensifies*
---
Oh man, I’ll be turning 60 soon. Where can I find a party/guild that is willing to do them with me?
---
I've never heard anything from the 'everyone need is bad' side that wasn't immediately countered with no followup. Care to enlighten me?
---
Oh, so being in a party or not still reduces the XP gain by the same amount?
---
Isn't that all the more reason for everyone to need? That's how I've seen it being handled on my server because that's the only way ensure no one is getting screwed.
---
But according to doomsayers we still had 8 layers and they were never leaving!
---
Yetis
---
Now 51 and 485g
---
Someone needs to lead.
---
Good point :=)  
---
I really liked the fire build in vanilla. With ZG gear, I did quite well even in MC (except for the fire immune bosses).  Unfortunately, my current gear seems to be way too low on crit. Not much in the way of rolling ignites.
---
I didn't ever farm consumables in vanilla, but I also wasn't very successful (cleared up to twin emps but didn't down them, killed 0 naxx bosses). How big of a deal are the consumables?
---
Maybe, but it's terrible for PvE(in fact, actively harmful on some fights). Sword skills is always useful.
---
"Hang on guys, let me finish this water totem quest really quick"
---
*everyone in discord laughs*
---
Friend : "you ever play a shaman before?"
---
Me : "nah, thats why i picked this class. Why?"
---
Friend : "no reason"
---
My guild is full of assholes i know irl, i wouldnt change a thing.
---
Truuuuuuuuuuuu
---
The woes of hunting. We just aren't allowed to have nice things! Atleast we can look nice!
---
And they want them because they're upgrades.  Funny....we're back at the beginning.

Yes I do understand what standard deviations are. With that logic there is just as large of a chance of two dropping in 100 as there are zero to drop. We are not talking about taking a sample of 100 kills and seeing if one drops. We are talking about on average over a large enough sample size there will be one that drops for every 100 kills, within a reasonable plus or minus for variation.
---
Oh please dude. Im a fellow horde player and both factions got they fair share of ass holes and griefers. Horde technically have more them in fact, because of the faction imbalance. Both sides have players hell bent on griefing the other faction.
---
How you going to level to 300 using the AH?
---
The saltiness over fucking digital items in a game is unbelievable. Like shit yeah I’d be a bit disappointed to not get an item but come on, suck it up and move on.
---
We make sure to gather our MC raids there, and assert dominance to build confidence.
---
&gt;...  almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that. This includes high population realms such as Faerlina, which has had only two layers for three weeks now. 
---
And people thought layering was never going to get turned off before P2 LOL
---
According to wowhead, it's best in slot for this phase. You won't replace it until you get a Quel'Serrar or a stronger weapon in BWL.
---
Go ahead and enchant it.
---
Anyone know what frames and bars this person is using? Thanks!
---
The filter is called "bind on pickup" and "bind on equip"
---
It's already there, you don't need to make flawed rules that create problems.
---
I've seen 3 purple boes drop in groups. Everybody rolled need, nobody complained, everyone was happy. 
---
Fair, equitable, zero chance for ninjas, literally no downsides except bozos crying that everyone should open themselves up to ninjas because they aren't able to comprehend that BoEs hold the same exact value to everyone.
---
Mulched a 60 warrior with a 52 warrior and paladin wasn't even that hard.
---
&gt; Oh, forgot my ammo.
---
This guy Classics.
---
People in our guild who couldn't afford decent PC's used to call it the Depression Room
---
Wats bis?
---
So... always need everything? 
---
Sorry warrior, i know you want that aegis of the scarlet commander. But i need that extra 2 gold to go towards buying my mount in 3 levels.
---
BiS probably has more damage for PvE but thinking for Pvp the set bonus's look great and the stam/int prob help a lot. Am I wrong?
---
About the time they lost my focus haha
---
What is the add on ur using that announces you’re in combat and damage?
---
yeah im with you, i started playing on private servers that were pvp only and oh my god playing pve has been such a treat. im glad some people are into that but it's just not fun for me.
---
if you want to stick it out, it did get easier at higher levels, 50 and 60, bc statistically fewer players can just stab you once and kill you. but idk might be better to just come back to the pve side. so much less stressful. most aggressive thing that's happened to me is an opposite faction player ninja'd an herb while i was clearing out a mob next to it.
---
edited to add another tip: have multiple toons youre leveling, and if someone starts to grief you, just change toons. if youre getting camped you can just leave your ghost and come back in like 20 mins and hearth home. whatever you're doing you can probably do later, after theyve lost interest
---
Cow is derogatory
---
Good read, I can relate. Hated the streamlining and lack of player interaction in retail wow. I have enjoyed ever bit of classic and my character actually has some meaning to me.
---
He picked the wrong talents, why isn't Misha on fire?
---
Achievements in Wotlk made city raids popular, at least momentarily.
---
Couldnt you and your buddy tank/heal the aoe group?
---
"This dude stole TWO Superior Healing Potions even though I killed the guy standing near it!! I must avoid him and his guild at all costs for they are the scum of the earth!!11!"
---
Yep, that's exactly the response I'd have too. It's honestly 100% the same as somebody stealing pre-raid BiS out of Chest of The Seven or changing loot rules/kicking people 5 seconds before a boss kill.  Completely the same, should definitely use the same term for it.
---
Where the lines between enemies and allies blend and everyone is chaos... the heart of darkness.
---
Seems optimized well to me. I haven't dipped under 144fps a single time yet at all ultra settings.
---
No one likes being camped. But venturing out into the world knowing that’s a real danger adds another element that some find exciting. If you’re really having trouble ask a friend or a nearby 60 for help.
---
They just use bots.  Kind of shady to charge for it, when their parent site scrapes the AH api for free.
---
The old you spank it you tank it mantra.   It's what taught me how to mage back in Vanilla
---
Horde ALWAYS deserve to die. 
---
If they didn't wanna die, they shouldn't have been horde.
---
You're right, there's so much of a reason to group up and get to know your own faction that it's not like pve servers feel empty. I play my paladin exclusively with my girlfriend though, so we don't group up with others nearly as much. Most people we've worked with have been chill, but you still get your aoe cleave nutjobs here and there, and some people have even weirded us out because "gamer girl hehe xD". We do dungeons and stuff and have a blast there, but I thought pvp would be fun so we could get into some intense brawls in the open world and be more immersive.
---
Both end up healing in raids. Druid leveling is easier. Both have suboptimal dps specs. Both can tank while leveling, though druids are much more legitimate tanks. Shaman wear mail which has less competition on rolls than leather. Any heals are desired but shaman buffs and chain heal are amazing for groups.
---
Shaman are wrecking balls in pvp with Elemental/resto spec or with a nice twohander and Enhance spec. Druids are flag carriers and escape artist/survivalist in pvp.
---
Ultimately just choose which you enjoy the most. They are both hybrids in the end.
---
What about Shield Block + Revenge?
---
&gt; Everyone needs gold
---
Exactly, everyone needs the gold so everyone should be rolling need.  Or everyone roll greed.  it doesn't matter so long as everyone has a shot at the item.
---
Not allowing a staff of jordan to be wasted by a dumbass mage who will just level out of it isn't the same thing as being a ninja looter.
---
&gt;Due to the nature of slow weapons proccing 
---
If you're referring to SoCommand, it's a fixed PPM, so you want the slowest weapon possible to maximize proc damage.
---
I think your build sounds viable to allow you to raid heal and still do a bit of DPS on the side.
---
Alright, cheers
---
Its beautiful.
---
One day blizzard will hear us - that this is what we want, not a stupid instance or a flag to capture but organic in the world war.
---
War for Warcraft.
---
you retail kids and your carebearish ways disgust me.
---
YOu are the 80th person to say that. Get an argument.
---
If your an enchanter you should grind out argent dawn revered, thorium brotherhood revered I believe, timbermaw I think you only need honored for both enchants. And cenarion circle but I don’t know anything about that rep yet. Phase 3 will be lit if you do.
---
Do your research before making claims. Because your are wrong.
---
I MC and spin them around, run in circles, then run into a wall.  That way I have a few seconds to blast the hell out of them while they figure out where the hell they are.  Disorientation is a useful tactic.
---
Saying fuck isn’t against the rules. Saying fvck is because it gets around the censor.
---
Honestly, that goes without saying.
---
Do you still have this issue? I am unable to rename my pet and it's driving me up the wall.
---
You should be rolling until you get a base of raiders.  This was nothing more than 5 people hiring probono mercenaries to get them raid gear.  Everyone should immediately leave, and no one should raid with such leadership again.  Hell, the second week we cleared 8/10 with mostly a PUG with 2 wipes, and went 10/10 the next week with 5 wipes.  If that guild can't clear those raids this far into Classic without a wipefest then they aren't competent enough in leadership to have earned anything.
---
Name that farce of a guild, or PM me and I will name it, and get them disbanded.
---
They are worthless leaders and helpless fools.
---
Arena's do general too so that they dont hit the lockout.
---
I can't speak for other classes, but the priest BiS lists are seriously retarded mathematically and [just](https://i.imgur.com/POGdIdZ.png) [obviously](https://i.imgur.com/lRTshpE.png).
---
plus healing is a garbage stat until you have probably 600 which comes naturally from being raid geared. downranking doesn't even match max rank mana efficiency until you have +300 healing and even then you're worse off because you're not regening mana because you constantly have to be spamming baby heals. But one day some clod indiscriminately made a list of items with the highest spell power and said "THIS IS THE BEST GEAR," the community fucking ran with it and we're still suffering.
---
Even in pve it kind of makes gold farming a problem though. Not a huge issue because I don’t think that’s normally their goal, but it is a downside.
---
They why does your response have absolutely nothing to do with it?
---
It's happened twice in my groups where people have rolled need while everyone else rolled greed and then they refused to equip the item when I asked them politely to do so. Everyone should roll need unless they are dumb or really don't mind people ninja-ing from them.
---
Definitely been doing that wrong! Thanks, been running in on Prot stance.
---
Honestly I thought that was a decent way of doing it to incentivize people to do world pvp at all.
---
TIL I'm an asshole for making sure nobody gets ninjad
---
How is this even controversial?
---
I'll gladly roll greed on BOE items under 100g.
---
But once you're above that amount, it's always a need. It's a huge "upgrade" for every player. I'm not gifting someone 400g, when it could be equally useful to anyone in the group.
---
As a Priest... I'm here for the *entire* experience, and that includes getting my *entire* iconic set.
---
The incentives aren't helping, and have exasperated faction balance issues. I'm wholly against incentives for WPvP after seeing it attempted and failed. It's best just to let people WPvP because they want to, and for no other reason.
---
For BoE?  Yes. 
---
Bind on pickup, no.
---
Do you trust everyone?  If it’s a guild organization sure you work it out, but a PUG? Lol yeah, Need always. Everyone else will.
---
You'll make it I swear
---
Not wrong, the value of the item is subjective and therefore open to interpretation for anyone. Someone could see 1.6 dps, or +10 stam and "need" the item, and someone could see the rest of their mount money and "need" the item. Having a stake in something is entirely up to you, and is influenced by numerous factors. I personally tend to let the easier ones go. Stuff that sells currently for like 30-50g I don't really mind letting it go to someone who wants it because I value getting hit with a social stigma. But if we're talking 800g or something (just a number I saw in the thread) it's insane to think that people you likely don't even know are going to just let you have it. We're flirting with entitlement here.
---
if players can get to him its not griefing or cheating
---
Without an achievement banner, it means nothing!
---
I strongly suggest checking out the addon [Character Notes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), it lets you leave positive or negative notes on players and their name will appear with an icon next to them when they talk in world chat / trade / party etc. Really handy for keeping tabs on these kinds of players.
---
It’s not even the min max mentality that will force you to go heals, it’s the fact that a raid needs like 8-10 healers and finding enough healers is very difficult so having someone in the raid doing shit dps and barely contributing when they could be healing and contributing a lot seems redundant.
---
On a somewhat related note...is there a way to grind cenarion circle rep other than killing stuff in Silithus for 1 freaking rep each?
---
I'd really like the bigger herb bag on my druid, but im a holy priest...theres no way im grinding that rep.
---
Hey i was there. Got spooked hard as you guys ran behind me from the hills.
---
The problem is I can’t decide between holy shock or blessing of kings
---
Runs great on my 13 inch MacBook Pro no Touch Bar 2017.
---
Anyone who wants to do a Mythic+ dungeon. No dungeon finder for that.
---
In terms of build/talents? Technically going Enhance until 40 then respeccing to Elemental is the fastest. Look up Defcamp &amp; Melderon on YouTube - they have 2 videos that go extremely in depth on shaman leveling. Kargoz also has a great shaman leveling guide on YouTube
---
Have I come across them?
---
Yes, yes I have.
---
everything is overfarmed, black lotus goes for 35-40g 
---
ah is flooded with thorium because of arcane crystal farm
---
rR?
---
I have been noticing I've run into familiar faces a lot more often the last couple weeks. This is great news
---
early warlock tier is great for pvp, but for raiding your random spellpower greens are indeed better
---
Horde deserve it on every server.
---
Im a Guild Leader of a guild that currently got MC 10/10 and ony down. Our one meme is a spell ret paladin and tryhards a lot. Enchanted pummlers atc and helps out in the guild. I've still had the talk with him though that if the day comes when we need him to do so he will swap to holy.
---
Whilst it’s not a solution to the problem, what level was he when he went to west fall? I had the same problem because I went slightly early. Also you can’t do the entire zone in one push, I found myself going between West fall and loch Modan, dark shore is also an option if you need it. If this is the case now it’ll be a problem later for sure. If it’s just the case of him being a warrior, look up hamstring kiting, carry food and stack bandages, I wasn’t really able to chain pull or take 2 mobs together at that point
---
Well considering your computer doesn't have a dedicated gpu that's still pretty good.
---
I guess.... money&gt;everything else
---
Careful, that dock is *Slippery When Wet*!
---
If they were legit they'd say "baby on board" instead. "Little horde on board" doesn't mean shit to most first responders and if you're using them for safety clarity would be the most important thing to look for in a sticker.
---
Moving the gold should be fine
---
LMAO. This explains so much.
---
Never played after Cata. I now understand why some people are so offended by ppl needing BOEs they cant use.
---
As far as I’m aware, buying the skill at level 40 to ride a mount gives you 300/300. So it’s just the cost of the epic mount (900g honoured) that you need to worry about. Hence this would save a lot of gold!
---
I did, he's inactive,
---
**edit to add.**
---
He's currently level 40, 1 bubble short of 41, with max rested, and it's not worth the trouble to burn rested off.
---
**eddit to add.**
---
I'm also RofO on EVERY north american server except whitemane.
---
Is the GM thing true? That would offer a lot of security if all you have to do is have everyone agree to the loot rules in chat beforehand.
---
The basics: certain animals can learn certain skills. Most can learn a "focus dump" ability like claw, some can learn a higher damage ability with a cooldown like bite.
---
Specific tamable beasts already know abilities, say for instance claw (rank 4). In order to be able to teach that to another pet, you need to capture one who already knows it and keep that pet fighting things till you get a message "you have learned claw (rank 4)." Then you can abandon that pet, get your normal pet out of the stables and teach it claw (rank 4).
---
There are a couple websites that will tell you what pets to get to learn any skill you need. Do a google search for petopia vanilla, and you should find one pretty easily.
---
Can anyone please describe what happens in video? This buffering is taking too long.
---
That sucks but lack of knowledge is no reason not to have a system like this. Or all just needs anyway like
---
Default
---
Thanks everything. Some really good advice in here. I read some positive thoughts around herbalism/ alchemy as well. Thoughts?
---
can nugrunning track another player's debuff like banish or fear?  Can I config it to track an enemy player's buff?

LH crafters will be plenty within 1-3 weeks. Item was not worth making cross faction. Sorry for the loss of materials, but it's your impatience that got the best of you.
---
On my server only Alliance had the plans, the next week we had 4 horde crafters and fees below 100g.
---
I’ve got a Shadowfang that I’m saving for when people start building up twinks.
---
I’m pretty much new to WoW, so I’m looking for some advice as far as a reasonable selling price, and approximately how long I should wait before I try selling it.
---
Idk, all private servers I played, chests in EPL/WPL had solid drops. As it is now, they are barely worth stopping for. Like you get maybe 30 silver value out of the chest. Maybe a gold for auctioning mana potions if you get lucky with those, pretty sure they should drop more/better stuff.
---
You lucky bastard
---
All of the classic Priest guides I’ve read push +healing aggressively as the stat most prized for BIS. But none of them actually do a tear down of int vs spirit vs healing vs mp5.
---
Basically, I think Cassandra’s Grace as BIS head slot being stupid. If +healing is the top priority, then you’re better off with a green piece with 55-60 +healing. If there’s any conversion rate between +healing and int/spirit, then something like Dreamweave Circlet is just as good for a significant discount.
---
Is there a better theorycrafting discussion or article on classic priest that I’ve missed that explains the stat priority rationale in detail?
---
no, it would break my heart to delete a lvl 51 warrior haha so I'm going to use the transfer to get him off and reroll ally
---
I bet your hands were shaking!
---
Everyone I know on PVP servers hates warmode
---
Exactly, not a huge fan of this personally. I get the whole no changes stuff but we are barely a month into classic, there are tons of ppl still dealing with the leveling grind. Those one off "kill this one guy" quests totally suck with so many ppl. Not to mention trying to buy timed patterns from vendors, guess that's always an issue though.
---
addons
---
Agree to disagree. Everybody has BiS BoEs that they need to buy and I don’t think you deserve it just because you got lucky that yours dropped. Everyone deserves a shot at the money regardless if it’s an upgrade for you, especially in the case of boe epics and ultra valuable boe blues like maidens circle or sword of zeal.
---
&gt; rat 
---
This sounds awesome. Do you have a link or something? They only thing I see is a rat cage... and something about Children week?
---
I thought they camp back with a blue post saying that it wasn’t cheating.
---
Depends. If it's a twink item like Shadowfang then definitely everyone should need since it's a low level weapon that can be worth hundreds of gold. Nobody passes on a few hundred gold, and nobody equips something that gives them a loss of 500g while levelling. Otherwise needing blue BoEs isn't really necessary until 40+ when they AH for a good chunk.
---
Oh, you're one of those. Have a good day.
---
If they had 25-40 of their own raid team, had everything on farm or close to it, and let a few trial players into the group to learn/experience the raids or the guild’s style, that’s one thing.
---
If they have 10 or less people and wipe all night with 20-30 “trial” guildies, that is a pug raid and everyone should be able to roll unless items were on reserve going in.
---
I wish they could stop multiboxing somehow. Nothing like being in a contested zone and being wrecked by a multiboxer before i can barely move my character.
---
Sure, but how do u get out of the dungeon? Running back to the entrance is a waste of time, and sometimes probably not even possible
---
Wut?
---
You've literally proved my point lol. Not possible within TSM without an auto clicker, which would then make the person doing it be breaking TOS
---
You know, I totally forgot about tabards. I'll buy one tonight!
---
Tailoring is rough just because the runecloth bag pattern is camped by bots.
---
Sure, but it's still more damage on average early.
---
Very true, you've actually convinced me BoEs should always be need rolled by all.
---
Convincing people of that in parties is hard though, and rolling need after a few greeds are out is pretty trashy.
---
if i recall correctly, the guns was added in the burning crusade or the pre-patch to it. Can't find anything on google so can't confirm it.
---
I did the same thing--I mistakenly repaired after getting my mount and it sucked up the last of my silver completely. I had to farm out leather and grays from Mulgore @ level 40 just to afford my flight to org. Then had to run to 1k needles and farm enough silver that I could fly back to my questing area. 
---
10/10 would get mount again.
---
You might be better off asking to reserve gear xyz on the runs. People tend to be put off by tanks charging gold pre-60.
---
Oh shit, someone stole my car. Well, it’s better to be disappointed now than safe then.
---
Wow was released in 2004, 20 minus 5 bud
---
There's pretty clear precedent on this kind of thing though. Did you do it intentionally and/or maliciously? That's probably your answer.
---
Just look at the layering/instance bug a few weeks ago. If someone accidentally encountered it they were fine. The people who got banned/suspended did it repeatedly for profit, completely abusing the bug.
---
It's still very simple. Was there intent to do it? Did you continue to do it once you realized what was happening? If yes, then you'll probably get in trouble. If no, you won't.
---
People don't get banned for doing this shit once by accident.
---
i just want my shield for my pally bois
---
how is using 3rd party software to control multiple characters not ToS? serious question.
---
Man going back to these comments with proof that layers are almost gone is hilarious
---
wpvp is best pvp
---
The point of need is that it's an instant upgrade of an item for a player. The value of very rare BoE is so high that they have a similar utility as any normal case "need". The issue though is that everyone has to agree to either all need or all greed for these super valuable items.
---
The worry was that the rogue wouldnt be aware of the 500g pricetag, to which I say knowledge is power and we cant control for not everyone being up to date on the market.
---
What would a macro like that look like?
---
It is. Phase 2 is gonna be the shit. And I imagine a lot of people are gonna quit lol.
---
Lol. Heroic strike has nothing to do with the offhand. Oh boy, I love this sub!
---
Four players? Sometimes it's just 4 Pokemon or just water on the screen and the games dip to 24 or lower fps.
---
People are giving you wrong info, you are killing his exp gain whether you are in party or not - this is also very easy to test if you let him kill mob solo and then let him tag and finish the mob, just compare the exp, you'll see. It's fine to help with elite quests but if you consistently "help" him with kill quests, his exp will suffer greatly because vanilla levelling is balanced around you murdering fuckton of mobs for your quests.
---
I saw plenty of MC and Ony groups LFM last night. Depends on the time of day and how far your server has gotten in gear and progression.
---
My guild rolled on PvP server then transferred to low pop server because of ganking. Like, you knew you were signing up for this. Why force me to choose guild vs server 3 weeks into launch?
---
All my retail toons are on Tich. I remember this happening many times. It was so frustrating.
---
&gt;Will blizz ban me for moving the gold through the neutral AH 1 time to my new toon?
---
Nah. But, save yourself some time and ask your coworker to help you transfer the money between characters.
---
we are talking about being bis.
---
Fuck. I’ve been had!
---
It's pretty complicated and I would recommend watching a video or reading a written guide. When you capture a pet, you have to have it use its ability for your hunter to 'learn' that pet ability. Now, any future pet you tame that can use that ability, your hunter will be able to teach it. This does not apply to family specific abilities like wind serpents' lightning breath. Different beasts in the open world know different ranks of the skills. For example, there wolves in like ubrs or one of those dungeons that are the only wolves that have the highest rank of their ability.
---
You can have 3 pets I believe. 2 in stables and one active
---
Spoken like someone who has never multiboxed tbh. Multiboxing is not against TOS because the keypress is simply sent to both instances of the game. It has a physical keypress involved = not against TOS
---
Warriors still wouldn't use it in pve unless their other weapons are blue. 2H is not good, and maces doubly so, especially for horde. Hand of rag has always been a pvp/vanity weapon.
---
Heres a few reasons this is kind of handicapping yourself:
---
You're going daggers deep assassination, but you skipped imp kidney, that increased 9% damage is HUGE. You're doing primarily burst damage and unlike swords its not always possible to get multiple off so you want to do as much as possible while you can.
---
You have imp ss, and imp backstab.. is this for leveling, pvp, or pve? Because for pvp or pve its a waste of points. Leveling it may improve your QOL a little? But you dont need imp ss to level. (Have the same opinion for people who do daggers+ hemmo youre just uneededly spending energy thst you should be reserving for as many backstabs as you can)
---
Youve neglected all rogue cooldowns.. 
---
Rogues have such amazingly strong cooldowns that most average or below average rogues succeed purely by using cooldowns. At least try and find a way to get either elusiveness or endurance (especially if youre taking imp sprint but not prep)
---
You went down to vigor which is a very disagreed upon topic. Yes you get a heavier opener, but it doesnt help you at all passed that point unless you get controlled and cant spend your energy till full regen (which normally means youre about to die)
---
10% chance to apply poisons is debateably good as well.. this becomes a must have for mutilate envenom later in the game but right now all its going to do is help you apply your offhands poison (assuming youre doing the proper Crippling MH / damage or control poison on the OH) because as daggers your main hand attacks much faster than swords and applies crippling quicker) as its not a procs per minute poison)
---
I also dislike combat swords because my entire goal is to pvp so i leveled using a pvp exclusive spec, didnt change my QOL very much
---
Tank was Druid?
---
I already felt that I did the same zones a lot already but yours are even higher! Easier to get a alt to 60 when you ever have a main at 60 :D!
---
The username.  It checks out.

Who is this legend
---
For me, PvP makes a server feel alive. I've been on both sides of the gank-coin. Honestly, I'd prefer to be spawn camped rather than afk grind with little risk. I find the game to be more satisfying when real players also get in my way. 
---
My tip: if you're being spawn camped, take ~5-10 minutes to step away from your computer. Campers will usually get bored.
---
I found 1 in 6 hours. Then 3 in 2 hours. Then 0 in 4 hours.
---
This sub, huh? Why do we even bother....
---
&gt; Like for the player in the dungeon that would equip them. A need.
---
Like for the player in the dungeon that would equip them. A need.
---
But until he equips the item it's juts a stack of money, just like it is to the rest of the party.
---
Once he equips the item he's turning that stack of money into stats, which begs the question, why would they want the item that drops in the first place, if they're willing to turn their exact gold value into those stats, why haven't they bought the item?
---
The ideal would be to get 55 then run lbrs with helpful 60s.
---
That's more common than people needing away greed rolls to ah later? Cause that's what we have now. Ninjas.
---
Like a shredded Costanza
---
Gnomes are the reason I dont play alliance.
---
This doesn't work in Classic.
---
Traded mine for a promissory note of 250g to our OT raider. Could have waited some months and sold it for 500g, or hold until it really goes up in price. But thought fuck it, money now and benefits the guild.
---
BRD has like 7 pre-bis items we can go for so any BRD run you go on will likely target at least a few of those and you can choose which BRD runs to join based on what you need. Far better use of time. UBRS has like one item we need, truly, and that's the trinket. Nothing else is worth wearing.
---
You’re trying to use too many big boy words, and it shows. 
---
Also, it’s not new, or ground breaking, for a company to sell high fidelity graphics for newly released titles, it’s actually one of the oldest sales tactics out there for video games.
---
They weren’t ahead of their time, they were on par, and I’m sure we will all agree we never picked up WoW in the first place for its super top notch graphics, just like now, all the classic players, are not playing classic for the graphics quality.
---
or if there are already so many warriors in the guild and they really don't want to gear another one. The good thing about feral tank is that a lot of his BiS stuff is equip that others don't really want.
---
One thing flying has destroyed is those videos of raids finding clever use of terrain + gliders to drop on enemies slowly. Was comical at least.
---
I’ve managed to score both [Shadowfang] and a [Gnarled Ash Staff] recently.
---
Being pretty new to WoW, I’m looking for some advice as far as reasonable prices to sell these items at, and also how long I should wait before I sell them. I understand that Shadowfang is a twink item and so there isn’t much point selling it at least until phase 2. 
---
Any advice would be appreciated!
---
Guess that's why they never implemented something to prevent that all the way up to retail then? I don't understand your point. Using TSM is not against TOS is my point, automatically buying things (which would require additional software) is.
---
Everywhere.
---
Pallys are edgelords though. Masters of the Edge indeed....
---
No but it's so true and it's one of my biggest gripes with the Undead faction.

Forsaken 1: "We're free! We are no longer slaved to the litch king, and we have our minds back. We even managed to keep our home that we had when we were alive. What are you going to do with all this freedom Ted?

Forsaken 2 (Ted): "Oh I don't know. I'll probably just go live in the sewer."
---
...why?
---
Target area for maximum damage.
---
But everyone NEEDS money. By your backwards logic, there shouldn't even be a greed option.
---
If you just want to complete the raids not a big deal at all.
---
If you want to complete the raids in a timely manner so you can get out of them and get into bgs so you can rank up they're absolutely huge.
---
Fury warrior out performs rogues at all phases through all of vanilla. Rogues are required for 1 fight, after that they bring 0 support and are out damaged by warriors who also have the ability to tank. If you don’t plan on pvping warrior is better. 
---
However there are A LOT of dps warriors and they are very gear dependent. If you don’t have the time to do the work go rogue. 
---
If you want to pvp rogue is a better solo experience, warriors are better when you have a healer with you.
---
For threat. Warrior in zerk stance does 80% threat. Rogues do 100% and have feint.
---
Wow, OPs response is gold. Not sure if he's joking or not.

I feel like you think if it's against the TOS that no one can/does do it. It's virally impossible to detect. Every live server has hundreds of people that do it and never get punished. Both classic servers I've been on have at least half a dozen people bot sniping the ah for misposts.
---
This debate is the plot behind the Leeroy Jenkins video. Except he was a paladin
---
That's stupid. People can play what they want.
---
And in turn the person who actually can use it, doesnt get the item.
---
Only thing missing is a raid full of MC’d undeads
---
The overall loot is good as well gotten 2 Librams already the exp per hour is not god awful and it is very mindless. I am watching archer while playing can't do that with strat runs and besides you need to grind exp in the 50s anyhow as quests vanish.
---
So overall I think it is a fine option if you feel like it.

---
RED LIGHT!
---
With what attitude?
---
Can you actually articulate what is wrong with what OP is saying?
---
Because from what I see, you are just not very open to people playing how they want to play, which is the whole point of classic.
---
And the kicker argument for boes is simple. If you  needed it, then buy it. If it's not worth the gold to buy it yourself you deny everyone else that value by needing it away from greed rolls. Either it's worth the same value to you as everyone else or it's worth less and you steal the value from others who would have sold it or traded it for it's full value.
---
Blacksmithing is a money pit. Go herb alchemy or herb mining.
---
29 was always very popular.
---
They're a big deal in AQ40 and Naxx when the dps requirements start to tighten significantly.
---
I know the one guy went off on me like I'm supposed to hold everyone's hand and tell them what to do.  But it's much easier for someone to realize they keep getting killed doing dumb shit than trying to explain to them what they're doing wrong.
---
You said you would be fine with it. Read my other comment again.
---
Life isn't fair man and typically neither are video games and by you not taking advantage of an opportunity is no ones fault but your own. Multi-Boxing has been around for ages and its prob not going anywhere tbh.
---
cursed comment
---
Need on BoE's where the rule BECAUSE of ninjas, who didn't care about need vs greed.
---
And every item in the game is interchangeable with gold, like blue BoP's, only difference is the amount. So I kinda find it a poor argument.
---
Yup, retail raiding is a joke as well but not necessarily for its mechanics but for many other aspects.
---
Questie changed the game, a lot of people didnt even know about half of the quests in vanilla or gave a shit to find that one off guy.  Even if you could get the coords off thottbot it was a lot harder than having the quest giver and objective on your map.  Also, many of us were children and its safe to say the avg age is way older now.
---
Wait I was told pservers were much better at this! This can't be true!
---
"Molten core? This place is as cold as my subway flat bread  after it's been toasted!"
---
You should just do the classic spell cleave with 1 Warrior, 1 Priest, 1 Warlock, and 2 Mages. Fast clears and not too much pressure on the healer.
---
Then why come here and cry about it when it’s not something that is normal. As a dps no one wants to share loot rolls for dps with a warrior.
---
I mean, you wouldn't know if they were poorly geared or mouse clickers but if it makes you feel better, ok. There's plenty of BG / arena footage in some of his videos as well and like I said, that's just one example.
---
I gave a one word response because this topic has been covered 8 times in the last hour alone but if you really want my detailed answer here it goes yet again.

I know what the MAJORITY of the player base thinks, if the MAJORITY thought the Earth was flat it wouldn’t make it anymore true. 
---
Just look at the system a NEED  button a GREED button and a PASS. It’s obvious it was meant to be roll NEED if you can equip it as an upgrade, roll GREED if it’s a useful gold boost or PASS if you just don’t give a flip about it. 
---
Now the selfish/greedy have taken to roll Need on anything that will give them extra coin, so many or doing this selfish way of thinking that the rest are forced to roll Need or risk never getting anything. 
---
It’s a mess now and the Greed button should be taken out of the option list.
---
Haha all good. It's toox for my nickname
---
There’s whelps in wetlands too. And if we’re talking profs you can farm herbs / ore / leather for more gold
---
The argument being presented in this thread is that it doesn't matter if someone actually needs the item, because everyone needs items they can buy with gold.
---
Thats just Vanilla PvP though. Engineering is prerequisite for PvP. Also, I invested time and money into a profession, why should I not reap the benefits.
---
Graphics settings are not identical between the clients anyway, the old textures and models most likely don't benefit from dx12 as the game really should be designed from the ground up around dx12 to get substantial benefits.
---
Reminds me of the time my low-level Alliance ass went through Wetlands to do a delivery quest. I found two ?? level Horde players standing still (one of which was a Shaman ghost wolf), so I just silently watched from the distance. Suddenly they started running toward me, so I panicked and tried (and failed) to frost nova them. I kept running thinking I was screwed, but the ghost wolf just kissed me and ran away.
---
Oh, and one time on Horde I accidentally thwacked an ally and they flipped me off.

Farming in your raid gear as a warlock right now is kinda ass because you have like 2600 health and 3600 mana. I rock a bunch of pieces with more int so i can farm for longer durations. 3pc T1 for locks is exceptional for farming because of the ability to go mana positive with buffer drain life.
---
Nah I got alot of Runecloth bags on that pserver
---
Exactly we lost our ony buff before our weekly MC due to this exact situation in the video and I had the biggest smile on my face and goosebumps on my arms
---
The thumbnail looked like an undead puking rainbows and I really liked it.
---
I mean, I still like it, but I'm really hung up on the undead puking rainbows now.
---
ELIMINATED
---
Not really.  Everyone is crafting bags to lvl tailoring, so they're at cost or even negative margin in order to recoup some of the material investment back.
---
For the most part, bolts are negative too for much the same reason, but the market can fluctuate.
---
Are they killing flight masters and corpse camping people who fly into areas and also corpse camping the graveyards for when you take spirit res? Because that’s what horde are doing on Herod and it’s fucking cancer
---
Wow...you actually don't know what morality means, do you?
---
Definitions:
---
&gt; principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; a particular system of values and principles of conduct, especially one held by a specified person or society. 
---
Morality isn't a universal rule set, it's about expectations for behavior, what is right/wrong to expect of one another.
---
The vast majority of us agree on need = equip, greed = money.  That's the default morality system in this game and this community.
---
I don't care if you deviate from this...but if you deviate without warning, you are violating the morality of the community.
---
U WOT M8?

I plan on it, my coworker is afraid of getting his account banned.  Says he read something about them flagging devilsaur leather getting moved back and forth.  I'm pretty they are just looking for gold farmer habits with that.

---
Lvl 41 hunter, I just picked up skinning and I made it to lvl 205 in about 3 hours of game time. Most of that time was traveling to figure out what area was good for which mobs.
---
Very weird place to put your unit frames
---
You are completely ignoring how many servers they spun up and the server transfers they offered.
---
This impact of dropout, this far, is minimal.
---
In general, when the “core” raid team size would still need to LFG to fill out an UBRS run and they are going to use “loot council”, prepared to get screwed if you are an app.
---
Would have /gquit as soon as GM tried to dictate professions.
---
You too shall return to the island, we all will.
---
I played a lock in vanilla original.
---
The probkem with felheart is it has no + spell damage. 
---
As to the bonus' mana drain increase is useless, no one mana drains. Life drain is alright, but its not a spell you use *that* much, especially when raiding. 
---
When your raidi g, your pets survivability just doesnt matter. The most common minion, the imp, is phase shifted anyway. 
---
Mana efficiency doesnt really help because of life tap. 
---
All in all blues with high spell damage and not wasting itemization on spirit are much better.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dccigd/mages\_are\_evolving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dccigd/mages_are_evolving/)  original post! the legend found the reddit post and posted a video of him dancing on the chain

It's not necessarily "pull faster" as it is "pull off tempo". They'll get their mana full, but as soon as they do it's off the the races. So it's not any faster, it just makes the group have to deal with low resources the entire time and hate the entire run. If they would just line up their drinking with everyone else, life would be easier for everyone, them included. But that's a lot of thinking for pea-sized brains.
---
&gt; But, it also means that the "CLASSIC IS GOING TO HAVE MILLIONS OF PLAYERS LONGER THAN RETAIL 4EVERZ!!!" crowd is being proven wrong.
---
We literally have zero data about population. Even census add-ons don't work anymore (not that we ever knew if they were accurate in the first place).
---
For all we know they could be merging 4 normal layers into one ridiculously huge layer. 
---
Or the servers could be 1/4th the size now, so they only need 1 normal layer.
---
We have no way of knowing...
---
When I join a group as a tank and I see a warrior i say “ah a warrior, my bad, I thought you needed a tank” then leave group.
---
Don the shield warriors
---
My man!
---
Mooncloth is still ~16g profit over 4 days, which is pitiful.  I wouldn't take tailoring for that.
---
on which side? i have not noticed this and im on krom
---
Its all RNG, I didn't really remember chests being worthwhile for more than the rare green, although in BC there were some good chest drops.
---
What level you at?
---
If you have to drink for 40 seconds after a pull that isn't a large mega pull, you need to get better at healing.
---
I'm in the process of doing this now. A friend helped me knock out the elementals, and now its on to STV for me.
---
What are the best race / class combos for PvP ?
---
From what I gathered online it seems that ud, dwarves and gnomes are a bit overpowered ? I have never seen anything about humans as the best race for PvP for any class for instance.
---
Not true. A well played cat, while quite hard to pull off, can put out respectable number , especially early on.
---
there is always 1 on reddit that says something negative
---
To have fun this is the perfect build if you feel like playing it (as is any other build)
---
Ah I see, its the egotistical diva healer.
---
yeah except servers are way way bigger these days so there's way more competition for stuff on a single layer.
---
its different for BOE's tho. if edgemasters hands drop. and one warrior already spent 500g on the AH for them. but the other didnt. does the warrior that did not buy the hands deserve them more than the one that did buy them? its a gold value item. its equally good for all people. since that warrior can just go and buy himself the gloves if he wants.
---
Bartender definitely has an option to keep that look, I think the setting is called "gryphons" or something like that.
---
It's more like "I'm going to exchange this shit for a different BoE that I do need" 
---
What you said is true about vendoring BoP items. Nobody is buying any upgrades with the 3g from vendoring a BoP.
---
As a 36 priest, I'd probably have to be looking for a tank for a looooong time before I'd consider paying one. You're not that rare, and I'm saving for a mount
---
LEEEEEROYYYYYYYYYYY
---
Might take a while for the permanence of Classic to set in before rare pets start selling for a lot.
---
On private servers, rare pets often never sold for more than a few gold. I once got the parrot that drops from Bloodsail mobs, the one that has like 0.0001% drop chance, went to sell it on the AH and saw 2 already on there for 5g.
---
priest shields benefit at 10% - now that is horrible scaling.  But then again, as a resto druid, I'm super jealous of priest renew scaling at 100% whereas rejuv and renew don't.  Oh, and that not having a rez thing.  ouch.
---
I bet your frames look weird to me too imagine that.
---
Suit yourself. :)
---
I always enjoyed opening ubrs for people back in the day who didn't have a key. That's pretty much what I wanted one this time around as well.
---
That gold going towards someone's mount / epic mount / BIS crafted item is way more meaningful than some leveling item.  *Especially* if it's a known twink item
---
Some of us actually want to play intelligently rather than being the Lv45 that's still running around on foot
---

---
Boes have a universal value that is the same to everyone, bops dont.  If Joe needs on a boe upgrade of mine (as he should) and wins I can not only try to buy it off him but I can buy it off someone else.  If Joe needs my bop upgrade I can't buy it off him or anyone else.  I understand you're real worked up and probably not thinking clearly but surely after I've explained it you see that you can't apply the same logic here.
---
Only works with 400+ agi, intim/scatter is fun af without being too gear dependent.
---
I'm on Azuresong and find it to be populated but not overcrowded.
---
Shweet! Thanks! Going to get him tonight!
---
Well I’d like to get raid invites as Resto so I figured I’d collect int gear so I can be in the best position possible for raid.
---
I am so glad druids are sharing their quality of lifes macros! :3 
---
Regarding the powershifting one. You canjust  make it "Cat Form" rather than "!Cat Form"and it will work just the same
---
But the aim of the macros above was to allow to go into different shapeshifts from any form and then back to humanoid form if you use it again (to mimic how BFA shapeshifting works) I am definitely making a powershift macro once I get into serioud PvE though!
---
I was scouring the internet for a conditional "in-water" and I couldn't find anything! I'll be using that one for sure. Same macro travel and Aquatic is a lifesaver
---
If you want to have fun then who cares what's the best for leveling, raiding, grinding... just do what you want and enjoy it.
---
I got ya.  Last night in Un’Goro a Prot warrior put in gen chat he was being camped at the graveyard.  I was nearby so I go up and clear the alli that was camping him.  He rezzes and we ride out back into the crater going our merry ways.  Not 5 minutes later he messages me that the same dude found him and is camping him again, so we party back up and I go on over and kill the alli.  I waited for a few minutes and he never rezzed, so I leave the area for 30 seconds, then turn around and ride back and find that he rezzed so I kill him again.  
---
Went on my way again and just happened to come across him on the opposite side of the map being chased by a bunch of MOBs.  So being the good little
---
Horde that I am, I dotted him up and there a CoE on him.
---
In this whole time span, I came across maybe 20 different alliance players, I never ganked them and vice versa.  I do log into the game with no intention of PvPing right now (no reward for it), but when stuff like this happens, it’s fun to change my goals and work to outsmart/outplay another player
---
As someone else picked up on. I misread the initial post and was thinking this person bought all the herbs to level his Alch to 300.
---
Edit: It's been a long day and I haven't yet had my fix of digital crack.
---
This is an excellent meme. But Classicwow mods consider it low effort because "if you remove the icons and pictures and it doesnt inherently have to do with Classic, its low effort." Its a stupid rule that removes a lot of great content from the sub. I love when a meme gets upvoted too quickly for them to have ample time to see it and shut it down because it lets more people see how dumb Rule 7 is.
---
Yes indeed! :D
---
This is great news! There have certainly been some hiccups but I am overall satisfied with the implementation of layering. Really excited to know we have made so much progress toward the goal of 1 layer per realm before stage 2. 
---
Blizzard will make the experience even better with the next F R E S H.
---
Huh, didn't know he could drop those pants.
---
I don't see why the client would be an issue if it's the server that would be processing all of the sappers, aoe and such going off and telling the client what to do based off it. It's not like the client has to do any of the hard work unless I'm missing something
---
Archmage is solo farmable
---
Those people are idiots and I would just leave at that point. If they clearly defined what they wanted and then change their mind on the fly what other bullshit are they going to pull.
---
Cringe
---
&gt; I made a mistake picking mining and **smithing**
---
Crafting Professions are almost always just gold sinks. You're likely to never see a profit from it, unless you find a niche and sell intermediate mats. You're likely better off just selling the raw mining materials.
---
Those are raid frames. You’re probably thinking of your party frames looking drastically different. There’s an option somewhere in the settings to show raid frames style while only in a party.
---
Block and let it go.
---
Because of the hit-rating, you want a 9% cap and its very hard to reach without Bloodvine, if not impossible. At least pre-aq.
---
2% crit is also very good for warlocks, as they have their crit bonuses 
---
I am not sure how good it is on 1.12.1 (still mandatory for all casters I would imagine) but at least pre.1.12.1 its way better than almost everything that drops in MC/BWL/Ony. You can only really replace if you get the cloth legs from Kazzak and some other crazy good pieces.
---
But I am pretty sure it will end up being a standard for 99% of casters until AQ at least.
---
raided the capital of the alliance in belarus like 3 times with 40+ people. no one fom blizz cared. servers run smoothly killed everyone and everything there. sadly the alliance had no factions leader in their capital. had 40+ vs 40+ battles in voldun at the terrace of the devoted. no lags at all. sadly most players don't like world pvp. in the end you could not even complet the 10kill quest because no one cares about world pvp. this killed bfa for me.
---
Lol. 'big boy words'. How much more threatened can you be?
---
Lost any slight chance I had of respecting your opinion right there. There's nothing wrong with showing I am educated
---
I managed to kill him once as a fire mage with combustion and living bomb. He camped me for a while after but it was worth it
---
Taking money =/= investing capital.
---
What commie logic makes you think otherwise?
---
&gt; I needed an item instantly like I always do with all BoEs.
---
This implied that they roll need on every BoE regardless of the situation. We could actually be honest, good-hearted human beings and roll greed if you don't need something and let people need things if they're an immediate upgrade.
---
Crazy, I know.
---
Fuck the alliance and fuck you for this video
---
Windrunner here.  Alliance side is very friendly.  Only ran into a couple of assholes in a high pop server.  Majority of horde have been alright too...have had several co op with some quests.  There's a small amount of world PvP but not much
---
People frequently said "All Need on valuable BoE's"  back in Vanilla.  How the system 'was intended to work' is nice and all, but doesn't account for someone hitting 'Need' to sell the item after the rest of the party hits Greed.  
---
If you want to trust PUG's not to run off with valuable items, just state your preferred rules ahead of time and suck it up when you get screwed (and you will).
---
I dunno dude I'm in that level range and don't feel like I have any issues questing. I think you're taking anecdotal evidence and generalizing
---
It has never been a gray area. NEED for equipment upgrade, and GREED for selling on AH or DE or side-upgrade.
---
Anyone trying to deviate from that just wants to ninja.
---
&gt; because they could potentially use it
---
Because they are using it. If they could but dont then that's a jerk move to Need on it too.
---
Have a 56 mage, 15 rogue that ive been liking. Im undecided for a 3rd being a tank/healer and I know Druids fit this pretty well. Im new to wow and dont know much about any of the classes outside mage, but Ive heard Druids are good at everything but master of none. How viable is a Tank/healing spec for a druid? Id like the flexability to do either to quickly get into dung's as either
---
Don't worry about it, people going to be clearing the same raid for many many more months, people this geared out already are soon going to be either rerolling alts or just camping the same spots all day farming what very little they actually need still.
---
Okay? That doesn't change my statement. If you want specific bosses from BRD then say so before starting the dungeon. It's not that hard.
---
It's the highest level dungeon where you can choose what you kill and most effectively pull everything, without any of them catching up to you. So dotters have good time killing them, and due to higher level, it's better to farm there than say Uldaman. Same can't be done in BRD for example which would be next highest level dungeon.
---
"I should finish leveling to 60." - I Should Buy a Boat Cat
---
And maybe the other warrior doesn't like tanking either and said "sure, if he can tank instead of me".
---
Either way, what OP describes is just a "you can join but you have to tank" message, I don't see any reason to be mad about this.
---
There is no “beating the game” lol. The game starts at lvl 60.
---
It is a game, and buying things off the AH is not as fun, and rarely worth it.   It is however a nice dopamine hit to get an upgrade dropped.
---
Thank You!  
---
We both use the details! damagemeter, it has a plugin for a threatmeter as well, I hope you enjoy classic! :D
---
I haven't actually heard any of this, any examples?
---
Exactly. It's not just BoE's too. Saw a high tier alchemy recipe drop in UBRS. So 10 people have a chance at it.
---
But some people foolishly rolled greed and then complained when 7 of us needed. The person who got it didn't do a /reroll, so the greeders just opted themselves out.
---
Now I like things to be fair. If I would have won it, I would have had everyone reroll. Seems strange that I would be called a ninja. Who's to say the alchemist that could use it immediately didn't already have it and would put on the AH later?
---
It's just not worth it. Just need and move on. Eventually you'll get lucky and get something you can sell for gold just like everyone else.
---
And let targeted harassment continue?
---
this month i'll be releasing a total of 8 poters :D
---
I did. I really gave bfa an honest try. Random waves of people appearing from thin air, slaughtering each other, and then phasing and scattering to the winds again does NOT compare
---
I dont believe anyone has ever said that
---
He messaged them saying fury dps. Can you not read?
---
How to farm downvotes 101
---
Yep, prioritize sunder. You'll generate the occasional revenge from natural shield blocks. I'd only heavily use shield block if you're tanking a boss without adds.
---
thank you!
---
Yeah the dungeons I've run have always been need boe's if you're actually gonna use them.  What pisses me off is when an enhancement shaman rolls need on a 20g boe helm for his healing set.  
---
If you're not playing that spec at the time, you cant claim it as a need roll imo.
---
Theres plenty of sp and feral druids healing in leveling. I dont understand why warriors get triggered about that
---
I don’t see a screenshot. Blizzard won’t take action for the black listing, and there probably isn’t a super high chance they’ll do anything about the harassment either, unless it rises to the point of threats of violence/exposure of personal info.
---
This isn't theft, it's unethical opportunism for sure, but not theft. You wanted to save money by putting the mats on for cheap and minimizing the AH tax.
---
However, you could have put the mats up for a high price and paid the difference to the crafter. you eat it, but it is safe. Sorry about your mats though, mate.
---
So many people here are just arguing for more gold, its gross. Its the worst logic. Yes everyone needs gold, it can buy and progress you too.
---
But if something drops someone will equip, they get priority over the AH. Saying they NEED it for the gold is just as bad as needing someones Bis BoP for vendor gold lol.
---
You can farm for gold but not really that epic Boe. If it drops for them let them enjoy the experience. Is that not better then some trip to the AH? I mean screw the spirit of this RNG gear game we play. Better to make a quick buck.   
---
Make bosses only drop gold and buy gears from vendors blizz /s
---
Agreed with IF it’s discussed...why not ask the rogue if he will open the chest before hand and you can than kick him if he doesn’t want to....I don’t ever see anyone ask or discuss these things before hand so to be mad at someone for not doing what you want is kinda obnoxious
---
Without Naxx gear survivalist is not good, but if you find it enjoyable then go for it
---
You should've just healed then that's about all you can do anyhow.
---
Not true, immediacy doesnt Matter. The price of a boe makes it essentially a sack of gold and gold is always valuable to everyone.
---
If your build is revolving around backstabs then you don’t need 3/3 in improved eviscerate or 5/5 in improved poison. Get opportunity 5/5. And you can go combat daggers if you really want backstabs but there’s no front stabbing so you’ve always got to be behind the target.
---
If you stack the mob on top of whoever is trying to get the chest it'll stop them from opening it.   Was messing around with a friend when we first discovered it then not 30 minutes later used it to stop some random from stealing a chest.
---
Sure man what kind of an upgrade would you like?  Want them to upgrade from server 1.0 to 2.0?  Cmon blizz just upgrade!
---
You don't even know enough about the topic to describe what you want.  It doesn't matter how much you "upgrade" no servers on the planet can handle what we're talking about.  If you have 50 people in an area and 50 more join in the processing power the server needs to handle it hasn't doubled it's increased exponentially.
---
You have level 19 pvp weapons worht multiple hundreds of golds (atleast later when PvP is bigger with BG release). Not every BoE drop must be a pre-raid BiS lol :)
---
Isn’t that actually the literal meta with Chromie?
---
It's not worth going for either of those, focus on doing the warrior class quest to get the Whirlwind Axe instead.
---
Even the best Pserver no lifers really dont hold a candle to legit world champion blizzcon winners. These players like Venruki, Cdew, Snutz all played Vanilla as well and have been at the very top of competitive WoW since day 1. Sure there was a bit of a knowledge curve but they are the best in the world for a reason.
---
That would be against the rules of the Internet I'm afraid
---
This is legit one of the things I'm most excited about. Masses combat should be so much fun now that the game/network can handle it so much better.
---
Like, back at the release of vanilla, my computer was a literal *hot mess*. I had the side panel open with a box fan sitting on top blowing into it to keep it cool, and I *still* locked up for the first 90 seconds of Razergore every time we pulled (and then got a glorious 9-15fps for the whole encounter. Thank god I wasn't tanking for that fight.)
---
Nah if it's worth 400g you can buy it off me
---
&gt; Did you do it intentionally and/or maliciously? That's probably your answer.
---
This doesn't answer anything as people do TONS of stuff that fits that description in world PvP that isn't bannable in any way. The fact that the top comment of this thread is someone who had to come in and link proof that Blizzard actually bans for this shows that this precedent is anything but clear.
---
I use truestrike for raid and beastmaster for everything else for the 4 set bonus.  
---
  Being a troll with a lower hitcap lets you get away with murder.
---
the struggle is real :P
---
Isn't this kind of just pointing out the obvious though? Once someone has accepted they aren't using the best in slot gear they're accepting they aren't going to have the best stats, meaning there's obviously going to be a gap of some level.
---
Okay, so if you do a "reset" you reset all 4 wings.
---
All the entrance are in the same general location (SM), but each wing has it's own entrance, if I'm correct?
---
Probably just someone using the AH as a storage area cause everything else available to them is full. Used to see that all the time in Wrath.
---
Im full disc level 27 atm. slow and steady.
---
Yes, thank you!
---
Perfect, filter yourselves out of the groups with good players.
---
From what I gather, it's bottom of the pure DPS barrel, but not as bad as hybrid damage.  
---
Assuming everyone else in your raid is their best spec, you'll likely be sitting at the bottom of the pure dps classes on the meters assuming your raid is full of halfway competent players.
---
Its viability depends on your raid group and their goals really. Just be careful because if you're not already good, or you're not totally comfortable with a rogue, then playing an already sub optimal spec can make you look and feel pretty useless to yourself and the raid team if they're pushing content.
---
Trinkets in Vanilla WoW all have long cooldowns. The purpose is that you get an addon that helps you rotate them during fights. It's not unusual to cycle through 5-6 trinkets in one duel, especially if it's against reset classes like mages/rogues.
---
For example, I dueled a mage yesterday and used a Frost Reflector, a Barov Peasant Caller, Gnomish Net-o-Matic Projector, Gnomish Battle Chicken, a Arena Master, and Nifty Stopwatch. This was all in just ONE duel.
---
Need to be LVL 42 for the quest anyway!
---
The point of running dungeons/instances is to get loot though. So if something drops and someone actually needs it to wear they should have priority over people who just want it for gold.
---
Dummy alert!!!
---
Here you go brother:
---
Along the way, some select realms reached their end-state of a single layer, and we locked that in. With a change we made earlier this week, the following WoW Classic realms are now permanently set to one layer:
---
Anathema
---
Arcanite Reaper
---
Ashkandi
---
Azuresong
---
Deviate Delight
---
Earthfury
---
Felstriker
---
Heartseeker
---
Netherwind
---
Old Blanchy
---
Remulos
---
Smolderweb
---
Windseeker
---
Seems this made you very upset
---
Just run sm ruin.  It's 4.5% behind ds ruin, not counting the corruption.  It's really not a big difference, especially for MC.  Solid pvp spec too.
---
I’ll remember to start rolling for mining nodes, too, when they spawn in the dungeon even if there is only one miner.
---
That sounds less to do with individual specs and more about player ability. At an even playing level, there's no way for cb/hemo to keep up with combat swords without a huge amount of good look for the former and bad luck for the latter. That said, yeah, I'd rather have a competent hemo rogue than a combat swords rogue who forgets to keep SnD up or doesn't have feint trained.
---
Like an hour? It's pretty quick since a 10 man group will mow through all the packs up to rend like it's nothing.
---
In all honestly maybe 2-3 hours. with the majority of that being transportation time. 
---
You could go from 100-175 in ashenvale just murdering bears.
---
I disagree. If you need a boe buy it(goes for non targetable boes).
---
&gt;Also yadda yadda BM for levelling, Trueshot for raids. I'm looking for a fun, roaming the countryside build here.
---
I mean fun is totally subjective, how would we know what you'll find fun. Some people find healing fun, others hate it; it's different for each person.
---
&gt;boe and gold grinding, and maybe a raid or two casually
---
Survival is terrible for both grinding and raiding. It's a pvp spec, and a weird one at that; it has lower damage and less pet tankiness. I personally wouldn't recommend it, I don't see how survival is more "fun" than BM/MM, but if that's what you wanna do go ahead just be aware it's sub-optimal in every regard.
---
For people who don't get what this means:  
---
the first month sub expiration culled a ton of people.
---
I would like to see an example of someone that is multi box'n with out follow.
---
thats what blizzard named those 2 buttons, its up to players how to use them.
---
I mean, Asmon just shit talked it on stream saying his damage is much more impressive. So naturally fankids will repeat the same things in the comments.
---
I don't really see anything wrong with this dungeon path having a unique incentive not to die. It's ok to be inconvenienced if you fail and it's ok if not every part of the game is exactly the same. Retail sanding off all the edges is one of the main things I don't like about it. Honestly, even this is extremely mild compared to what preceded it in EQ1, and I liked the penalty in EQ1.
---
Which sucks bc this is such a shitty and immature way to do it.  If someone actually needs it and it's something they can equip and use as an upgrade in their current role, they should roll need, and others greed.
---
You can do both, but you're at the very least going to need two separate sets. I'm not sure if respecs are required between the two.
---
that makes me very happy! thank you &lt;3
---
We're clearing Ony+MC together in less than our scheduled raid time so we've started to let people come in comedy-value, farming, and PVP specs just to spice things up until BWL comes out.
---
We had a rogue with Viskag+DR coming as hemo this reset. It's awful: *a warlock* beat him even though he used full consumes. He was behind all the mages who are coming in AOE farming spec.
---
We still got Ony + Rag in one night though. This phase is LFR difficulty.
---
But these cost 80s for 5 units ?
---
Without you, we're wiped, so we salute you men and women of shadowy magic.
---
It means those servers have nothing in common with Shrek.
---
And what does that mean? Those casts hit you, a tank/warrior being healed, versus squishy clothies, who are doing the same thing to the opposing DPS without the distraction of a bunch of warstomps and similar interrupts. Gasp, what if they were shielded before this clearly pre-planned tactic?
---
So, is your strategy to just have the melee all sit in the middle, while hellfire/ice rains down? Or is it more that mages are all-powerful so nothing I type will be able to counter their mastery?
---
You sound salty but yea I guess you could call it beginner's luck.
---
Idk about op but a few people definitely replied to me with HURRDADURR I CAN VENDOR BOPS SO I NEED BOPS.   idk if they're actually that stupid or just so incapable of accepting change that they're saying stupid shit without even thinking because the alternative is questioning a system they've internalized as the only "fair" system and literally anything else means you're a ninja.
---
Don't stand in stupid. 😬
---
It's probably pretty accurate. Preach had mentioned this in a video I watched recently - the quests were basically designed to tell you where to grind.  Kill quests, which are really good in groups, tend to have slightly tougher mobs. Drop quests, which are better solo and have slightly easier mobs, have awful drop rates so you're expected to get some exp from grinding them for a while.  I don't mind quests with bad drop rates where the mobs are plentiful and spaced well, like most ogre camps. Some gnoll camps in Westfall are spaced out so it takes time to run between them and it's like pulling a murloc camp. Tag 1 and they bring 4 friends, so you have to range pull and kite one out and figure out the leash range.
---
Your mom's hot.
---
4 wings , 4 different portals , 4 different instance
---
\-Graveyard,  Left most portal and its lvl 26-36  
---
\-Library,  Right most portal and its lvl 29-39 (you get the scarlet key here)  
---
\-Armory, Back wall, right portal and its  lvl 32-42 (requires the scarlet key to open the door)  
---
\-Cathedral, Back wall, left portal and its lvl 35-45 (requires the scarlet key to open the door)
---
Then you need to state this before the group starts. That's what I do. I need to farm doomhowl so when I'm joining a lbrs I tell them we need to kill doomhowl or im not coming.
---
Yeah sure.
---
Not to mention phase 2 doesn't add any raids :/
---
if its a boe might as well need everything bcs you get pieces of shit like this once in a while.
---
So I wasn't just imagining things, this is great! No more of that "inv layer plz" bullshit.
---
I remember in BWL Nef fight there was a texture in the room that if you looked at it at a certain angle and had an ATI graphics card you would crash to desktop, played most of the raid just staring off the balcony
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
Same thing is happening in Winterspring, using a corner in the banker house, guards dont aggro. I report every one of you fucks exploiting.
---
Alliance rogue, if your character is human you'll officially be the worst type of person smh
---
It's not actually bad. It is worse but the non-DPS benefits are pretty large. The more casual your guild is the more the int and stam and resists are worth. 
---
And obviously it's amazing for PvP.
---
&gt;Those one off "kill this one guy" quests totally suck with so many ppl
---
You have no idea. I went to do the King Bangalash quest and it took forever. Eventually I went afk and when I came back an hour later I saw a troll hunter killing him.
---
Obviously I ruined the party-killed the Hunter, stole the kill and had a good laugh.
---
Maybe with layers it's a bit less congested and I don't ruin that guy's night. But holy shit was it bad.
---
very kind words, thank you! i hope blizzard hear you :D
---
The purity of "Butmuncher" farting on a boat.
---
Something tells me you are a mage. Don't bother to confirm, I already know.
---
So, just for intellectual curiosity, you believe there is NO tactic currently available to disrupt a backline of mages? Warriors currently have whirlwind but I really don't see that as a means to push a backline.
---
edit: apologies /u/Swineflew1 I mistook your comment for /u/DwasTV who I'd been responding to. Question still stands about potential counter-tactics.
---
Mine says MOnday for delivery. I cant wait!
---
yes! &lt;3
---
&gt; Next time don't be such a douchebag when you're ignorant.
---
Show me where I'm being a douchebag lmao
---
Also can you even multibox a FPS? I would love to see someone do that.
---
Yes. Eventually they will leave him alone
---
This is my favorite video on this subreddit thus far. Amazing
---
Yeah i bet that 5-100g is going to speed up your progression so much. About as much as rogue with a better dagger lmao. By all means steal someones bIS for the AH its the classy move right
---
If you dont raid you can throw most of the advice away.  The main issue with fire destro in raids is that MC and BWL have a lot of fire resist and fire immune, on top of immolate taking debuff slot and being not very great on mana.  searing pain likewise is mostly a PVP talent, and soul fire is as well (on top of taking a shard and having a CD).
---
But there's nothing wrong with destro, in fact conflag/NF is a very popular PVP spec and in a lot of ways better than SM ruin due to the role warlocks play in BGs, and of course conflag was popularized by drakedog back in vanilla.  Very crit/bursty pvp spec.  I'm sure you can easily make do with it in dungeons, especially as you get gear, because at the end of the day 5man dungeons really dont get any harder than they currently are, and are eventually trivialized by later PVE/PVP gear from raids or ranking.
---
Most guides will point towards the most optimal solution, in warlocks case DS or SM with ruin give the best DPS because in a typical raid environment you can only really cast sbolt + your assigned curse, and sometimes corruption.  That's why they are all sm/ruin or ds/ruin, as they are 4.5% away from one another and by far the *best* option for pve raids.  but dont let that color how you play.
---
If you go for a destro spec, I would advise something like NF/conflag.  It's very fun, you also have the freedom to pick up 2/2 improved healthstone which is useful.
---
I like your WA health/power bars
---
Yeah this is a classic loot dilemma.  Theres really no right way to do it.  
---
For super high value items like this, everyone should roll greed.  
---
I was in a dungeon with a guildmate and 3 pugs and a pre-raid bis boe worth 100g dropped.  My guildmate won it unopposed and the rest of the group passed it to him bc it was a huge upgrade.
---
I wonder if they would have passed if they had known the value of the item though.....
---
ideally you do not auto cast anything on the succubus.  You only manual cast the last of pain or do invis only when in dungeons
---
I don’t think 
---
1g + greed loot + trash drops + trash silver &gt; questing. 
---
Even without the 1g, I still tend to get more.
---
I mean, usually there's some other offspec lower level tank who's currently taking. If I've got a 36 ret pally planning to tank an armory run and a level 40 warrior joins, of course we'll ask him to tank instead. It makes the whole run easier for everyone if the 40 war isn't constantly pulling aggro off the paladin.
---
Things are going to change a lot once people get fully geared up.
---
Just hit 31 last night.
---
It's not naive, it's principled.  Yes, unscrupulous people will sometimes take advantage of you.  You push greed because it's the right thing to do, not because you're certain it will be fair for you.  Life isn't fair, but it can be more equitable, if we try to make it so.
---
Take the high road, and treasure the company of those who follow you there.
---
More context please, what item did he need on, what  class and spec is he?
---
They're saying everyone need because what will happen is 4/5 will roll greed and last second someone will roll need just to sell bc they know they'll get it since everyone else rolled greed. I don't agree but I do think it's the best way to stop ninja looters.
---
While it is definitely a better and a given that you should talk about things before a run, if something drops that is a sweet upgrade for them, they should have priority on it over someone else selling it for gold (making sure they equip it). I understand that people are too greedy for that now though so most courtesies have gone out the window. That is one of the reasons I don't really do group stuff much.
---
I dont like the idea of paying a set price when someone else would just offer to do them for free and I gladly tip them because they're dope for helping a brother out. Obviously it's just how I feel I dont have a problem with people selling portals I just will find someone else
---
Not even close.
---
I didn't make it past your second paragraph sorry. You need to go back and look up the definition of automated.....
---
I can guarantee you 
---
1. The definition won't mention a game of any kind
---
2. A process that requires human input can still be automated - see most factory work
---
You seem to be pretty deeply rooted on the wrong side of this argument, conveniently ignoring a few key things. I'm not interested in convincing you good luck hopefully you play alliance so i can take a crack at you!
---
Its boe so He could buy it at anytime. IF he needs it that much. And if it's not worth that much gold for him to buy it, then he could sell it for that gold value and so could everyone else equally.
---
So everyone has an equal need for the item, whether by gold value or not. That's why its boe, not bop. Because trade value matters too.
---
thank you! moar coming
---
What if he just wants the full set to look cool, doesn't need to be bis.
---
Does anyone have a Druid talent spec for leveling in bear form? I know what my talents should look like at level 60 but not what order to take them.
---
This is too simple for these people. They're confused by the gold coin icon.
---
What spec are you planning on playing? I haven't seen many people complain about pretty much any of the druid specs except maybe boomkin, but even then you still bring the spell crit buff so it's not the worst thing out there.
---
Theres a ton of small things. Switching stances as a warrior often will switch to that stance bar instantly like as soon as you hit the button, then it shows you the original bar and then* does the switch like its supposed to naturally.   
---
Another is wanding, moving for a little to cancel wanding, but your character will continue to wand after the move like 50% of the time. Sometimes you cant use an ability after wanding because youll wand again, gotta spam that shit for it to work at times.
---
I like bread! 🦇
---
Let people enjoy things
---
Alright, so any desktop build post 2011 or laptop from 2014 onwards.... or some higher spec cell phones.
---
Anything in the past decade. Got it.
---
Depending on how hardcore your guild is it takes anything betwen 40 minutes and 3 hours, if its any longer than 3 i suggest just pugging instead.
---
This guy fucked me up too!
---
Idk I havent completed it but hasnt been a huge pain or anything. Was going to SFK anyway so stop in hillsbrad and was gonna quest in ashenvale after any way....
---
"You call that fire? A know of a small burning shrubbery that has more followers than you!"
---
I think that would be a bit too strong. It would also make many people feel they have to first level easy to level classes such as mage, hunter, or warlock before things like warrior, paladin, or rogue. I don't so much care about "the classic experience" but from a gameplay perspective that's just not healthy for the game. Leveling and playing different classes comes with different perks and leveling those is going to be a different experience each time.
---
Personally my first raid with them. The previous week they raided, which I hit 60, I offered them to help on Ragnaros instead of joining a pug and get a full clear going. Inside the instance we realized nobody could douse so I wasted an ID for practically nothing. From what I know they raided a week before that as well, so it's the 3rd Raid from what I know.
---
Leekspin.
---
Won't be too late.
---
Edit: might want to go warrior though if you're planning to raid.  Fury warriors are in high demand when AQ and Naxx come along.
---
I thought you only wanted like 2 in a raid and only 1 later on. Min/max'd comp ofc.
---
People were insisting dozens of layers were active, too.
---
RIP all the people that cried about layering prelaunch then from day 1 took every opportunity they could to abuse it
---
Lifetapping is a DPS reduction :)
---
No. 60s are always going to be needed if you're talking about raiding.  40-mans require a lot of warm bodies for the raid team + bench. And raiding for most of the population hasn't even begun.
---
Jump in, the water's fine.
---
I wouldn't even say that you absolutely need this either.  There's the mace from BRD, there's a quest staff from STV that give armor.
---
You can get more budget things now like Argent Custodian and Magmus Stone for MC/Onyxia tanking that would probably work pretty close at such a minor budget.  Tome of Knowledge is giving you a little hunder half% dodge, and I think for a druid that's equal to around 5 or 6 +defense alone.  Then you get str (more threat) crit (more threat) stamina (mitigation) out of it as well.  I think you even get points of agi -&gt; armor?
---
My point is, I think just the raw armor value of Warden is good, but for phase 1 there are many options that are probably better suited for the content.  But everyone just follows blindly BiS lists without thinking WHY it is there.
---
Just hit search with no search terms or filters to see everything on the AH. Then click on the "Time Left" column to sort it by shortest to longest time remaining.
---
You're getting downvoted but you're mostly right. If one side has everyone on discord and has more engineers and/or mages it can help, but yeah it is mostly a numbers game. Even if you manage to win an 80 vs. 100 because you had some of those things going and the other group didn't, it's not very satisfying or interesting on a personal level.
---
This is why every time there's MMOs that promise huge guild vs guild or region vs region combat I roll my eyes because they never implement it well. You need to break big conflicts up into small to medium sized skirmishes so that it's not just a zergfest, or alternatively make the game slow enough (via higher hp and/or lower damage numbers, or maybe a more creative solution like giving most players temporary immunes) that even when there's a lot of people fighting, people don't just die instantly. But that generally causes problems in smaller scale combat, so breaking things up into smaller skirmishes is the better solution.
---
You do you man.
---
Targeted and sustained harassment against a single player is bannable.  It's a matter of degrees and the first step is to block the people who whisper about it.  If that doesn't end the situation and they escalate by making new characters or recruiting more people to harass, that is actionable.
---
As a spriest I can do it in about 10 minutes. I have to learn rotgrip to make my runs slower because I have wasted time
---
Very few people will pay for a tank, especially one the same level as them who is also expecting to roll on gear.
---
How do I get the stat sheet you have?
---
This one is the best ninja-loot video.
---
https://youtu.be/1NbBpp90coQ
---
On my server spellcleave groups were rare and obviously there are always demand for dungeons to finish quests and get some blues to help with world levelling. All I meant was this tryhard 4 mage 1 warlock zf farm groups are far from the norm.
---
Right, but the player base now seems to also be quite a bit larger and getting going all together, and it makes sense to account for that.
---
Just my opinion, guess it shouldn't be shared if it isn't the popular one. Such is reddit.
---
We like to send out the Ghostbusters to freeze all the eggs.
---
He said nothing to serious.
---
No dude, I don't think it is.. what makes you think this is a troll post?
---
So how does that correlate to the vanilla experience that is touted around so much? Seems opposite yet it's thrown in there as if it's widely accepted as the same thing.
---
Yea, I think it’s compounded with me playing like a normal human since release on a high pop server. It’s so hard to quest or to even grind mobs that I’ve been trying to dungeon grind as much as I can. I’m still only level 49.  
---
I’ve got nobody to blame but myself for playing high pop, hell, it’s what I wanted, and still want tbh, but leveling sure does suck atm.  
---
Herod btw.
---
Yeah, exactly. He gains some threat by attacking first, but if you're putting out strong DFS then you're going to steal it away from the tank. I'd say wait 5 second after he starts and then start casting.
---
No because a human is still sending commands to the other characters.
---
A **robot** would be when a human doesn't interact at all. As soon as a character makes an action due to human intervention make it automatically not a **robot**
---
oooh, so like RES, for WoW
---
*marked for helpful WoW advice*
---
This is really helpful. Thank you.
---
I love that "Old Blanchy" is a realm name.
---
&gt;Need on BoE's where the rule BECAUSE of ninjas, who didn't care about need vs greed.
---
If everybody needs or everybody greeds, the outcome is exactly the same. The difference is that one allows someone to ninja and one doesn't. 
---
&gt;And every item in the game is interchangeable with gold, like blue BoP's, only difference is the amount. So I kinda find it a poor argument.
---
It would be a poor argument if for some reason you couldn't understand the concept of relative value. A BoP item that's an upgrade is worth significantly more to a person than the vendor price. A BoE is worth the exact same thing to everybody in the group: it is worth the AH price. 
---
The need/greed system is fundamentally there to help alleviate the problem if differences in relative value between group members. It obviously isn't a perfect system or we wouldn't have a million memes about hunters rolling need on everything possible that they technically can equip. But that is what it is for. And there is zero argument against the idea that a BoE has the exactly same value for everyone.
---
Go play on a PvE server?
---
And just not autoattacking until five attacks of Sunder isn't an option because...?
---
Again, there's a difference between class feature and profession. But much of the time, players in a group will ask if there are other miners/herbalists/skinners and not hog it all if there is.
---
Common courtesy.
---
Your argument only makes sense for bop. But boe have loads of ways of getting them too because, like you said theres loads of ways to make gold.
---
Why do you have the right to take away someone's gold because you dont want to spend yours to buy your gear?
---
Don't have to be an expert to know having a shitton of stamina is amazing for PvP :p
---
Being one of those priests many moons ago, it means nuke healing your Warlock friends at your Nefarian class call.
---
I'm sorry, but the loot system as it is makes perfect sense and is fair. I have yet to see a solid, well-thought, reasonable argument against the Need/Greed distribution - and until I do,  my stance on it remains unshaken. 
---
And yes, I do and always have enforced it especially when it's not in my favor. When an item is a +5 upgrade to a single stat for me but a massive upgrade for the next guy, I always let them have it because A. I'd be an asshole if I didn't, and B. the group as whole benefits from that exchange a lot more.
---
I am aware that there are people who disagree with that. They may even disagree strongly enough to say "I'd never run a dungeon/raid with you and your dumb rules." You know what? I'm perfectly fine with that, and wholeheartedly support their decision not to.
---
What is the addon on the far left called? I vaguely remember having it...

Level up, plain and simple. Gold will be more common the high level you get. As for your professions just level them as you go along. Mining will give you more gold when you get to later professions, fishing will give you gold so check the market price on those too. Only spend money on skills you need until you get your mount.
---
&gt; They're running literally on the same hardware and codebase..
---
Uhh, no.  They are 100% not running the same codebase or hardware.  They're emulating parts of it, but they're modern servers with mostly like a modified wow server.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw a talk on this where they pulled old data tapes from an old server and talked about difficulties implementing them in the new server codebase.  Something about terrain and model data being structured differently.
---
I've heard esfand say that
---
What US-eastcoast PVP Server would be a good one to start on?
---
the best part? really?
---
I'm at 7 days played too!
---
I guess I just spent too much time fooling around in PvP and helping my buddies.
---
Warrior's charge doesn't aggro. You can charge a mob and then immediately back off and not pull aggro.
---
So it's almost a warrior blink if there is a mob you can charge to lol
---
I mean, I can get the logic of how they designed warfronts. I kinda like the idea tbh. Just put down some quests down in an area that horde and alliance both want to do, and just let the PVP happen! And with phasing, you always have a decent amount of parity between the horde and alliance numbers. It's certainly better than any of the wPVP objectives that wizard tried during wow's early years.
---
And it does happen. Once I switched on warmode I encountered for the first time groups of players forming raids to hunt down groups of alliance assassins (players that had gotten several honor kills in a row, giving them a buff but also making them worth more honor.) And these assassins got their kills because they were hanging out near a warfront and pvping with people. It works well! I was honestly pretty impressed with the design, compared to a lot of things in modern retail WOW that feels *really* stale and poorly executed. Like 100% of the class design for instance.
---
Problem is, the wPVP itself has virtually no worthwhile benefit. Honor only gives you points towards cosmetic rewards.
---
Definitely more arseholes online now than back in the day. Shame really that the internet was made accessible to them.
---
Do you seriously not see the irony of this comment.
---
Warlock tier 1 set sucks anyway. Besides completing T1 set isn't beating the game lol
---
I think that Ret requires such hyper-specific gear to be remotely effective in late game PvE that it’s just not worth it. You can be really strong in PvP, though. If you really want to PvE as Ret, honestly you might be best off going for the full PvP blue set (which will take some time but is far from inaccessible). That’ll give you the stats to be competitive in raids like MC and BWL, I think (though you’ll still need more +hit gear).
---
Personally, I’m going to level my paladin as a hybrid and then go full Prot at 60. I’ll be able to main tank dungeons, but I’ve accepted that I’ll only ever off-tank in raids since I won’t have a taunt. Still, I think that’ll be enough for me.
---
It’s done by configuring software to make the 4 slave characters take the same actions as the master character, adding /follow macros, and then playing the master character basically normally.
---
&gt;don't get baited by the "best ways to grind XP" bullshit that comes from retail mentality.
---
We are on our alts, we both have a 60 already, so it's not so much anymore about skipping interesting content as it is saving some time on lvling.  I can't say 30-40 is super fun, I'd rather rush to 40 and get our mounts so we can go have more fun pvping out in the world, and at least SM is a pretty nice place to grind it out with some good drops for the both of us.
---
You dont need bots to actually snipe with TSM. Just a good formula.
---
I’m sitting on a bunch of plaguebloom and ghost mushrooms for when people realize they need pots and ghost dye lol
---
Agreed. If a group requests a DPS and a warrior signs on that for that role, then no idea why the group would turn around and ask him to tank also. Especially given that the group should have simply asked for a tank when LFMing.
---
You're right.
---
I just have pretty simple reasoning for my ranks. I value class design/balance and endgame content by far the highest.
---
MoP had everything for me. The best class design, great raids, alot of content etc 
---
Vs classic that (imo) has terrible design, simple raids and very lacking endgame
---
But ah well
---
That is very strange though. Any reason you don't use the main bar for stuff other than food? Just curious.
---
People are still talking about this???
---
*B a t t l e S h o u t*
---
if you go dig into some technical articles recently you'll notice they talk about fixing bugs related to how spell batching works because they have to essentially emulate the old spell-batching system which was implemented for performance reasons in the past but no longer operates in the same way.
---
It’s happened to me.  I was on my 60 druid leveling up herbalism when the call for pvp help came out.  A group of alliance were camping and killing horde in the cave next to hammerfall.  I go in and it’s 3 level 40-42 alliance, a mage hunter and priest.  I did not get an opener since I tried to save the warrior they were banking and they killed me.  Between the cc the mage and hunter were laying on me and the heals from the priest, I got thrashed and was oom from all the shifting to avoid the cc.  I did come back and kill all three, but I certainly couldn’t just face roll based off the level difference.
---
Cheers pal
---
Rogues basically farm the exact same gear as fury warriors
---
oh noes, I have been ninjed,  what ever will I do,  life is over.
---
oh no wait, my in game life is better, I won't group with you again.
---
At least you recognize that  under the default need/greed system you are nijaing.
---
Just don't join the groups. If I have done a boss 30 times and not gotten my item I will reserve it. If you want it, too, join a different group.
---
There's nothing wrong with setting arbitratry loot groups for your run, it's up to the others to decide whether they want to abide these rules.
---
You can simplify the Faerie Fire macro a bit
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;/cast \[stance:1/3\] Faerie Fire (Feral); Faerie Fire
---
I was merely agreeing with you and laying out the logic that the "need=equip, everyone else greed" crowd is missing out on- the opportunity cost of the drop
---
Warriors cant dps til endgame.  Dps warriors bring nothing to a group.  No hard cc and mediocre dps.
---
Like you wouldn't?! That was insane.
---
Try using some sim software like Simcraft. You can test any variables or rotation that you want, fight length, enchants, talents, etc all to your liking. itll give you definitive answers with data to back it up. Not sure how well it can work for classic but im sure someone somewhere has something.
---
Depends on loot rules.  You have to decide the loot rules ahead of time for MC...and MC should always have a master looter.
---
My superior mana potions have made me a couple hundred gold so far from just buying mats and selling the pots
---
If you just turned 50 then Searing Gorge and Blasted Lands are your best options.  The other 3 have quests well into the mid-high 50s, and you should try waiting as long as you can before going there.
---
Run the spec for the content you are the most serious about.  If you value pvp more, hemo is fine.  It's not as good as combat but combat blows chunks in pvp.
---
I bought every item for that quest, but then farmed all the zesty clams and more from fishing while waiting for the 1hr mail from my bank alt.
---
You never CC the unmarked one, if that's what the group said then they are bad and don't know how to mark.
---
Ok, that makes sense wiith the pickpocketing and all that...I am now curious as to what these utilities are for each class.. do you happen to know of an in-depth guide on this? I am obviously lacking in information on this and would like to educate myself on this more....
---
lol thats what happens when you put valuable items for 1s. You pretty much gave it away xd. Your fault
---
I am so proud of you! FOR THE HORDE!
---
Not in official servers

My server was selling stacks for silver.
---
ye i tried but i atm horde is all over in my server , i got instakilled in fellwood satyrys and azshara by 60 levels pussies
---
It is more about being informed that these are people deserving of hate even if you are emotionally healthy and let go of the hate. Seems like a good solution to me!
---
I once sold Warden Staff for 9 gold
---
in actual vanilla though, but still
---
Ah I see.  And yes that's the thing with this whole issue, specifics and perspective are all that matter.
---
I agree with you and my experience with this has all been pleasant. It makes no sense that rogues default get locked chests, if anything it is just an added feature of dungeons that give a group an added benefit of bringing a rogue and formulating the 5 man team as they see fit.
---
Zug Zug
---
You didn’t even show you killing half of these people or even using any relatively interesting tactics lol
---
Those horde should be ashamed
---
Point of correction, what you're calling "phasing" is actually "sharding".
---
Phasing is when a zone changes appearance because of your quest state or advancement in the story. It's a story-telling device, not a technical device.
---
/r/classicwowplus/ please post this here.

I had the same problem! You can try to do some quests in Duskwood and the Wetlands!

Thought so, ran past him in Hinterlands couple nights ago.

Pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for the answer. I thought I could resist renewing my account for the first time since 2007, but no. Can't do. Gotta play. At least a little ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

For feral druids, you will not get the AP from predatory strikes when using this macro to shift directly into bear form. May affect other talents too, but I haven't tested it

Sunder, rend and hamstring help mobs die so much faster and prevents them from running away.

&gt; I don't think most people ARE legitimately confused. I think most people are just angry they can't do what they want to.
---
Yeah, that's not condescending at all.
---
Congratulations, you're a tism. Thankfully you don't play on Shazzrah.
---
What server?
---
No, there's a sound alert and it takes less than a second to get your mouse over to click the thing and scroll the wheel. Often I'll be just watching a movie or w/e so I just have my mouse hovered over ready to click an item anyway. I do a couple different types of snipes though depending on how braindead I want to be so like vendor sniping it's just instant without thought, but otherwise there's some delay depending on the item to determine if it's worth it, but people who are more experienced already know what stuff is worth so they'd be instant on those too.
---
Curse = twitch I thought, or my friend gave me bad info.  But I've been noticing sometimes twitch client misses stuff. Didn't know there was still a curse client.
---
Which server?
---
Honestly, I would snipe this listing too. But I would then message the guy who posted it and give it back if it was unintentional. He clearly either meant to put 30g or has no fucking clue how much it would be worth. I'd feel way too guilty keeping it and flipping it for 100x profit.
---
&gt; Join their group anyway, roll need anyway
---
Breaking set loot rules is a reportable offense. If you don't want to abide certain loot rules, get a different group. It's not hard und unfair or anything. Anyone can make a group, there is no point in sabotaging other groups just because you think their rules are bullshit.
---
No shit Sherlock.
---
More if you cook them.
---
What do you expect from orcs
---
He used his class abilities along with his profession to PvP, I think you missed the point of leveling engineering.
---
They're almost a month behind though, not just 3 days?
---
Are you locking them again once they are where you want them?
---
Don't worry about it, you'll be fine. As a former rogue main, rogue is literally the easiest class to raid as. You don't have major aggro concerns and there are like 2 places in the entire game where you have any amount of responsibility, neither of which even exist right now (suppression room traps and dodge tanking during Razuvios). No dispelling, no tanking, no offtanking, no pulling, no worrying about mana, no banishing. Hit things and keep slice and dice up.
---
I second this. All of it.
---
Did they pick by server population? Why isn't Thunderfury one of the 13? I thought it was one of the smallest.
---
As a rogue I always roll on chests, even if I loose, I offer to unlock it for whoever wins the roll. I've always done it this way and never understood why anyone else wouldn't.
---
I also always roll greed on lockboxes and offer to unlock those if I loose.
---
Could've sworn it said 100%, I was beginning to feel worried for your gf, thinking she thought you were done.
---
Dude, my group was in BRD doing arena/anger/golem and as a rogue, I wanted the shanker from the bar which wasnt that much further for the group. When I asked the tank if we could go for the drop from him too, he says “going to golem is a curtesy to the healer but I’m not doing anything more”. 
---
Well, just so happens HOJ dropped and he then proceeded to beg for me and the other rogue in the group to pass. We win the roll and proceeded to laugh at him and his attempts to buy the item from us. Had his ass been nicer and helped me get bar shank, perhaps I would of passed on the trinket. Karmas a bitch and I love it!
---
Need is for when you need that specific item to advance your toon. Greed is for when acquiring that item would enrich your character in a way that something else would be just as effective at doing. 
---
The greed symbol is literally gold. It's assumed that if you greed something your only looking to turn it into gold.
---
If the developers intended everyone to roll need just to auction it or sell it. They would have just made gold drop and have it divided up even over the group
---
What is the alternative exactly? Just pass and give him a 100% chance? Find out where he live in RL, fly to his house and make him roll with everyone else?
---
Dude that’s cool as a cucumber
---
u/BAEtted pretty much does nothing but complain and say shitty things to people on reddit. Not sure how a human can be happy to be so negative all the time.
---
I honestly don’t know if it could ever happen, especially with streamer realms like Faerlina.
---
We will see, Blizzard has done a good job so far so I’m confident in their abilities
---
I'm level 35, could quest in STV but I did that the first time I played (like 12-13 years ago) so i'm trying to avoid it. basically done with desolace (just got the escorts, final reclaimers(I think), and another centaur quest or two). where should i go? just grind SM cath? i'm a healer
---
Unless you find a progression guild with a lot of other noobies.  That can be pretty fun rather than just having veterans carry you through.
---
Faerlina...
---
in the raids i played it would literally be less than 1fps per second and it would only be a matter of time before the server got reset.
---
Bullshit.  I used a detailed quest addon when they spawned Chromaggus server to reach 60 in 7 days played as a priest.  I wish i could remember what it was called but it existed post BWL and I used it in Vanilla on a fresh server.  I'll see if i can find the name after work.
---
"Fury warriors dont even have a hit penalty"
---
Maybe dont say something stupid if you dont want stupid answers. You cant have heroic strike queued 100%
---
Hahahaha! Only 100% done leveling... *Evil laugh*
---
Honestly? No, he REALLY suck as a RL.
---
He has by far the best gear and still manage to place LAST amongst Rogues.
---
I’m on Whitemane, if you are there I’ll be glad to take them off your hands ;)
---
stam and int is going to be more efficient while lvling but i t doesnt really matter use both
---
What are the typical lengths of dungeon runs at higher levels?  How about typical lengths of specialized runs like the DM East rich thorium veins run ( I know this isn't out yet ).
---
Whaaaat?! Around 40 is when they get strong. At least that’s my opinion (I’m new to WoW). 
---
Low level Warlock is strong. You can easily fear down elites 2 levels above you. Then things get a bit slower in the 20s when your voidwalker taunt is crap and imo spec you get hit and have to kite too much. 
---
But maaaaannn when you get the new drain life at 38, then Dark Pact (if that’s the name. The pet mana tap). I can just crank through even level mobs nonstop. I love it!
---
But hey, to each their own! I hope you find your class!
---
I think you just won haha.
---
&gt; Barron Rivendales mount is still considered an upgrade
---
...
---
Well...that's only if they wait around for the honor system to come out when people start creating twinks.
---
Hemo is technically a pretty valuable debuff, it's just that Gift of Arthas is just as good and doesn't take a subpar PvE spec to use.
---
Honestly, I say just accept one of the invites you get, see how the guild is. If you like it, stay. If not, /gquit and check out another one.
---
people don't play runescape they just complain about it on reddit.
---
It will speed him up by exactly the same amount as a rogue getting 5-100g that he could then use to buy said dagger. By all means, lets throw logic out the window and argue from a fundamental standpoint.
---
thanks for considering the other point of view and not mindlessly  crying the usual ' ninjaaaaaaa' mantra.  It is indeed better to group with people with the same ideas about loot, saves everybody a lot of drama.  For this reason I always try to communicate before the first  pull , although that is sometimes difficult, due to language barriers or  retail 'zerg zerg zerg'  mindset
---
&gt;Go check out ANY zone level 30-40 around 8-10pm EST.
---
There are many zones in that range. Only one of them has ever been super crowded, STV, and it's crowded because it's one of the best zones in the game.
---
play your cards right and who knows wink wink
---
dammit this is so epic
---
24 Hours /played . I played other mmo's before so the mechanics were not new and I rushed a bit, since there was nothing else to do\^\^
---
Does reckoning work? I don’t think I’ve seen it proc once. I have redoubt talented too and that procs often, reckoning should proc at the same time?

 [https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/druid/leveling-1-60/](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/druid/leveling-1-60/)   
---
Just the picture thats the last thing in section 6.
---
Gotcha, I was kind of curious there for a second.
---
Yeah, an invisible wall could work too.
---
The real rogue move is to stealth ahead, peak inside, see a Boe rare, drop group, loot rare, whisper group leader you accidentally dropped, get invited back, then roll on the chest with everyone else
---
The logic is actually very simple.  
---
&gt; AH &gt; Upgrade &gt; Vendor  
---
BoE = AH  
---
50silver BoP = Vendor
---
Much of the set is completely fine for PvE as well, and may save you time farming. I got the gloves a couple weeks ago. Are they slightly worse than Hands of Power? Yes. Am I happy to never farm fucking Zigris again and not worry about a tiny DPS loss? Also yes.
---
Just made the switch to Alliance and I’m on mobile so haven’t really looked at changing it yet
---
Everyone with a brain can spell roll correctly. Maybe check your comment before questioning someone’s intelligence
---
Uh... Ghost Mushrooms are already crazy expensive. Usually around 1g, but I've seen them 2g each.
---
Im using Vuhdo as my raid frames, a TON to configure but if set up right you can get exactly what you need. Showing only dispellable debuffs for example. Might be worth a look
---
Can I volunteer to get on these lists? I don't want invites from people who don't understand BoE loot rules. They probably don't understand how to play their class either. If you guys could create a huge database of "ninjas" and circulate it on reddit for all the noobs to use, that would be ideal.
---
How do I know the warrior doesn't already have a ravager and just doesn't have it equipped? I need money my mount is more important than a second ravager.
---
It's easy to get lots of groups for SM Arms as a warrior, just offer to tank.
---
Bonebiter is a bit better for solo questing than ravager but I personally took the 1h sword as the quest reward for my leveling tanking set.  
---
Prior to getting ravager my 2h was significantly worse than corpsemaker as I could never get it to drop in all my rfk runs.
---
Pre release there were just AHs in ironforge and org, 1.9 linked AHs by faction in all cities. So you’re safe to bet your friend 1000g that vanilla had a linked AH in darn
---
[linked Auction Houses](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Linked_Auction_Houses)
---
Blasted lands is pretty awful when it's crowded, and it usually is. Searing George and Ungoro are both great questing zones, as is felwood though it's not particularly long.
---
T2 helm and Belt are hella good items
---
Cool!
---
The group made the effort to get there, and since all classes do bring something to the table, the Rogue should /roll with everyone else and unlock for the winner.
---
The great thing about being a Rogue is that, if for whatever reason they want to waste their time farming locked chests, most of the time they can just stealth in solo and do it. If it’s two mobs guarding, sap and blind. If it’s three, sap one, blind one, kill the third, kill the blinded target, then kill the sapped target; evasion if they can’t kill one before the other breaks CC.
---
Sorry, I should’ve said a general rule for logical people. Logical people don’t equip an item worth 100g if they only get 10g of value out of it, they would sell it and get 100g worth of upgrades. Logical people also will agree that if they get 100g value out of a 100g item, then it is comparable to a 100g raw drop of currency.
---
Now....DPS very very slowly...and by slow, I mean FUCKING slow.
---
Cant wait for phase 42!
---
It is not selfish, a BoE has the same value to everyone in the party, so everyone should have an equal chance of obtaining it. The BoE rule applies to items I might want as well, and I'm fine with it because it is more fair to the entire party.
---
That drops in LBRS not BRD.
---
i mostly just focus on Darnassus rep quest now for my kitty kat
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Really it's a pretty mediocre debuff that works out to around 60 dps if you don't clip any charges.  It's ok in MC level gear, but sat that it's outdamages by any warlock's corruption.
---
what do you mean dual? It's dool wield.
---
Wonder if that dude came back for classic. Or if he died of an aneurism.
---
Fair, scumbag was a tad much and I take it back. Maybe I’m bias from my memories of vanilla. When people ‘Ninjaed’ (I know you dont see it that way but imma used that term for now) they would immediatly leave grp, HS or log off entirely to avoid being flamed cause it was commonly that much frowned upon.
---
I guess we didnt have the same means of communication like reddit back then and maybe thats why the discussion gets abit more heated these days.
---
It does.
---
Thought you can't swap trinkets in combat? If I'm going crazy, what addon do you recommend?
---
When those streamers stop streaming or scale back, the population will take a nose dive.
---
I second that
---
ummm.  Yeah, nah.   
---
Streamers....ffs.
---
the only way to address is it just talk in your fing party
---
Ah, no alliance for me. Either UD mage or orc warrior for me
---
No... you haven't.
---
You said:
---
&gt;This doesn't answer anything as people do TONS of stuff that fits that description in world PvP that isn't bannable in any way.
---
You gave zero examples of where that doesn't apply. You gave a vague generality.
---
Unless you mean:
---
&gt;Should I be worried about a mob that gets stuck in a root while soloing a group quest? What about an add in a raid boss fight that gets stuck? What if it's a player in a BG that gets stuck in buggy terrain? Do I have to just assume that any time there's any kind of pathing or AI issue I could get banned?
---
In which case, yes, it does fit in. Instead of "griefing other players" change it to "for personal gain". It falls on step 2. Was it intentional and/or malicious? An add somehow bugs out and makes the raid fight easier? Fine. Abuse that bug every subsequent time to trivialize it intentionally? Not fine, bannable.
---
Again, this is **not** complicated. It's hilariously simple to figure out if something is bannable or not. You're either not being genuine, or you're just not very clever. And I won't apologize for saying that, either. If answering the questions "is this a bug being abused" and "did i do it intentionally and/or maliciously" is too much for you, then that's your problem not Blizzard's. I would have no sympathy for you getting banned.
---
Why's everyone playing mages and warriors in classic nowadays? Lol.
---
Use that money to buy a keyboard that has a working print screen key.
---
Eh, it's a gray area that people will disagree on. There's a major difference in Mages/locks and rogues in that a rogue actually has to train up lockpicking, just as you would skinning/mining/herbalism. Do you also expect to get to roll on that rich thorium vein's loot without having mining?
---
There are secondary abilities that benefit the party and secondary abilities that benefit the user. It's a bit disingenuous to compare them.
---
I know, but these do not effect the models or as far as I know textures. Mostly it's just shadow and field depth.
---
The quest to get the Signet of Ragnaros or whatever from the elites in searing gorge was my most recent.  Had to solo like 30 elites before it dropped, while avoiding horde that were killing those mobs for some reason (pretty sure those quests are ally only).  The caster were a joke but the melee guys took my entire mana bar per kill.
---
They didn't do spell batching by reducing the server tickrate lol its intentional and many things clearly function at a higher rate.  Is that what this is all about everyones still mad about spell batching and thinks it's bad servers?
---
Should be free, but tips should be handed out when relevant. For example, if I get a BoE Epic out of a chest a Rogue unlocked, which I wouldn't have had without the Rogue being there, he's getting a tip and possibly even a % of the BoE's selling price.
---
No it fucking doesn't have the same value to everyone. If someone is there and can use it they get priority because it's a drop in a dungeon. It's not some magical separate thing. Stop excusing your and other shitty behavior that you feel like you need to account for by doing shitty behavior. It's your fault.
---
Hey what addon makes your nameplate and the enemy's the same color as their class?
---
yes. hint: save your arcane crystals.
---
Herbs are worthless right now because the content out doesn't require any crazy flasks and there's still a ton of people who haven't even hit 60 and are raiding yet. I have always been herbalist/alchemy since I started playing the game and fresh expansions (esp this one aka the first version of the game) typically it happens at first and then they rise the more and more people hit max level and start raiding. It's actually a damn good time to buy underpriced herbs and throw them in your bank.
---
Yeah, that's normal. Just means someone saw it before you. Not every scan for everyone is hitting at the same time, so what is fraction of a second for you was actually a second or two for someone else.  That's why you miss some snipes even if you clicked it as fast as you possibly could.  If the botting was as widespread as people are claiming it would be literally impossible for me to snipe.
---
I’m sure those two guilds are a lot less significant than they think they are. 
---
Just ignore them and move along.
---
PLEASE! *Cries in holy priest*
---
PvP gear in phase 2 is kind of a beef for me. A VERY large portion of it is BiS for the life of the game. 
---
Like how the fuck are you going to delay Dire Maul because of it's gear then release PvP epics in the same phase.
---
thanks I thought duskwood would be higher level, but I'll give that a shot.
---
Something tells me you wish you were a mage. Don't bother to confirm, I already know. 
---
So just for Intellectual Curiosity you believe a warrior, one of the most immobile classes in Classic has a change against a backline of mages all with roots and CC and every means to get away from you easily. [Let me introduce you to the last warrior that thought this](https://i.redd.it/lqmgwya7hxm31.png)
---
DAoC had a few huge things going for it, namely three factions instead of two to help bring balance.  Every faction was outnumbered.  Also small, coordinated groups had the tools to control larger, less coordinated groups.

AoE CC that lasted 30-45 seconds unless someone in your group disspelled you was *amazing*.  And the fact that a type of CC could only apply to you once was amazing too.  The less coordinated groups would stumble over each other and break their own CC, giving you immunity.
---
NO!  Go play retail peasant.
---
I mean, you could write a program that would track your wow zone and go to YouTube urls accordingly. Might have a problem with ads though
---
My thoughts exactly.  I mean the reason I even made the post was because I couldn't find anything on it.  Hopefully this will help convince my coworker =\]  thanks

According to: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/   Your rejuv scales at 80% of spell power per cast, and at the same ratio per tick.
---
Regrowth does seem a bit weak. Flash Heal scales at 85%, whereas Regrowth scales at 82.28 and most of that scaling is over 15 seconds.
---
For the first few sections of BRD that's fine.  The final boss is 59 if that helps at all.
---
You gonna use free action potions on every fight?
---
How do you know who’s the top raiding guilds?
---
People who mock MC don't understand the difference of the gear when the raid originally released and the gear available right now. Same for talents. And for some guilds having had hundreds of practice runs.
---
The raid had quite some gear requirements originally. Mages weren't running around with 300 spellpower back then, bosses lived like 3 times as long which required much better healing (mana management, better gear with more int since +heal was also scarce)
---
It has never been mechanically challenging but it also wasn't always doable with 58s.
---
Off the top of my head (and I might be missing some):
---
Druid: Mark of the Wild, Thorns.
---
Mage: Intellect Buff, Food and water, portal to a capital city of choice.
---
Priest: Stamina Buff, possible Spirit buff.
---
Rogue: Lockpicking chests.
---
Warlock: Soulstones, Healthstones, Summons.
---
Paladins: Buffs galore.
---
I can't think off the bat what utility Shamans and Warriors bring to the table outside of the usual skill or spell rotations in combat.
---
Basically, when I say utility, it's skills or spells that are used out of combat that help the group.
---
The urge for you to eat my anus was too strong. Pathetic is how long you have been getting trolled. As I said. Eat my asshole out..
---
I found this:
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/46/basic-stats-sheet
---
Looks like 16,500 for Classic.  I believe I heard a number similar on Tipsout youtube video when he interviewed Skarm (a popular long time bear tank on private realms) who had the number memorized.
---
It's fine.
---
Just be carefull to not agro if your group is skipping too many mobs.
---
So to prevent a few people from exploring the system you pervert it for everyone?
---
Saying everyone need is taking advantage of the system just the same. The only difference is that "everyone need" is pretending to be altruistic about it
---
It was the Cadaverous Armor chest piece. Apparently it's a pre-raid best in slot piece for rogues. Something I didn't know beforehand. They were all higher level than me with good gear, so I (wrongly) assumed he didn't need it, and I proceeded to roll on it out of excitement. Which was my mistake and has not happened to me once in 15 years of playing the game, and I did apologise many times to him, to no avail.
---
What was the item
---
It doesn't seem weird to me if it's a 100+ gold drop in a pug. Sure it's probably an upgrade to a member but if they want it they'll have to roll against me, I'm not just gonna give that to someone, are you crazy?
---
\*Meanwhile me in my 40's\* ... wait.. people have epics?!

Been reading online about ret palas in PVP and they get shredded for being one of the worst DPS classes if not the worst in the game, I’m currently level 40 and I’m absolutely raping people, maybe it’s just a skill gap? But I’m rolling around STV raping 40-42/3 players 1v1. 
---
Pros 
---
High burst damage
---
Excellent sustain
---
Good CC
---
Excellent utility 
---
Cons
---
Weak dmg spell versatility (but for me pressing less buttons is a pro imho) 
---
Can be kited by hunters/mages easily 
---
Tbh even against mages and hunters, the burst dmg is so high the pressure I put on them makes them pop all their CDs. Which is fine, I have 3 bops, a stun to heal and LOH for the inevitable.
---
Please can someone enlighten me? I played hunter during vanilla and never really PvPd until TBC.
---
Seem like I hit like a warrior in terms of damage but with better sustain, a bubble and better utility.
---
Hunter vs Warlock vs Mage in the scaling game? In terms of both PvP and PvE, do any of them start to fall off as the Phases will continue?
---
I worry mainly that one might fall behind in power due to gear as the Phases progress.
---
Okay, so here's what I think is the problem with Retail World PVP. **I think there is too much to do in the game.** I know, how can a game have *too much* to do? Well, if you are constantly trying to do daily quests, farm something, grind something... that's all you will be focused on doing. Why seek out organic, spontaneous forms of gameplay when I haven't yet finished my AP grind for the week? Or I haven't run my daily Mythic Dungeon or Daily BG? Players have a whole checklist of things they need to get done, and they try to get it done before they log off. They don't have time to be messing around in World PVP. And if they encounter it, they seek to avoid it by switching layers or just saying fuck it, I'm turning off wPVP and playing in PVE mode. And if you are running a Dungeon, you don't need to go out into the world to queue into it. 
---
Actually, this same thing happens in Classic, but it's not as bad. There are a lot of zones where people are really focused on leveling and questing. Alliance and Horde will pass by each other and not kill each other because they don't want to fuck with the program. I noticed this happening a lot in the Mage AOE grinding spots. If you start messing with each other and ganking, *no one will get anything done*. So there's this unspoken peace. But sometimes, it fractures. Someone decides to gank, or someone decides they're bored. Or maybe someone thinks they will get more done if they clear out the competition. Whatever the case, sometimes fights do happen in these areas. That can occasionally be fun, but for the most part it's peaceful.
---
At max level, though, people have a lot more free time on their hands. I don't mean that they don't have anything to do at all. People might be farming gold for their epic mount, they might be working on tradeskills, they might be leveling alts. But there's not this daily obsession with getting XYZ done. You can have a day when you just fuck around in World PVP and it doesn't feel like you are doing anything wrong. That's because at 60, your time is your own. Blizzard's not forcing you into certain activities because you need to grind AP or you need to get a random chance at rolling Titanforged epic on a weekly chest. You're free to explore the game and figure out what's fun to you. You get your raiding done for the week, and you can just... do the activities you think are fun. What a concept - playing a game because it's fun. Not because you have some incentive to grind endlessly every day until you burn out. 
---
If the core game is fun, you don't need incentive. Just like in Sandbox MMOs, players will come up with things. They'll create their own events. They'll coordinate raids on the other cities. They'll have naked Gnome races across the world. They'll host dueling competitions. They'll twink alts. They'll help friends level in dungeons and out in the open world. They'll defend newbies from ganks. Then the gankers friends will come out to help kill the 60s, and it will build and build until you have an all-out battle between Southshore and Tarren Mill. 
---
But if players are constantly trying to get shit done for dailies and weeklies... well, they will never take a break to figure out something else that could be fun in an organic, spontaneous way.
---
I think the argument was about social courtesy not function.  Too many players don't know to roll need.
---
Tbh if not everyone did roll need on BoE if you're super considerate just have them /roll and give if they "win".
---
Never trust others though.  Always explain everyone need it and never fall for the "everyone greed" pitfall
---
Can someone explain the massive price? Why would anyone pay this much for a levelling item? Im lvl 24 and i pieces if gear with like +11 and +6. Plus other crazy stat gear. Why is this so expensive?
---
Agreed on Shadowpanther, especially for the weapon lists. Still, Wowhead is solid as a beginner's guide
---
Yeh so this is something I kinda figured. Perhaps if we were doing ONLY quests and ONLY what was required of them, THEN maybe he'd fall behind in the zone so when I got off he'd maybe be a little underleveled. But if we're flying through it fast enough and killing generally anything we come across in super quick fashion, then I imagine he would be doing alright. Otherwise, you're right about the dungeons. Once he's level 18 we could probably fit in multiple runs in a far shorter amount of time than it'd normally take him going in looking for groups by himself.
---
Do your class quests! Great rewards and will probs bring you to mid 50s
---
Pugs can last from 1hr to Forever.
---
Guild runs with Disc/etc can take from 30mins to 1hr.
---
Welcome to classic bud.
---
I think in duels it’s common to “reset” and pop out of combat, allowing you to switch.
---
It makes me irrationally angry when I see it. I want to ignore people who do it even if they are in my guild.
---
Gotcha! Yeah mainly just hoping to do the first half, although I do also want to get attuned for MC soon, so sounds like I would need at least 55 for that?
---
That's awesome, thanks! Does not taking Primal Fury leave you rage starved much of the time?
---
400g item drops, someone in the group can use the item, everyone in the group can sell the item and buy an upgrade.

What’s that orb?
---
I've noticed most DPS is just quick on the trigger finger. It was like that in vanilla too. You can try to pick up the pace so they don't feel like it's going slow, or you can let them know that you're having trouble getting aggro at the start and that you would like DPS to wait until you pull and have a sunder or two on before engaging. Communication is key and you want to keep the run moving and fun. Don't call anyone out for their mistakes in party chat. Don't be negative. Bored DPS leads to them doing stupid things and causing issues for the group.  
---
One thing to watch for is everyone's mana. DPS won't pull if they are oom. And I like to keep pulling when the healer has mana but the DPS is kinda of low. It forces them to drink at the beginning of the pull giving you a chance to build aggro.  
---
All that said, some people are assholes. And you might have to kick a player out of the group if they aren't cooperating or being a bully to other group members. You're the tank, you have to take the leadership role, set the standard, and deal with issues along the way.
---
Dire Maul :)
---
That \[Good Luck Charm\] certainly came in handy
---
Pointing to a fringe on one side and then a huge chunk on another and saying “both sides” is fairly worthless to this topic, but thanks for the effort
---
What class/spec are you?
---
Ok everyone, whatever you want your loot rules to be, establish them with your group in game chat beforehand. That way if someone breaks them you can report them and they can be banned and have the item deleted. If everyone does this it will hugely cut down on the number of ninjas.
---
Bill Brasky used spellcleave! TO BILL BRASKEY!
---
Cool, thanks. Never even played that far in vanilla!
---
Cleave is useful on more than 1 target.  I like slam because I can build up rage and then knock a mob down from half health pretty quick.
---
How do you know it for a fact? What evidence/proof do you have?
---
Your situation is different than what I've really been looking at in my posts. Fuck those guy's they're ninja looters. In guild groups the focus is always the betterment of the guild. No questions asked. Like I said, usually an upgrade goes to someone during dungeons or questing. We're discussing a few rare cases here. I haven't rolled need on anything that wasn't a direct upgrade for me off of a regular boss loot table. If someone in my guild, which are mostly people I know IRL, did what you described I'd hope they rectified their mistake. Otherwise I'd drive the 600 miles home and beat their ass.
---
Noooow you're getting it.
---
Even worse, these items often effectively have *lower* drop rates than dungeon drops, because you can't farm for them specifically, and they can appear with any number of dozens of affixes.
---
always need
---
Warriors top DPS meters, and mages top Alterac valley
---
Cadaverous Armor chest piece. I play an enhancement shaman outside of dungeons and (if people want an enhancement shaman) sometimes in dungeons as well. I joined as a healer in this instance.
---
Yeah if I put "LFM anger forge/golem run" and people expect me to run other stuff, that's their fault for joining.
---
But I tend to help them anyway because BRD is cool
---
The argument has the worst logic. Yes everyone needs gold, it can buy and progress you too. But if something drops someone will equip, they get priority over the AH. Why? For the same reason A boss drops gear instead of only gold. The same reason you dont buy all gear at a vendor. Its a part of the spirit of an RNG gear game.  Saying they NEED it to sell is equally as bad as needing someones Bis BoP for vendor gold lol. You can farm for gold but not really that epic Boe. If something rare drops someone can eequip,  let them enjoy the experience. Is that not better then some trip to the AH? I mean screw the spirit of this RNG gear game, better to make a quick buck. Is that really how you think it should be?
---
Well, seeing as how Asmongold did a 15 man Onyxia kill: if you can get into a raid as a Ret Paladin, go ahead. Classic WoW is so piss easy at the moment that that shouldn’t be the be all, end all, in terms of getting bosses killed. As people have said before though, there are *lots* of people playing dps, so it may be more of the fact that there simply isn’t enough slots available for dps rather than you are a detriment to the raid.
---
Layering doesn't affect queue times. Pop cap is the only thing that does, and it's not directly tied to layering
---

Simple example going around.  You and 4 friends pitch in and buy a raffle for a Ferrari and win. one of your friends doesnt have a car at all. By your logic he should just get the ferrari by necessity then?
---
If you're such a giver you're cool with giving away a Ferrari then good for you but dont call people pathetic because some people might want to trade the Ferrari in for cash, or at least want a chance at the Ferrari to trade away their old car.
---
They'll learn eventually. You would think. By this time next year, we'll all be needing BoEs, as God intended.
---
Played a shaman back in the day where the set was actually good :( I really like the Warlock but the gear choices are pretty silly.
---
Did anyone consider that it could be a F/F/M relationship?  Or did we all just assume M/F/M relationship.  Just curious, not even sure if it matters in the chat.
---
It's not though.  Comparing Warden Staff + Tome of Knowledge
---
-|Warden Staff|Arden Custodian + Tome of Knowledge 
---
:-:|:-:|:-:
---
Mitigation|0.4% dodge + 0.4% to be missed =0.8% total|0.6% dodge (0.2 from def, 0.4 from agi) + 0.2% to be missed = 0.8% total
---
Armor|260|100
---
Stamina|11|8
---
Crit|-|+0.4% (from 8 agi)
---
Attack power|-|+16
---
The armor (as I'm told) doesn't matter since Druids eventually hit the armor cap. So throwing that out, you trade 3 stam for 0.4% crit and 18 attack power.  IMO, seems like Warden isn't your best end game and even gets beat with another Phase 1 combo.  I'd gladly trade off 3 stam for increased threat.
---
What you're looking for can be found in retail. That's "vanilla +"
---
Classic is classic. People wanted the vanilla experience and asked for years and that's what we have. You want the extras? The changes? Retail
---
I should've rolled a druid.
---
NP. Just to add to it the Multiboxer did get his characters unbanned since it isn't against any rules. so if the worst case scenario occurs and the system flags them then as long as they are persistent the ban will be reversed.

You're awfully salty for someone who isn't jealous.

I made a comment this morning about how for the first time (or one of the only times) I couldn't find a black lotus in Winterspring during the 7-8am my-time i do before i go downtown twice a week on the Azuresong realm.
---
This definitely explains it, although i would have solely believed that just more 60s are around now would be good enough.
---
If you’re just in it for the mana, you’d be better off with a fast 1h and SoW.

Cmon man, give the boys a battleshout

I'm perfectly fine having different opinions. No hard feelings at all. :)

Still waiting on that example of when you're maliciously exploiting a bug and it isn't bannable. I'm amused that you've somehow twisted you not understanding a pretty basic principle into me not understanding things. Whatever saves your ego I guess. Have a good one.
---
This happened in my group yesterday and GMs are supposed to help out. Apparently that’s how they did it in vanilla, so I think the rogue will get his chest piece.
---
Shoutout to all the mages dying on the solo leveling farm in mara. May you dodge the opposite faction in your dash back to the portal room..
---
I agree that it's up to the player + the group...there ain't a "this is how it works for everyone" rule.
---
I tend to forget I have auto-loot on and am pretty damn good at the unlock &gt; jump backward before I loot the chest mechanic.  I've yet to nab something unintentionally.  
---
This reminds me...I gotta get back to leveling lockpicking.  I've got three 175 chests sitting in the bank (am in the mid 160's currently).  I'm a pickpocketing fiend.
---
Your mother was a water elemental
---
I can agree with PvP's inherent sense of danger and thus heightened tension and payoff, but it vexes me whenever people say that PvE is solo play. Need to get into a den of elite ogres and kill the named? Gotta group up. Need to kill 20 spiders that are in limited supply? Gotta group up. Need to do a dungeon? Gotta group up. Even without grouping up, I still see people charging in to save someone who's in trouble and guiding lesser experienced players through a zone. Sure, there is no lingering threat of the enemy faction, but that doesn't suddenly make the game soloable.
---
I don't find people needing BoEs any better, the idea that every item is a 1 for 1 trade for other items on the AH is a statement made by someone who only plays retail who has no clue about the actual AH market and is just an excuse for people to be assholes and take weapons from people who can actually use these items because their parents never told them no so they think they are entitled to everything.
---
I did this quest at 35 on my mage and the interrupt was absolutely brutal.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, i'm level 47(almost 48) and i've been dungeon grinding ZF from 45, i tried to do a couple of quests but kept getting killed by alliance wanting to quest in the same hub, it's not that big of a deal to me though because i'm still having fun and am leveling; albeit a bit slower, overall i would deal with crowding any day over not being able to find people for groups/quests due to a low pop server.
---
What the other guy said, cooking is awesome for regen and buffs but the downtime you’ll need for fishing will more than outweigh any regular leveling downtime. That said, if you’re in no rush to reach 60, the fishing vendors and trainers in level appropriate areas will almost always have recipes for the fish you’ll find. And recipes are rarely expensive on the AH.
---
Warm that heart up boi, things like this happen all the time if you want em to!
---
I see. Care to explain more or should i screw off onto google for it?
---
Warriors by themselves are mediocre unless raid geared, using cooldowns, etc. But in organized PvP (from 2v2 all the way up to AV or open world brawls) they are very very good. Heals and things like Windfury or Blessing of Freedom make the class really shine.
---
Thanks... I need to watch the movies now.
---
That's what I'd do. I got lucky with the first one I joined, but I'm on Rattlegore so it wouldn't really help you
---
Shaman are generally less concerned about what to do to stay alive, more about what to do to not stay dead.
---
It's not too late but it will be a very demanding grind.
---
I would start by doing all NE quests you skipped, they will give you very low rep points compared to doing them while still green, but it's still better than nothing.
---
Then go on questing and leveling as usual, and do the remaining NE quests (assuming there are still some) while they're still green to you.
---
After that, your only option is cloth turn-ins (in Darnassus), it's quite a grind but there's no limit and you can do it at your own pace.
---
They're probably the worst DPS class in PvE but, as you stated, a Paladins burst damage potential is really good. The problem with that burst is that it's RNG and you can't use it on command. The other problem is that Paladins are also the best healers in PvP and a Ret Paladin doesn't bring much else to the table that a Holy Paladin can. So there's really no point to taking a Ret Paladin over a Holy Paladin for PvE and PvP if you're min/maxing.
---
What's it like playing with a potato?
---
Just offer to tank the dungeons...you will get groups quickly and the random drops you get from the dungeons will not you gold quickly. Especially fast clears of SM, ZF, etc.
---
That just hasn't worked for me in any groups. They will just get mad at the bad tank or bad healer for letting them die. And they will fail to see the issue. Being kind and good communication is the best way to get a group under control.
---
Duh, he knows for a fact. What other evidence would you need?
---
The NPC doesn't give a quest, he just says that the Inn was burned and would like you to check it out as normal NPC text.
---
That's what led me to investigate the inn this go around, since I wasn't using a quest add on.
---
If a group is paying you to tank, I don’t think they would let you greed loot.
---
Crystals are going for 5g on my server. WTF?
---
How is this brigading?
---
&gt;First and foremost, players have leveled up and spread out around the world. This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer, which means fewer layers required per realm. The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that. This includes high population realms such as Faerlina, which has had only two layers for three weeks now.
---
It's not the first month sub expiration culling people. The timeline doesn't add up.
---
This isnt about morality.  You're saying you're moral b4cause you gave a guy something he could have gotten on his own at anytime with money. All you did by passing the need is gift them the gold you would have gotten otherwise. That's not morality.
---
Shaman. I play both enhancement and restoration when needed in dungeons.
---
Yeah Im Horde for life but if I did go ally I would NElf it up. Also I am a main rogue :]
---
These mind blasts... Too accurate for sand people.
---
Like I said above, I'm not gonna roll need if everybody rolls greed.  But if any other character rolls need, so am I because I have no gaurantee that they are actually gonna equip it rather than sell it on the AH.  I'm happy to let the other party members /roll if they feel cheated, but rolling need is *protective* not aggressive.
---
What did you expect?
---
You're literally suggesting Blizzard should change everything that makes Classic what it is.
---
If you didn't (or don't) like Vanilla, don't play Classic, simple as that.
---
Posting memes doesn't make your bad ideas better.
---
Or maybe because the bluepost is literally saying something entirely different?
---
I think the pvp aspect is nudging me to play shaman. Would rather hit hard and heal than be survivalist and carrier
---
Hey, I'm cool with being WoW missed connections or character missing persons. Hope you find them!
---
I use this in classic.  Doesn't increase the number of macros available like you said but does allow you to make longer macros.  I've noticed that making longer macros breaks the automatic #showtooltip function in complex macros and I have to define my own tooltip scenarios.  Also the key bind only section doesn't seem to work at all.  I can make a macro but the key bind doesn't work and I can't delete it after.
---
Maybe killing you is fun for them. Ever consider that perspective or only your own?
---
Here's some random advice in no order:
---
\- Consumables are great. Sagefish in particular is wonderful.
---
\- Get as much spirit as you can.
---
\- Don't overrely on mana potions. They're great to have in an emergency, but if you consider them a part of your healing rotation you'll go broke fast.
---
\- Abuse the five second rule. So put a big heal on the tank, hit him with renew, and then wand for 5 to 10 seconds. This allows you to regen some mana.
---
\- Not every party member needs to be at 100% HP all the time.
---
\- The tank controls HOW to pull, you control WHEN to pull. If you need mana, tell the party and stop to drink.
---
\- If you get aggro, run to the tank, not away.
---
On “other” servers I was getting about 1.2g for gromsblood. But this was over a year into the servers life.
---
I listed something for 99s instead of 99g.  I was on when it sold and messaged the guy to congratulate him and I said fair play.  He said he would sell it back for the 99s. I gave him 10g for his trouble.  
---
It was very nice of him but I didn't expect him to do it.
---
Holy crap I didn't even realize that was why, can priests give the power word also?
---
It does but there’s really no reason to go to silithus yet unless you’re an herbalist or miner.
---
Just set the loot threshold to not even roll on greens, problem solved for that and tell everyone at the start to roll need on BoEs. Problem solved
---
Probably tons of people in starting areas still
---
So you wasted money on gear instead of a mount which would help you farm faster and save time?
---
So did he dps while letting another warrior tank his dungeon?
---
My experience was different and if you needed in BoE’s you were a ninja. Been a long ass time but I remember someone get gkicked for needing a staff of Jordan while lvling in the guild on an alt as a warrior. 
---
BoE being interchangeable with gold only furthers the argument that it’s a GREED roll. With that logic you just used (which is so deeply and obviously flawed) then everything in every dungeon is a need if your criteria is low enough. 
---
I’m not your parent telling you how to play, just stop trying to justify shitty behavior. It’s shitty to roll need for gold if people already greeded. Just deal with it, my opinion will not change regardless of how often you repeat the same arguments that I’ve already acknowledged and still disagree with.
---
Ignore all these other casuals obsessed with the definition of words on buttons. Need all high value BoE drops, or you're just screwing yourself.
---
"fact" and "facts" are not what they used to be...

Lots of people have and it’s true.

Go away. Dont come back
---
It’s probably not in the sprint of classic wow to charge for a service that isn’t too hard to find elsewhere for free, but if you want to make an enterprise out of charging to tank, 1g is reasonable but make sure you put level the instance by a good 10+.
---
Togglable abilities such as animal forms or stealth will toggle with each cast. The exclamation forces the macro to only cast the activation half of the toggle, so you can never accidentally toggle it off by repeated presses. However, the clause \[noform:3\] makes this redundant (the macro will never be in a situation where Cat Form is active AND it tries to cast Cat Form again). So to answer your question literally: it doesn't do anything.
---
The best way to farm gold at level 15 is by farming xp to level up. But if you are set on staying level 15 and farming gold... deviate fish are probably the most lucrative.
---
In fact, tanking in prot is sub-par.
---
My vanilla character was a warrior - couldn't afford my mount until mid 40s. I know the struggle, which is why I offer a healthstone to every single questing warrior I see in the world!

I wouldnt want to tank most dungeons on my classes that can tank, either.
---
Being the 'leader' of the group is enough to have me already hesitant to tank.
---
On top of that add in dungeons where i dont know the path through, where to go for specific bosses, what can be skipped, etc (and no maps in dungeons) and im just not going to put myself/group through that (maybe if its a guild run, but not a pug).
---
Now add in DPS not waiting to AoE, pulling extra crap, etc and i REALLY dont want to be the poor bastard that has to tank.
---
I dont really understabd what your trying to say. People enjoy tanking? How is that related?
---
Do you enjoy being bottom on the dps meter and every melee groaning when you take yet another upgrade from them, and still bottom meter?
---
correct no /focus, @focus in classic.
---
I once mind visioned people in Ironforge from stormwind back in the days. (had a friend use flight path to ironforge)
---
For pve hunter definitely scales the worst of the 3, but that's at aq40 levels of gear, I believe they are all strong in pvp throughout. Mages and locks both scale well for pve, I believe Mages maybe a bit bitter once you can go fire and get huge rolling ignites.
---
i thought once they’re grey they don’t give +rep? am i mistaken?
---
&gt; The most mind boggling decision they made was making Warfronts a PVE thing. Like, what the hell Blizzard? You had an opportunity to combine AV with a RTS and you use AI opponents instead of real players? 
---
This way the content doesn't become empty or suffer as many queue issues.
---
When I was doing game dev there were a not small amount of devs debating on how best to populate an MMO with AI players and possibly having PCs controlled by AI while logged off - more active world, economy doesn't ever lack, etc. and players could possibly do character management for non combat offline tasks(crafting, farming, etc)...it mainly solved problems with drastically fluctuating playerbases though.
---
The problem about features/dream ideas like that is that they always get boiled down to what the simplest implementation that still looks like it's trying to solve the same problem.
---
There Is no birthday boy. Everyone running that dungeon contributed to the dungeon, ideally equally.

Killed a guy on retail next to a flight path in Argus, he immediately created a level 1 Alliance and started spamming me all this shit about how he made 6 figures and was going to log off to go fuck his girlfriend lmfao.

---
&gt; I am not contesting that the population dropped, just that it was the first month sub expiration. People probably quit before their subs expired.
---
Ah, ok then. We're actually on the same page then. I've always been of the mindset that people quit WoW over the years for a variety of reasons, and Classic is the same way.
---
I agree with you 100%.
---
&gt;Its real annoying to see people so happy to abuse a system that shouldnt be there for their own gain.
---
In your opinion.
---
You'll get it Gordon, if you're even remotely as diligent at farming Tidal as you are Devilsaur.
---
It's a little wonky but once you learn how to manipulate it properly it's great, possibly better than how it actually was in vanilla because it does some extra stuff I wasn't aware of previously (could of been that way but I'm honestly unsure). There's something wrong with how it behaves currently and it will very commonly not give you your extra swing when you're crit and you're ready to expend it. I'll give you a quick run down on how to get the most out of it.
---
You're going to want to bind auto attack to something you can hit easily and frequently. I use caps lock, which can be a bit annoying because you'll need to turn it back off to type at people, but it's such a valuable bind to me that I just deal with it. I like it because I can hit it with my pinky without interfering with what the rest of my hand is doing.
---
You're going to need a swing timer addon. If you already have one, disregard, but yeah. Learn to pay attention to it. When your swing isn't ready, deactivate your auto. You need to direct-input your auto attacks because like I said earlier, having it prepped whenever you get a proc tends to deny you the proc. If you have the auto off and you get a proc, THEN activate your auto, it goes through with much, much greater consistency. It's been some time since I've had it not work in this fashion without me making some other mistake. So, just learn to direct input your auto attacks, in short.
---
Another critical factor that I'm not sure is actually 100% vanilla like, getting crit with reckoning RESETS your auto attack and expends the charge along with your normal swing. So if you auto attack normally then get crit right after your swing, you'll immediately come back down on them with two hits. This can be a little annoying since you need to direct-input your autos and will have to react by activating your auto whenever you get crit, but it's so fucking good that it's more than worth the extra inputs. Redoubt helps a lot because it makes that loud noise every time you're crit.
---
Just some other notes:
---
- It only stacks up four times, for a total of five swings (4 stacks from being crit plus the base auto attack).
---
- Do not swap your weapon if you have stacks unless you're willing to lose them. Swapping 100% gets rid of them.
---
- You should make a macro for all your heal spells. Just put /stopattack and then /cast &lt;spell&gt;. You CAN heal with stacks and retain them, but I've lost stacks from getting crit while healing with my auto attack active. So you can be sure to deactivate your auto attack any time you cast heals with that simple macro.
---
- You can mount too, that won't drop stacks.
---
- I've found that you can generally activate your auto attack before you're in range of your target without losing stacks, but it's *somewhat* inconsistent. I recommend that you activate your auto attack only when in range, just to be safe (also helps reinforce the general technique of only direct-inputting your autos).
---
- Remember that parries reduce your pending swing timer. So if your auto isn't active and you parry, it's a good idea to activate your auto real quick to utilize that additional attack speed. Just remember to turn it back off. Treat parries like you were crit, just understand that it's just a quick attack speed boost and not gonna be a double hit.
---
I'll re-comment if I think of anything else important.
---
You're giving them the wrong incentive. Not that people should *need* incentives to help group members, but they often demand such things.
---
You shouldn't be saying "Please kill Solakar so I can get my Devout Mantle." You should be saying "Please kill Solakar because it's a three-minute fight the Rogue can activate without tripping any whelps, and we can get a BoE Flame Reflector engineering pattern from it."

So your saying people who need gear should grind $$$ to buy it off the AH just so you can need it to sell it for $$$?
---
Get the F off classic.
---
More than half the game feels like warrior loot, I don't see how anyone could say you're wrong. From just sheer number of actual warrior gear, to the various weapons they can use, to the fact that even fury warriors will be rolling on leather or mail sometimes. This game is just about gearing warriors, and the rest of us are just along for the ride.
---
They posted like an hour ago that only a few servers still have multiple layers and that no server has more than 2.
---
"All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full."

guards not reaching yes but out of agro range or in a safe area where they dont patrol is totally fine.  Examples are the 2nd floor in the inn in BB where you can be attacked and no guard will agro (just before the stairs).

Just close out of the login screen and use the launcher. It will take just about the same amount of time to do as typing in your log in manually.
---
&gt;Private servers do not run on vanilla wow. It did not perform like Nostalrius.
---
Yes the server and networking code is different, we all know that. The actual game and clients are the same though, and that's why they're being compared. Also the point is that a couple of amateurs shouldn't be creating better server code than Blizzard.
---
&gt;I have repeatedly stated THERE IS A PROBLEM and you are still trying to claim I am saying there isn’t. You need to learn to fucking read.
---
No, you need to learn how to effectively communicate your thoughts, because these statements:
---
&gt;The performance is way better, not even remotely close to worse.
---
&gt;You said the performance got worse instead of better but that’s not true
---
seem to suggest that you in fact do not believe that the lag in player-dense areas is a problem.
---
And yes, the performance in the current client is better in just about every way compared to the 1.1.12 client. But that's irrelevant because this particular discussion is about the issue with lag/freezing when a lot of players are in a single area. This is a new issue, that didn't exist in 1.12.1. This is not up for debate, there's more than enough evidence to substantiate it. Even Blizzard know it. They have to.
---
Maybe pull back on the Blizzard defense a bit and learn to discuss things objectively, because all that you're accomplishing here is contradicting yourself and looking like a fool.
---
Make specs customizable again,  got to 20 on retail and hated the what ability do you want approach.
---
It could make sense on a PvP server where you're only allowed 1 faction per account. Doesn't make sense on PvE servers where you could have both factions, as queues are before character selection screen.
---
Got it. Thx
---
I wish I had some reddit gold or silver to give you because damn
---
During a fight, you don't. When BGs are out, you use the item, die, and swap it out for another while it's on the 10+minute cooldown.
---
Equipping a Use item puts it on a 30 second cooldown. It will be very difficult to disengage, gear swap, and then dick around for an extra 30 seconds when someone is trying to kill you.
---
There's a link to a 16 page discussion on the last tab.

Cast it into the fire of molten core

Yes, but they raised pop cap and have been decreasing the number of layers. That just proves my point the two are independent. Some people seem to think decreasing layers means pop cap must also decrease
---
Great art
---
Dang!
---
You basically can't go wrong with either of ravager, bonebiter, or WW axe. Ravager of course is a drop as opposed to the certainty of quest rewards from the other two though. If you still have corpsemaker by 35, spam armory to 38. If no ravager drop, go bonebiter/WW weapon.

At least he tried and was self aware enough to not put himself and another group through that experience again.

---
Unless he was rude to criticism, why would you be happy he "learned his place" when you could've taught him better
---
Hunter will fall off compared to the other two, but they are always great for pulling. 
---
Warlock starts off lower than both but only gets better as crit and hit gear become available. 
---
Mages are pretty good consistently, but they get a nice boost when they can spec fire in phase 5.
---
Pedantic, no, I think you misunderstand or at least misapplied the word.

Condescending? Yup. Taking a camera phone picture of a computer screen is pretty caveman. It’s like spitting your gum on the street, is it against the law or does it affect me really? No, but now I have to see your litter on my walk and I judge you harshly for your subhuman behavior.

World questing has become very slow so im looking for that sweet two hander. Is it rude to go into a dungeon as a healer and need on a twohander? I mean, how else are you supposed to even get a decent weapon when you play as a holy Paladin?

What do you mean by "Layers"? Haven't heard that term yet.

Oof, finishing up the elite orc quests? I haven't done a single quest in Redridge yet. Most of my time was spent in Westfall, Dun Morogh, and Loch Modan as well as DM and BFD (you are spot on! There is some solid caster loot - the staff is awesome!). Is it worth starting in Redridge now or should I just call it a loss and hit up the Wetlands/Duskwood?
---
Can you idiots just press printscreen please, this meme isnt funny any more
---
They can outdamage mages by like Naxx, but there's no +spell hit in the Warlock talents or gear to make Shadowbolts hit more often. They lose to mages based just on that, until the +spell hit gear is released in later dungeons.
---
Most typical raid build is DS/Ruin: DS enables sacrifice of a succubus for +15% shadow damage, and Ruin gives +100% spell crit damage (so spell crits hit for 200% damage instead of the typical 150%)
---
Queue last night on Faerlina per usual?
---
This is already the rule, but too many new players are getting burned because it's not intuitive enough and they're confused by the gold icon next to "greed" and watch the BoEs float on by.
---
Give it a few more months and they'll all either catch on and change the way they roll, or be playing alone in their moral circles of integrity, away from the rest of the population as they blacklist us all for being "ninjas". Win/win for the rest of us.
---
I have never played one, but with my experience i can say warlocks are viable and they are desired in every aspect of the game. They might not have as much damage as mages, but they deal a pretty good amount. Locks bring a lot of utility (soulstone, healthstone, summons...), excel at levelling, and they are one of the better classes for world pvp. If i got bored of my main i would definitely play a warlock.
---
I think the entire point of games like Classic is to force people to socialize. 
---
If you're not willing to do things for strangers, fine. But they won't do anything for you. Until you take a chance, make some dungeon buddies and help each other out.
---
But it's nice to spread the message to randoms "hey it's give and take here".
---
Yeah I can tell lol.
---
Notice the guy was in Olympus, that’s par for the course, those guys are a bunch of keyboard turning paint chip connoisseurs
---
Not all upgrades are equal.  100G+ items that are BoE should be a need for everyone.  Don't get upset when you roll greed and lose out on one.  Guild runs are a different territory, but random groups of people run on different rules.  Telling everyone to roll greed then rolling need is being a ninja.  Telling everyone to roll need and rolling need is the right thing to do.
---
I mean... Everyone doesn't need the gold as much as they seem to think they do either. But to me the difference here is that it's not gold that actually dropped... It's an item. So IMO the priority should be anyone who can use THAT item for its intended purpose.
---
But you are saying you will take loot in a situation like this.
---
And trying to justify it with "my pvp melee hits need HoJ" , which just exposes that you dont know what your class uses in pvp.
---
lol someone was asking for a port to SW from Auberdine yesterday in LFG. I was in burning steps so I ported to darnassus (9s) went to auberdine (by boat) portal them to sw (18s) then port to if (9s)  and got back on the fp to burning steppes (8s). they asked me how much I wanted for the port before hand and I told them as long as they covered the 50s it would cost me to do all this it was fine. They gave me 1.5g. I find if you let them decide they usually hook it up.

Black Lotus is 14 to 15 g on my server.

It scans for you. It can't buy out for you.
---
I think the ban was stupid and over kill tbh. I think a lot of GM's are power hungry bottom feeders that got picked on too much and have built up anger inside and abuse their power however they can.
---
With that being said. Relevant to characters with dogshit names, I honestly don't know how people like you get motivated to play a character with a moronic name. Sometimes I spend hours getting a name for my adventurer, his journey is and adventure and he's the star of the story.
---
But yeah, the GM got his chopps off that's for sure.
---
The fires of mount blackrock.
---
No?  Fury Warriors don't use the defensive plate that tanks want.
---
Also, you can structure the group such that the warrior won't be rolling on any class's gear.
---
Finally, what about the mages and warlocks?  Should I drop group if those two classes are present as they can slow down my gear progression?
---
Warriors aren't slowing anyone's progression and insinuating otherwise is demonstrably false.  If that is their main spec, the warrior getting the BiS gloves that also are BiS for a rogue are equivalent. (example)
---
I was having issues in lvl 15-30 areas.
---
Theres still a shitload of people there, quite a few of us on alts, etc.
---
Ret paladin also seems pretty strong during the leveling process if you have a decent weapon. Where it really starts to break down is scaling at 60. They just don't scale as well as other melee in raid gear. However there burst potential is always strong in pvp. I'm a 50 pally rn and definitely feel like I can hold my own in world pvp
---
This was in regards to the fact that servers would have layers. Did they ever confirm a non-layered server would have more players than back in vanilla?

I’m level 42 with 50g looking for ways to make money for now and what to look for with the future. Now my question is simply what should I do? I have 150~ mining and 85 blacksmithing. I’m thinking of just farming up mobs in stv, and just  swapping out bs for skinning.

PS I have max cooking and fishing but my servers economy is weird as hell so if anyone is on horde rattlegore lmk what’s up.

What about dark pact do I put it while leveling and then I respec when I hit 60? Because I know I won't be able to reach ruin before 60.

My guild is dishing out loot based on "BIS lists" been forced to pass on really great upgrades because "your bis is X crafting item or Y BoE world drop". All the guilds on my realm seem to be like this currently pain in the backside

Go to graphics and turn that shit to 10 (not 3/4 which are the classic settings)... It changes models AND textures

Questie is definitely a huge QoL upgrade for questing, that's for sure. The same friend I made this joke to didn't know you are supposed to do those random single (!) in the middle of nowhere that are your level, he was looking for large clusters of quests. We both started playing in BC so we had Quest Helper, and I had to remind him that this is how classic quests work haha. You're running around everywhereeee.
---
You must've played with some shit warriors, then. I was consistently ~40% of my group's overall DPS while 2h tanking in levelling dungeons. That said, I'm deep prot now.
---
Spec feral and have two gear sets, one with agi/str/stam and the other with spirit/int priority; done. 
---
You can either carry the 2nd set around all the time or keep it in your bank; depending on how starved you are for bag space. Hunters and warlocks both lose out on an entire bag, so yes it's perfectly fine to carry around an extra gear set since it'll be like 6-8 actual pieces you need to swap; you don't *have* to keep a backup for each piece in your healing set, just enough to get by; and you'll likely have a few off int/str or spi/agi random pieces that are acceptable for both.
---
Agreed. I've been getting ganked from the start, and that's after I left Faerlina for one of the realms that were born a day or two after launch.
---
Wow that's a really good deal. I got my Mithril Shield Spike recipe for a steal at 35g, and in the week since I haven't seen any sell for under 75g. 
---
I put in a bid last night for Steel Weapon Chain Recipe for 20g, it was going to end shortly so I'm hoping to see it in my mailbox when I get off work.
---
There's a word for when you believe you need more wealth. It's called greed.
---
&gt;unless you're a mage/rogue
---
Or Priest.
---
Firstly... ruins someone's day? That person has some issues that need to be dealt with which have nothing to do with WoW.
---
Second... If everyone just left the spawned mob there and accepted that sometimes they have to kill it before they get the chest but they never have to kill it after, it would be more efficient for everyone.
---
Yes, but every time I've seen it mentioned, it has been in the contex of layers being a thing. I've never seen them confirm that a non-layered server have an increased population cap.
---
I don't know why i leveled every goddamned spell, but especially that totem
---
I'd check it each time when i replaced the old with the new and just go "Oh..."
---
Same thing with lightning shield but at least those 3 charges do some good damage
---
I logged into Faerlina last night at 5 est with no queue. The free migrations are working.
---
Hi! I just dinged 40 as a warlock. I have all of the loot I need from SM. Neck, Dagger, etc. Should I do Ulda or RFD next?
---
A little bit.  I usually demo shout first after pulling a group in dungeons.
---
I would love to. My item dropped and yours didn’t. Why should I have to farm gold for an item that dropped in front of my face? “Great my item dropped now I’ll go buy it off the AH!” How would you feel if somebody sniped warden staff for the same reason? It’s not entitlement if I’m the only person who can use it. It’s entitled to believe you need to have the gold from selling an item you can’t use. Also, we don’t get equal value because it’s 100g flat to you. The only reason these items have such a high price tag is BECAUSE someone wants to use it. If it wasn’t worth more than the gold you’d spend, then nobody would buy it. Bc it’s worth 100g to me and the utility I get from using it.
---
Besides it’s just plain polite. You could need on everything you wanted even BoP because you can vendor those for chunks of change. It takes many grains of sand to make a mountain so your etiquette shouldn’t change based on the price tag.
---
Gotta kill a lot of mobs. 
---
I just ran through the tunnel. Died once getting Moonglade FP, and died twice getting Winterspring's, and now I'll never need that tunnel again. Thankfully.

that can be counterspelled.
---
Where can I send you Pizza/Coffee money as thanks?
---
Well i'll ask the obvious question, what tips can you suggest for another person looking to replicate your success?
---
well they lose about 50 to 60 % hp on ambush crit so... usually its ambush =&gt; gouge =&gt; backstab =&gt; eviscerate =&gt; next one. This is why i recommend troll's blood for skipping the regen down time and abuse relentless strike (45% crit chance for 20 sec on next ambush after a kill)
---
Only if you're in the right shard...
---
You have mixed feelings about it but it’s also great to know that it’s in its current state?
---
What class should I play for solo leveling, i’m currently playing Rogue im level 20 but I keep dying in boss quests it’s very annoying, I don’t have anyone to play with so i’m as solo as it gets please help, i’m also not great at movement so maybe a casting character would be better?
---
You’re missing the point. Gear in WoW is constantly upgraded and replaced and swapped, especially when you’re leveling. 
---
If people thought their raid gear was going to hold them over to level 70 or be used for an extended period of time in TBC, I don’t think they really understood the game. And if you quit at level 62 because you replaced one item, all you did was miss out on a lot of fantastic content.
---
Edit: that comparison literally makes no sense? I’m not sure you understand what’s being discussed at all.
---
Didn't want to eat any damage from him, no idea how much a "??" (60 according to someone else) would hit me for.  As someone above pointed out frost ward would have been the better option.
---
At this level I don't have improved counterspell so if I was to interrupt his frostbolt it would only lock his frost spells and I really wanted to save it for his sheep so that I could lock him out of arcane and raw cast a couple of my own frostbolts at him without worrying about getting counterspelled.  
---
I also fully expected to die when he jumped me and had commited to using all cooldowns (including cold snap) before I did.
---
Had I known where he was at ability wise I wouldn't have been so worried, in saying that I was very fortunate that only my frostnova resisted considering his level.
---
multiboxing seems fun and I would personaly want to do it if it wasn't so expensive and it's rare enough that it really isn't an issue
---
Yea but generating rage sucks. I see the need to stance dance for the charge rage. Then rotating between the mob group, but I get healed and my aggro breaks.  To me the math is , run in with charge at lvl 46 I get 21 rage, I have a talent that gives me 6 extra and then my swing. Depending on the hit it’s either 5 or 10. So I barely have enough for 2 sunders. Then I change stance so I gotta wait then pop enrage and hopefully my sunder land or use taunt to picky whatever misses.  That’s assuming I clicked/pressed everything in order and properly.
---
TBH a lot of tanks are new and learning yet the groups are impatient and don’t help the tank by controlling their DPS.  So a warrior is trying to hold aggro, but certain groups want perfect runs and performances.
---
Yes, that's a good idea. You have nothing else to spend the money on anyway, get some giant bags.
---
It has nothing to do with meta, it has to do with DPS warriors charging in before the tank pulls and competing on all of the same gear as the warrior doing the more challenging role.
---
I think Vanilla when I levelled my first character to 60 was the last time I actually killed mobs for all the Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages in STV.
---
Nowadays? AH all the way.
---
What AH addon do you use?
---
why was your gold so low? 
---
as a warrior, most of the skill upgrades that cost about 1G give you such small bonuses it isn't worth upgrading them beyond level 1. even rend, which looks to give a big dmg increase, increases time, so the DPS stays pretty static.

This. Mages actually think, without them, all other classes wouldn't be able to achieve anything in game. It's frustrating when a mage AoEs 0.1 seconds into a pull and wipes the group, or Blizzards only one or two mobs. I can deal with those, because it's common right now. But what I don't like is the overall smugness from the class as a whole and the players who mage attract. 
---
As a shadow priest, I go out of my way in WPVP to kill mages. Nothing like hitting them with a 5 second blanket Silence and watching them start to back pedal.
---
Why would people be sitting in IF for hours when they’re level 40?
---
yea but thats also against the rules of basketball....
---
There are no rules in Wow about stealing resources lmfao
---
HEL YEA I'm so happy
---
That is literally what the quote says. 
---
Server population and layering are independent from each other. 
---
Medium population server now = higher server count than full in 2006.
---
I’m a Druid tank so health potions are less than optimal and I was short on cash by spending some gold on my warden staff.
---
ah nice, TIL! thanks
---
I don't love WoW *generally*. I would for instance never ever, ever play retail.
---
This meme is a exact mirror of you.
---
RFD for sure. I wouldn't do Ulda until 43 at the earliest, I tried it at 42 (as a tank, so take it with a grain of salt) and it was a no-go. The second half of the dungeon scales way up in levels.
---
Very fun class and a must for PvE content. Their curses are a must to boost damage for raids and summons/soulstone/healthstone bring a ton of utility. Dont listen to people who say Warlock dps is not as good as mages. They are not good Warlocks and the reason you see them low on the dps meters is because of non optimised gear and poor rotation, for example throwing all their dots on a target that will die quickly. 
---
Running out of shards can be not fun, and they have threat mitigation issues so you need to watch for that. Running out of mana is also not fun and you will never have that problem as a Lock.
---
It's not particularly rare, but only 3 spawn on a 5 minute timer and everyone and their mom and their mom's dog and the dog's uncle are camping those 3 mobs.
---
The only thing I called you is stupid. I'll keep calling you that as long as you'll keep acting like it.
---
Your role is to heal the entire group lol what’re you smoking? If they’re pulling trash and trolling that’s one thing. Not unlocking a chest you think YOU deserve is another lmao
---
So how many players per layer now? 6K? 7K? 8K? 
---
And I notice they didn't reaffirm their commitment to removing layers before Phase 2. So maybe they aren't sure that's going to work.
---
I hit 300 in alchemy.  Any must have recipes to make gold or help with raids/pvp?
---
But when inflation hits ... the gold you get in phase 3 might be more, but it will be worth less, so... there is really no point?
---
let her die only way to learn.
---
I'm on Old Blanchy and for the last two weeks we've really noticed this, I have started getting up early for the lotus farm
---
And that they could create them.
---
And if you had raid gear from AQ and Naxx you weren’t replacing most of your gear until level 65+. 
---
If you thought that gear wasn’t going to get replaced, you just had poor expectations or don’t understand the game at all.
---
Their original plan was to remove layering before P2. We're still a long ways away from P2, what makes you say they had to relax their original plan? Removing it this early is a huge success IMO
---
Itemrack.
---
tanks are more or less the leaders of whatever group they join. they set the pace and tone for everything that goes down. some can handle that responsibility, others like chilling and stabbing stuff while watching YouTube. what's cool about WoW is the preassigned responsibility/expectations that comes with certain classes and how people respond to them. I don't have an opinion on this i just think that's cool
---
Yes lets base the game around you and not the most loyal fans
---
Thats like 5 years of wages for a common westfall  farmer you elitist scum!
---
You can feel how you want about it. Believe what you want. I was explaining my point of view. But you can act like an asshole, if you wish. That's of no real consequence.
---
Your whole argument is predicated on this entire game being easy based on MC , the starter raid. We'll see how the casual guilds handle AQ and Naxx.
---
Sure some restos just want to heal. But not many.
---
If I have 3 restos that all want enhance gear, how do I pick which one gets to slack off in raids, not pay for  respec, and get prio on all the gear?
---
Id rather reward a resto who is willing to respec with hand of ragnaros than a stubborn enhance who puts himself ahead pf the raid group.
---
Except at all ranks, outside of resto talents, 20 seconds is the maximum time you need to be near the totem to get the mana refund. 12 seconds if Resto talented. His math, although would work if those were the numbers, aren't how it is in game.
---
40 Mana at 4mp2 = 10 ticks, 20 seconds.
---
60 Mana at 6mp2 = 10 ticks, 20 seconds.
---
80 Mana at 8mp2 = 10 ticks, 20 seconds.
---
And the final rank, 100 Mana at 10mp2 = 10 ticks, 20 seconds.
---
If that makes you feel better.
---
Mage food and water speed up runs rather than slowing them down, and mages charge for creating them outside of dungeon groups. Same thing with portals.
---
This post just reeks of greed by you.
---
Framing people who don't want literal dead weight in their raid as "elitist jerks" isn't fair at all lol. Sure, some people will be down with having a meme spec or two, but it's literally just making the group slower by a lot to let them in. There's nothing elitist about needing healers and being a bit meh about inviting a class that can heal as a spec that does very little damage instead.
---
And my point is simply that these misplays are conducted by all classes just less noticeably and that all the qq peeps need to put on their big people pants and just let us kill things for you.  We'll show you how.
---
That was added in BC
---
A few quests in the southern part of Felwood give rep that will almost make you unfriendly.  After that you have to grind a few mobs.  Should be about 20-30 after the quests.
---
Retail needs to lean into the fact that people are playing it to get the story and play multiple characters and more or less remove the barrier to gearing alts. I don't necessarily want to be able to get everything for free on my alt, but if there's anything like essences they need to be account-level. The artifact power grind needs to be reduced for alts, anything that is made to be a pure time gate should be significantly reduced or removed for additional characters.
---
I actually liked the artifact weapon and class hall quests in Legion because it gave me something unique to do on alts without feeling too much like an insane grind.
---
Compare that to the Heart of Azeroth and the war campaign and it feels like an incredible regression. The only way to get anything different is to play an alt of the other faction, or if you are horde, make a different choice to support Sylvanas or not. Alts in BFA are an awful slog that have no value except as a mechanical difference, and that feels really bad. 
---
I enjoyed the fact that I could jump on my hunter, paladin, and priest and do drastically different things basically every week in Legion. I haven't touched anything but my priest since 8.1.
---
Onyxia is a joke :P Already 20man her and probably do 15man soon aswell
---
What you said has nothing to do with my point.
---
My point is a new expansion destroys the time and effort put into a character up till that point. A new expansion is essentially a whole new game in WoW and that's something that a lot of people (including myself) don't like.
---
is op ok? hes getting very angry about having mobs hit him in an instance
---
Free transfers still apply I think.
---
My alt recently did some STV quests, on Fairbanks-Alliance, and it was crowded, but doable. I feel like STV is often like that, though.
---
Then I did some Dustwallow quests. There were only a handful of other people there. It was very easy to do all the quests. I even got the escort quest (there was nobody around, and I waited around 3 minutes for him to spawn).
---
This is probably a couple hours before the server peak, but it still says "High" on the realm selection screen.
---
Some people only have a small amount of time to play this game. I can only speak for myself but I legit think of it all day at work, so when I get home to play for my 2 hours and have to deal with someone running/swimming around making everyone's life harder it might be a bit upsetting. You can understand that right? Just trying to give perspective, not upset at you in the least bit. Keep on man, you seem to have it all figured out.
---
Lmao this subreddit is a joke. The doomsday crowd will find something new quickly.
---
I’m going to derail this post just slightly with a question about Mages. 
---
Last night in Deadmines, yes the low level newbie dungeon, I grouped with a Mage who’s only damaging spell he cast the entire run was Blizzard. Ok that’s not true there was one Frost Bolt but I honestly believe that it was a miss click. 
---
It was great in those 4+ pulls but he did it on 2 mob pulls as well and when OOM would just wand. Single pulls he would just wand. 
---
Now I don’t use any damage meter but after last night I might because I’m dying to know how much he contributed on single or duo pull fights. 
---
Do wands out  damage any single target spells a Mage has at level 20?
---
Honestly, there is a similar feeling and win/loss gain/lose scenario with world quests and world bosses on retail now.
---
The problem is...people just turn off war mode. 
---
No one actually DOES the world stuff in war mode.
---
People have the option to just opt out of the extra danger so...they do.
---
If they were locked into horde mode without the ability to layer or phase jump to a different copy of the world with no opposing faction around they WOULD fight for the objective.
---
Being locked into a difficult situation is part of it honestly. It's human nature to take the path of least obvious resistance.
---
Yes, you can easily heal SM GY, Library, and Armory. I probably wouldn't take you into Cath until level 35. 
---
That's fine, but probably not the 2-hander from Armory. That's what all your warriors are going to be there for, taking that as a healer would be a little over the line in my opinion. Most warriors grind until they get that axe because they'll use it for at least 10 levels (I finally sold mine at level 47 or 48). There are other two handers that drop though, and I'd say any of those are fine to need on.
---
How does it feel to be on a server with somebody as insignificant as myself?
---
He doesn’t
---
I feel your pain. I ran WC 5 times for the pants and another 4 after that for Venomstrike. I never want to run WC again lmao
---
And I disagree with that assessment and stand by what I said. It feels terrible if you are in a group and something amazing drops for your class and someone else wins it and just sells it for some gold. It does NOT feel terrible if something amazing drops for somebody else's class and they get it and equip it to actually use it. 
---
Look at it this way. The person that takes it and sells it for gold could be selling it to the same person in the group that could have used it in the 1st place. So in effect, having them both roll for it is like the person that can use the item paying the other person just because they won a roll of the dice. Instead of just using the ALREADY random roll of the dice which chose to drop that particular BOE in the first place.
---
I play krom at those times and 30-40 was the first time i didnt see many people lol
---
Yep tested this with a friend in Redridge. Even if you're not in a party if you help them kill it they get severely reduced XP
---
Depends on what you mean by fine place, they aren't great in damage, but they're still wanted.
---
Holy/disc priest pvp. I get wrecked by anything but casters. I remember not being as squishy. Why do I suck?
---
This goes against the very reason I'm arguing, so that's definitely not a good solution.

Hundred percent recommend you not do this. Here are some reasons why:
---
Supply for tanks at this level range of dungeons will be high since the dungeons are both quick and have a lot of gear that they want.
---
Demand will be low since everyone at that level is trying to save money for their mount.
---
Finally, there are better alternatives, namely, farming mobs in the outside world for gold (recommend finding dragons as they drop both money and good trash)
---
I like that you are trying to do something different to get your gold, but frankly it just won’t work imho.
---
not really a list but i can tell you some good dagger, LV 20 theres a dagger with 1-7 bonus shadow damage and huge  dmg compared to the other dagger (smtg like 19 dps + the shadow dmg while all the other weapon are at 16-17, dont remember the name). Lv 27 you have a dagger with +2 intel and shadow bolt proc(who cares about intel, the shadow proc is good and the dagger is slow thats all u want), then scarlet cim dagger if u can get it (10% loot chance) otherwise ziggler from auction house and black menace from scarlet quest. lv 40 u got the epic one at auction if u can afford it otherwise the lv 42 blue(gutripper?) is almost as good for half the price.
---
Basically the slower the dagger the better for main hand since your backstab is % weapon damge, you really dont want a fast main hand. for Offhand u can go for what you find, even sword if you go ambush specc instead of combat tree (you go full dagger if you go combat for the 5% crit chance with dagger talent)
---
Edit : i forgot to mention no matter what you want to switch to sword at lv 49 for the maraudon quest thrash blade, that shit way too op
---
Just like in real life.
---
Warriors, Paladins and Druids can tank all five mans. I might go out on a limb and say Pali/Druid are actually better for five mans.
---
Also Druids can tank raid content just fine, if not better than warriors at this phase of the game.
---
Signed: My guilds MT Druid.

People need to stop being dumb and spouting of nonsense like this.
---
Lol only in Fantasy Football
---
This is classic m8, 3g 96s is a band haha
---
I was confused lol.  “I swear I didn’t see a quest at the trainer...”.
---
Uhh might have been a good idea to censor that trade chat.
---
How are your bags so empty? Where are your consumables, your quest deliveries? Your profession mats and the upgrades ‘to be equipped on ding’? Where’s your fishing pole, your blacksmith hammer, your skinning knife or your engi-wrench? Is your mount not in your bag?
---
Tldr: How many bank alts do you have to organize your inventory in this way?!
---
Instead of Low - Medium - High - Full, it will simply say “Layered” if it has multiple layers. 
---
If it doesn’t have multiple layers, it will simply say Low, Medium, High, or Full
---
I'm legit confused by this thread. I jumped in when I saw you asked "How do you know that" in response to "every server has been down to either no layering or just two layers for awhile now".
---
I like healium for dungeons, it shows your group, then you can configure a number of buttons in front of each name, put the spells you want in each. Easy enough to configure.
---
What realm was this?
---
2 alliance raids attacking afk horde sitting around a hut was my fav part of lord of the rings
---
Idk if I should even justify this with a response, but obviously this doesn't apply to BoP.
---
Everyone here seems to think this is black and white, ninja looter or not, when it's very clearly a grey area.
---
Speak for yourself. Not everyone loves every aspect of Classic. The class balance is obviously deeply flawed. Some specs or classes are in a very rough state. 
---
I'd love to see a patch addressing that after phase 6 though. Could really just do the TBC patch.
---
Find people in chat who also need the quest. They are technically soloable under certain conditions, but you are meant to find a group for elite quests. That's why they're flagged; so you know not to try them alone.
---
So I'm a proper new player, and the logic here doesn't make sense to me. Minding that I don't know what the staff of Jordan is or how much anything is worth.
---
&gt;It's not a BoE blue. It's an item that will fund a big chunk of, if not a whole epic mount. You'd be pretty dumb to pass on that just because it's an upgrade for someone - an upgrade that they'll replace soon enough with a slightly better blue.
---
Why is it possibly worth so much then? If it is such a minor upgrade there is a new upgrade shortly thereafter, shouldn't it be relatively low cost? I would assume something so expensive is actually a big upgrade, and not something being so easily replaced. In which case, not letting take it to upgrade, and making them re-run the dungeon or buy it just cost them greatly. You *can* sell it, but presumably they *need* it if the cost is so high, right?
---
people have definitely been quitting, even prime time on weekends stalagg hasnt had a queue in over a week
---
Damn those are the bad lands!!
---
Yes, in fact it's causing too much threat...

---
They sapped then ganked so I defended myself, it’s a pvp server..
---
Going back and looking it up you are right. They had the base code. 
---
It was more the changes to make it work with the engine that took time / made  new bugs
---
This baffles me.. In my guild we kick anyone that requested layer abuse. I wouldn't stay in a guild that allowed it for a second.
---
As SM/Ruin, you really don't need to use immolate, so spellpower is really only more useful than shadow damage in aoe situations.
---
Too bad Druid T1 is trash for PvE :(
---
While it does come with being a rogue as an ability it’s not the equivalent of the zero cost of water or summons. You do have to level up lockpick and that is time consuming sometimes. So it’s a bit different than those utilities. In the end though I’d say it’s up to the group to discuss that with the rogue at the start and decide on how to proceed on locked chests.
---
&gt;More than half the game feels like warrior loot
---
In vanilla, Warriors were the favorites. Also have you read the Vanilla manual? 
---
The Warrior:
---
&gt;The warrior is the toughest of all classes in World of Warcraft. They have the highest health of any class, can use the best weapons, can wear the heaviest armor, and can also deal an excellent amount of damage. Melee combat is the warriors' forte, and while
---
they aren't as quick or lethal as the rogue, nor as adept at ranged
---
combat as the mage or hunter, they are nevertheless one of the
---
toughest classes in World of Warcraft.
---
They basically say "You're the biggest badass in the game!"
---

If you wanna read all of them yourself, they are around page 37 or so
---
Whitemane has SMOrc which is gonna end up putting like 300+ people just from their guild in one place for raids on cities eventually I'm sure. City raids will be completely undoable on our server pretty much sadly due to the population.
---
I almost quit my guild over it, but the officers stepped in and told people not to ask for more than one layering group invite per hour, and the three people that were trying to spam switch layers ended up just spamming each other in whispers instead.
---
people are batshit insane everywhere some times.
---
No, you're conflating two different things. There are separate hosted processes for each continent (and one for instances) but they are the same layer. A layer is an entire copy of the entire world, including all its processes (Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Instance).
---
Actually it's MUCH better now then at launch because the population is MUCH more spread out which is why they can remove layering.
---
Really? My own mage hands it out freely at outposts. But maybe that's just me.
---
On the other hand, a five man dungeon group coming upon a locked chest that only the rogue will loot, despite the fact that that his group is the one who got him there in the first place ... THAT reeks of greed.
---
But hey ... if you want to solo those dungeons, you are absolutely welcome to. We'll just find a rogue who's happy to share his class utility with the group while in a dungeon run. If not, guess we can just replace that rogue with a Warlock who will happily summon two group members from across the world, or a mage who will open a portal to a capital city of choice for those characters who's hearthstone is still on cooldown.
---
Not even sure he clicks, I think he actually types.
---
/Cast Cone of Cold (Rank 4)
---
/Cast Frostbolt (Rank 7)
---
I didn't say it wasn't a problem.
---
It's just one of the biggest jokes of a problem I've ever heard of.  It's like a teenager screaming "you just don't understand!" At their parents because they're having a hard time fitting in in the 8th grade.
---
Edit: also, sorry about your nuts, man.
---
I've heard horror stories about testicular torsion and I wish the best for you.
---
Not a hard concept here. Everyone roll need and no one gets burned. 
---
When youre in a PUG and BoEs of high value drop that can be sold for good chunk of gold, everyone needs to roll need. 
---
If you are playing with guildies or friends, than you can be nice enough to pass it to someone that would use it. This logic doesnt work with randoms and the only people being burned are the ones being nice enough to pass it to someone that would use, and than guess what, that person puts it on the AH and their niceness just lost them a chance at that money. 
---
As much as everyone wants to think everyone is helpful to each other in Classic, it is the the reality that niceness will be taken advantage of.  Protect yourself and roll need.
---
If everyone rolls need and you end up winning it and think hey, ill be nice and give it to the person that can use it, than that is your item to do so.
---
I wrote "how do you know that" just before checking the forum and see the (only 2 hours old) update about layering.
---
OP said it was about the previous quote on "single digits" and NOT about the new update, that's why I said you can't make up numbers, because single digit can mean anything.
---
If OP said I just saw the EU announcement it would have been totally different.
---
Gratz! Same boat, got my mount yesterday and advanced a few professions. Down to less than 1g but worth it!
---
I just looted this on Sulfurus in Tanaris. Planning on selling today.
---
Why is white mane so crazy? No huge streamers iirc, but the queues were bad enough that I rerolled in Blaumeux
---
That's exaclty my point.  
---
Many tanks will want for their fury spec the leather stuff. Then the rogue too. Sometimes the hunter.  
---
Fuck that shit; then I end up with two wars, a rogue, and a hunter who want the same gear. Or two wars and a rogue.   
---
If the DPS wanted to tank, we could have less competition or casters, which is less competitive for loot (better distribution).
---
Your other weapon for fury will be from Onyxia. DW fury is one of the strongest dps specs in the game.
---
From a PvE perspective. **Transmute: Arcanite** is a big one. And then pretty much all the **Flask** recipes. **Titans, Distilled Wisdom,** and **Supreme Power** are big three. And then **Greater Fire Protection** is really good too for PvE.
---
Every time you interact with the AH you are manipulating the market.  You undercut the Runecloth stack by 10s? Clearly manipulating the market.  And if someone buys your entire stock and relists it at the higher price, that's the same thing. Neither should be illegal.
---
Thats true, it is hard to find an exact point to draw the line, but I think its clear that the line is drawn before 300+ gold items.
---
Feels good to see this gear on a orc warlock, i hope you put it on use and kill some alliances.
---
I also use pyroblast as a mage to have a little regen period since the cast is so long once the cast is complete it cancels the regen
---
Meditation is whatever. Maxed out wand and spirit tap is first priority and is the bread and butter of priest leveling (try to find a good wand for your level too).
---
I don't get it. They just move away from each other and sit to eat/drink?
---
This surprises me, considering how useless mages without mana are. I assumed they would "reset" by having one sheep the other, evocate/bandage, then attack, with a huge mana advantage.
---
Bears not a meme spec.
---
Not us, we have tacos!
---
Sure there is...because most community members expect need = upgrade you equip.
---
It's literally how most of us see "need".
---
"Greed" is what is there for "I need gold", it literally means you want the money.
---
I'm not objecting if people want to use other rules like "all need", but it's not a ninja move to need something you'll equip.
---
MufAsa
---
People play Ironman in WoW?
---
I mean, I have enough non-ninjas on my friends list that I generally don't have to risk it with randoms anyway, and I haven't run into many ninjas because most people are decent people who are just playing to have fun and aren't greedy dipshits, despite what the post distribution on this sub would indicate.
---
It is higher than that. Like 28.
---
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. After level 36 nothing comes close to SS + WW + cleave 's aoe damage.
---
At what gear levels....
---
Well fuck why didn't I think of setting up a castsequence for grinding.
---
I don't get it. Why do these things sell for high prices, if they're just going to be replaced in 3 levels?  Isn't the price just artificially high *because* people are looting and selling it, making it harder to actually get?
---
Long live the king.
---
We literally don't know if they reduced the pop cap or not.
---
It's probably the worst pve dps spec I think.  I would expect to do around 50-66% of the dps of combat swords with the same gear.  
---
Maybe only eclipsed by a premed build in terms of terrible dps spec.
---
&gt;What is the functional difference between needing immediately vs typing "everyone need" and needing last?
---
I explained  
---
&gt; The argument being presented in this thread is that it doesn't matter if someone actually needs the item, because everyone needs items they can buy with gold.   
---
Then you said that like I was offtopic so I explained the topic. 
---
 But i will discuss it with others I guess?
---
Make it where I don't have to sim every piece of gear to know which is more optimal and get rid of all the fucking tallent choices. We have basic bitch tallents where you get to choose between 1-3 things, but then you get gear to choose more procs or in some cases change how you play your class, or even changes your spec. 
---
Case in point I kept getting gear that was absolutely the best for fire mages, but not great for ice (my spec)... so I started learning fire mage for a bit instead of playing the spec I wanted, but then classic came out. 
---
There are just too many numbers based off of procs for me to really understand what all is happening. sure it feels great to have a ton of numbers with damage all over the screen, but at the same time it is like "I have no fucking idea what is going on, but this looks cool" and then you find out that you are playing the wrong style for your spec for what gear you have.
---
Nice lie, how did he win the roll? The game wouldn’t even let him roll on them if he hadn’t done the quest.
---
Let whoever is leading your class know you haven't raided before.  You can avoid a lot of trouble by just being up front about it and asking them what you should be doing, and what you should bring to the raid.  Any group that isn't willing to teach you a little isn't worth joining.
---
Sure - but also probably not far off from the truth either way
---
Homie calm down it's okay man
---
&gt; And I notice they didn't reaffirm their commitment to removing layers before Phase 2. So maybe they aren't sure that's going to work.
---
-
---
Post says: 
---
&gt; As we’ve said before, we will have all realms on a single layer before introducing world bosses, and a great deal of progress has been made toward that goal.
---
While leveling through SM, I was always top damage for every run as a warrior, who was also designated tank. I don't know why people have a problem with it. Doing the same thing in BRD, but other classes are starting to catch up to damage so it's not as noticeable.
---
Fascinating.  Chat has banter.
---
So sexy great job OP!
---
And pantaloons.
---
So I just wait out Brutality Blade / Vis'Kag and Deathbringer?
---
There's no fire in Tarren Mill, bruh.  No *fire*.  That's the lack of amenities we have to deal with.
---
Why on earth does that website want me to login with my blizzard account? Thats gonna be a no from me dog.
---
Dual spec because it lets everyone play 2 out of 3 (or 4, for Druids) possible roles, effectively encouraging people to only play among their smaller group, as opposed to encouraging people to play with more people. My character is a Discipline Priest, not whatever you need it to be.
---
As for phasing, because it literally makes no sense that the world would change for me, but not for the person standing right next to me, that's just as bad as, if not worse than, layering and cross-server groups.
---
Yep.  37 and 49 characters on Kromcrush.  STV 2-3 weeks ago was a nightmare.  Now, it just sucks like normal.  Only place I've had any MAJOR issues in the past week was a 10+ horde squad with multiple 60s constantly ganking in Jintha'Alor.  I'll have to save Sharpbeak some other time...
---
Agree on the guide idea,disagree on the source
---
Wow-professions has much better guides with maps of routes for mining/skinning depending on your level
---
Is it just so humiliating for people to be defeated by undead warriors that they simply give in out of shame?
---
I think the point is that if you choose the lesser weapon with that mindset, are you also choosing lesser pieces of gear across the board? At that point, the gap adds up.
---
I do. Our raid is fine w 0 enhance scrub shit.
---
Youre the one trying to say we should take them.
---
How did you manage to get everyone together, our group had almost two full raid groups, it got split into 4 seperate groups because of phasing and we gave up.
---
They are at 60, but not for leveling
---
Wanding when oom is the right thing to do. But normally if you have mana and there's only 1-2 enemies I tend to get more dps through frostbolting than Wanding with maybe a fireball/fireblast mixed in.
---
That being said, sometimes on fights where all I do is wand sometimes I'm 2nd or 3rd (occasionally even 1st) in damage. Some wands do pretty decent dps
---
&gt; fearing warlocks
---
Well, while I would be apprehensive about this too from the onset, a good warlock can use curse of recklessness to cancel the fear effect, and then another curse to get it back, to have the mob run back and forth in a shorter zone.  It takes a lot of attention to do though, but its useful if the pull is going badly and you need abit more CC.
---
* The trick to a good healer is to have as little downtime as possible. That's it. You can do this by 1, drinking whenever possible, and 2, using the 5 second rule (5SR)
---
First, let's look at how you maximize drinking to keep up mana regen:
---
* Get mages to give you water, and lots of it. Like, 3+ stacks. Even if they aren't in your group, tip a mage outside the dungeon/in town; you want a *ton* of water so you can burn through it at every opportunity without feeling bad
---
* You don't need full mana every pull. If I'm above 50% mana, I'll usually tell the tank to pull unless I know the next pull will be very hard. You'll keep up mana regen from drinking at the start of the fight, so you'd just be sitting there doing nothing while you wait for people to take damage if you were at full mana anyway.
---
* As soon as combat ends, drop and start drinking. When you need to cast a heal, as soon as the spell finishes if you are out of combat you can hit the drink button and go right back to drinking before getting put in combat. This is called combat drinking. If you are really good at timing/make a macro for it, you can even cast gheal and renew and go back to drinking
---
Now, let's look at how you maximize 5SR and healing efficiency:
---
* 5SR means that for 5 second after a spell cast, you will regen no mana. After that, when you are out of casting you will regen mana in ticks every 2 seconds. You want to burst your heals together and heal as much as possible and as fast as possible, to maximize the time where you're out of casting and regenerating mana.
---
* This is why you don't keep everyone topped, you want to wait as long as possible before healing. Once you let people get a little low, you can start spamming heal/gheal to fill people up, then go back to waiting.
---
* This is why renew is low-key good. Heal/gheal are your most efficient spells in terms of HP per mana, so you want to cast these a lot; but because renew is instant cast, it's really easy to cast it right after finishing a gheal. This won't increase your time in casting at all, unlike another heal, and you can do it preemptively, further increasing time not-casting. Even though it has lower HP/mana, when you take into account the mana saved by not having to cast it starts looking more efficient.
---
Other tips and tricks:
---
* PW:S is a great backup spell to keep people from getting nuked, but it's really inefficient and will stop warr/druid from getting rage so you should not use it often. It is best used on casters when channeling big spells like warlock hellfire/RoF, or mage blizzard, as it keeps them from losing channel time to pushback if they pull aggro (which they will)
---
* Level by getting wand spec/spirit tap first, then go disc, respec at 44 to shadowform/wand spec, continue disc, respec in the late 50's to holy/disc and start grinding BiS through dungeons as you get your last few levels
---
* DO. NOT. DOWNRANK. You will hear people say this a lot, "you should be downranking as a healer it's more efficient" No, it isn't. You need to have a lot of +healing, which you won't have while leveling (and basically can't get enough without twinking), and you need a lot of MP5 and other regen. It just is less efficient with leveling gear vs. stacking spirit and maximizing the 5SR. The only time you should downrank is to prevent overhealing, period.
---
That isnt enough threat generation still. You still have to watch threat at all times when fighting bosses and with windfury you can burst above that thresh hold without notice
---
It's not even lucky crits. And time you crit them, they're going to immediately come back down on you with two additional swings.
---
I've halved rogues with just a single double-swing that procs seal of command.
---
It's just the opposite. Open world questing is WAY better today then it was at launch. I don't have ANY problems questing now. If people are saying they are having problems, they weren't around at launch.
---
That is retarded but I commend your generosity.
---
* Reduce raid difficulty from 4 to 2. Removing LFR and Normal. Even though I never do Mythic I think it is kind of cool to have something that challenging in the game. This could also be done through achievements like in the past.
---
* Remove world quests
---
* Add legendary quest lines again
---
* Tier sets
---
* I would say remove phasing but not sure if thats even possible at this point
---
* Remove gear score and any means to calculate it
---
* Add hit% back in
---
* Add talent tree back in
---
* Long, detailed class quests (best part of Legion)
---
* Class overhaul. I'm not playing Classic because I find the classes too bland and also time. But I think BFA classes can pretty much do it all. I think there needs to be a middle ground. Each class would get their own thread though so too much to expand on there.
---
* Stats to scale harder like in WOTLK. If you stacked stats it actually mattered. It wouldn't swing it 5% it would swing it 30%. Instead of 10% haste you could get 40%. It made it feel like you customized your character to how you wanted to play. Stacking a stat in bfa doesn't feel like it actually increases that stat very much. 
---
* Crafting professions to always matter. It seems like every patch they forget to update and make professions useful. 
---
Regarding servers they already FUBARd that shit in classic too. They would have to hard reset and have to put an actual faction cap on every server because Twitch. I don't mind things like scaled leveling and increased speed and phasing during leveling. Achievements I like. I think the best time of WoW was Wotlk so pretty much give me that.
---
Ah, my bad then. Would have to be the honor system, which some people would abuse, much like the ninjaing issue. Luckily, despite all the sickening posts here, most people in game are actually reasonable fair-minded people.
---
You can make good money flipping pages if you have bank space. Buy a few cheapo 5s pages, scan the AH any time you're in gadget,bb, everlook (which will be very often from 35-50) and list any missing pages for ~60s. If there's just one or two pages and they're kind of cheap, buy them out and re-list them.
---
Head: Bad
---
Shoulders: Only beaten by wild growth spaulders, drop from Majordomo Executus, better than Pre-BiS. I'd rate as good.
---
Wrists: Except dumping a lot of gold into the flarecore wraps. I'd rate as okay.
---
Gloves: 2nd best, nice untill you get the better hands of the exalted. I'd rate as okay.
---
Belt: Better than anything from dungeons. The competition is a 500g belt or belt from MC. I'd rate as good.
---
Boots: BiS.
---
It's a very good starting point. And the set is not garbage. The 2 first set bonuses are also good. The last one is a bit niche, nice for solo farming, you're probably never needing 50% reduced CD on Tranq though.
---
Kinda depends.  Generally I aoe with 4+ mobs and single with 3 or fewer.  If we're aoe pulling and there's 1-2 mobs left with some physical dps in the group I'll just wand to conserve Mana and let the real dps come from the group's tank/hunter/rouge etc.  Wands do hit reasonably hard so it's not a complete waste and if I save myself a frostbolt or two it might mean the tank can pull 4-5 seconds faster.  It's not much but every bit counts. 
---
If the remaining mob is at 40% hp or more left I'll probably try to chunk it with a frostbolt, particularly if there isn't much physical dps represented in the group or if the mob might be a runner (kill faster and slow with frostbolt helps here).
---
Edit:. hp not exp
---
Fact = I've convinced myself.
---
I do it on the daily! &gt;:) Lok’tar!
---
If servers get flooded with flame sacs though, it will never be a bad thing. They always seemed to be in short supply.
---
While it will not help now, might be a good idea to hold on to them. While a small number of players have been 60 for some time now, there is a LARGE number of players either in the 40s or approaching 60. When they all start flooding into MC those things will shoot up in price.
---
Reward isn't even 0.5% towards the epic mount.  Beyond your wildest dreams!
---
well do we have ANY videos of this?
---
I would think the slower harder hitting weapon will always be best.
---
No, it's more like the servers aren't as congested. People are now spread out.
---
Everyone should roll need on epic BoEs to prevent ninja looting. Gold standard. If you greed on high value items you’re a chump who deserves to get ninjad.
---
yea just saw that after posting lol
---
Yea it’s weird. Some guy yesterday said LFM DPS BRD. So I join and everyone’s 52-54. And I’m the only viable tank. So I just tell them that I’m not tanking and left. 
---
When people say LFM DPS, I assume they already have tank and heals. It throws me off when they don’t. Like why wouldn’t you ask for tank and heals first????
---
They literally just said today that several servers are down to no layers, and the most any server has is 2 now (possibly 3 due to confusing wording on the post but they said even faerlina is 2). Whitemane, which was one of the worst queues up until sub renewal hit hasn't had a queue at peak for the past week.
---
We'll see how awful it gets in another month or two once more people are concentrated at 60 though. It's possibly gonna be pretty awful lol.
---
Good point. Yeah, I think that person is just looking at a perspective of Naxx levels of end game.  But at the same time, if you're still considering that the phase 2 mace is such a small difference.  That trade of 1 stam for 2 def/10 armor washes out in the noise.
---
I think argent/ToK is a good "poor man's warden staff" that won't cost you as much and trades some armor.  Is it a replacement for a warden staff as far as raw armor?  No, at least not until you get to the cap.
---
But like I said, I can see if someone wants the best for phase 1 for armor on weapons.  I still don't see that you would NEED it by any means.  It's the same where I spent 450g on Edgemaster's on my warrior, but that is a SIGNIFICANT boost to my warrior's damage considering that I'm a Gnome.
---
Perplexity
---
I leveled an enhancement shaman in the past.  I recall Windfury being the general go-to, especially with a 2-hand weapon.  If I was going for a more "keeping the pace" grind with a 1H and Shield I remember Flametongue Weapon being pretty good.
---
As a rogue, I say yes, but that's just out of wanting less competition for brutality blade/viskag. What's the competitive difference between 2h and dual wield fury or even arms in MC? Is it beneficial enough to put those 2handers to good use and allow the rogues priority since they're more limited unless they go daggers?
---
Can I have it?
---
Can it tell you their alts as well?
---
You need deathbringer from MC. Viskaag would be great too if you're a human. Depends on how your rogues want to spec. They should prefer aged core leather gloves and daggers if they don't want to compete with warriors as significantly.
---
2H fury would be fun because you could end up winning spinal reaper or bonereavers edge from ragnaros. 
---
So the question is if you guys do onyxia and if so what offhand would you use with deathbringer since rogues can't use axes and it's terrible for taking and hunters it should go straight to fury warriors.
---
If you're not guaranteed deathbringer for some crazy reason I would probably go 2H. Just be patient. Don't go for vendorstrike. Obsidian edged is great but if your guild is already clearing Rag then I would wait for a rag 2hander.
---
Wow-noob here, Can anyone explain this to me? I understand people from horde can fight people from alliance but I have a couple questions.
---
Is it like runescape where you have a certain zone(s) you can fight within? Or just anywhere
---
Is this premeditated? Looks like some sort of ambush deal but I have no idea
---
What are the red dudes doing that their all grouped up in one area like this? Are they just doing their own thing  or were they ready for something like this?
---
I'm not talking about weapons, though ofc those are nuts. Some of the armor pieces are BiS for several specs.
---
They literally confirmed it isn't independent of each other when they opened more layers on the largest realms to reduce queues. They're directly linked.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this all out. It is very much appreciated.
---
Yeah, you good OP.
---
Yeah, dungeons are very mediocre in that game. I actively avoid them because I don't particularly like running them. Raiding is also fun, but it's been steadily downhill since A4S, which was considered by far the hardest raid tier of that game. But that was two expacs ago now, and it was so hard that less than 1% of the player base cleared it pre-Echo, so they've made their raids way easier, which I personally don't like.
---
But by far and away my two favorite areas of FFXIV are crafting/gathering, and housing. I'm an omnicrafter/gatherer, with an emphasis on Fishing (I spent weeks getting the Of Dragons Deep title), and I've spent more time and money on my house than anything else in the game. And it's only a small house, because I'm poor. The depth of these two areas of game play are absolutely incredible, and I think help maintain the longevity of FFXIV as a whole.
---
The story annoys me too much to salvage retail.
---
And where is the 12 copper!?
---
I honestly don't get why people are so opposed to tanking, at low levels you don't even *need* to use a shield except against a boss.  FFS, I have more Rage than I know what to do with so I end up spamming Sunder Armor anyways
---
I'm Arms but love to tank because I can set the pace of the dungeon with my only real concern being the healer's mana
---
People act like it is in a vaccuum. Like someone hopping into another layer, making a pass for rich thorium, then hopping back wont affect me when they are putting far more shit on the auction house than they would without. Then that guy gets his epic mount faster and has an advantage even without layering.
---
Same type of thing for those who leveled faster in raid groups. They got to 60 quicker than they would have, and thus have had more time to gear. Or what about the people who checked multiple layers to get a tidal charm? 
---
Makes complete sense to me why people who hate ceetain things will still participate in order to not be at a disadvantage
---
actually greed is pretty popular among them because it means they'll always get it
---
*just remain calm, everything is fine here...*
---
What does this mean? Does it mean some servers get mixed with others so there are more players in the world?
---
It is cancelled when you try to cast something else, but it triggers global cooldown, which makes your cast not work.  Originally they only wanted hunters to have a ranged auto-shoot.  You used to have to click shoot every single time you wanted a *single* wand shot.  You couldn't auto-shoot at all.
---
They are.
---
Chance to be crit isn't something you can push off the hit table like a warrior can doing shield block.  Druids just accept they will be crit and have high armor to make up for it.  Either way, you're talking about a 0.2% difference in chance to be crit between the two.
---
The whole discussion started on the dire maul mace vs warden, which are insignificant between each other.  I'm just showing a phase 1 example, but there are other +def 1h items that you can get later on that probably top warden staff.
---
In the end "BiS" is BiS. And warden staff has the most armor +def you can get in the weapon slot.  I'm just pointing out less expensive or free (RNG drop) based alternatives.
---
I was expecting the usual terrible comments on this sub. But as a 12 year wow player your suggestions are very much in line with mine
---
The rule is simple
---
If it makes you stronger and you want it you need it no matter what
---
Never listen to anyone who tells you otherwise unless you had made an agreement or smth
---
&gt;Did you miss the whole fact that there was a beta and we had information about what the gear looked like?
---
Yes, I was like 13.
---
&gt;All you’re doing is saying you don’t want arguably the best content in the history of WoW so you can sit in your raid gear you got and do...nothing?
---
I would like that content at level 60 so that after Naxx the next tier would be Karazhan.
---
A good guild would. Meme guilds wont
---
Oh I see.  I have not raided much in the last 2 or 3 years.  So now the stats are random?
---
Chances are we won’t see a r12 for 3 months as well. There aren’t BGs so honor is going to be hard to come by and will be 100% random. Some days you might get a ton, other days none.
---
Jesus what don't you get
---
&gt;IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DPS. AND A WARRIOR JOINS AS DPS. HE IS GOING TO DPS... Stop acting like idiots for real.
---
Don't tell him to tank if he replied back to a LF DPS.  That Warrior LF DPS does not care about your buddy that cannot tank. He doesn't want to tank and wants to DPS don't respond at all if you want him to tank.
---
And then we'll all run back to our bodies!
---
And fight again!
---
And die again!
---
Get your shit together, Legolas!
---
When I tanked in retail, I would do the full run each time, all the side bosses and everything. More exp. Sometimes I would intentionally try to get lost, lol. Different story considering that you can hold threat and tank entire rooms at a time, but nevertheless.
---
But still, as a first timer, it’s not fun when the group all knows what they’re doing and rushes the dungeon as quickly as humanly possible. Most groups are like that in my experience. 
---
I remember I joined a dungeon run in Guild Wars 2 once, and there was a particular hallway that everyone just rushes through ignoring the enemies. Didn’t know I was supposed to do that, and ended up dying. Then the group abandoned me and continued on with the rest of the dungeon. Felt bad.
---
Do some grinding on a good mob. Money and xp and better chance for good drops.
---
Good for you? There are like 50k horde on my server, nobody cares about you or your guild network lol
---
To which you get one reply from the person that can’t use it saying they don’t mind, and 3 non replies.  So you sit on the roll window til it’s almost run out and have to play Russian roulette with your mouse cursor.
---
Itemization.info I like for things like this
---
If you are looking for something for 2handed axes or maces you are kinda outta luck. Unless you want a lvl 30 green 2handed mace...
---
This is basic mage stuff -- everyone who plays mage is a genius.
---
Butt blasted so hard you gotta call it trolling because you got embarrassed. Cute
---
I have heard that a lot of cleave groups are willing to take a druid simply to go in bear for swipe, and to take aggro IF shit goes wrong. So you arent tanking, you just swipe whenever you can. 
---
And due to the way low level druids scale, you can do good damage even as resto in bear with swipe.
---
it's actually better looked at the other way. It's greedy and selfish to think you are entitled to something which is worth a lot of money when sold to a twink, or is worthless when used on a levelling character as it gets replaced in a few levels' time
---
This guy is not really a ninja, he's following pretty standard established loot rules regarding BoEs. Anyone who rolls greed deserves to lose the roll to learn a lesson.
---
Your post is clear, people just can’t read. Take 5% less stats over a few difference pieces (like the difference between warden and unyielding) and suddenly there is a very noticeable gap.
---
Seriously, what a fucking dunce.
---
Reddit is Fun is the only Reddit app that feels good to me. All of the iOS ones I tried on my iPad are awful.
---
I don't expect it because there are so many assholes like you playing. In an ideal world people aren't so selfish.
---
By all means be a greedy person in game, we will likely never cross paths anyway thank god.
---
This is my point. Vendor purchases, spell levelings, talent respecs, mount purchases, alt leveling. Plenty of fixed prices, everything else can be attained without spending gold.
---
The grand scheme of things, what's 20 more gold?
---
as a tank i just stopped inviting mages into the group and try helping out the rogues druids and other folk who have been dejected by the current "meta"   
---
its been so much more pleasant in both gameplay and dealing with the level of smug "pull everything/more" attititudes that leads to me having to pop everything to save people and try getting things under control while the mage's lack of self awareness ends making the run take even longer because of their inability to manage threat
---
More time for peggle
---
Isn’t titan panel a full UI update?
---
&gt; It will never be removed because it cannot be disable. That's how the game works. That's how it is designed. There is no such thing as a server, "layer," that holds 3k people.
---
&gt;Please feel free to reply back when it is disabled after the first few weeks.. I'll gladly eat crow. Keep drinking the koolaid.. daddy blizzard knows best and will never lie to you!
---
Well shit that backfired. Turns out they do know what they are doing after all!
---
I guess my point was more "is a warrior with BRE/other good 2hander and a rogue with brutality blade/viskag better or worse than a warrior with b/v and rogue with say rends?" Would those 2handers be used otherwise? Which situation brings the most to the raid. This is just speculative, I don't think fury should be shoehorned into a specific style just to gear us poor rogues out wanting fancy swords, just more of a curiousity thing.
---
Now I wish I had a better printer.
---
Yeah I love when they don't expect anything maybe 18s, if you're sitting next to me just jumping around then I ask for a port and you reply "1g" I'll say oh no way and flight path or ask the next one when in reality I only ever ask a mage if I can see them and always tip 60s+
---
10 days ago I was checking the new EU realms where you could transfer from the big ones. These new realms werent truly new as they were like over 1 week old. At 2 in the night there were only 250 people online total, which was less than there were level 60 on my realm at the same time.   
---
Now there are two scenarios possible - Blizzard won't give a fuck and people will be forced to stay on ghost realms or they will allow paid transfer or merges, but then imagine the economic advantage people from ghost realms will have - on the realm I talked about earlier there were 11 60lvls online. Just imagine the farming possibilities where entire zone is yours to mine/herb.
---
You made that much in just five years? Then how about lending your ol pal Zoidberg a few copper Mr. Millionaire.
---
I was in 1k needles in the salt flats. I was an Alliance player in 2006 and I rerolled Alliance again (blame my friends) so I've never really explored the Horde areas.
---
Of course doing so in a PvP server is not a very good idea. But I actually made it all the way to Tanaris from Theramore without getting killed once, even stopped to help a Tauren warrior who pulled too many mobs. Most people seem to just want to grind and level even if they can just kill me with 1 button. So I thought it'd be alright to do a few quests in the race track area.
---
At first, all I had were a couple of surprised looks when they see me (their target bar didn't move from my character for a good minute). But later on I did get 2 very memorable PvP stories for me, both against players who were 2-3 levels higher.
---
This one druid decided to gank me in the middle of killing a scorpid. Fine, fair enough, it's open season on Alliance players in 1k needles anyway. But then he decides to *corpse camp*.
---
So I respawn a bit further away and run away. Nope, this guy *follows me* in travel form. Like, you go out of your way to kill a player who's running away and rewards you nothing, when you could be killing mobs and levelling. Just...why?
---
Anyway it turns out he's a terrible player because he spammed moonfire whilst chasing me, eventually ran out of mana to which I turned around, healed myself and wanded him to death. Pretty satisfying to see him panic and turn his character confusingly in circles when my mind blast crit him for half his hp.
---
Second time, again whilst killing scorpids a warrior and shaman combo jumps me. I figured I was dead so I just danced whilst they smacked the lights out. The shaman must've taken pity because he stopped attacking, and I noticed the warrior was a 1h spec and wasn't doing alot of damage, so I feared them and ran away. The warrior decides to chase after me but we kept triggering random mobs so he was in combat and couldn't charge. Once I saw he was dazed, I turned around, nuked him and wanded him to death. To his credit he tried to LOS juke through my character but I don't turn with my keyboard so I took him down.
---
The Shaman went another route presumably to cut me off. Once he got there his buddy was already dead and I was at full hp/mana again. So he just clapped, I bowed and we parted ways.
---
10/10 would quest there again.
---
&gt;They'll have naked Gnome races across the world.
---
Dude, are you from Sting or Deathwing?  I remember that!
---
It seems like it would help both.
---
&gt; He doesn't want to tank and wants to DPS
---
How do you know that? How do you know he cares?
---
Elixir of the mongoose is a good seller too for raids
---
What an insightful comment.
---
Yeah my brother (Paladin) just brought it to my attention. He's a few levels behind me, so maybe I'll have a quest buddy...
---
Strange analogy. It doesn't work at all, even imperfectly, given that lottery tickets are purely monetized. You've described a ninja looter!
---
If you and a naked buddy are walking along and an expensive suit drops that is his perfect size and he says, "wow, I've been looking for a suit. I need one for work," but you say, "well, that's interesting but I need new tires for my car. I'm going to sell this suit and buy tires with the money." That's ninja looting.
---
Herod is a different beast from a "high pop server". I'm on incendius which is like 4th or 5th in pop in NA and I've done every quest in Hillsbrad, Desolace, STV, you name it.
---
I think you're nuts, unless they opened free transfers to that realm, it'd be dead. More people will definitely quit anyways.
---
What do cops have to do with wow?
---
He has that Orc brain... can't comprehend people not playing orc.
---
Because a warrior dps at a higher level than the tank currently in party will pull  aggro anyways and because it's a warrior they'll tank minimal damage anyways. Not saying people have to like it, but that's the reality and it makes sense to do the more efficient thing.
---
If the warrior doesn't want to and really cares about not pulling aggro (and by extension, lowering their damage), then the whole  group suffers a little for that preference.
---
All that said, fuck it, play how you want. If people ask you to do something you're uncomfortable with, leave.
---
Yeah Reckoning is a contentious ability for whatever reason. I think it's mostly a batching issue but there may have also been some attempted sabotage.
---
Regardless, for now at least, that's how you use it and it's at full possible strength with manipulation. It might seem pretty obnoxious but honestly I like it. Like it's not automated, you have to press buttons for damage. It's almost like you have actual damage abilities like Mortal Strike :D
---
They aren't advocating defensive needing followed by immediately allowing people who can actually use it to roll on it.
---
Because expensive boe drops are a mutual roll, everyone should need or greed.
---
Anything with lots of stamina.
---
What hit-percentage? There isn't any hit-% on Hand of Justice, now you're just spreading lies.
---
Can I come too? I can open lockboxes :)
---
Yes. It's retarded to give away your chances at a once in a lifetime drop because it'll save some rando you don't know 900g. Deathchargers reins are one of the most rare/sought after items in the game. You want give it away so you can get a warm fuzzy feeling? I'm sorry but that is the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
---
also "Hurr durr DAE mages are assholes??"
---
Yea lemme just go run DM: N ...wait a sec

This took an unexpected turn.
---
Nah, my usernames purpose is actually exactly that. I don't take reddit seriously, so I enjoy taking the piss outta people occasionally. If I wanted to be inflammatory, I would have just said something very controversial and upsetting that is hard to agree with instead of a genuine question. When people discredit me purely because of my username it's hilarious to me. I win, either way.
---
I am just curious about general / neutral opinions about a topic I am unfamiliar with, hence why I asked this question in the first place. I got a good scope of replies which helped me shape my opinion about the current situation I am facing in Classic WoW and have decided to quit the guild. I have asked a bunch of guilds that were already established and managed to get an spot in a second raid that was looking for my class. At the end, I benefited from this thread and I am thankful for it.
---
Treat me like in 5 and explain this to me. I don’t remember anything about “layers”.
---
&gt; It won’t be temporary. I promise you, it will persist.
---
You broke your promise :(
---
Isn’t there a 30s CD on them as soon as you equip?
---
Bloomy ftw!!
---
we're talking about BoE selling for hundreds, you're definitely saving weeks of grinding gold
---
it's not about who needs it more, but I'd argue our time is equally as valuable, and a pricey BoE drop is just that; time saved
---
for the one that would use it, he doesn't have to save money to buy it off the AH, for the other, he's closer/he has his epic mount
---
So when I mind control someone, i can give them all my instants. Like shild;stamina;renew;cure disease;fearward. And he can buffed by my teammates if I remember correct, so I am with a mage in a group, the mage can also buff him.
---
I cant use ANY spell from the enemy, in this case the mage. I can only run around with him and attack(melee!) stuff in a certain range, if I run to far it will break!
---
May as well just get a rubidium hammer...
---
The amount of fucking haters here is hilarious.
---
So a lot of the items that sell high are actually twink items.  Shadowfang is a good example because it requires level 19 to equip and is in fact bis before level 20, but there are very few people (especially on ally) that hit sfk pre-20.  The sword has something like a 0.01% drop chance from everything in the instance so it can sell for hundreds of gold.
---
People are willing to pay very high prices to get their twinks ready before battlegrounds release.
---
Pretty sure you are the first in line of people not understanding things.
---
&gt; This allowed us to accommodate** more players per layer**, which means fewer layers required per realm.
---
They dropped the layering down because everyone is no longer stuck in low zones, which would make play literally impossible without extra layers. Now there are more players in ALL the zones per layer, and believe be on bigger servers it's just too many. Every quest location is stuffed.
---
Game is too easy to need any guides
---
You have 0 proof they were using any unauthorized programs or scripts. Look, we all feel bad because you are upset and are thinking about quitting. But you did all of this to yourself. You already knew this was risky because you took steps to mitigate the risk. Then after taking those steps, someone still managed to buy up some of you mats. That is a massive red flag. You should have stopped immediately. You ignored all obvious warning signs of trouble and continued anyway. 
---
Then you publicly accuse people of botting, which is against this subs rules. You will get no sympathy here. You are in the wrong.
---
Much like AoE Looting. Or Transmog.
---
If a BOE epic or expensive blue drops in a PUG, I am needing. I tell others to need. It’s money. I am not going to greed just to see the other person try to sell it later. 
---
BOP rules are different. For greens, I don’t mind rolling greed. If someone needs it great. It’s not a lot of gold. And people won’t ruin their reps by needing stuff they don’t actually need. But for epics, and even blues, I will need. If someone mistakenly rolls greed and I win, I will let them roll against me. 
---
Now, guild runs are different. I will not take an item a guilty needs and plans to use. But in PUG runs that freezing band is just as useful to me (gold to buy other stuff) as to the frost mage (gold to buy other stuff or use it).
---
With that said, if the group agrees to other loot rules, I will either accept them or leave the group. But I have had zero issues in PUGs when I say need on BOE epics and blues.
---
And here I am, walking all over the place with pockets full of fish.
---
I caught them last week, so they're probably still good.
---
BIS BOE items are Need&gt;Greed.
---
Non-BIS BOE items are 'All Need'.
---
Guild runs should be using loot council and guild banks, so no point mentioning that
---
Yeah, no, I'd definitely have a local printing shop do the printing on a nice plotter.
---
There are no queues on Firemaw, just logged in straight away during peak time today. And that used to be one of the Eu servers with the longest queues.
---
Even with stealth?
---
In this same thread another redditor brings up my point that even though AH prices change, mounts, spells, vendor items, respecs(kinda), and other recipes dont change prices.
---
That's what op means. Warriors cannot do their dps if they are not tanking, because if you're not getting hit you don't have the rage to do anything. This is why you should only ever do leveling dungeons as a warrior if you're tanking.
---
Concerns being the key word there. It never came to fruition which is important to note.
---
Thanks for making things more civil, and your question doesn't have a simple answer.
---
I think the main reason there are two buttons is to have a flexible way to distribute loot quickly, and that Blizzard wanted the loot rules to sort themselves out organically. The labels Need/Greed are just to make things a little easier to understand than having words like, High Priority, and low priority.
---
There is no one way to treat the buttons, and in a guild only run I think it actually makes sense to let certain classes have BoE epics if they help progression since you are working in a team, though some items the profits should be split evenly if they are only good for leveling/twinking. In pickup groups it should be a free for all.
---
 What I think is fair/efficient/default for the typical 5 man is you greed mediocre greens because the effort of selling them on the AH generally isn't worth the time or AH fees. However even mediocre greens are useful to somebody, so they might as well need it because the green is legitimately more valuable to one class than another because it is hard to sell. If it is a blue/purple boe armor/wep, or worth more than 15g (subject to mood/level), everyone should need. If someone does want it they can pay someone then for a slight discount because valuable stuff only drops once in a blue moon so it isn't a hassle. Obviously these rules aren't comprehensive, so for other things like traveler's backpacks where values fluctuate heavily the rules are subject to change. In some groups where every player is heavily geared, the fastest way to give out loot is to always need every item because nobody needs crap.
---
It is important to consider that humans have an irrational tendency to consider things they own more valuable than things they don't own, so if there was only 1 roll button whoever won the item would be more likely to haggle for greens, which slows down the entire group, and makes playing the game more stressful for the sake of cheap crap items. Having two buttons lets people make up their own loot rules and is a simpler interface/coding. For example when running ZG/AQ20 guilds will frequently tell everyone to always need every coin/bijou that drops which lets items be distributed randomly, quickly, and with less mistakes. 
---
Having a need button makes this transfer seemless so you don't have to stop and convince someone to hand you something from your inventory for free, which sidesteps drama because it was never yours to begin with. If you have an enchanter in your group you can also use this to automatically funnel them all greens for disenchanting and roll for that if that is your thing. Maybe someone is only wanting to run the dungeon so they can get dibs on a certain craft materials like a righteous orb. Need/Greed makes these situations go smoothly. Some blues are quite crap and equivalent to greens, and some greens are BiS for the entire game because they have ridiculous RNG stats like +healing wands, so you can't base it on color whether there are two buttons either. Also there are certain blue items like spell tomes, which are stupid common. A one button roll system doesn't cover every use case, and coding in all sorts of special rules is complicated, confusing, and prone to mistakes. 
---
For BoP drops you need two roll buttons for obvious reasons that I don't need to explain, and having the same loot system for BoP and BoE is simpler.
---
Horde's definitely the mainstream faction now if people just assume you're Horde.
---
So do you have enemy player castbars set at the very top of the screen then?
---
A lot of people took time off for launch, once people hit 60 they just log in to raid essentially, like retail.
---
All you’re doing then is building an absurdly long raid progression to try and get a character geared. It makes way more sense to have people level and transition to a new set of raids.
---
Of course not! I mean it’s not really even mine. I found the base file on Reddit and  just enhanced it.
---
Oh man, dark void is awful.
---
I feel you, I farmed this fishing pole for 3 hours before finally getting it. And I'm Alliance so the shellfish were useless to me. Surprisingly none of the many Horde swimming around also farming it attacked me, everyone kept to their own little space of about 3 or 4 traps.
---
&gt; What part about that phrase do you think involves selling anything?
---
I don't think that involves selling anything, however I do think it involves removing the cost they would have had to pay for the item if he wasn't being greedy.
---
I.e. if they win, what they win is the money they no longer have to pay to buy the item.
---
We agree on that.
---
what is sapper?   
---
i see,but holy nova is pretty low range and even lower dmg (i mean nobody will waste point in talants for its range,right?), its still good?O_O  (i dunno,im shadow on leveling right now)
---
Awe, u angry someone can actually use the item cuts into your profit margin from selling it?  There’s a good reason why the roll buttons are labeled need and greed.  The color of the item shouldn’t factor into which one you click when the item is being rolled on.  Arguing anything beyond that point is irrelevant to the question.  If I see an upgrade, I click need, I put it on.  Crazy concept right!?!?
---
Think if warlocks sat there and told you to pay a gold+ to their bank alt before they gave a summon or some shit. I have to give up bag space to carry these shards around and make sure I have a healthy supply... I don't suppose you give 2 shits about that or even tip for lock summons.
---
I just think this is a topic that people will be split on permanently. I truly believe that hundreds of gold towards an epic mount (which is a permanent upgrade to your character) is worth way more than someone getting an upgrade for 15 levels. Also, you can even earn more gold with the gold that you get from selling the BoE, which adds even more value to it.
---
If the item in question drops that is an upgrade for the person, but that person never intended to buy it off of the AH because of its price - then that just goes to show how valuable it really is. If they wanted it they can farm the gold for it, instead of the train of thought "oh, now that this dropped, I think I'd like to use it". I bought a Krol Blade off of the AH with my rogue back in OG classic and at the end of the day I think I would have rather had the gold.
---
Again I've never, or if I can't remember it must not have been that big of a deal, had any complaints about this in groups. People feel so entitled over pixels it's insane.
---
edited for formatting
---
There are some gear upgrades that are disproportionate to their gold values. 
---
Example: a twink item worth 200g that if you continue leveling your character will get replaced in a level or two.
---
It's clear you guys are playing on a different server to me.
---
Dude, everything in this game is just pushing a button. It took me hours to level up this skill that isnt required. Dont compare this to a spell you learn at the trainer.
---
But youre the retard that went from "5s" to "8g". Really good price jump there.
---
Fair enough, and you might find the black shield above the fireplace fairly easily, but the tiny badge on the plank of wood.. idk if the average player would be able to spot that..
---
So you said that a resto that drops windfury is not a support. But a enhance specced shaman in healiing gear provides all the same support buffs as a melee enhance. But, they have way more mana that they can use to totem twist instead of the melee who is using the little mana he has to boost his meager dps. 
---
So how is the melee enhance shaman more of a support than the healer, when the healer provides more supporting totems by using totem twist? Explain in words the claim you made two posts above.
---
Here's the thing: you can't. You can't justify enhance shaman from a strategic perspective. The only valid argument is "this game is casual and it doesn't matter". But it does matter, because we need resto shamans, and those resto shamans want pvp enhance gear.
---
jesus that sounds pathetic
---
&gt; Right, but if the game wanted to just give you a shitload of gold it could.
---
So which mobs drop hundreds of gold at a time then? None of them do because it would completely destroy the economy with inflation.
---
Shut up, nerd.
---
For a reason.
---
&gt; I don't need to choose between being able to tank or heal and everything else.
---
See, what you see as a great feature is a bad one, to me. So this will be a case of agree to disagree.
---
&gt; Questing, grinding, farming etc are all tough when specced as a healer.
---
Leveled a Priest to 60 as a Healer three times and while it's slightly longer when questing than on a DPS class/spec, it's certainly not harder.
---
&gt; For classic I picked a feral durid because it's the closet classic has to duel spec and say "fuck you" to any raiding guild that forces all of it's durids to respect to resto without covering thier Respec cost
---
It's what I rolled for my alt, for other reasons, but I'll certainly take advantage of being able to spec Feral and fill all 3 roles as needed, while leveling. That's the perk of playing an hybrid class, which is void and null when other classes can simply dual spec.
---
Its the best central place to get to everything.
---
Oh the original engine I’m sure has been constantly evolving all this time into the modern engine.
---
However what that code base looks like in 2019 compared to 2004 is wildly different, is what the devs explained. To the point it would be much more work to re-implement a lot of the networking code &amp; performance enhancements into the old code base.
---
Damn, how did you not instantly die when you charged and then ran right through them? We're they all AFK?
---
I can tell that you didn't even look at the pic in OP's post. The offenders in question are not standing in a "hard to get to spot". They are in a spot that's barely above ground level and out in the open, it just happens to be a spot that causes the guards to evade bug. Hence exploit.
---
As a warrior, I want nothing to do with you and your aoe spammers.
---
I think a lot of people would enjoy a middle ground between retail and classic.  But hardly anyone trusts blizzard to make those changes to classic without ruining it.
---
Yeah if I'm understanding correctly I think that is what SWTOR did and that was my favorite leveling in any MMO so far.
---
You're absolutely allowed to need on a BoE if you intend to use it.
---
Personally I think *all* players should need, and if someone really intends to use it they can try to convince their party to let them have it or do separate rolls among themselves. Especially if the drop  sells for a lot of money but will be relatively short lived on a leveling players vs. a twink.
---
Level 43 and still don't have it because I abandoned it and the quest giver no longer has it. I've been researching for weeks and tried every suggestion I found on forums, both recent and from 06. Blizzard won't tell me where to re-accept the quest because it's "not in the spirit of Classic". I've talked to every NPC listed on WoWHead and none of them have the quest.
---
Somebody help I'm about to quit the game.
---
Really don't get the hate for this.
---
Tank has a much higher repair bill than everyone else.
---
Tank is likely the least able to farm for gold outside of instances compared to everyone else.
---
You will likely make more than the 1g you just gave him in the run itself.
---
Everyone wins.
---
....and then people will reply with "/r/classicwow"
---
Realm population depends not only on the amount of people playing, ot also depends on how much they play
---
Some abstract "tourist" that used to play 2 hours/day on average on launch and now quit have less impact on the percieved realm population than some other abstract player that used to play 6 hours/day and now "only" plays 3 hours/day.

Honestly as long as the group isn't a complete and utter moron you don't have to spec that way, and not trying too difficult a dungeon. I'm planning on end game healing so just getting used to the spells and which to use when with the various talents.
---
LOL OK
---
Repeating the same thought over and over isn't going to somehow make it relevant. Layers and pop caps are not tied to each other. How is the idea you keep repeating challenging or adding to that discussion. Like you said, "we don't know if they reduced pop cap" so why are you speculating as if it's probable they did? Private servers had pop caps much higher than vanilla
---
the feign death thing was patched supposedly, I don't currently have a hunter though
---
....takes the longest fp.... Just for dabs!!!
---
I just don't want either in PvP :)
---
&gt; Why bother posting yet ANOTHER post on this same topic?
---
Because OP had an actual question about a specific circumstance.  I mean, he wasn't asking about looting *in general*, he was wondering whether what he did in this one particular case was right or wrong. So he asked.
---
Also the global gold pool isn't high enough yet. So many people are still struggling to pay for the "flat fee" stuff like abilities, mounts, etc. They don't have enough excess cash to pay a lot for herbs. Over time everything on the AH will inflate as the gold pool grows.
---
Though there will be some things like twink blues that will inflate more than everything else because they have little value now but will have a lot more value when BGs come out.
---
There are some dead spots but it's pretty viable, especially for a healer or tank.
---
You label them the new hunters and then say you don't want to label people. Holy shit....
---
Please explain how me wanting to ensure everyone get's a fair shot at a BoE item makes me a ninja?
---
You can keep virtue signaling all you want.  But if you're needing on marginal BoE upgrades because you can equip them when in reality everyone could use the profit from them.  I think that makes you the entitled asshole here, not me.
---
Because you guys are cry babies who are never happy.
---
Case in point. Blizzard literally gave you classic almost perfectly, but hey, STILL CANT TRUST MEAN GREEDY MONEY MAKING BLIZZARD!! They ruin everything right?!
---
I think there are just less people in dungeons. It was easy to aoe/farm shit from 17-50 but now the groups come less easy and the grind wears on you. I started questing for the first time since like day 3 of launch and we had a huge spontaneous pvp battle to take back the beach at lost rigger cove.
---
&gt;If there's a ninja in the group (or you don't trust the person, or whatever), and you decide to have everyone roll "need" to prevent them from ninja'ing an item that nobody needs, fine, I can understand that.  All need is safer than all greed, at least.
---
So you agree with me, in a PUG group, (people you dont know) that all should roll need on BOE? Mainly because you cant assume the intentions of the group.
---
You never 'know' there is a ninja in the party. If you did, you'd kick em before the roll! 
---
I appreciate you at least considering there is merit to my argument.
---
&gt;But to say that need/greed simply don't apply to BOEs because it's "equivalent to gold" is where you lose me.  If you roll need on an item strictly for the gold, and then offer to sell it back to the guy who actually did need it, you're a scumbag, period.
---
Perhaps "need/greed dont apply" is too much of hyperbole. It's an archaic system that I dont have any idea on how to improve, unfortunately. 
---
&gt;"youre a scumbag, period"
---
However, again I say, protect yourself against potential scammers by all rolling need. You dont 'know' that they are going to equip it. If you greed roll, they need roll, then bounce. Now I've given up my fair chance at the loot/gold to someone whom I had no idea their intentions in the first place. Doesn't that feel bad and could have been prevented?
---
Remember, my whole argument is predicated on the fact of these are people you dont have any experience playing with. If you know them/have played with them before, then greed roll everytime.
---
Didn't we call Sylvanas as the next bad guy back in legion? Fuck what a shitty storyline. She actually loses all her shit over a slip of the tongue, fucking embarrassing.
---
Maybe
---
But everyone wont. Theres nice and new people and you are participating in ripping them off by selecting need if you dont talk to them. If they dont know "that's how it is" they will have to get taken advantage of until someone tells then or they decide to join in with the Needing.
---
Everyone is telling you no. I am gonna say yes. 
---
I have no problems healing on my restroDruid. She’s 33 now. People rarely die and res during combat? Awesome! 
---
I have a 46 pally tank too! She’s awesome and I had a Druid heal our ulda runs no problem. 
---
No one is gonna tell you no unless they are an asshole or you are too low.
---
Go for it!
---
find a place, as in will they be wanted in a raid (which answered, so thanks :) )
---
Awesome! Looking forward to it, all hopefully with Horde as main characters ;)
---
&gt;considering how useless mages without mana are
---
This is exactly why a mage can reset if they don't get the correct crits to kill something and why it's super frustrating to duel a competent mage.
---
&gt; I assumed they would "reset" by having one sheep the other, evocate/bandage, then attack, with a huge mana advantage.
---
This is correct. They can just poly and get a full reset. They can even delay a duel to get back CD's if needed but this can work against them since the other person is also getting CD's back.
---
I'd love to see this fully completed with all the islands and Northrend.
---
Mage uses slow fall blink

Retail players:

Classic players: God.. holy shit
---
You were confusing layers with capacity and I'm still not sure if you understand that they're completely independent of each other. I kinda glossed over what you're saying because it's confusing me.
---
No one can predict the future and I haven't seen anyone say blizzard will definitely lower or raise capacity. The only fact is that they will reduce layers to 1 by phase 2 at the latest. That does not indicate if they will lower capacity or not.
---
also:
---
&gt;I've never said that A means B.
---
&gt;They literally opened more layers on some servers to reduce queue times, so this is entirely false.
---
So you actually did say A means B. You're contradicting yourself so i'm confused where you're confused, is the problem.
---
UnNice.
---
Unless you're pugging it(I don't really recommend), you'll have a raid/class leader who can answer these kinds of questions to suit their vision of how the raid should go.
---
Just make the bars smaller, you can pull up the template in interface options to test it out.
---
Sure they can same with palys. It's a waste. And I've seen palys with epic mounts already
---
&gt; No assumptions here, he was told to tank when OP responded to a LF DPS.
---
Yes, he was told to tank, as in "you're either tanking or you're not in this group", that's asking if the person is willing to tank.
---
Generally the tank sets the pace, but other than that, no.
---
Did you actually get 8/8 already without abusing the layers in raids previously? Just seems incredibly unlikely
---
If you have a second or third place BiS item and one of the only upgrades in the game that you can get is a BoE and it drops, that is even MORE lucky and that person deserves it even more. 
---
Who knows what the greedy person would get with the gold, the point is that the game already randomly rolled when it decided what gear to drop. If it is an upgrade for you, it is your lucky day! If it isn't then it is someone else's lucky day. If more than 1 person would equip it, they can roll for it. If noone would equip it, then everyone can greed roll for the chance to sell it. But the person who's was lucky enough to have the game drop something amazing for them, shouldn't have to also be lucky enough to with a roll against 4 other people that just want gold. There is no reason to add that extra layer of random luck into it. At that point why not roll best 2 out of 3? lol
---
Well except when you have 3 or 4 road groups invading ironforge
---
I have run into a couple of people that I would love to put on this list, so thank you.
---
I don't care as much about campers (yet) simply because I'm a rogue and can get away pretty much always, but you can't get away from your own faction, particularly when the people are around your same level.
---
People who jokingly pulled groups of mobs to intentionally wipe a group 2 times in a long dungeon, which then resulted in probe having to revive, then leave and repair, then come back, all of which took about 45 minutes for example...
---
taunt only brings your threat to the top of the list +1 and keeps the mob focused to you during the debuff, so taunting a mob you already have agro on does nothing.
---
By "not the highest" you mean down on par with the tank and shadow priest?
---
1 guy is not fucking up your raid. Rag was downed by a non-level 60 raid.   
---
Its not the enh shaman.
---
One gold is the same as any other. If it's something a guy can use, I'm happy to let him have it.
---
No, but your arguments are not based on any rational thinking.

---
I too wish that I didn't need to have this macro on my action bar.
---
I literally outlined the very obvious difference between the value of a BoE via auction and the nonexistent value of a BoP via vendor. Calm down.
---
This is a really nood question by why isn’t my pet holding aggro?
---
Did you equip the item immediately and let them inspect?
---
Still seem rather stupid.
---
afk = a free kill
---
ok, that's amazing. I was wondering wtf a lvl 6 Alliance was doing in Durotar
---
Frankly they are playing the game and asked nothing of you, you are the beggar trying to get food/water on the cheap. Yet they are the entitled ones? You seriously lack situational awareness.
---
I give free food/water and set up a port to my instance group party. Just like locks port their party members. What I hate is entitled people who open a random trade window with me while im standing in a city and just PM me and say "food"
---
Game is dead in another 6 months. Who cares.
---
You still get exp until the quests are grey. Classes like warrior and rogue usually have to quest a level or two behind. However in a quest drought you take what you can get.
---
That's hot.
---
You’re clearly the only angry person here, and you can’t see beyond the system they gave us a general template, fully acknowledging that players have the mental ability to use said system in the most ideal way possible.
---
Know what’s ideal? Avoiding people ninjaing something because everyone else greeded.
---
Know what’s also ideal? Selling a twink item for a lot of gold rather than someone taking it as an upgrade to replace and vendor it a level later. 
---
If you can’t think beyond “omg it says need and greed,” you really are just naive and irrational.
---
Even doing only quests wouldnt be that bad. If he starts getting underleveled just throw a dungeon run in there or swap to another zone for a bit. Killing mobs on the way to and from quests help too. Im sure if you guys play together for a bit and you help him he will catch up in no time. Worse case scenario imo is he is a couple levels behind and you focus on professions for a day or 2 to let him catch up.
---
GL on the grind fam.
---
I agree with all of this, but I think there could be a place for lfg for old content only. It can be hard to find groups for old content. On the other hand, maybe that would be less of a problem if there was no sharding and everyone on a server could always connect with each other.
---
ah fearward yeah. very smart.
---
She is not the next bad guy
---
I feel like in retail there is a huge world, but 90% of that world is irrelevant. That's what bothers me the most. They would have to find a way to make the whole world relevant again.
---
But not through level scaling, that which makes the players progress irrelevant again. 
---
Remake the whole world again to be much more cohesive. So many changes come to mind. It's not gonna happen.
---
Also reintroduce that tasty rpg elements in some form. Talents, crazy ways to itemize your character, i'm not listing everything, you get the gist.

EDIT: Do people not realize that a gold windfall by selling a BoE that you earned while playing a group can also lead to an upgrade for you? Seriously, just because it's not a hard upgrade for you doesn't mean you can't turn it into an upgrade for yourself. BoEs are *potential upgrades* for everyone.
---
Bottom line: establish loot rules before the run. If you don't trust the group or loot rules weren't established, roll need and tell everyone else to do the same. These people will tell you that's not how the system was set up, and they are right 100%. What they don't understand is that people on the Internet... wait for it, this is going to be shocking... *don't follow the rules when the stakes are higher than normal.*
---
Nope, just a normal addon that puts a bar across the top with various stats like: empty bag slots, zone text &amp; coords, xp earned til lvl, gold earned/hr, etc.
---
Warlocks are OP and really hard to kill in 1v1. Their leveling is super easy and you can solo elite mobs.
---
Probably still best to need on BoEs to sell. 
---
A BoE you sell for your mount helps you get your mount, and helps someone else buy a BoE they really need. 
---
Two people benefit and the market becomes more liquid and makes items accessible. 
---
Equipping a BoE outright is less effective, and gets muuuch less effective if it’s not a BiS. 
---
BiS is probably the only time it’s best for someone to need and equip a BoE.
---
There's a difference between a port that costs money/resources to the creator and food/water that just cost a click. It's the equivalent of a priest not wanting to heal somebody
---
Blizz explained how their version of dynamic spawns works. If other people are clearing mobs that you can see it makes it quicker for similar mobs to spawn around you. Sometimes it'll be right on top of you
---
I mean, he can turn around and sell it for 99g properly now, so it's giving the guy a cut for being nice.
---
I must be fucking garbage at the game because I'm at 11 days /played and am level 53.
---
2 Questions:
---
Why would you want loot distribution to reward laziness and greed?
---
Why would you want loot distribution to reward intentionally slowing down the dungeon run?
---
By chance are you on said council? 😅
---
These people don't get it. They can't see past their "tHe GrEeD bUtToN iS a PiEcE oF gOlD" logic. The system was obviously intended to work as they would advocate. But it's not the way it is used when Edgemaster's Handgaurds drop during a run with a bunch of people you don't know. And if you're naive enough to not protect yourself and everyone else against it, then you will get an item ninjad. Not to mention that the gold windfall from selling a BoE can lead to an upgrade for someone else, who has *just as much right to the item as you* because they were part of the group.
---
If you haven't established loot rules and don't trust your group to follow them, roll need to avoid being taken advantage of, and tell your party to do the same.
---
Nah that makes me feel worse. Guy was such hot garbage he had to have his big buddy bail him out with some extra damage control.
---
It does
---
Shit boys, he called me a boomer, we got a badass here.
---
You’ll figure it out one day champ.
---
Definitely slow when it comes to WF.
---
If you're willing to put in a little work you can make of copy of this spreadsheet posted on the shaman discord: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RftXKBZ5_zq2X9jnv-WYFS3aTTJinILwbjEJ3-HuWKk/edit#gid=0
---
Just unsubscribe.
---
nope!
---
you cant BoP people that are not in your party
---
I misread the stats on this trinket. 
---
Thought it was flat 2% hit percentage, not that extra swing.  Sorry dude. Could see how that would be better for warriors and rogues.
---
yes indeed =)
---
The first group I joined as a healer, I asked for water and got 3 from the mage in the party. I really wanted to say something but I was thankful for what I got.
---
The fact that you don't see many others should just be more encouragement to play one! Warlocks are great, and they're often under-represented (especially on the Alliance side). I just rerolled from hunter to warlock myself. Warlock is what I played in vanilla, and is the class I consider to be "my class". So nice to be back!
---
Champ? Cmon bro, surely you can be more cringe than that. Channel your inner boomer I believe in you
---
Are you on Atiesh by chance? This happened in the MC group my friend was in the other day.
---
Walk back it’s not the end of the world
---
Orgrimar Gates looking THICC as Fel.
---
&gt;Or, server transfers rebalanced people and not everyone is no-lifing it 24/7  
---
I saw almost 0 difference in Q times for my server (shazzrah) during transfer time. The realm they made to transfer from shazzrah was always on low pop.  
---
People choose big servers for a reason and they are not moving.
---
When tho? Only time is when you have CC and you can't predict the bounce. And that's pretty rare.  Normally if you have CC its going to be done on the pull so you don't have to worry about where it's going to bounce
---
Kurinaxx is where it's at. Bring your guild to gurubashi so I can fuck them
---
I think it used to give more informative error messages, though. Like "You need to be in a raid".
---
I discovered it doesn't handle negative numbers, I decided to try some conditional formatting whiuch works great but appears unsupported in Google sheets.  
---
I'll link you a version I've put in Excel online later.
---
Something tells me I could easily beat these trained professionals...
---
&gt;Any reasonable person can look at the two videos and say okay that's roughly the same situation, same area, same amount of players, but video B has 10x the input lag.
---
imagine looking at something this different claiming it's the same and then calling me biased lol.
---
Im done with this conversation.  bye
---
This^ I’m arms and trying to hold out for bre/spinal before I switch to dw fury . Which based on pugs already and our guild schedule should be quite feasible for me
---
I’m currently trying to make a macro for mount dispel and then cast and I can’t get it to work. I want one button that will dismount me and cast a spell like holy fire on a target any suggestions?
---
Just to clarify, the 'threat value' they list in the chart is on top of the threat caused by damage, right?
---
So Revenge max rank does  355 + about 100, for a total of 455, and Shield slam does  250 + about 350 for a total of 600, making it the highest threat ability available?
---
What I cant stand is that the people using the gold logic won't ever reply to a comment that uses correct logic. All these need for gold people need to change their comments to, "I am greedy and just want the gold from the item."
---
0.5 tier is class locked as well.
---
Just made a warrior. Level 30. I've done maybe 10 dungeon runs, and on 4 of them they asked if I would tank it. 
---
Man, I don't carry around a shield and I have purchased 0 tank abilities.
---
Check my history, I've also said I'd happily give it to a stranger that needed it. I mentioned friend because that's best case scenario. 
---
&gt;Reading is hard
---
That's ok, you'll always have coloring books.
---
I play for gear, thats actual loot. Not a mount that means nothing if I already have my epic lol. 
---
You're pathetic dude.
---
I go most dungeons with premade friends. Lots of melees but at least I dont have to xkmpete for gear. Have to run enverything infinitely for them tho
---
And on boss fights you should always use multishot on cooldown
---
It’s not the same at all actually! 
---
If you need on an item and vendor it, then only you benefitted by getting gold. 
---
If you need on an item and sell it to another player, then you benefit by getting gold, AND the other player gets that shiny item that they’ve worked so hard for. 
---
This isn’t even including that the use value of BoPs is MUCH higher than the use value for BoEs. It is a waste therefore to sell BoPs.
---
The opposite applies to BoEs, which are worth more gold than they are worth in use value. It is a waste therefore to use BoEs for leveling.
---
 /logic'd
---
Im sorry that happened to you but I dont really see where anyone did anything against any rules or illegal, there was this EXACT risk that you very clearly were aware of, you had people checking multiple places in the world, doing /who and other things, in preperation for the exact situation so you knew good and well what COULD happen.  Im sorry man but this will hurt to hear. 
---
Blizzard is not going to do anything, you posted these on the AH and got sniped, its simply a very unfortunate outcome for you but a very fortunate one for someone else, this person is the exact opposite of what you are, hes not really in the wrong. 
---
Again, im sorry for the loss, truly.
---
YES!!
---
How much damage difference are we talking in being decked out in full T1 set vs being fully decked out in preraid BiS items?
---
I noticed Nvidia had an update recently.  Maybe that? I didn't install it.
---
Are you checking your latency?
---
You're mistaking Gandling with 2 different bosses. A strategy is to not go straight for them and aggro the entire room.
---
AFAIK, you can summon between wings if you summon within the instance, as they all share the same instance zone location (all 4 are the same instances, just not connected together)
---
Popular demand, it seems.
---
I guess you could say...
---
Chill!
---
I’m not saying it is. I’m just saying that’s the general consensus. I’ve actually been refused dungeon groups because I’m a bear!
---
Nononono. Read a couple comments above you
---
With the amount of people using auction addons that will automatically undercut the lowest price I have been putting certain items up up at a significantly lower price than market value.
---
People will then post more auctions undercutting me and I buy them all out. Easy money.
---
yea, but "a fish" is not
---
60 mage - 4g
---
Easy way to remember it is it came when they added the profession Inscription. Get it they write on paper and at that same time we learned how to write enchants on paper. xD
---
&gt; The timeline doesn't add up  
---
Yes it does. First month ended less than a week ago.
---
How do clearly defined need/greed rules reward laziness and greed, or slow down dungeon runs?
---
BIG. DICK. DPS.
---
It could be that you now have access to modern graphics controls and simulations. The water for example is much more realistic and taxing in classic than the private servers. The same can probably be said for particle effects and weather which may also be slowing you down.
---
I'd definitely start with Feralas. Hinterlands most revantusk village quests are 48-50.
---
Plus a feralas quest leads to hinterlands (the muisek one)
---
Other options if not done yet would be Badlands, Southern/later quest chains STV, Swamp of Sorrows
---
Absolutely not the case but you keep pretending like you’re all angels lmao
---
Feel free to lay out your chain of logical conclusions that goes from 'I don't like when warlocks come unprepared and refuse to drink' to me being an egotistical diva
---
In Classic, even the trinket isn't a trinket against all.
---
I mean sure people quit but don't forget they also like doubled the server list and then left free transfers going for multiple weeks too.
---
Lol LF39M MC
---
Hahah! Actually no crashes, using CS6. The working file is like 1.6 gigs I think. I have to turn every layer off just to edit the text. It. Is. A. Monster. I have been working on it for like 2 months for like a few hours each week on my lunch breaks. It’s hard to pick this over playing the game. And there is always mistakes in it. Thanks for the kind words. It was so tedious but I’m very pleased with it. I just wanted a good WoW classic map worthy of printing.
---
lmao every group I’m in, every need rolls on BoEs. 
---
I haven’t had anyone throw a tantrum yet because they think they deserve the BoE cause they can get 1+ stamina at the cost of 600g. 
---
If they did, they’d probably get kicked by all the other annoyed group and raid members.
---
You can't be punished for killing members of the opposite faction unless you use an exploit to do so. Regardless of what it does to the other faction's economy.
---
Though I guess blizz sometimes steps in if it gets too bad, so maybe I'm wrong.
---
I'd go with VW until you start pulling aggro from him, then Succ.
---
Ayup.
---
Mage, officer and a RL here and my fellow officers like to joke that I might get a MB in half a year (We're LC, but super aware of how corrupt they can appear and so are taking some steps to alleviate that). Hell, even an item like Arcanist Bindings is looking like a potential AH buy, if I want a pair anytime soon, should they ever get listed.
---
Whats funny is this morning I had a Rogue recruit complain about the competition on 1h swords versus warriors in raid, and here I am just thinking, "Dude, you're talking to a Mage, and I have to fight like 11-12 people for one item".
---
I did jarl needs eyes and karnitol shipwreck both in the past week. I also did mazens behest last week and can tell you it took 3 times as long as either of those.
---
In addition to what other people have said there is also a few mining and herb nodes to farm which add to the gold per hour.
---
like 130spellpower. But I ofc only use t1 in world farm / PvP
---
I  have heard that mages can solo it.
---
Imo everyone should roll need on expensive BoE regardless of an upgrade or not. Ive had too many people roll need on something that’s not an upgrade and not even equip it for some unknown reason.
---
I am a casual by comparison, but one day will cap all the jobs! FF has the best integration of crafting and economy of any MMO I have played. The dungeon and raid gear is better but because much of that gear is non-trivial to acquire the crafted items have value. Good design.
---
I legit love just kicking back and cycling poses  and taking screen shots in different gear.
---
I can't afford housing, I don't play often enough,  but even guild housing is nice and it felt like I was contributing even with limited play time.
---
I see some similarities between LOTRO(pre-F2P) and FF. Not visually or mechanically obviously, but scale and scope. Big world's with big stories that drive you through them. Crafting and economy before the Moria expansion was alot like FF. As ugly as the models are, the dungeons and raids were good. FF housing is very similar to LOTRO. Anyway tangent. Go.
---
I just totally spaced it. I had been running around questing for days, and had filled my quiver up like last week. 
---
Now I'm wondering if there's an add-on that consistently shows how much ammo you have over the bag slot. The number disappears every so often normally.
---
Everyone saw Leeroy and now has an innate fear of going in that room.  I remember in Vanilla only getting to fight that guy like once because no one dared risk popping all the eggs.
---
I have been working on that mountain lion quest for ages and I just get royally fucked up every time. I'm level 23, I get murked by alliance anywhere from 40-60. It sucks, but it's contested territory so it's expected.
---
&gt; Like you said, "we don't know if they reduced pop cap" so why are you speculating as if it's probable they did?
---
Because it's likely that they rolled back the pop cap increases they made in the first couple days.
---
&gt; Private servers had pop caps much higher than vanilla
---
And they felt different for it.
---
Different kind of head shot
---
Edit: I see you are on Kromcrush - we are 50/50 split with the horde in total numbers. Doesn’t mean that there arn’t more horde in one area at one time.
---
Nearly all PvP is ganking.  The struggle is to be the one who ganks.  Some people enjoy that; I really don't.
---
I'll continue being pathetic with my ultra rare loot and you continue being retarded with... what? Oh, right. A warm fuzzy feeling. LOL.
---
Yep, even if you turn all the extra stuff off, just being able to open the map and see available quests and what level will help you out alot.
---
I mean, it was a real memorial. A real memorial for a real person who died in real life, held in virtual space. It would be roleplaying if they were holding a funeral for her character.
---
Check the links in my main comment.I have 3 file sizes. Surely 15mb is small enough.
---
It’s not tHat bad when you never experienced cable. Used to play Counter-Strike on dial-up, and it looks fine on my side. Everyone else felt like they are playing with a ninja coz I be skipping on the screen.
---
I've already experienced that and can/will take it like an adult
---
\- rdruid ms took painweaver band for OS.  Other's rolled too ofc but I was #2 roll
---
\- prot war (confirmed ms as he mt's for a friends guild) took bis helm off ghost in strath
---
if you want to make it so you aren't sharing weapon drops one of you can go combat swords other goes sub daggers.
---
the sword combat guy will be your "tank" and the sub rogue will do ambush / backstab.
---
or you can just both go sub daggers that way your stealth / movement speed is the same.
---
&gt; the player that COULD use the item, should in some cases, but theyre going to sell it anyway.
---
Obviously not, because that's not the scenario the OC laid out.
---
Dang reading comprehension is hard, eh? Boomed me.
---
Mageblade is priority for Mages in your raid?
---
I would encourage you to make a simple /cancelform macro and bind it to a key (I use e) and get used to canceling your form with that.  Then set all your forms to power shift macros now.  Relearning it later on will be much tougher.
---
if it means anything, i’m pretty sure warlock doesn’t compete with warrior/mage/rogue until later tiers.
---
I will need that fadeleaf and swiftthistle. For free.
---
Well you've linked your twitch channel about 3-4 times now in these comments so I guess it doesn't work.
---
MAGE LF SPELLCLEAVE GROUP 420K XP/HR
---
The prebc patch had 41pt talents tho
---
Sorry if my parenthetical mislead you, I only meant it as a way to tell that it is a single instance not that the other indicators that it is a single instance don’t exist. Yes, you would be able to summon between the different wings of SM without problem, you are right.
---
Just level the way you like. I'm levelling a Pala with protection build. As long as you have fun.
---
All the big name Twitch streamers like Shroud or w/e have left the Classic hype train.
---
Maybe if you didnt force people who need the item to compete with you, youd be in a group right now and not on reddit defending being a ninja. Once one person rolls need, now everyone has to. You're a problem player.
---
&gt; But stormwind tho*
---
Obsolete.  Badly laid out.  Poorly located for end game anything.  Visit occasionally, home in IF.
---
You cannot keep aggro if youre dps isnt willing you let you have aggro, you can theorycraft to get some extra threat as much as you want but its not in your hand.
---
Does anyone else love getting as high as possible before they play?
---
Well the value here is outside of gold value. IE I think you can at least agree that say the value of a melee weapon for a warrior or rogue is greater than the value of a staff to a mage? Some people will tell you that getting a weapon from a dungeon adventure inherently makes it more valuable than buying it from an auction house.
---
You can also make arguments that the gold prices in the auction house are not good representations of the value of an item.  An Item's value  and its AH value is not the same. Some times items simply aren't easily found on the AH as well. 
---
I'm not looking to argue you out of your position because I don't think I can but these are some of the arguments you could make about why everyone need on BOE isn't exactly fair in all situations.
---
I think 
---
/castsequence !Shoot, !Shoot 
---
Would make it so if you're standing it will continue to cast, but if you move it will deactivate on it's own. Not really sure tho
---
Lol, I never ask for stam buffs so if they buff me I buff back. You miss the point he is begging and upset that people will not just give him shit. So take your flawed argument and shove it, idiot.
---
As a warrior who hates tanking, maybe if every time something went wrong people didn't spam nasty whispers or type "Ugh can you actually *try* to tank?"
---
I've had DPS run ahead get 4 mobs on them while we were already in a pull, then run away and die and wonder why a warrior 3 levels under them in classic with very **VERY** few AoE argo abilities wasn't able to get all the new mobs to agro on them
---
Or I can be an awesome DPS and not have to worry about any of that shit
---
I tank for guildies but tanking for randoms suuuuucks. There's a reason no one wants to tank. It's toxic af
---
Well, his roll is his roll; you have no control over that. You were going to use it, so rolling need was fine.
---
Any plans of making this a purchasable poster?  I'd buy in a second.
---
Well I mean, who doesnt want batman lol. Trust me I woulda said batman if it fit!
---
I am not known for structuring my sentences, so well.
---
You don't need to be good in large scale pvp, you just need to push buttons.
---
This warrior didn't even push many buttons, they mostly just jumped around.(not altogether useless since they were the first one in and moving around breaks LOS)
---
Meaning two war rolling on fury shit, while also a rogue/hunter; all MS. 3 people sharing at least if not 4.   
---
Of course. I kick the fury war, keep the one tanking, and get a clothie. Then the fury comes to bitch here.
---
&gt; Layering is going to have a long term negative effect on the economy with all the abuse
---
it will have long term effect, but not too bad as it was really only the first month it got to be abused
---
will settle out long term hopefully
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ORL-CpNVFzc this is a Shadow Priest soloing it naked so I’m sure Holy with gear on will be absolutely fine.
---
You're free to not tank, just as they're free to ask. Just saying "you're going to tank" is obviously not OK.
---
In my experience, there are *way too many* Warriors that refuse to tank while leveling.
---
You're a Warrior. You're levelling. You're not end-game equipped, there's nothing significant that's separating you from any other Warrior (the tank class).
---
The only possible issues are:
---
* not wearing mail/plate
---
* not buying any prot/tank-related skills
---
* not having a 1h/shield
---
If you're under lvl 50 and you fall into all 3 of those categories, then you better get used to this coming up in every pub you join. Keeping a 1h/shield in the bank and buying level 1 taunt/revenge etc skills are cheap and simple to do. You're just shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Pretty much. When tanking shield slam is easily the highest single target threat generating ability you have. It beats sunder armor and revenge by a lot. Especially if your shield slam is a crit, that's like 3-4 times sunder armor worth of threat.
---
If you want to have raiders in your guild you're going to have to raid as a guild. No real way around that tbh
---
I’m not your friend, buddy!
---
yea, I know, sometimes you cant be positive which way it will bounce, and better safe then sorry.
---
You're missing my point. I'm stating that these "baby on board" stickers are used by people who have no idea what the original purpose of it is, because its one of those little pieces of pop culture we've had since the 80s (i think the 80s). Stating my statement was false...... was false because people DO buy them for reasons that have nothing to do with safety.
---
I'm not saying your reason isn't also a thing...... just that a lot of people have no concept of that and do it for other reasons.
---
Another dumb question im sure but do you have to press growl or bind it or does the pet do it automatically?
---
Oh Jesus Christ, what if the person is a ghost in real life and doesn’t need WoW.  If someone is a Tailor and doesn’t have that recipe, he gets to need.  I’ve played WoW for 15 years, run thousands of groups, and I’ve never seen a single person intentionally under equip so that they could roll on something.  I’ve never heard of it, not one single time, ever.
---
 You having these bizarre, one off situations doesn’t change anything.  Just be honest, say you think you’re special and the rules don’t apply to you, and move on.  You won’t have to spend so much time typing these long winded rants we all see through.
---
Was just an obvservation mate. One of the top posts on this sub is about how Asmon is playing Classic "wrong" for taking donations from viewers. CDew proceeds to get 3k+ gold in donations and crafts a legendary mace 1 hour after getting the RNG drop. Even after he equipped it he was still taking money from random viewers. Why was it so wrong when Asmongold does it then?
---
There’s not enough bank space to warrant hording herbs
---
That's awesome, sorry for doubting i just know a lot of people abused it.  Tons of people like me have done 3 full MC's and only have 1 or 2 pieces tops and are jelly lol
---
Just like every other wow youtuber. They are too busy playing wow to make youtube videos lol.
---
Is rec a friend benefits even possible in classic?
---
Blameux server, everyone follows need/greed properly for all BoP items.  All BoE items are ALL NEED in every single group I've ever played, whether one of the classes can actually use it or not.  And in 90% of the cases it's the tank that yells ALL NEED, immediately.
---
If Phase 2 doesn't come out soon, it's gonna shrink real fast.
---
I play on Old Blanchy! No one wonder there were so many people at the SW AH last night.
---
I strongly believe that greeding on extremely precious items worth hundreds of gold is not the right thing to do. Everyone NEEDS gold. Nobody is entitled to an item worth 500-1000 gold just because they play a certain spec or have a certain proffession. You don't deserve a free freezing band (500g) over anyone else because you decided to roll a mage or feral tank instead of a paladin.
---
&gt; Mage vs Mage duels can literally go for 20+ minutes straight if they're both playing well.
---
lol.
---
In order to change your spec you have to visit a class trainer and have them undo your talents. This has an increasing cost (that decays over time) capping at 50G per respec. Your spec is your spec.
---
That being said, druids are interesting. They have a number of good hybrid specs that allow them to heal and tank decent. As well, any dedicated feral tank spec is going to be like 90-95% of a feral dps spec.
---
Also, unlike current WoW you have a lot more class abilities. With my current spec I'm going to have all of 3 active abilities come from my talent choices. I still have access to a full suite of bear and cat abilities, all the heals, balance spells, and utility spells.
---
stare at the floor? as a tank i spent alot of time staring at the boss groin area. sometimes with my back against the wall.
---
Yes you can, it is recommended if you want another race’s mount also
---
Heal the tank mainly. Throw a shield and HoT on anyone else taking damage. Wand mobs to try to get spirit tap to trigger.
---
I've healed dungeons up to lvl 30 and had to drink maybe 3 times using this rotation.
---
Threat shouldn't be an issue. If I ever pull aggro I just run in front of the tank so he is aware, and then back behind the crowd once I lose the aggro.
---
Oh, also, STAMINA BUFFS FOR EVERYONE!!!
---
As far as I know theyre not implementing RF. I could be wrong. With that being said you can still do the starting zone quest in any of the zones you're just going to have to run.
---
elaborate?
---
Seems like half the mages on my server are spamming "FREE FOOD/WATER. TIPS APPRECIATED" and making a decent chunk of change that way.
---
It's just to get initial aggro on the scarabs since they are yellow.
---
I wouldn't be taunting a mob thats still on me, it would be a DPS tearing it away from me (Hunter example.)
---
I don’t think OP knows what Bambi Is.
---
So, you are saying your 60 main can be beat by a 52 rogue?
---
Lol blaze it
---
&gt;people are going to inevitably act in their self interests
---
Which means, being selfish pricks. Thank you for confirming that.
---
&gt;all I want is a way for EVERYONE in the group to have a FAIR shot at an item
---
If there is nobody in the group for whom the item would be an upgrade, then by all means. But I will always put those who will actually benefit from equipping and actually using the item before those who want to turn a quick buck. And if they think they should be entitled to roll on it anyway then yes, they are selfish pricks.
---
&gt;a bunch of white knighters who are stuck on this antiquated system
---
This is WOW **Classic**, not Retail, so talking about antiquated is kind of funny, first of all. Second, if being honorable and having the good of the group in mind are "antiquated", then I'm glad I stepped away from hardcore raiding before that kind of toxic thinking could become mainstream.
---
Your position is simply untenable. I understand what you're trying to defend, but you truly can't without admitting that you don't give a shit about anyone but yourself.
---
I believe so. But it probably takes just as long for, say, a ham to run to the NE starting land than it does to just level up to westfall and meet there instead
---
Yes. You may have to travel back for class quests. But the level 1 quests will be available for any zone
---
If you’re 60 and die to a 52 rogue,  I don’t have sympathy.
---
Yes, but sometimes the distance from A B might be very close as the difference from A C.  Sometimes its not worth the risk.
---
solution to that is merge the low-pop servers together so that the economics of the two realms merged more closely matched each other
---
Why? People with a basic understanding of economics not allowed in wow?

**edited added mouseover and target priority**
---
Ah ok thx
---
With this logic, it might be only you in the group that will roll need, because someone will try to ninja it. And with this, it is you who'll become the ninja looter
---
Sapper is Goblin Sapper Charge, crafted grenade like item from engineering. The whole raid in this video is using one and it helps immensely in situations like these. It blasts around you for around 500-750 damage, when 40 people use this at the same time in middle of 100 horde, you can imagine how fast they die. And ofc usually you wont be specced into holy nova, but if you are in a minmax guild like this, they will respec for PvP events just to pump out more aoe damage. Any aoe helps to be honest, and it also heals your allies
---
The guy got 10g for being nice. The original seller now will get 89g profit if he sells it for 99g

Since shoot is a cast you could add

In front of all your spells but you still have global cooldown to deal with.  I added it in front of my drain soul macro to stop wanding and start channeling but I still need to hit it twice to get it to go.  
---
There seems to be a timing component involved so you could try an addon like [WeaponSwingTimer](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weaponswingtimer).  It has a wand bar but I didn't bother to learn how to use it optimally.
---
You too
---
&gt; Animal forms are the order you learn them
---
Are you joking? Is this why my Aquatic Form is shittily placed forever second on the form bar instead of Cat Form? What a stupid fucking system. I had to install a UI mod *just* to reposition it.
---
Continuing to prove the point^
---
There is literally nothing to do at 60 but farm instances or farm gold/tradeskill mats. I really hope that Phase 2 is coming sooner than later.
---
noone needs a full month, in faqct the fact that any group has a special date means they are still an other and not just a regular part of society. which should me the goal for any marginalized group, to become a mundane part of society, tolerated and accepted.
---
I bet you don't even pop full consumes in raid and your obsessing over 20 AP.
---
Yeah it's pretty great to be a druid from a world pvp standpoint.  You have stealth and track humanoids, which means you rarely get caught in an enemy ambush.  Most world pvp encounters will be started on your own terms
---
I just call it the BFM: Big Fucking Murloc.
---
Yes you can. It might be harder to run from one starting area than others. Dwarves and gnomes, orcs and trolls start in the same area.
---
Beware that undead and night elves start far away from other races starting zones.
---
Remove titanforging and random casino loot drops. I want to be able to farm my best gear and know it's the best possible version of that item.
---
&gt; There were some seriously pissed off people who created problems in their own mind.
---
They ended up being wrong, but they didn't create the problem in their own mind.
---
Taking a single item worth 200g-1000g on the AH is *vastly* different from rolling need on *every single item* so that you can vendor it.
---
I forgot about that limit
---
And my point is that in any group where you haven't discussed beforehand, you're likely to find most people believing they're supposed to roll greed.
---
Knowing that...if you roll need "to avoid the ninja", you will often become the ninja.
---
Unless your intent is to then have everyone reroll?...you are the ninja in that scenario.
---
Therefore the only correct answer is to establish loot rules.  There is no other correct answer.
---
yes. also don't forget to multiply by 1.30 if youre in D stance, or 1.495 if you're in D stance with 5/5 Defiance.
---
Yes, always.
---
tanking requires a little bit of thought and game knowledge/dungeon knowledge and some people are not comfortable doing that leadership role as you said, they set the pace.  Some people want to face roll buttons and do damage mindlessly.
---
Hax
---
The problem I see is that Ninjas are going to Need.  It's going to be a risk every time for a BoE to be Ninja'd unless you personally know everyone in the group.
---
Rolling Need at least gives a chance the Ninja doesn't get it.  If it became a norm, then no one would accidentally roll Greed and find some punk shit steal it with a Need just to sell it like everyone else in the group would.
---
And you'll definitely get kicked within the first minutes, because contrary to BoEs which have equal value to everyone in the group, BoPs you can't use have much less value to you than to someone that can use them.
---
The worst is when they stop because they see you drinking, but you need to rebuff int and/or make a new mana gem so you stand up and BOOM tank pulls while you are back to 20% or less mana.
---
They weren't rumours. Blizzard stated that they were higher population.
---
I've played a mage forever and my rule has always been free for group members and 1/2 vendor price (based on what level food/water) if some random wants my vending machine services. They get cheap water (often without having to travel back to own out in the wild) and I get a little something for providing a service.
---
A+
---
Bizzare, one of, specific, sure.
---
But name a single downside with all rolling need.
---
You can kill the lower level deviate mobs outside the instance for them as well. I usually just grind them until I finish if I don't plan to run it again. Watch out for the oozes, they don't drop them and will duplicate at low health.
---
"They thought we didn't! But we did! Now die!"
---
I don’t think so, also you can always level in any zone, you just have to run your happy level 1 ass all the way there lol and by “any” I mean “any starting zone for your faction”
---
They'll just turn on layering for the AQ event.
---
Buy bags bruh, most essential use of gold besides mounts
---
Spirit of Aquementas is BiS I think. More spell damage the better, cos no offhands are available with hit/crit yet.
---
People literally do sit for hours at the AH with the scanner running. You can make 100s of gold while only clicking buy once every few minutes.
---
That's amazing, I was thinking about doing something like this but I don't think I could have managed to make it as good as that
---
&gt; grilled squids
---
raw ones go for maybe 60s
---
i play Shaman dude lol, it's just funny seeing some warrior mix in with some r/iamverysmart get angry when someone tells them the reality that Classic Mass PvP is quiet literally who can bring the most mages. 
---
Every season player will tell you this and they all joke about how much of a joke and unenjoyable a large scale battle like that is because it's always 100% that have all the impact.
---
Asmon, Soda, Staysafe, Tipsout, Moonmoon, Cdew, Payo.
---
Name it they'll all say the same. Mages are the ones to dominate it. 
---
Also, do be a douch going around saying "Don't bother confirming, i already know" when you feel your own words have no weight.
---
Damn Alliance &amp; their wilful murder of innocent Horde members
---
Yikes, If only you where this worked up about real Issues.
---
Have you considered the rules apply to me as well meaning people wouldn't be passing on the stuff I could use?
---
Instant. It's not even humanly sustainable to click the buyout button every 0.05 seconds for hours on end anticipating that one accidental post. Yes you can buyout quick. But not instantly. That's evidence of an auto click application.
---
I've also never seen a feral druid who refuses to tank and only does cat form dps.
---
I went with a boar and turn growl on for solo. I like the dash ability. And he eats everything, so no worries about food.
---
Because they made the decision to farm the item rather than buy it. Which you can do for your stuff too. But.... nope. Its money. Its greed. You can try to justify it in anyway it's still flawed.

Hey, jackass, you’re literally the reason retail wow sucks. Get off classic. You can’t handle it, clearly.

Elvui had healcomm included in its libraries a few updates ago.

And when you say something it's always excuses (I'm not logged in reddit on pc, it's easier on my phone, it's too complicated on pc)

You could download sharex so that when you hit prtscn it will pop up asking you if you want to upload to reddit and you hit yes and it'll open the window for you to a blank post with the image there. Seriously takes 5 mins to set up and there on out you can upload in 5 secs.

But I don't want to install it! Prt scn alt tab upload to reddit, it's just as fast, just log in it's not hard
---
Not an overreaction at all. I state my unfiltered opinion, no need to be political correct or nice on reddit. Welcome to the internet. And once again you are not reading. I am in a guild, I am in a very fun and social guild. No one cares about min axing, no one is forcing me to do anything, we are all helping each other and we are being nice. We are levelling exploring, and role-playing. You are entitled for forcing people to play your way, you are entitled for making people farm/wear gear they do not want to. You are the one forcing your will on others, and this su reddit is filled with people like you. It's your way, or you're a noob and an entitled shit.
---
And what's with your other assumption, I will not be getting this gear? Do you even realize what you are saying, or are you another 15 year old who thinks the world revolves around him. You sound like a piece of shit, and are offended by my opinion.

---
well, sort of
---
I think the hard push to 60 is what kept servers full
---
there is still a lot to do in the game outside of raiding
---
PVP, economy stuff, social with friends, killing shit for fun, hunting rares, etc
---
it's just that getting to 60 ASAP means you get more raid lockouts before phase 2, so you really wanted to cram in the play-time to get to 60
---
once your raid locked there is a lot less pressure to be on, so you can play more when you want to rather than 10+ hrs a day
---
Even bigger at 32 with Faerie fire(feral) and ferocious bite
---
I got lucky with a Warden Staff drop, and decided to sell it to a good friend.  We agreed on 250g and his Dark Whelping drop.  I'm really torn on whether I should keep it or sell it (the DW). 
---
What would something like that sell for back in the day? I've heard that due to the weird economy state the game is in right now, that people were buying and selling these between 10-30g.
---
If I held on to it, what is a reasonable price in a reasonable market it could sell for?  I don't need-need the money, as I have about 200g now and my friend still owes me 150g, so if 30g is all I could get, I'll probably keep it.. I dunno, thoughts?
---
No, someone lost money, money that is then fairly distributed among the party.
---
I submitted a ticket because I didn't receive credit for doing Jailbreak in BRD even though I started the quest for my group and no one died and everyone else in my party got credit. I got an automated response and was linked to wowhead. Its not a big deal because I got guildies to help me redo it but I was dissapointed with the poor CS.
---
Wow! Took lvl 60! Wow!
---
Some of the streamers are actually extremely good pvp players and won multiple official tourneys, like Cdew or Venruki. I think part of their popularity is because they're great pvpers. I personally don't watch streamers but thinking that all streamers are only in a good spot because of getting loot handed to them is way too generalized.
---
- older style skill/talent trees
---
- Bring back better class identity, 
---
- idk about others, but I really liked tier gear. Adds to the class identity part
---
- increase overall difficulty of the game
---
- stop RNG looting.
---
- probably more but cant think of them right now.
---
Paladins are definitely kill on sight.  Y'all are jerks.
---
I waited about 20 minutes. They never showed up. 4 40+s did though, and they indeed got revenge (plus murdered every other Horde they saw). Pretty sure those were just people answering the call of /3.
---
Depends on your guild. My guild isn't competitive in that we aren't pushing for server firsts or speed records. We're running nearly every meme spec in the game (ret/prot paladins, feral druid), and it's totally fine.
---
You can't farm BoEs, no.
---
His spawn location is back left in like the big graveyard part?
---
I'll do what was advertised and what I responded to. If I felt like tanking, I would respond to a LF tank request or make my own group. Same on my shaman, if I want to heal, I will join a group looking for a healer vice versa if I want to dps. It's fairly simple.
---
I'm not sure which is which, but I believe one scjool makes a bunch of gadgets, while the other creates consumables. The best option is to level the one that makes gadgets. Make all the gadgets, then drop, and do the other one because you can still use ghe gadgets
---
Otherwise, look at what both schools make and decide what recipes you want
---
What evidence do you have that people who buy it don’t know the purpose ?
---
Yes, we are so butthurt that you'll pass all the BoEs to us.
---
I have not seen a queue on grob since day 8.
---
Who? MIKE JOOONES
---
Omfg dude. I knew it was this video before clicking. I just knew it. I haven't seen this in 14 years and I died laughing. This is hilarious ahahaha
---
I literally know dogs that are able to distinguish between significant value differences better than you can. Think about that.
---
You sound like a typical redditor. There is absolutely no reason at all to take a druid over a priest or shaman.
---
Jesus Christ, this argument? you're on reddit right now moron.
---
And You have no idea what ninja looting is, Ill take people that need on BoE like normal sane people over whiny entitled morons like you any day.
---
tHeRe ArEn'T eNoUgH sKeLeToNs!!!
---
You didn’t play vanilla. Also, you’re wrong. Hope you learn your lesson by getting ninjad.
---
Good for you
---
I believe any of the rares can spawn in any of the rare spawn slots. You basically have to check the whole area to be sure.
---
Max levels should definitely one shot people with 10-20 levels less than them, just dumb if there isn't scaling.
---
Not necessarily disagreeing but as a rogue I find it easier to kill shamans then essentially any other class.
---
I suppose that is true, but I'm too horde to ever realize. :P
---
Lol, what?
---
PvP needs less rng and less nukes. It sure got old having someone proc a good azerite and kill you instantly.
---
There's a lot more shit to keep track of and do when playing (in pve)
---
Well yeah that's gamefreak for you.
---
They're notoriously sloppy and ass-backwards with weird solutions to problems.
---
Like, rather than storing one copy of a model on the cartridge and calling it each time it's needed they'd rather copy the same model to over a hundred different folders.
---
For gen 2 their code was so bloated and inefficient that when they tried to put in Kanto [the cartridge only had enough room left to fit a squished down caricature of it](https://tcrf.net/images/1/17/PokemonGS_Proto_Overworld_Map.png)---See that tiny ass road with two skyscrapers? That's what Celadon and Saffron were going to look like until Satoru Iwata unfucked their shit for them.
---
Hell, Pokemon X and Y could have ran at a clean, stable 30fps even during triple battles but those chose to use models that were insanely high detailed even though the screen wasn't good enough to show it, just because they wanted to be able to reuse the same models for the next decade and a half (similar to how they used Stadium 1's models in Stadium 2, Colosseum, XD, Battle Revolution, etc)
---
Yeah, he should stop being a good party member because you guys are glorifying ninja looting. OK
---
Don't mind me, just here to bitch about the abundance and convienience of FPs the horde gets.
---
I can smell the bodies.
---
Not with their follow macros. They'll notice and wait so as not to leave them behind.
---
You'll be able to get rage as DPS warrior if you're even remotely okay at the roll. Idk what you're talking about?
---
Whenever I'm lucky enough to be allowed to play DPS I'm routinely at the top %
---
It's a mathematical certainity, that by Having everyone need on all BoE, you are giving yourself more rolls, (at lower odds per roll), and reducing the chance that the person that would actually use the item (as opposed to selling it) would receive it.
---
It's more or less the same, really.
---
Id be beyond happy with 25s or something. I mean that is WAY less then what you would pay for water/mana drinks at a vendor!
---
On my server the DW is only worth like 45g. Most of these pets aren't worth much right now because there's not a ton of money available in the economy for frivolous items.
---
As the game progresses, I've heard they go for like 200-250g (based on older players and private servers), but I find that to be a little excessive. It only took me like a week to farm one, so not sure why they'd ever have such a high demand and such a low supply.
---
Broken tooth dps is 1 while other cats are 1.4-2 with the cats in hillsbrad being an exception (1.2)
---
What about EU realms ? (we exist too)
---
edit : nevermind  [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update-english/92241](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update-english/92241)
---
If you can't differentiate the difference in value between a 500g BoE and the 4g you'd get from vendoring a BoP, you might want to consider hiring a caretaker for yourself.
---
Wait, what is a chore in WoW?
---
Yes. You can. You run the instance until it drops. How you think it drops? You can check all the BOEs in atlas lot for whatever instance you want to do. Then you can run that shit until your fingers bleed OR you can buy it. Most people take to the latter but there are those that run a dg 500 times praying to the RNG gods it drops.
---
People do this for twink gear all the time.
---
Tanking is the best role in this game if you know how to tank. You are probably the only class that can dictate the speed of instance runs. I get headaches when I see tanks being stationary, and dps had to pull mobs for him coz they don’t know how to pull.
---
Before lvl 40, just stop using heroic strike. It's additional damage vs rage depletion isn't worth it.  Just focus on Overpower when it procs and soloing becomes significantly easier.
---
Wow. So he ganks someone 5v1 and then gets mad when he is ganked? Where's the logic in that?? It's a PvP server, why would they get mad about PvP. Makes no sense.
---
Thank you !
---
People dont quit the game once you get 60. And there is still plenty to do outside of raid logging. Remember, the faster you got max-level, the more raid lockouts you get. I went super hard to get to the earliest raid lockouts I could. But now that I have my raid lockout, I can log in far more casually. EVEN AFTER RAIDS ARE DONE! I like to farm stuff, kill horde, talk to friends. There's still a million things to do... there just isnt a time pressure to play as much as I can anymore. And I love it. 
---
A similar example was why blizzard removed the unarmored mounts. They didnt want ppl rushing to get those before they were removed. It's the exact same concept really, but obviously you cant remove raid lockouts. 
---
Most people are still playing. Prime time is still pretty crowded on the good servers. It's just people now log in after work rather than taking 2 weeks off work to play 14 hrs to get to their first raid lockout the fastest.
---
&gt;Hourly
---
Fixed that for you

Thanks, but can't get a working Simcraft solution for Classic.

I think youre wasting your time with this one, these people wouldn't understand logic if it bit them in the ass.
---
Id say sure...25s :)
---
Broken tooth is 1.0 and the next fastest is 1.2 (The Rake being an example)
---
Meanwhile the rest of us get irritated with guild chat being "layer invite pls" every 30 seconds.
---
So salty. Oof
---
Orcs and Trolls both start in Durotar.

If you're going to abandon being a tank and just become DPS who grabbed aggro, then level your engineering and open with AOE grenades.
---
idk if it is the lighting but the colors on rag look very lack luster.
---
Tired of strings of TLDR. Summed it up and gave people who want to know why the ability to do so.
---
Wtf
---
Marie! Baguettes!
---
Nice, thanks for the summary!
---
You really seem like an entitled jackass. Noone is more deserving of getting 500 gold for free with no effort because they decided to roll a specific class. Everyone in your party NEEDS that gold for an epic mount or other upgrades in the future. Defaulting gold to players based on class and spec is just plain stupid.
---
Your "average" hunter will actually do [considerably better](https://classic.wowhead.com/wow-classic-dps-rankings-tier-list-phase-1-molten-core) than your "average" mage in phase 1, and I definitely preferred them in Naxx. I'll take the bait though. Yes, being a raid leader means accounting for things outside of game mechanics, like player skill and popular opinion. Hunters were also very plentiful by comparison, which meant I could fill up my group faster. We might progress 20-30 minutes slower with those players, but if it means we started an hour earlier then that's a net gain of 30 minutes.
---
did you even read his post?

Im having the same problem trying to do gerstahn in BRD for the shoulders. Its right next to the arena but groups don't want to do it. And if i finally convince them, the casters in the group will roll need on them. Ive killed her like 10 times, the shoulders have dropped twice and both time someone else won the roll.

My favorite guild name on that server is either gayboys, or grown ups 2

I saw some fresh garbage in the alley over there. Go check that out instead!

Literally the only reason it's bis is due to the set attack speed of bears. Doubling attack speed is sooo valid when the attack weapon damage doesn't matter

I DID THIS THREE FUCKING TIMES LOL my group was pissed.
---
Seems like I touched a nerve? You post guides for Icy Veins or something? 
---
Look, the fact of the matter is that the information is sub par. Nothing you think changes that. The information is sooooooo old there is no excuse for this. Period. Don't go calling other people the problem because (you or your peers) don't write perfect guides. It's not to say that they aren't useful, but only for the newest of players. For anyone with experience, it's so easy to spot how they are wrong, you lose faith in anything more advanced.
---
Personally tested out numerous guides for Diablo and a few for WoW. When it's wrong, it's wrong. That's a fact and I'm free to say so. I don't owe you or anyone else writing guides a thing. Do better. Then maybe people won't call out the guides.

Uhhhh not really. These are your words, not mine.
---
&gt; Go play on a PVE server you idiot
---
That's OK, I get that you're feeling frustrated. Probably best you stick with games as harmless as WoW's PVP you idiot.
---
There's a lot of people here being intentionally obtuse about the intent if the need/greed system. I hope blizz does something because greedy people cannot be convinced to not be greedy. 
---
If a BoE drops I'm gonna roll need just to give the person who will actually equip it a better chance of getting the item. 
---
I understand the "potential of selling the boe for an upgrade that fits your class" argument. Its bunk. Get over yourself.
---
Thank you for kicking this fools ass.
---
It really depends on your playstyles. Stamina and int are pretty universal priorities for PvP, especially in hotw. Then if you want to go feral heavy you go for agility and crit, caster heavy you go for more spellpower.
---
No idea, I'm not native English speaker.
---
Haha hell yeah. The crying over the ring. Damn son. Thanks for linking
---
Right, because it was off topic or at best tangential. I asked about the functional difference between rolling need immediately vs. telling everyone to roll need, and then rolling need. Your comment was about letting someone have the item or having only some people roll need. The guy I asked the question to wants everyone to roll for it, not to give it to a specific person who wants to equip it.
---
I’ve done this.   It sucks but it’ll just get worse , better to run a fresh group and ignore that entire guild.

I went with Fury up to level 40 and then respecced to Arms, my suggestion is to go Arms all the way because the out-of-combat rage decay talent and the other talent that allows you to keep 25 rage when switching stances are absolutely huge. Bind your stances, at least Battle and Berserker (when you get it) to hotkeys. Your stance changes are on a different cooldown than the rest of your abilities. Overpower is one of the best Warrior abilities, it can only be used in Battle Stance; you'll want to be able to quickly switch stances back to Battle Stance and have enough rage to use Overpower. You only have about 5 seconds to use this ability after a mob Dodges your attack.
---
Once you hit 40, dip into the Fury tree and pick up 5/5 points in Cruelty.
---
Honestly? I grew up in a blue collar town with a lot of people on welfare/food stamps. I was the assistant manager of a dollar tree for about 2 years and in that time we sold cheap "baby on board" stickers. People would often walk up to them, blurt out "baby on board? thats cute" like they've never seen it before, and sometimes would purchase it. This happened 50 to 100 times, possibly more often.

There is no way that all of those people who bought it, or even everyone who picked it up knew that it'd be a notifying factor in a collision so that paramedics prioritize their baby. I'm not saying that some people don't know, or couldn't speculate, but there is simply no way that the majority of these (often) young, poor, and uneducated people coming in all know about this. This wasn't something we were taught in school, nor was its function stated anywhere. It was just...... sort of a meme before we had memes? If that makes sense.

Insect here in need of squishin!

Well thank God there's more than one private server.

Maybe you need to talk with your guild leader or find another guild.
---
I'm just waiting to see if someone can explain to me how BoE's are somehow not worth the same for everyone, or why they need to be equipped on the spot.
---
You gotta make up for it with grinding speed brah. Juggle that aggro and take 2-3 mobs on at all times.
---
You know, you don't have to be subscribed to visit this sub.
---
Hey I’m in the sceenshot camp. Just explaining that for many, especially people who didn’t grow up on computers, a phone is much easier.
---
You are absolutely right /u/yuriaoflondor, that's what the Greed roll is. A bunch of selfish pricks who don't give a damn about anyone but themselves will try to tell you that they "have right" to it. Honestly, don't even bother listening to them. WOW is best played with a group of people you actually can trust, rather than with a bunch of crooks who'd sell their own Nana's teeth if it fetched over 100g.
---
Sadly, most people who game/do anything online don’t understand the concept of compromise.

Ran my Dad through it to get him the wand for his mage.

I never did it before, but I played it off like I did it on purpose.

Indubitably.

It is funny how he said "worse stats" when green shadow damage gear literally has ONE stat.
---
Then whisper back, our tank would rather DPS, we'll take you if  you can tank instead?
---
I do think so. 80% of the people I started with have left, and I told them it would cool down. Not the other 20% left as well.
---
Try desolace, it's perfect at 33 for a good level and a half. Or just spam SM

Wonder how many of these same posts we can fit into one week
---
Omg stop changing the topic. Keep talking about how cute I am! You got a crush ;). Can’t stop talking to me 😍
---
I'm chatting on a lot of different threads, so I might've gotten confused.
---
I figured the subject was about pricey BoEs in general, dungeon boes aren't any different if they sell for 100g; you should need them. Not sure why Staff of Jordan is fair game to you but not a 100g BoE blue dagger, for instance.
---
My only thought, "hey look 3 alliance ganging up on a horde player and still failing. But what else is new right?"

Just find another group, no need to post it here.

Spent your money on runecloth instead of a faster mount?

There is a bridge you cross from Ashenvale. Ally FP should be just inside to the right. You shouldn't encounter any high lvl mobs between the bridge and the FP area. Really easy to grab even if low lvl.
---
You mean that beautiful human priestess, Whitemane? You should check out the cosplay somebody did on her in this forum.
---
What an ignorant thing to say
---
Or it is just you being a ninja and trying to justify it and can be applied for every damn item in the game. Just because it is worth 500g, you get greedy and say it is OK to need, because I'm sure someone will need it. If an epic drops that is a healing staff, 3 people greed on it, the priest selects need. Will you just need it because you can sell it?
---
Whats the ranged attack normalization then? Thought it only applied to weapons above 3.3 attack speed.
---
basically scrap everything that had happened before the newest x-pac
---
one of the greatest things about vanilla is starting from nothing and building yourself up to a badass legend.  When they release a new expansion it just feels like you're going from 90% to 100% and it's not very impactful.
---
It was relevant to your comment.
---
Your mana is free in town, you gd rent seeker.
---
For solo stuff I'm using an owl, screech is OP as fuck (will change to a bat for better attack speed once ZG is released)
---
For PVP: Broken Tooth.
---
For group PVE: Deathmaw/whatever the wolves in SFK are called.
---
&gt; Go to winter springs inn and enjoy the bots and ***exploiters*** there its horse shit 
---
Specifically talking about bots huh?  Because I was talking about exploiters (who the comment I replied to had mentioned..) who are in town using spots (that blizzard has taken action against in the past) to kill opposing faction.
---
Probably because they already had a "DPS-only" warrior and were looking for a tank for 30 minutes until that guy reluctantly agreed to tank. Once they invited the second DPS warrior the process on determine who tanks started once over.
---
There are just too many warriors who gotta jump over their own shadow and tank. I'm inviting no DPS warriors to my groups because they interfere with my tanking (high threat, multi-target, specced battleshout) and take my loot.
---
Vanilla wasn't like this. Sure there where dicks, but not this many. Looks like all of the battle Royale kids have joined
---
Here's the thing about druids, especially resto druids. No other class is going to need leather that has int on it, so it all goes to you. When looking through what to play, I noticed that druids aren't very common and won't be the best at anything, but we'll be okay at everything, so naturally, it's human to not want to do that (because we wanna be the very best, dammit). I'm exchanging being the best for being very well geared early on. That's a win in my book.
---
Thats nice, but what part of this is interesting.
---
I'll clear this up then: I was not responding to what you think would happen. I was responding to your criticism of the community, which was all in present tense if I'm not mistaken.
---
Do you happen to have a spec sheet to share? I'm kinda interested in this concept.
---
Even if I'm tanking the run, I make sure people know I'm Arms main spec, so I will be rolling need on DPS gear. If they don't like that, they're free to leave or find a new tank.
---
Fair enough, so you're just trying to ensure everyone rolls equally without any headache or chance to ninja? I feel like suggesting 'everyone greed' is a bad idea if we're talking about groups you don't trust though. Sounds like the two guys who rolled greed in this scenario are just hosed.
---
I ran a top ranked resto druid in vanilla.
---
I was a Twitch favorite for PvP with a resto.
---
I played **years** on free Vanilla servers as a resto.
---
I'm currently leveling a resto in classic.
---
You know how everyone is saying "level feral, you'll be a fine healer too"?
---
Yeah, the opposite is also true. I spend most of my time in cat while leveling. I kill kill plenty fast. Also, I have fairly sick heals at my level.
---
And PvP? For get about it. No one +/-5 levels will kill you. No one.
---
Classic feral was only kinda "meh". 
---
Hell the number 1 damage dealer in the world for MC is currently a balance druid. 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=-1
---
Feral isn't even in the conversation really.
---
Dude, seriously, I've been doing vanilla/classic resto hard core end game raiding and PvP for a decade. You'll be a fucking raid boss.  
---
Straight up, ferals are a joke.
---
99% of the time I NS+Hibernate, /laugh, and walk away. They're not even worth the 25 seconds it takes me to kill one.
---
I have seen tons of gayboys, however I have not seen this grown ups 2 you speak of. 
---
I will be keeping an eye out this evening when I log on haha. 
---
A few I like are: “you no take candle”, “it burns when I pvp”, and “from accounting” hahah the last one cracks me up because I always read their character name followed by “from accounting” 🤣😂
---
oh i plan on discussing it i just am waiting for an mc run to confirm his laziness
---
No need to hide names of the unforgiven
---
At least it wasn't right before the boss.
---
There's more then one Classic server...
---
I had his dagger on my rogue for the longest time because of loot changes in later patches/expansions, the dagger was no longer available.
---
Should have killed his pet first.
---
What part of bugging out an npc path  doesnt seem like an exploit? How does that not fit a bankable offense. It's a clear exploit.
---
Survival seems to be more supportive of one of the other too for pvp. As it increases your survivability in a number of ways, but since we have no self healing, we need damage to make use of that tankiness.
---
Im looking for people to group with on Whitemane (Alliance) that are on from the times of 1am to 4am server time. 
---
Specifically I'm a level 43 priest that is having trouble forming groups at this time and would like to get a core group of players around when it's BRD time (or earlier for stuff like ZF/Mara) 
---
It's hard getting a group together and then finishing an instance like BRD so late/early as well with 2 to 3 hour time constraints. But if a consistent group was able to be made it would go a long way!
---
I truly believe a google search would have been easier than posting this
---
You just have to be prepared to encounter that kind of behavior.  That's my point.
---
They asked, you said no, and everyone moved on.
---
How many times would a max rank overhead vs the other.
---
But what they did is the same thing.
---
So the gun is better for long fights where you can't keep up an ideal rotation because of mana? What's better for Rag then?
---
Ok bye
---
I still use that addon. It also tells you about stealth players being near.
---
It's called Spy and it's amazing.
---
They literally just posted some servers are down to 1 and the rest are at 2
---
How many leather pieces do you think you’ll be wearing? 
---
Shoulders, gloves and legs, maybe if you don’t get the BoEs. You don’t replace them till Cthun tho
---
He's right
---
Of course. Everything you said is true. At the end of the day we are have our own thoughts on things
---
Overpowers and Sunders all day. Hamstrings for runners. Execute if you're feeling adventurous.
---
Shit posts, good bye
---
do not open this with a shitty work computer... almost froze mine up lmao
---
I had this happen in vanilla, I was questing and just fell through the world, was just kinda floating in the middle of the world, there was no land but there was weird colored sky both above and below me. I probably have screenshots still somewhere. I couldn't hearth because I think I might have technically been falling although without changes in the environment its hard to tell.
---
Fair, but in the scenario i'm talking about, I want everyone to roll need, regardless on if they are going to equip it or not.
---
Then don't join a group as a tank.
---
If I do that, I'm going to have to relevel my engineering then? Do I lose all of my recipes?
---
I'm glad the honor system isn't out yet, let's a lot of these shenanigans go down without people stressing a DHK.
---
Cross-realm BGs is one of the biggest disappointments of Classic.
---
I'm also still mad they didn't put the original epic mounts in the game. I want my damn Ivory Raptor!
---
Offended - g'damn snowflakes. OG WoW was GoT style brutality. Y'all don't even remember when they raid ganked homies effing funeral. Bunch o' softies. RIP
---
https://youtu.be/MEpv7YxnLCQ
---
My guild is not like that. Or it wasn't, everyone quit. So many people had so many bad experiences. Ninja looting seems to be normal, and even promoted, thanks asmonshit. Etc. I'll just join my friendly people on other games and let this game die out.
---
My buddy and his wife legit stopped talking to me and got really mad I wouldn't tank as arms at level 30
---
I've always wondered why "assless chaps" are a meme.  It's like 'wet water' or 'lying politician'.
---
ALL CHAPS ARE ASSLESS.  Most are crotchless too.  They're literally just leather legs, and sometimes only the front of those.
---
*That's what makes them different from* *pants*.
---
Or just have the default rule be to roll need, and then there's always a 20% chance for everyone. A fair roll.
---
He's right.
---
I absolutely loved open world pvp battles like that. The guild battles at Molten Core were insane
---
In classic, you have the same exact build or maybe 1 other build, at least for rogues you do. Combat swords or combat daggers for PvE.
---
At least in retail a lot of talents can be adjusted to personal liking which affect your overall rotations and such.
---
I feel like this guy probably already has a hard enough life.
---
your best bet as a priest it to attach yourself to an AoE group (and apparently get crucified by this sub for doing so) but its easily the fastest and most consistent dung exp you cant get if thats all you're doing. Also at least get the quests for each new dung you plan on doing (unless they're chained)
---
Lets imagine for a second what this sub would look like if every time someone was kicked from a group, they posted to reddit. Thousands of posts a day for mods to delete.
---
Why would anyone not want to play Orc? Me no understand. They am not that kind of Orc?
---
I think it’s just an accumulation of disdain and hyperbole reactions, as I went along earlier. But to be fair, “never trust Blizzard again” also sounds hyperbole. In my case, for example, let’s say Diablo 4 comes out soon, in the past I would have preordered the game while nowadays I’d wait for a few days and read some reviews before dropping $60.
---
Hope that gives you an idea, I’m assuming the average person doesn’t feel that much different, but I may also be super wrong though.
---
Mages are pretty good at it too because they have a spell that makes them invulnerable for 10 seconds on a 5 minute cooldown and does not direct aggro to anyone else.
---
How much of a grind is it to get the rep needed to get the douse item (not the re-usable one)?  My guild is planning on starting to raid in about 2 weeks now and I would like to be able to bring one with me as I know many will forget.
---
I prefer to call it "blow me".
---
Wrath was an amazing expansion but I prefer TBC because it is like polished Classic with flying. Wrath was the expansion where they started to ruin the game.
---
My friend group re rolled on Heartseeker, and we’re in the 30s and we are constantly getting bullied by skull level alliance. The server is so imbalanced and it makes the game so much less fun. I don’t play it as much because of it unfortunately. Like I totally wouldn’t mind once I was 60 and another 60 tried to sneak up on me. But as a 35, a lvl 60 bullying me just isn’t fun.
---
Cause I thought it would be much easier to get with my schedule. But if what your saying is true than I might just go for full on tier 1. Thanks
---
They mean they're not regenerating mana outside of the mp5 once they drop the totem... for 5 more seconds. It's not nearly the deal they are making it out to be.
---
Fair enough. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth and I'm sorry about that.
---
Tell that to the RuneScape community, we go harder after max
---
clean your monitor, and stop taking pictures of your monitor with your phone.
---
If you read the parent comment, the argument that was extremely common here was that people didnt believe blizzard was ever going to remove layering. That complete distrust of Blizzard is less common in the average commenter here as the subreddit has grown. I'm more just saying it from an onswevational standpoint. I've been a frequent user of this subreddit since r/wowclassic was the other subreddit and the main discussions on both subs were which one to use as the "main" sub.
---
This is amazing
---
Well, the actual effect from improved WF totem is really marginal; max rank WF totem grants +315 AP on that one WF attack, with a proc chance of 20%. The added effect from the talent points add about 95 AP to that strike. When you calculate that the added effect from improved WF is only 20% of 95 AP over a constant period of time, the reason to take enhancement shamans gets smaller and smaller.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love people that play what they desire and don't get the minmax mentality get to their head; I play a Retribution Paladin for crying out loud. But let's not pretend that improved WF totem is something to write home about.
---
I'm not giving up on my dreams just yet.
---
That’s what happens when you lay off the old timers and then rehire scrubs who know they have zero job security and little prospect with the company.

Vendor em all
---
Somebody got ganked by a 52 rogue it seems...
---
Not if they want to save their DKP for raid items.  If an enhance shaman is waiting at the end of the gear list it makes sense he'd get first crack at this item he needs.
---
It's basically evade bugging. That's an exploit and taking part in it repeatedly is exploiting. It's not a question of if ita am exploit, theres no gry zone here. It's an exploit and people know it.
---
I'm on the most populated Oceania server and there hasn't been a queue in over 2 weeks. I'd assume the tourist had started leaving. Even I'm a bit burnt out and playing less (which is a good thing cause I have other things to do).

You don't NEED to spend 200g on a sword that you will use for 10 levels. If you NEEDED to have that sword you could already have it by spending 200g.
---
I’m used to it at least, always played MMOs on a shitty computer. I remember in some of those huge World vs World battles in Guild Wars 2, I would literally have 1 FPS.
---
On the plus side, I'm definitely making a macro to use when I form groups to weed out the crazies
---
This subreddit has shown me that's mandatory on the offchance you get one of these people

I have not had any luck logging in from the game window, even after a disconnect when it shows my account name there. I have only been able to launch from the launcher itself, so I just close WoW any time I get DC'd and launch from the launcher.
---
...such a weird name...
---
That's not at all what this means. This only means that enough players are spread out and/or spending more time in instances.
---
He literally said he wanted to wear it because it looks cool, even though it is a big DPS loss. What is that if not RP gear?
---
Yes they are and for sure I know the pain... all I'm saying is people are going to want you to tank every once in awhile. Or in my case non fucking stop, yes it can be irritating but when it comes down to it you are a warrior THE tank class of vanilla. You can simply say no sorry dudes not feeling it or do what I do and bargain. Agree but tell them you need to be party lead and when you get to the boss you need get priority if the item drops and will be putting it on master loot to ensure you get your item.
---
Shield the dps warriors Everytime, shield the tank when below half and haven’t started casting heal yet
---
you just told the OP to stop trying to defend the OP
---
Also, you are an idiot even outside of that.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
&gt; There seems to be a timing component involved
---
Yes. This is the part that is causing my frustration. Behavior isn't consistent/predictable and I was hoping that legacy behavior of wands is already well understood and top tier players developed workarounds.
---
Lol, I didn’t imagine tier 1 being easier but i would much rather go for that if I can find a guild that raids super late Sunday nights
---
Can someone explain this to me? I just started playing, never played retail, and I'm a 14 mage. I can make food and water, but I can charge for it? Why not just give them some if it's really easy to make?
---
I really appreciate that, but we're gonna be on Deviate Delight
---
I do not use addons. I played a pala only guild in vanilla. None of this is possible anymore the way it's played now. It's only about fast fast fast and efficiency. Sometimes you just need to stop, and take the time to enjoy the world around you. And that's why almost everyone left. Enough of this forcing shit onto people.

Got to Multibox then it turns fishing into a fun game of whack-a-mole

One of the main stoppers for Arms in raids is the debuff limits. Mortal Strike and bleeds take up slots that would be better suited to other classes.

I went to eb games (gamespot) in person and preordered one last week. Hit the pavement boys.
---
It depends what exactly your goals are. Pets don't scale with your stats at endgame so it's all about the utility they bring.
---
For PvP, you want as fast an attack speed as possible for pushback against casters. That generally means Brokentooth with his 1.0 attack speed but he can be a pain in the ass to get and there's readily available 1.2 attack speed pets that will do just as well 95% of the time.
---
For PvE, you want a wolf. Furious Howl is great and between it and Trueshot Aura you're a great damage increase for melee dps in your group. Attack speed doesn't matter at all for PvE without being deep BM spec so the only consideration is the abilities your pet can learn.
---
For soloing, you want a carrion bird. They get +5% armor (same as a bear) and can learn Screech which not only causes aoe threat but also reduces the damage your pet takes from enemies.
---
The highest level 1.2 attack speed cats you can tame are level 36-37 in Swamp of Sorrows so part of the typical process I'd recommend for a hunter is to tame one of those at the appropriate level and take it out with you after you level so it'll keep up, but use a carrion bird as your normal pet for most of the leveling process. Once you get to 60, use the 3rd slot to tame one of the higher level owls in Winterspring to get max ranks of Dive and Claw and the highest currently available rank of Screech so you have those available for other pets. Then abandon the owl and try to get into an LBRS group that's willing to help you tame a Bloodaxe Worg near the wolf boss. Using that for a bit will get you max ranks of Bite, Dash, and Furious Howl. In fact, a Bloodaxe Worg is the only source in the game for learning the max ranks of Bite and Furious Howl so it's a necessity. You can keep that worg as your permanent raiding pet unless you want one that looks different, but there's no statistical advantage to be gained from going with a different wolf for raiding.
---
Of course it affects him.  This isn't a single player game.  When that one guy farmed like 100 truefaith vestments from Strath by abusing layers, did that affect him?  It sure did if he wanted to buy or sell that pattern.  So how about the constant layer-hopping on a massive scale to farm mobs/resources since release?  Does that affect him?  Probably does in some way.  Imagine people abused it even for non-tradeable shit.  Imagine if some group of players had silently abused instance layering for a couple months straight and all got Deathcharger?  Doesn't affect him at all right because it's not like they can sell it or anything.  But no, it still does, because maybe he aspired to get Deathcharger someday because it's a mega-rare status symbol, and now it's devalued by 5 cheating idiots jumping around Org bank with it.
---
Just initiate a /roll in the party for any locked chests in their entirety, then rogue unlocks regardless of who won, then the winner loots the entire chest.
---
Cartoony graphics and cow people don’t but gnomes ruin it?
---
I’m just running a standard combat swords build for now. Just accepting that my life will suck in PvP for a little bit.
---
Depends on what you want out of the game. Do you want to top dps raid bosses? Would be tough. Open world pvp? Will probably be pretty rough until you get really good gear (even then it may be rough against similarly geared people). Just messing around playing at your own pace a class that you enjoy, maybe doing some occasional pvp and dungeons? Sure, go ahead.

They should. But they should also ban exploiters. It's not like someone can get off Scot free for burglarizing a house because they say "oh well they left their door unlocked so I figured I could".
---
I think Batman may have a bit of trouble with Illidan

Not having layering would basically have made the game DoA.

You are a hero, Twitch is blocked at work here as well.

But there's no such thing as sand gnomes!
---
So this comes with 2 boxes? One for rag and one that is similar to the normal wow collectors?
---
Both of those classes will give you alot of options, but keep in mind that healers are actually very valuable in PVP.  Priest could also be an option, especially if your friend is going warrior, since shadow can put out some great damage in pvp if you desire.

Get z-perl or another addons that shows who in your party has aggro.

A couple months ago when this map resurfaced again I found it and had it printed. You can download it onto a USB (almost have to do it this way because the file is too large to upload online to 99% of sites) and bring it in to your local Office Depot/other chain that prints posters. Cost me about $30 to have it printed there.

Most chests in the open world certainly do not have greens, we’re not talking about dungeon chests which are guaranteed to have a green.

Oh my bad, I misunderstood your first comment and didn't realise they were in a spot the guards couldn't reach. Blizzard will absolutely punish people for that, you're right.
---
Yeah ok but no clue how RuneScape classic or whatever it's called does it. For wow classic the phase approach basically mimics patches, and player behavior here has always been that people play the main content, which is 2-4 weeks based on how much time you can play, and then play much less. Only logging in in for raids and such.
---
This is it. This ends it.
---
No he means pservers (mentioned they had been up for 1 year)
---
I agree with the other guy when it comes to Transmog. I think it’s a good thing that we have to show exactly what we have equipped.
---
I don’t care about being the best, I just want a spot in raids
---
He’s just angry because he had high hopes of walking away with purples and that clouded his judgement of realizing that he was basically a pug. No guild gives out loot to people who have been with them for days. The guild sounds like they are trying to build something and they want to weed out the people who don’t stick around, and not risk having that loot leave the guild as well. It seems like a good plan to me.
---
And it only cost Skeram its barely viable faction balance. I still laugh as I see heartseeker players begging horde to join the server. But at least we're down to only TWO layers. Now we're thanking Blizzard for plural layers.. Oh boy.
---
Kudos to blizzards divine wisdom of unrestricted alliance transfers off skeram. Short term gain ignoring long term pain, the key to success. But at least we're down to only TWO layers. Wowee
---
The best part is Sam is his pet
---
Horde can be competitive due to windfury and hamstring spamming. But yeah dw is generally superior. If you factor gear competition into it, might be better off going 2h if it means you get better gear faster.
---
He's 1.0 while the next fastest are 1.2 but it makes no difference towards dps unless you're specced deep BM. A faster attack speed is better in pvp for caster pushback, that's all.
---
Didn't know u could change that setting, thank you
---
Because you care about them?
---
or the priest is MC you as a warrior to toggle your run/walk for extra slow and confusion
---
Didn't she like spread the original plague doesn't that yknow...make you a villain?
---
You need to take a break. Stretch. Maybe pet a dog.
---
That seems pretty straight forward.
---
A different problem where I am terribly disappointed is when we have one or more warriors in the group and are still looking for a tank. Why are you not tanking?! You're playing one of the two classes than *CAN* tank and aren't fulfilling your needed role? Something is wrong there...
---
I should have rolled warrior instead of a healer, but if I level an alt it'll definitely be a warrior. These non-tanking warriors are disgusting imo.
---
This doesn't apply to druids because they don't exist.
---
Playing on rp servers, but its not constant rp like u see on reddit highlights. Its more like ppl give you smalltalk while fishing, greet and dance at dungeon meeting stones and celebrate guildmembers birthdays in guildevents at some random inn. People who roleplay 1 very specific character are rare.
---
How do you know who to add, though?
---
Is GotW in yet?
---
But classic has more baseline
---
Most annoying thing about retail is that you just straight up lose half of your class when you switch specs
---
There's no more hero mode when you're an arms warrior and end up tanking when the tank dies
---
It's okay. I suppose my original comment was pretty fucking insensitive but that's just how I feel.
---
You can empathize with someone while also recognizing that their problem, whatever it is, is being blown out of proportion.
---
Apperantly not based on the video also 0 reason to do it when you have a tank.
---
Is there somewhere I can buy a somewhat large print of this? Framed maybe?
---
hi it's me ur brother
---
How many free toon transfers do you get? I started a toon one a server before I realized my friend is on another and I'd like to xfer it but not waste it.
---
Then I'll do it for the mods and delete it.  Jesus.  My bad.  You seem very invested for something so uninteresting.  Carry on.
---
I like executing mobs just before they heal. Or if there's nothing else nearby.
---
I was ina gui on a private server where every time someone joined the guild everyone would say in all caps ONE OF US
---
The top dps paladin in the game does 1/5th the dps of the top warrior.
---
You dont want to dps as a ret pally. It feels awful. Ypu use max consumes just to still be bottom meters.
---
I feel bad for you. That didn’t even make any sense.. bye lol
---
Except if I am casting 2 rank 5s, which heal for 900 and cost 270 mana.  So, that's 1800 healing for 540 mana in 7 seconds.  
---
Rank 9 heals for 1932 for 600 mana.  So, I heal for a bit more, but spend 60 more mana, right?  
---
Except, you spend 7 seconds casting instead of 3.5, and I regen 57 maan per tick.  If I get 1 tick from spirit, it eliminates the saving of downranking.
---
Yup, it drops from the Winterspring elites too.
---
Source: I got one 2 days ago.
---
Hence, why I am avoiding it entirely. You can skip zones that don't fit your playstyle. Like I said as well, I don't think I can do Badlands in one go but I am going to try.
---
I have taken 5 or 6 alts through STV. I have no desire to go back. Wetlands is fucking annoying to level my Priest in, so I just did the quests that require me to do turn ins at Menethil and that shit dwarf fortress, then leave. Same with Arathi.
---
I mained an Undead Rogue in vanilla and feel like I just stayed in STV until I was done with all the quests but that was along time ago so I am probably on drugs. I have a Rogue alt approaching STV level, maybe I'll see where I get stuck there. All I remember is cultivating a deep hatred for the place.
---
Things that are time locked one a day things. The only thing classic has remotely similar are crafting cooldowns but thats log in press a button log off.
---
I am curious to know how he added you. That seems a bit fishy.
---
As for the experience, anyone saying threatening to put you in all too X faction guild KOS list is all bluster. Maybe they add you to one guild’s KOS list. But the person making such childish threats usually has zero influence.
---
Nzoth.
---
- No flying mounts or any other form of "PvE cloud". I'm counting War Mode as a form of this.
---
- Greatly reduce the amount of scaling within an expansion. Gear doesn't need to be a 100% DPS increase every tier for it to be worth raiding the new tier.
---
- No daily quests, world quests, or any other sort of chore. Trying to force me to log in every day just makes me not want to log in ***at all***.
---
- Tone down the number of tools classes have to BC levels. It got too extreme afterwards, and while BC had *some* of the instant-cast cancer that would later ruin PvP, it also had a lot of very good changes for most classes (crusader strike, cloak of shadows, enhancement rework). 
---
- Pre-2.4 monster difficulties. That patch nerfed world elites and made everything soloable. 
---
- Leveling to cap should take about as long as it takes to get 60 on Classic. And get rid of instant-cap boosts. As a compromise, make it easier to test-drive at the cap. The class trials can sort of do this, but they're clunky and limited, and for some reason don't let you trial the new races.
---
- Drastically reduce character power in the world. I could easily solo 15+ monsters at once on my demon hunter. 
---
- Ability animations should only play when the server says it's happening (as it works on Classic), not when you press the button (as it works on Retail since Legion). Watching your character repeatedly perform an animation, because your client thinks you're in range but the server doesn't, is infuriating and obnoxious. 
---
- De-linearize instances and bring back the complex ones like BRD.
---
Overall, ***quit being afraid to challenge the player.*** The best content WoW has ever had was the hunter epic quest in Classic. The second best was the Mage Tower in Legion. What both of those had in common was that they were difficult and challenged you to play extremely well for long periods of time.
---
Read what he said.
---
"Because a warrior dps at a higher level than the tank currently in party will pull aggro anyways"
---
What you then have is the healer either trying to keep the higher level DPS warrior alive when they pull aggro ie they are the tank.
---
Dungeon sets aren't out yet.
---
A couple of my friends were in this guild once where every time someone dinged or got an achievement, this dude would say "GOOD 1" and it would be surrounded with skull triangle and circle markers.
---
When we made our own raiding guild eventually we all had our own obnoxious GOOD 1 macros that we spammed whenever someone got an achievement.
---
It’s impossible, even with a full clear. I have been multiboxing and it takes me 2 runs and a few kills outside to get all deviate hides for all 5 toons.
---
2-3 is really all there ever were in raids.  1 Feral for 3% crit and occasional off tank if needed.  Then 1 or 2 resto driuds.  I know some take a Balance druid for crit buff in mage group, but that was more rare.
---
Druids are not awkward to bring, they have a lot of utility.  You just don't need that many.  (I main'd a druid in Vanilla and again now in Classic.)
---
This becomes less and less true the better geared the 60s become... but I had at least 2000-3000 health in my 40s, most 60s can't one-shot that.
---
But layers have no effect on the population of a server... just how that population is spread out. It's not like removing layers will remove people who were playing on that server.
---
She's just the current bad guy.
---
If you're a pure healer,  very viable,  just remember you'll still have to run around to get quests for dungeons and some gear as well,  not to mention various flight paths to get to dungeons and of course reagents and materials.  Even a 50/50 split of time between dungeons and questing is very dungeon heavy. 
---
Is it doable? Of course.  But you'll still need to get out and about as well.
---
Wait, I just saw your class icon.  Have a great day, I’ll see myself out.
---
“These images were taken when I hit 60 3 days later [and could finally equip the gear], 3 minutes apart”
---
That’s my reading
---
For sure man, we think about it quite similarly. I just phrased it that way to see if that guy had given it much thought. The problem Blizzard encounters is that even though players use this to gather more nodes, it's not actually abusing the spawn system, its abusing the players ability to essentially drive a monopoly by possessing a larger amount of the materials via layering. Theoretically I suppose they could define that as economy abuse, but I fail to see how Blizzard could systematically define unnatural layer swaps. Maybe flag characters that break a certain threshold of average time existing in each layer. But then you may get a bunch of false positives from players who run dungeon pugs frequently and constantly join random parties. It probably comes down to a logistics issue of them not wanting to manually review that many people to check for wrongdoing. Too much money.
---
&gt;What'd they do to you? 
---
Try to gank me more than any other class.
---
I've been told Highways are PvP zones, take good care of your little ones. May they grow up to be Alliance friends :)
---
Aah thanks a lot!
---
That brings me back to DAOC relic raids. Staring at the floor.
---
If you are taking a BOE for money, why not take a BOP for vendor. Clearly you are worried about what the drop can do for you, so you take it despite it having an immediate and clear benefit to someone else. Does it matter if it vendors for 5 gold or auctions for 500g? Either way you are taking a piece of gear from someone else and leaving them with nothing. And when do you draw a line? What price is acceptable to need despite it being an upgrade for someone else. I can guarantee that whatever price you have, someone else will have lower. Forcing you to lower your price as well. If everyone behaved like you assholes needing everything then the price that it would be acceptable to need at would be driven down to like 30 silver. The only reason this system “works” for you is because you abuse the good will of the masses. Fuck you and all your greedy ninja looting friends. Go make a guild together a rage every week when people constantly snake each other and nobody ever gets gear. Wow classic is about a good community and all you snakes are going to have to name change or realm transfer once you get blacklisted by everyone.

I thought about this a while back, and I actually don't know that I'd like that for my characters in WoW. Part of the reason I enjoy playing the characters are I do are for the characters themselves. I love my Zandalari Troll Priest, my Tauren Paladin, and my Blood Elf hunter. I couldn't imagine playing those classes on any other character or playing another class on one of those characters. I'm sure I'm in the minority on that though, because I do just a a tiny bit of RP with every character I make.
---
That said, I also acknowledge that I could still have my multiple characters if they opened multi-class into WoW, so I'm not exactly opposed to the idea itself.
---
Yup. Mostly I as a war want to dps because I have no energy and want to just zone out. I dont mind waiting for a group. When I do mind waiting for a group I'll usually tank. I also dont like tanking my first few runs of a dungeon until I know the route bosses quests etc
---
Oh yeah on that note I forgot about using Shield Bash to interrupt the occasional pesky heal.
---
Okay. Yeah I mean I want to assume the best, but I’d like to hear an explanation if anyone possibly knows how this could even happen
---
And I find it crazy that you think people should just suck it up when people spam guild chat because they're too spazzy and impatient to just wait a moment for respawns or, god forbid, go find another area to clear while the first one repopulates. Ooooh nooo, playing the game as intended and not exploiting server load maintence mechanics. Horror.
---
and "looking for a reason to complain", from the guy complaining about complaints? Laughable blindness to your own hypocrisy.
---
No mage , I figured that was a given , I was just giving a comparison to another class
---
How big are we talking? 2% or 20%? The whole issue here is the tired argument that if you are not wearing your BiS you are trash. A 2% dps loss is not going to make or break you in a raid setting unless you are pushing for world first races.
---
A 60 of any class should destroy a 52 rogue. And if the 60 has decent green gear, even a 52 with BIS gear for a 52 rogue should be easy.
---
Go DW you’ll have rage for days
---
Why do you say attack speed doesn’t matter if your not BM?
---
Go for shaman, your rogue friend gonna love wf. You could argue that being able to stealth as a druid is great but dps pvp spec is ultraniche relying exclusively on bleeding ennemies to death.
---
Hi everyone! hope you guys are having a good day so far! I just wanted to ask for some recommended grinding spots for a warrior level 42 to level in. I can only log on after work and I'd like a good place to grind a few levels after work and not have to worry as much about competing with the horde for quests XD. Let me know of any good grinding spots in this level range!
---
It doesn't matter how many warriors are out there if only a small percentage of them are willing to tank
---
I usually go to shimmering flats to get those, since they're also required for another low droprate quest :D
---
Man if only there was a word for wanting something for the gold... if only.
---
I saw someone spamming yesterday 'LFM Tank+DPS Strat Live everything reserved except gear upgrades you need'
---
That's pretty much exactly what he said "everything reserved except gear upgrades you need."
---
Why would I even go? Sure getting gear is good but what if nothing I want drops? At least in a normal run I've got a good chance of some BOEs or greed rolling a BOP off a boss to sell.
---
&gt; In general, it's right to roll need if you are going to immediately or almost immediately use the item
---
Loophole: I plan to "use" the item "immediately" to fund my epic mount.  This technically fits your definition of when to need but would be kinda scumbaggy
---
Lmao that's amazing.
---
Use one of the addons I suggested. I suggest healbot. They will fit.
---
Dont change. Grass is always greener on other side.
---
Potion of free movement aswell, basically its the pvp herb.
---
mouseover for everything
---
grid frames for data
---
Rather appropriately druids are better the less you have of them since their hots don't stack.
---
Yes my sun
---
Yea, that's generally my viewpoint but when there's so many other people there that you spend 90% of the time running around just looking for an alive mob, it's definitely not worth.
---

Making gold solo as a warrior? I was lucky enough to get Eye of Sulfuras. I was able to farm enough gold for 50 arcanite bars through essence farming, but now that layers are minimal, these spots are way too crowded. I need to start farming gold for ingots and I'm pretty lost at what to do now. I'm herbalism/alchemy.
---
Lol that doesnt mean what you think it means. Your comment was ingornant and I wanted you to know that and now you understand it was stupid thing to say.
---
DROP BEAR
---
&gt;the least amount of skill and gear required to dominate- roll mage
---
When the hateboner gets to strong.
---
You forgot the shepherd, who kills the wolves to protect the sheep.
---
Feral.  
---
Balance is a meme spec for the most part and has way too much down time to be viable compared to Feral.  Resto is like any other healer build, decent to dungeon with but not very good in the open world.
---
The comment I replied to was mentioning the enemy faction, to which I replied that there is a pretty good alternative out there.
---
Yep, soon as people hit 60 all the old zones become wastelands because they're dead content.
---
Love it!
---
as a warrior, my biggest issue with this is that my 1h is outdated and my weapon skill is like 80+ below my current level. it's just way simpler to just dps. i've also not had the greatest experiences tanking and i just don't enjoy it that much
---
Duuuude yes.
---
Because that would be awful.
---
This was the source to go to 15 years ago , and its still the source to go to today.
---
Ah yes, I do like that when I'm sword/board.  I don't recall, does it require defensive stance? That might just be how I set up my action bar.
---
No would def not recommend.  Combat swords is utter trash for PvP. Energy inefficient and no burst. 
---
You are entirely tied to AR to kill people who are decent. 
---
That being said - it’s kind of just the nature of rogue - their PvP specs are good but bad for raiding and vice versa. This changes when you can do seal fate but that’s a long way off.
---
Also the great at non-world pvp since they are the undisputed best flag carriers.
---
Besides in your own example, the person being a dick intentionally would just role need and bounce out anyway, not even giving the chance to someone trying to be fair.
---
I remember that. Lol that was great.
---
&gt; One is a pleasant Event that happened to someone in your party
---
That event still happens.
---
Your definition of screwing over is seriously screwed.
---
If someone is willing to pay a price for an item, how are they getting screwed over by buying at that price?
---
If someone is willing to sell an item at a price, how are they getting screwed over by selling at that price?
---
&gt; No one feels good that someone won
---
The guy who sells feels good that he won, the guy who bought it feels good that he got an item he really earned instead of just having it handed to him by rng.
---
&gt; It promotes competion amongst the group instead of a team effort.
---
No, it promotes fairly sharing as opposed to a "me me me" attitude that allows you to screw over other players is god knows how many ways.
---
They have arguably the most broken pvp spec
---
2nd this
---
What pet are you using as well? Some pets do less damage and you have to learn their skills to upgrade (such as big, claw, screech)
---
Search Google for Petopia Classic. I cannot recommits more to seek out a pet that has screech as it is very similar to claw in dps and it provides extra threat with the AoE demoralize. I rarely take aggro from my pet with screech on auto cast.
---
No the other warrior made a DECISION to buy the item for gold the other player shouldn’t be punished for the first player’s decision.
---
I don't think you realize how much Horde dominates Whitemane. I was stuck on 33 for a full week. I did not use the term "unplayable" lightly, Alliance literally has no chance.
---
Yeah I feel ya - I think if you get near perfect pre raid BiS you can skip the precision talents and still be okay as long as you are human.
---
I sometimes add others to my list when other people get camped or something. But I forget who they are 5 minutes after its done so I don't know what grudge I'm settling when their kos alert goes off in the future.
---
Nah it's fine. The population is much more spread out in level now. Some places are hotspots but for the most parts it's really not bad.
---

---
Blizzard put it in to lighten area load and prevent lag, they didn't put it in for spazzy impatient brats on Twitch to farm with. It's an abuse of the mechanics in a way that was not intended.
---
The fuck kind of logic is that? You don't need to love everything about it to enjoy it. Every game has flaws, classic included.
---
Both people need it for gold, the person that can't use it will sell it gaining gold, the person that can use it equips it, saving gold.
---
If the person that can use it isn't going to buy it, how can you justify them needing it?
---
Layering only had a positive affect on the game so far, not sure what issue you have with it.
---
I’ve literally seen people in game wearing Beaststalker armor. However the upgraded version of the set isn’t out yet if that’s what you mean.
---
Non pvp servers you can have toons with each faction.
---
As a hunter...I feel attacked
---
I hit need on BoEs.  If someone who really needs it is in the group they can buy it from me.
---
Duskwood has a pretty big level range. There are quest for lvl 23 to 30. What I do is hopping between Redridge mountains, Duskwood and the Wetlands.
---
I've made 300g selling herbs in the last week. Stacks of sungrass, icecap, and mountain silversage are going for between 5g and 15g on my server.
---
I'm not invested enough to keep track of things just to hate them with
---
Well, no, I can't handle 4 level 60s running around killing every single alliance they encounter. How am I suppose to handle that?
---
No, not really. My rationale is "let people be happy they got a drop they can use rather than ninja it out from under them because I want a few more gold". 
---
There's not really anything very irrational about that.  He might *disagree* with my opinion but that doesn't make it irrational. He just picked a word he thought would be a pejorative and then used it incorrectly.
---
Tailloring will bring you your BIS torso for a few phases aswell as ZG cloth set bonus, you will also be able to craft resist gear but outside of a few pieces you won't make much gold
---
Alchemy is good as a money making profession. (arcanite transmutation etc..)
---
Engineering is ZE best utility profession for pvp and pve
---
Mining &amp; Herb are great money making prof
---
You don't win 1v1, DPS for DPS, unless it's a very imbalanced matchup or you get really lucky, but you can win 2v1.
---
&gt;and "looking for a reason to complain", from the guy complaining about complaints? Laughable blindness to your own hypocrisy.&lt;
---
Oh look at you complaining about me complaining about you complaining! Eyeroll. Cry more about people asking for invites. Jesus, I hope for your sake you're not a grown ass man.
---
My theory is that the quest is designed to make you pay in advance for all the travel time saved by ghost wolf from 20-40.
---
You're not even that hot!
---
Turns out Earthroot is basically useless. I had several stacks from herbing while leveling but didn't use any for leveling Alchemy. Vendored it all for 4s/stack.
---
It's almost like hunters are needed in the game.
---
Because it simply doesn't. Pet damage is normalized so a 1.0 attack speed pet will do the same overall dps as a 2.0 attack speed. The 1.0 hits twice as fast but does half as much damage per hit.
---
I love your comment, so in depth, thank you!
---
I agree that vigor is actally unnecessary, i have since got rid of it. So if im not taking improved SS, then what should my primary source of dmg be if i cant get behind the target? I only really got it for lower cost.
---
Do you mind tweaking my build a bit into what you think would be best?
---
He couldn't tell cause of the -8 intellect
---
BoE epics, all roll need.
---
I was thinking of something like Faerie fire/ insect swarm/ moonfire and then maybe barkskin -&gt; hurricane, assuming  you are alive then pop bear and spam swipe. I wonder if there is a build for something like this. I think I would go oom after gathering a couple targets though.
---
I’m still using the same computer and it’s not as terrible as I remembered. I definitely need a new computer tho
---
Perfect example, an item that quickly becomes trash, but is worth a fortune to some.
---
&gt;These 'two issues' are two sides of the same coin. You cant agree with me, then call me a scumbag for doing it.
---
Huh?  Not even remotely.  One issue is about stopping ninjas from taking items unfairly.  The other is you justifying taking items from someone who needs them.  Again, there is absolutely nothing wrong with rolling all need to prevent ninjas from being able to steal drops.  The ONLY thing I'm arguing against is the idea that BoE epics are "Need" for everyone because they're worth a lot of gold.
---
&gt;You can still pass the item to the truly needy after the roll.
---
If that's truly the way you act then I have no problem at all, you and I agree 100%.  But there ARE scumbags in this thread arguing that BoEs are equivalent to gold and so they are justified in taking them to sell on the AH even if another player in the party actually needs the item to equip, and that's who I'm arguing against.  If I misunderstood your position, I apologize.
---
If you kill one boss in a raid you are locked to that specific ID until reset. Specific boss lockouts were a later feature.
---
I know you can do that for your own faction, but for the opposite faction I didn’t know/ still kind of don’t believe that. Everything in that thread is on the assumption for same faction.
---
Gonna go test now
---
Edit: confirmed this does not work for opposite faction https://imgur.com/a/kOiwjXf
---
You need engineering on every class.
---
Yeah that’s false. It’s a fantastic PvP set.
---
This isn’t the first time it’s been discussed. Apparently it’s easy and fast, too, as people are getting messaged immediately.

The voting system seems to work pretty well for OSRS. The way they do it is you have to have a certain total level and be a member to be able to vote which ensures only dedicated players. Maybe just make it so you need to have a level 40 character to be able to vote.
---
because theres people like me who forsee the scenario that they will need to reintroduce it when the population re-spikes at each additional phase release.  there's also the other side of it where they get things massively wrong.  like thinking they only needed 4 servers on launch day
---
Thoughts on best skills for a hunter cat pet while leveling? I'm thinking dash and growl are must-haves. But what about the last 2 slots? Bite/claw/prowl?
---
Pet does tend to be main tank in dungeons at times for my friend group (yes it works, we've cleared everything up to Marudon this way), so I want as much threat as possible.
---
So that helps a little, hopefully 😅
---
They're thieves! They're thieves! They're filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us, our precious. Curse them!
---
No not possible. You will be locked to a specific raid ID and can't join other raids.
---
That's what I've done when people invite me, a holy pally with a 2h weapon, to a group as a healer but then want me to tank. Sure, I can try, but my threat isn't great while using little +str gear and I'm 1/3 in cloth for the +int and +heals. I'll roll on the tank gear we come across to help make a less awful tank, but it's not what I'm looking to play as.
---
i dont know how to explain this, but i love the word "rabid", english is my second language and when i read/hear it is like damn, such a cool word.
---
Yeah, it's more "let them fight it out over every mob imaginable until  transfers become high enough to normalize it" lol. That would be an absolute nightmare.
---
I've been pissed about rogues since they fucked assassination going into Legion. WoD assassination (when it was about envenom) was so fun and different. Now it's just an obsession with bleeds.
---
1v1 they are arguably the best class. A geared warlock is something to be feared. With the right spec, you can blow someone up without them having a chance to even think about attacking you. Seduce, soulfire, immolate, Conflagrate. Honestly, PvP is where locks really shine
---
If you’re alliance on Herod it’s even worse. I’ve given up on questing zones during peak hours. Those have become my dungeon times. Instead I’ve been questing in the early mornings and afternoons as i work a pretty early schedule.
---
So, at level 40, I had 120g when I dinged but I thought "Hm. If I buy my mount I wont have enough g to really fund the rest of my levelling / trade skills." (Thinking of possible AH plate upgrades / training / etc). So I decided I'd invest a bit further in the AH with some more items to maybe earn another 50g just to smooth things out a bit. This has backfired tremendously with me having about 200g of items in the AH, but none of it is moving. This consists up an Eye of Flame, several chromatic scales, red dragon scales, living essences, one sword of corruption, tigerstrike mantle, some wildheart pieces, and a few small radiant shards. So while I can keep playing my Warrior, I have some really fond memories of riding my mount around Feralas and Tanaris and southern STV and was hoping to relive that. Call it unnecessary pride, but it is what it is.
---
What can I do here, exactly? I'll be the first to ridicule my greed (If you feel the need to insult me, go ahead, but I'd rather get some advice). I am essentially sitting at less than 20g now account wide. My warrior is a skinner / leatherworker as I was hoping to make some quick G with the cooldowns in LW (I dont have them yet, am only about 150 skill) but even those are selling for dirt cheap now.
---
I'm on Horde-Atiesh if this helps with any specific advice.
---
I wasn’t being testy, it was an honest question.   The past is the past, and I’m curious about the future.  So I’m the future, you’re on the side of everyone needing. Problem solved
---
thank you :D
---
It’s also why would I as a warrior tank want another person in my run rolling on my loot? I’d rather take some rogues and mages.
---
Say faction 1 is 50% of the server, Faction 2 is 25% of the server, Faction 3 is 25% of the server.
---
Faction 2 and 3 then start ganging up on Faction 1.
---
Tons of beasts in desolace with very high density. Around 35 the basilisks in southern shimmering flats are very good.
---
There are 5 Dark Whelps on my servers AH for less than 25g... wish I could afford them all
---
daggers and hemo is so bad...horrible dmg per energy using a low damage weapon with hemo
---
The best way is to keep leveling.
---
Not in a raiding environment, enrage + MCP takes care of the initial rage. In dungeons however it can be harder to maintain but is usually fixed my doing slightly bigger pulls if your gear allows it.
---
No, it's something I've wanted to know about and I've asked it once or twice before. No stalking, maybe coincidence. It seems like it could work because it causes increased queue times which can help balance servers, last time they tried to balance it with rewards and people said it was OP rewards but it was the closest we had to balanced warmode shards.
---
TIL. I thought that was a cata thing.
---
Screech OP.
---
Thanks everyone for the replies.  I think I'll continue with my Warlock!
---
Someday if I have time for an alt, immediately doing that troll shadow priest haha
---
If they have I haven’t noticed. I get ignored by them unless I successfully tag or skin one. Then I have screen shots of me getting told I don’t belong here or to move on, followed shortly by an alliance member who comes and kills me every single time a Dino pops.
---
If that’s the reasoning for people doing this, it’s the dumbest reason for anything I’ve heard in awhile.
---
Who’s the tank?
---
i promise it’s so much better than retail. i played PVE on retail from cata up. but pvp classic-wolk? golden.
---
But i thought fury has that too because you have to get that in order to get impale
---
Hey everyone! I just wanted to put this out here again. 
---
A while back, during name reservation and when all the discords started popping up for each realm, I grabbed classicdiscord.net and set up subdomains for each server, like http://herod.classicdiscord.net and for the classes, like http://priest.classicdiscord.net (from the reddit wiki here), to make all these discords easier to find since there seemed to be so many rising.
---
We got a new host, searchable design, and many more of the various server discords added to our list! If you know of any servers that should be on our list, please drops us a message at the [support discord](http://support.classicdiscord.net)! Thanks!
---
Commenting to save. WoW!
---
The raid would get a higher dps output with a hunter meleing.
---
Right, neither do their aura buffs that feral and boomkin provide. It does make sense, it's all coupled with them also being the least played out of all classes (which weirdly enough has the most variety of all classes.)
---
In a LBRS runa week or two ago. Two warriors (neither are prot) and me (huntard). The tank gets angry when the other warrior roles on tank gear. Has a fucking meltdown because he's the tank. Halycon drops the mail bracers. Tank rolls need because his main spec is fury. I lost and wasn't happy but didn't say anything. The healer points out the irony in the roll on dps gear, he just blows it off. What can I do? What's done is done. 
---
But I am playing the long con. I've seen him frequently advertising HoJ runs. He likes to stack the group so he has no competition. I've joined them repeatedly under the guise that they hit the arena first. I don't give a fuck about that epic chest piece that won't drop. I am there to fuck him out of the HoJ. I absolutely will roll need on that HoJ "because it has attack power." And if I win, my revenge will be complete.
---
Dude you gotta be a troll or like 14 years old to honestly believe what your saying.
---
When they added achievements in WotLK, there were some pretty good city raids. If you killed the leader in every capital city you got a cool bear mount.
---
Yeah once I started BRD I've found it really wasn't viable to tank with a 2H.
---
Because it doesn’t work like that. If I’m a rogue in your raid group I’m going to look at you like this - you are purposely contributing less to the raid out of semi selfishness. You should be dead last to receive raid loot. All the other rogues are specced to best benefit the raid and you are not. 
---
Maybe you’re cool with that. Maybe your guild doesn’t care. I won’t presume to know - but surely you can see where this comes from. 
---
Just go full Hemo and at least be blatant about your intentions. You’d at least have my respect for that.
---
But this halfway nonsense just means you’re still pulling less weight in PvE but trying to justify it more in your own head.  That wouldn’t sit right with me. Alas, I don’t speak for everyone though. 
---
Bottom line in my opinion - spend the 50g to respec like everyone else - or just stay in PvP spec so at least everyone in the raid can easily understand your selfishness and gear you accordingly.
---
Edit: this is more of a thought process argument than anything else - not even mentioning how badly this is for PvP missing assassination talents.
---
Yeah it was annoying when I was leveling as ele and healing for dungeons. Luckily I was in the "fast" group of levelers so most of them waited for mana or realized they couldn't pull 2 groups. 
---
But then you get that one dipshit who thinks "ME HAVE RAVAGER ME GOOD!!!" And pulled 6 ZF mobs
---
If we’re talking 1vs1 situations Id say SPriests and Warlocks are the absolute best counters to Mages.  
---
IMO Warriors or Druids counter Rogues and to be honest Druids do pretty well against Mages as well if you’re looking for a class that can fight both effectively.
---
Only thing more pathetic than those people are people like you who rush to defend a multi billion dollar company that has done nothing to earn our trust
---
Which is why Swipe is one of your best to avoid oomage.
---
Hurricane has a 1min CD and thus wouldn't be a reliable spell to use every pull.
---
There are literally tens of dozens of addons capable of doing this. There was even a post on here a day or two ago of someone who made a HUD with Weakaura's. But for the lazy googlers; Luna Unit Frames, ElvUi, ShadowUnitFrames, IceHud, SpartanUI, Whoa UnitFrames,....
---
Do you play on Earthfury by any chance:)?
---
Warlocks are straight up broken
---
Because vendor money is often hundreds of times less money than BoE money? how is that not a difference. Wtf.... some people are so thick skulled. 100-500g toward a mount you have on your character forever is worth more than a piece of gear you're going to replace.
---
Its not taking gear from 1 person when 5 people did the work to earn that drop. you are being just as selfish expecting the gear being yours when you wouldn't have it without the help of those 4 other people. 5 people get a chance to benefit from your collective work especially BoE,  The all need, is to prevent someone from taking the item with an unfair roll.
---
also ive been abiding by this rule since vanilla and now classic and no one has blacklisted me, sounds like the whiny babies keeping track of their little black lists are the cancer of the community not the people who want everyone to get a fair chance at rewards. Dont call me a snake for trying to prevent snakes. You must've been a cata baby. hehe
---
Why don't you disable the Blizz art bar if you don't use it ?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
This is the only real place where they discuss technical stuff as far as I know
---
Now they need to up the respawn rate on rich thorium veins. Cause as it stands its absolute dog shit to farm that stuff.
---
Owl for screech
---
I don't have a cause, you're still projecting something onto my statement that isn't there.
---
Oh i never heard of that, so more people could be on a server but they cant see eachother?
---
Not sure why you're being condescending. 
---
The point is having code that only runs smoothly on hardware from the future doesn't automatically mean you're ahead of the times. Most of the time in this industry it just means you're bad at your job.
---
i'm not rereading all of that i'm just going to skip to the last sentence.
---
Just have bodies in the front and stop them from getting to the mages. Large scale PvP doesn't matter, it's again, numbers game. Who has more Mages and more people willing to throw themselves in.
---
Large scale world PvP in WoW doesn't exist as tactical or some sort of chess game, to think of it is to think how your farm animals will defend off a alien invasion. 
---
Bring mages, bring more people. That's WoW classic large scale PvP. 
---
Many people had tried to put strategy in it, doesn't matter. Just bring mages, Nova, CoC, Cold Snap, Nova, CoC.

I'm not for ninjalooting but everyone should roll need on boe items. As much as this dude sucks, he's right, who doesn't need gold? Just be cautious and don't greed as soon as the item drops. Say ''all need'' or something like that in the chat. There's no such thing as mainspec on boe items with pugs.
---
Click the name in chat.  Most likely from the combat log.
---
There’s optimization for pvp and then there’s optimization for duels. The latter being taking it way too far. I know I’ll be swapping some things for world pvp but battle chickens and such will not be one of them. Not trying to dishearten anyone but when it’s mandatory to duel someone with 5 trinkets to stretch the epeen, it’s a tough sell.
---
mount speed makes a huge difference!
---
they are coming!
---
If someone thinks you can't use an item that isn't bis, but is only 3 stats away from the best item, they must be the type of people who would never invite dps classes other than rogues warriors and Mages as well. I'm getting my dungeon set, I don't care if it isn't the best.
---
I would give you my money in a second if you could sell hard-copy of this.  $50 or even $100 in a heartbeat.
---
If you lack funds, start a kickstarter.  Seriously.  I would pay you money for this.
---
Surely there must be better trinkets than lifestone? 2% Spell Crit trinket?
---
Had a question about a theme going across a few threads in the sub: is it acceptable to get tier 0 in preparation for raiding, or will you be required to get bis gear? Also, is bis gear better than tier 0 even after accounting for the set bonuses?
---
Let me break down your whole response, to show you how wrong you are
---
&gt; You guys are putting these 400g prices on here arbitrarily to support your point, yet no BoE epic is selling for 400g in classic right now. At least not on my server. 
---
The specific number isn't relevant to the warrant of my point. No counterlogic presented.
---
&gt;  As if equipping an item you can use "ruins" a 400g sale. Wow. Its not if that person can use it. If he would only pay 50g for it, its only worth 50gs to him. Not the 400g you think its worth just because you posted it that high. Ruining its value.. hahaha omg. It has value if the person can use it right away. 
---
Yes, if you equip a BoE item worth 400g it no longer is worth 400g on the auction house, so it does ruin the potential sale(you are wrong). Just because he can use it, doesn't mean he would have had more value selling it for 400g and buying upgrades worth 400g, rather than using it for the 50g value to him. No counterlogic presented, just wrong claims that also have no warrants. 
---
&gt;  Just because you COULD sell it, does not mean you WILL sell it, and does not mean that the person who could use it is ruining the value of anything. It has intrinsic value because that person could use it straight away. Thats the value. 
---
If you could sell it for 400g, then its worth 400g. If you elect to equip it to soulbind it to yourself, you are giving up the opportunity cost of having 400g. The items worth is equal to its opportunity cost, not equal to how much the person who would equip it values it at. Here you attempt at providing warrants, but they have no logic to them, and are simply wrong
---
&gt; Not this imaginary 400g figure you attached to make it seem like MUH GOLDS were being destroyed. So who's entitled? The person who might actually use it or the person complaining about imaginary gold prices? 
---
The 400g isn't an imaginary figure, its used to explain a situation where this is the item's value on the AH. The entitled person would be one who soulbounds a 400g item that is only worth 50g to him, ruining its value just so he can have dibs on it and ensure its his.
---
Imagine druids tanking and using a 49 staff for 2 years lul
---
So the trick with the rotgrip is using light feathers to kite him across the water while you deal enough damage to eventually turn around and blow him up. I haven’t tried yet, but I am planning on it tonight. There is also a strategy with a luffa, don’t know if luffa will get rid of all the bleeds or just one tick though
---
Thanks, mate!
---
That's fine just DnD, like I said I only ask if I'm right next to them in a hub. Not like I pull up to a questing mage and go "U PORT NOW". I hit them with a whisper "hey would you mind giving me an org port? Def will tip!" If no response I just look for another or just flight path
---
It would be nice with auctions if there was a 2 min window before posting went live for review.
---
I'm a healer and what annoys me the most of the 2 handed weapons tanks is the attitude. They always cause wipes by going too fast and because of the increased incoming damage, they require more mana out of me.
---
When we wipe (because of them going too fast or overpulling) they blame everyone and everthing but themselves.
---
They are as annoying as the aoe mages and make everyone lose their time and goodwill.
---
It means a parallel zone, a copy.  It splits the players among the copies so that there's not too many in place and helps make sure there's enough enemies for everyone.
---
Because you could jump between layers by joining up with a player in another one, you could farm certain enemies or do quests more efficiently by hopping between them.  That's why its considered bad, its an unfair advantage for those who had people to help them do it.
---
Its also something the original WoW didn't have.
---
I am going to wear it. I'm going to sell it, buy some devilsaur armor and wear its "essence". Just because it's already converted to something you can wear, doesn't mean you're more deserving of it.
---
Nope, if the tanks is good and your are confident will heals it isn’t annoying however it does leave more room for error. Basically it comes down to how experience the entire group is.
---
Twitch is awful for me all the time.  Stuttering and repeating audio, have to reload the video so often.  Some days it's fine, some days I'm reloading every 3-5 minutes.
---
I'm 99% sure that Bartender lets you do what you're trying to do. 
---
 When I installed it, I had to change Bartender settings to remove the stuff that you're trying to keep.  Type /bartender in the chat to bring up the configuration menu.  Somewhere in there (I think it's the first window called Bars that gives you general options), there's a setting called "Use Blizzard Artwork" or something like that.  
---
I can follow up when I'm at home with better instructions if you can't find it.  
---
Edit:  Just got home and logged on.  In the /bartender configuration screen, mine has a separate window called Blizzard Art Bar listed under the XP Bar on the left.  I would try to re-download Bartender from the Twitch app - I'm guessing that you're missing a file or folder or something.
---
I've always thought they look kinda cool!
---
Naw that only happens when you either have only 2 factions (where it's guaranteed to happen eventually unless the devs keep a deathgrip on faction balance and proactively micromanage it) or when one faction has tons of unique bonuses and the other two have basically none (which is easy to ensure doesn't happen)
---
Having 3 factions means that if one faction grows too big the other two are incentivized to team up against it and work together.
---
And having the incentive be an open world farming zone that forces the faction to compete against itself for spawns/loot means that if one faction becomes too crowded people will move to the smallest faction to have less competition inside the dungeon.
---
Like, you'd never have a perfect 33%/33%/33% under any circumstances. but you'll also never get shit like 80%/10%/10% either---And you definitely won't see servers that are "'full" despite one faction having only like 2 people online at peak hours like you often see in Retail WoW
---
You say that it can be directly exchanged for gold. It can also be directly equipped by someone who needs it. An action that the item is meant for. 
---
How convenient that you've determined the fairest way of dealing with this also happens to be the way in which you happen to stand to benefit from a situation in which you wouldn't have before.
---
Are you on a PvE server or assuming this is someone with 2 accounts. I'm just curious if this would be as frequent on a pvp server.
---
I am not in a raiding guild, and I would agree that in a raiding guild you should be raiding in pve spec. I also regularly alternate between dueling and dungeons/raids so re-speccing is not realistic. 
---
I'm curious if you are in a hardcore raiding guild, because the pvp and casual guilds I have been in usually include many members with non-optimal raiding specs with no issue.
---
I loved PVP in vanilla so of course this time around I was all about rolling on a PVP server. Went Alliance this time since I was Horde previously and wanted to check out the difference.
---
Finally got leveled up high enough to go run a dungeon. After about 30 minutes or so of building the group we were good to go and headed to the entrance.
---
Unfortunately the entrance had a shit load of Horde, plus the elite mobs all over the place. After trying for about an hour to get to the entrance and our group falling apart I decided I don't have the time for this anymore. Swapped to Normal realm and haven't looked back. 
---
WPVP is fun as hell, but now that I have a family and kids I only get so much time to play and it's a huge bummer to want to run a dungeon/quest, but not be able to. I'd suggest if you're not having fun to go ahead and swap now.
---
I had a macro that did the Xena war cry when I charged.
---
Aalalalalalalalalala!
---
savage truth
---
This is some retard fucking logic, you already have lost the valuable BoE in this case. Just always roll need.
---
And if it's a .000001% vs 2% you're astronomically more fucked, and it's still only 2%
---
This^ 
---
My war is engineering/alchemy with an alt funneling mats
---
😂
---
You should watch a YouTube video. It shows a good path, which is the biggest thing. I’d also recommend going in with a friend the first few times so they can bail you out if it goes south. The run back realty sucks
---
&gt; Blizzard isn’t perfect but
---
But as happened to lie, thousands of times. Blizzard simply cannot be trusted, and layering as a concept was indeed worrying, and many early displays of the worst layering could offer popped-up at the same time. None of what was "just in their mind".
---
Just curious, how old are you?
---
  This is coming from the perspective of someone playing Warrior and is new to Classic.
---
If you play Warrior you should be prepared to tank dungeons while leveling. That means keeping a sword and shield in your bag and learning which of your abilities generate aggro.
---
That does NOT mean you have to put points into Protection or you have to tank if you don’t want to or especially if you advertise yourself as DPS when forming groups. 
---
I’m playing Arms. I want to grab 2handers with the biggest numbers I can find and hit things and get big crits and feel like a barbarian. But I chose to play Warrior. It’s unrealistic to expect to never have to tank anything. If I didn’t want the responsibility I could’ve played rogue.
---
Strafing shouldn't be "occasional" in PvP or in any aspect of the game tbh. It should be a major and often used part of how you move your character
---
Not when they are playing WoW.
---
I don't see why you should limit yourself to either. Find an MC pug and do as much as you can and drop group when you need to. If no pugs are raiding MC, or you already cleared it, run dungeons for t0.
---
Turtle to tank and hold aggro?
---
For the most part they've only a few modifications or none at all in order to work. The 14 year old 1.12 addons are a lost cause and are abandoned, it would be faster to rewrite them from scratch.
---
Someone tell my dad they named a guild after me!!
---
Even tier stuff is hard to get as a mage when there are 10 of them in a raid all starved for gear.
---
nah, keep it Classic
---
Hold up, can you explain please?  I wrote that thing off as impossible to get.  Is there some trick?
---
Each server had multiple copies of the game's world within it. To illustrate: there were three Ironforges, three Stormwinds, three Orgrimmars, three STVs, etc. 
---
This allowed people to login with minimal queing. Player A would login and enter World 1, Player B would go to world 2, etc. If player A wanted to group with player B, then one of them would enter player B's world at the same coordinates, effectively putting them into the same layer and allowing them to go group content.
---
Some servers are down to 2 layers. This means all of the players who log in will be distributed between the two copies, making both more populated than before. Some servers are down to 1 layer, so all players are going to enter the one and only layer there is...this is the Vanilla experience.
---
I never understood the hatred for hunters, or why some people won't even group with them.  Having healed on retail for about 11 years.
---
Today while tanking WC I encountered a hunter who was pulling 5+ mobs at once getting us killed, blaming the heal, pettaunting all kinds of stuff, you name it.  Stole a belt which was a huge strength upgrade for me :'(
---
 When I asked him to stop pulling soo much he cursed at me.  I'm well geared so I was moving quickly, but not enough for ya boi the hunter.
---
Anyway I totally understand now and will never play with a hunter again.  I know the class has nothing to do with someone being a dick but after that experience my bigotry towards hunters has expanded beyond reason.
---
Really feels like a woosh moment here.
---
Like... Obviously I don't think this way right?  Just a little fun at the end with a reference to "you think you do, but you don't".
---

I've been using [Vanas Kos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vanaskos). It has various lists you can add ppl to (kill on sight, nice list, naughty list). When you come across someone on one of your lists, the screen flashes and they show up in chat.

You can add little notes when you add characters too. These notes are shown both when you see someone in the open world or when you see them say something in chat.

WoW! I haven't seen this yet.  I'll definitely pop this on while quest tonight!  Thanks a bunch!
---
If you consider quasi-cannibalism "lunch" then yes :)
---
Possession with intent to sell
---
Tanks have a history of having the attitude "I control the flow of the dungeon, without me there wouldn't be a party. Everyone else wants to kill an extra boss but not me? My way or go fuck yourselves."
---
Good thing we can easily just ignore these people in Classic.
---
I started tanking as a new player to WoW in classic a few weeks ago  and am level 51 so take this for what it’s worth.
---
Been using a 1H and shield...I think you can get away with using a 2H but defensive stance is really important due to the increased threat generation.    I’ve seen and read about dual wield fury tanking but from what I understand that’s a post 60 optimal gearing realm.
---
If they can macro to a shield for interrupts and the heals can keep up, it shouldn’t matter.  But ultimately I don’t think most warriors while leveling even bother investing in the defensive stance skills.  You don’t need many of them but they can really help.
---
The reality is while I tank with a board and sword and have a lot of the skills, I haven’t invested in the skill tree(outside of blockx5)...nor has hardly anyone.  Common wisdom and advice from the top tier tanks is to build into fury until 60 then respec.
---
Hasn’t been a problem for me and I can maintain aggro most of the time unless there’s a lot of adds and I’ve got a bunch of melee DPS.
---
It will likely get better as you get closer to 60/hit it.  At that point the main tanks will main tank, and the warriors just trying to level and get dungeon invites will focus on DPSing.  They likely won’t be investing in pre BiS tank gear so you should be able to tell pretty easily by then.
---
Retard mode.
---
Once someone finishes though you can pick up their drops after they loot their kill.  It feels worse but it probably is still a net gain, unless you kill so fast you have to wait on spawns.  Then its worse.
---
Paladins always want to go to SFK.
---
They are using the term LFD to describe both, for heroic queueing and for forming mythic parties. Vs the old days of using General or Trade or LFG chat to form groups.
---
&gt; People dont quit the game once you get 60.
---
You'd be surprised. Leveling is my favorite part. 60 is a part-time job. I've always hated being max-level.
---
Haha, Its not mine to sell. Its Brady Games. I just enhanced it.
---
Your statement of saying I'm ignorant.... is the ignorant statement, thus you are projecting. Take you salty comments somewhere else because whining is annoying just like you and shit warriors that never want to tank.
---
You can do whatever you want, and feel more powerful as you level as well. Of course there's always a best. But it's the same in retar... retail wow. You get an aoe option and a single target option with little synergy. Plus you get classes like druid and shaman in classic that can get away with a lot of different builds.
---
Some of them are similar but have a different interaction with a certain spell/spells.
---
jupp!
---
I'm just under 30 but I try and cycle thru the mobs nearby with sunders and overpowers.  If one work low health peals off I try and let it go if it'll die soon.  Usually I can keep my 2h equipped but for more challenging foes I'll go to sword/board, defensive stance and use taunts.
---
I throw in rends as well but I don't know if that's ideal.
---
Owl, nothing beats screech for aggro (unfortunately) and it really does add a lot of tankyness.
---
I like the boar's Dash to speed things up. And he eats everything. Never had a problem with him holding aggro.
---
People like you are why retail is ruined. “Blizzard please care about me the person who only puts in one hour a day, give me free epics”
---
they'll only do it when you've already gotten into an accident, or if there are 7 other alliance big rigs around.
---
If everyone agrees on this beforehand it works great, the problem is people naturally hit greed like they should be doing and someone takes advantage of that. Again we are talking about a situation where people already hit greed, we can't really use a time machine and make them hit need instead.
---
Mages are required to give water/food to members of their party. This is no different than a buff, a health stone, a summon, or doing your job (healing, tanking, or DPS). 
---
Mages are not required to give water/food to people outside their parties. It is optional. You do it if you feel like it. You can charge for it or choose not to. Choosing to charge, not charge, or just not provide the service is again optional and totally up to the mage.
---
Mages should offer free water/food to guild mates and friends. Many services are provided to the guild for free. This includes enhancing, alchemy, and more. So while a guildmate may tip, you should not ask for it (note the should and not required language). 
---
I was a mage main in vanilla. I sometimes gave food/water for free and sometimes charged for it. I always have it for free to my party or guild. And I always have at least 3 stacks to the healer and 2 stacks to mana users (more for multiple runs/farms). I also offered food to anyone who wanted it in the party. 
---
Now if a random asked for it nicely, I may offer it for free. Note the “may.” If they demanded it or opened a window, I would require a 1g payment. If a random expected me to find them in a non-city zone or drop party or something else, I usually refused unless they paid enough to make it worth my time (much more than 1g). 
---
Now I don’t play a mage. I pay for mage water. 1g for a full trade window set of max level water. 50 silver for lower level water (e.g. my resto shaman is a 37 alt so only needs the 35 or 25 water). 
---
Anyone who demands a mage to make water for free when the mage is not in their party is the entitled person. Any mage who refuses to make water/food for all party members (includes water for other DPS) is the entitled person. Any mage who refuses to provide water/food or charges randoms is perfectly fine.
---
Oh man you really got me with that one. How will I ever recover?
---
No but I am not stuck in a situation where I look at the lazy fury warrior in my group fishing in Tanaris while we're asking for a fucking tank in a capital; a position he could accomplish if he actually bothered.
---
Only if everyone else agreed to roll greed on BoEs. Most modern groups, everyone rolls need on BoEs to *prevent* ninja looting.
---
Yeah, I feel you. Took me a couple of weeks to really set it up for good. I've spent way to much time tweaking it than I should have lol
---
But when it's done, optimized by you, for you, it's really nice!

I dunno man. There’s a very short amount of people that have reached end game and even shorter are the people who will run out of stuff to do. If you find yourself reaching that, you have been completely consumed by the game. I’m playing with buddies who have 8+ days and are just reaching 60, and I’m sitting at 4 at 43. We have different work responsibilities but if you have ran mc/ony multiple times, already preBiS you have literally no lifed it. The only thing phase 2 is rolling out that could light a spark to the economy and some players are bgs. But even then, allowing a super small group to honor farm to start their grind to rank 14 seems counter intuitive.
---
Hmm, I don't know. Most of the retarded changes started happening at the very tail end of Wrath or even during Cata pre-patch, so it's hardly representative of the expansion. I personally miss Wrath's PvP so much ... S8 was simply the most balanced season ever, every single class and spec was playable at R1 level. Northrend ? The most beautiful continent. Once they nerfed DKs in the first patch, Wrath had simply amazing gameplay.
---
While I understand telling a warrior to tank without his previous consent is weird, is that such a big problem though? I mean I keep a 1h, a shield and a few pieces to offset my leather gear just in case people want me to tank. I mean so far it was 50/50 and really isn't a huge problem, I just want to run through the dungeon, finish my quests and be done with it as I'm sure the case with most people. Makes zero difference if I'm tanking or dpsing. Why is it such a big deal if people ask you to tank?
---
..yes but that's an additional area to get half a level pretty quickly.. ? You said it really isn't a levelling zone, I'm going against your statement. It's a great place
---
What's your server and character?
---
RIP all the bitches who swap layers to avoid pvp.

Not a big fan of that site personally

Reddit has a built in save function that is very reliable. I have links still saved from 7 years ago.
---
Highest threat but not highest threat per rage point.
---
I'll try it out, thanks!
---
You would be hard pressed to heal someone in a  raid for 2300 on a 3.5 sec cast and not overheal.   So pretty much, 100% of the time.
---
Now in a 5 man where you have more control, you could avoid most overheal.
---
I can't tell if you are trolling or... But I will try to break this down for you...
---
The post you replied to is taking the given "everyone greeds, ninja needs, you haven't rolled." In this case the before past is stating that they prefer to need against the ninja giving it a coin flip to prevent their ninja. Afterwards then they /roll it with the group if he wins.  
---
His two options, need or dont give the following chances.
---
Need / Other (Greed/pass) In a 5 man group.  
---
Ninja: 50% / 100%  
---
Him: 12.5% / 0%
---
Everyone else: 12.5% / 0%  
---
Clearly needing is the best option.
---
well yes I use that with my PvE gear. It’s not like I use any tier1 gear in PvE either :p
---
I find healers that can’t drink as soon as combat ends and freak out if the tank does a small pull while they’re still drinking more annoying
---
For many/most classes, tier gear isn't very useful.  Spell damage, crit, hit healing, etc are all generally the stats you go for, and sets basically don't have these stats.  They're still good enough to do tier 1 content because that's so easy, but most decent guilds would prefer you to get actual BiS gear.
---
"In what world is that a hunter weapon"
---
laughed pretty hard when that came up

If that taunts rag we know he isn’t an engineer!
---
I'm leveling with the same build - just some advice! Take LOTP and then respec at 60 to switch it out for Nature's swiftness. You're missing out on the single strongest talent for DPS feral druids have. You're not going to be able to pick up NS until 60 anyway, so you might as well level with 3% extra crit (which is a huge DPS bump) and then respec to grab NS at 60 (which is my plan.) You're going to have to respec at 60 anyway to move some of the talents you picked up in feral that are good for leveling but not for endgame HOTW build.
---
t1 then t2 is great for pvp and bgs. 
---
well, pvp gear is awesome for pve. 
---
until aq40, you are in greens/crafted gear mostly
---
The problem with Feral DPS is that it’s middle of the road DPS wise at best but requires twice the effort to get there compared to a Rogue or Mage which is why you tended to not see many end game kitties. 
---
If you’re interested in raiding as Druid you’ll more than likely be healing or *maybe* as an off tank.
---
I think it would be pretty presumptuous to assume people will dedicate several weeks of raiding, knowing fully that they will get nothing until they meet some vague and undefined "graduation" point.  These people are being told that until someone decides that they've put in enough time, they're essentially working for free, spending money on repairs and consumables for nothing.  Yes, people can join a raid and not get any loot, but that can just be bad luck with drops and/or rolls.  These people don't even get a chance to have bad luck, they are essentially being told to do the job "for exposure".
---
If instead the leaders had presented a set of guidelines for becoming a "raider" along with expectations to achieve that, then they might have some ground to stand on. For example, if they started out by saying to everyone that they are on trial until they've completed a raid with the guild.  They want to be sure that the trial members can show up on time, show up prepared, follow direction, perform their role, and take advice if given if they screw up.  If they stick with it and make it through the raid, the trial period is over they can begin getting loot the following week.  Sure not everyone will like this, and some may /gquit, but the ones who stay have a solid understanding of what is expected of them, and the timeline they can expect things to change if they meet said requirements.
---
Lower starting bid means less auction deposit. Maybe that’s why???
---
There’s a shitload of entitled people in here saying “yeah but if you’re playing a warrior you should expect to tank because you have a tank spec”
---
Those people can honestly go fuck themselves silly with this mentality. If I don’t want to tank I’m absolutely not going to tank and you can enjoy finding someone else to fill your DPS spot.
---
Someone give this guy a medal. I’m a new player and it’s hard to enjoy the game when you can’t even put on some gear you like without someone calling it “trash” because it’s like 1% less efficient than some other build.
---
Like no one ever was?
---
Report move on.
---
How much free space do you have on your ssd? A full one will be slower.
---
You are trying to prevent something by becoming the same thing. Let's say purple drops, only the person who would use it rolls need, everyone else rolls greed besides you, since by your logic it is mandatory to roll need. Is that not being a ninja. You can not assume, that everyone is a ninja and act accordingly. This logic will just multiply the amount of ninjaing
---
I used to play PvP, but I decided for Classic I would roll PvE and just wait for Battlegrounds to be released as I couldn't deal with the stress of being ganked anymore. There have been so many occasions where I would have been caught out, and my afternoon ruined by large groups of Horde.   
---
Instead I partake in PvE ganking, which for me is stealing their skinning loot. Then I can go on my merry way and level up. At this age I'm totally okay with that.  
---
That said I have recently rolled Horde on a PvP realm, so will see how that goes.
---
Just skip it until you have a mount, astral recall(15m hearth CD + hearthstone OP), and all the FPs.  Or pick it up and do the spots when you're in the area anyway - IE, ashenvale, SFK, hillsbrad, etc all have quests that should interest you from 20-30. Also you might be able to get lock summons to do SFK and skip the zepp ride.
---
Unless you go resto and are leveling with friends water totem is optional.
---
If they kill all the shit. Then spend a couple minutes hopping. Then kill all that shit, then spend a few more minutes hopping back it's probably pretty close to the spawn rate of the monsters.
---
* Stick close to other rogues or melee if you don't know where to stand.
---
* Slowly ramp up your DPS so the tank can get aggro.
---
* If you do get aggro on something, don't run away, run toward the tank that should have aggro.
---
* Make sure you have flasks / potions (can't remember the right ones - long time ago)
---
* Pay very close attention on Baron Geddon (MW2713 you're the bomb!) so you don't blow up the raid
---
* Get the mods GTFO and Deadly Boss Mods
---
As much as I'm disgusted at the thought of a hunter rolling on HoJ, at least that guy deserves it lol
---
Are respawn times going down too? I'd like to do my quests, y'know.
---
That is why in the title I put phase 1 in the title because it is a good spec to use while gearing up.
---
It is a very good pvp spec in my opinion, however, not the best. In place of cold blood you do get improved sprint and improved kick. I still agree that cold blood spec is better, but I don't think it is fair to say that it is not a good pvp spec.
---
Accurate af

It was in the 2nd sentence! The 2ND!!

Am I supposed to read EVERY damn sentence before I post???

Definitely a bot. Report that fool!
---
Just had the same thought!
---
The Huntard meme continues in classic.
---
Hunter and mage/lock are the only classes I never played, maxed the rest.
---
So I rolled a Hunter, because I wanted the vanilla feeling on something new, but I actually feel the rage against Bunders, even when I need on a Hunter Agi leather rogues get pissed on me.
---
People dont reply if I /w them after a "LFG dps needed"
---
IF I get invited people start telling me how to manage my pet instantly.
---
But yeah I seen many reasons why this is...sadly...
---
And it does feel rewarding when people notice a good hunter.
---
As a fellow warrior I really like your UI, what addons did you use/how did you make it?
---
Also found it to be true. I did ST without issue, but after that it’s really sword and board
---
I turned spacebar into frostbolt for her on an alt, she pulls some sick deeps! Loves smashing that space bar, lol!

Youll also probably want weapon swap macros.

I think i saw macros on either the wowhead classic portal or the icy veins classic one.

Also Darnassus is a ghost town, because it's not close to anything and it's ultra confusing to navigate. If you're in a city, type in Trade Chat rather than city chat (defaults to chat channel 2). Trade chat shows your dialogue to all characters currently in trade chat, which encompasses IF, SW, and Darnassus all three. 
---
BFD is a little behind the leveling curve at this point, so might be a LITTLE longer to find a group than it was 2-3 weeks ago, but should still be relatively popular. It's one of the first dungeons Alliance can do, so it's good for leveling through the mid 20s.
---
While I see no reason for warrior to refuse tanking, you're being really silly with your statements, I'm yet to see mages beat my sweeping strikes+whirlwind combo that deletes packs in seconds with their silly blizzard. When I'm asked to dps instead of tanking, which happens often, I can more than pull my weight.
---
Does anyone know if the Hakkari Breastplate/Shroud is available in Steel Lockboxes or from Un’Goro gorillas? It was in private servers and I asked a GM and they said they couldn’t provide that type of information.
---
What nonsense...we've been legit tanks since early vanilla after they fixed armor scaling.
---
I had a Cat on Vanilla that held it's own in solo farming, I wouldn't recommend anything ranged since you need it to be away from you to juggle aggro for some fights.
---
Those are the dead realms with a measly "Medium" pop.
---
All the Full realms will probably have layering for months still.
---
There’s some famous main tank warriors who continued to play vanilla on private servers and push clear time records, and they all agree early tanking is better as arms over prot. Biggest factor being rage and threat, not survivability. If dps have to throttle so hard that delays the dungeon, delays pulls etc. In a pug if they don’t throttle your prot tree just cost the healer way more mana by having to heal the dps pulling off the rage starved prot warr
---
I don't see any reason to hold off phase 2 once the layering is solved.  They should release it as soon as they can.  Phase 2 doesn't add a big stage to the end game, Dire Maul is really nice to have as another dungeon option.
---
Layering to multi-kill world bosses would be a serious problem, which is why they need to get it solved first, but beyond that there's no real reason to wait.
---
&gt;On top of that add in dungeons where i dont know the path through
---
Being the tank doesn't make you the "leader", and being the party owner doesn't make you the "leader" either. Whoever knows the dungeon or raid is the leader.
---
I've done LBRS maybe 3 times, ever. Once was last night, the other two times were 14 years ago. As the tank, I just said "I don't know this dungeon", and our dps shaman said "Ok, I'll mark." That was all it took. I had to check party chat every now and then, and he'd say "LoS these next 2 packs" or "there's a patrol we should wait for in the next hall" or "we go left here, and after the next boss jump down". It went just as fast and smooth as any other dungeon where I took the lead and knew the pulls.
---
shaman is good in melee? I heard they're a kiting class
---
People use the addon spy and add people to KOS list. It will notify you when you are close to a KOS player. A lot of people go out of their way to gank KOS targets, at least where I play.
---
accurate
---
“Im well geared” of course gotta work the brag in there cant have a story be believable now can we?
---
To be fair...he goes on to describe a meta spec (bear tanking) and just misapplied the label to himself.
---
A lot of people are probably really mad that you snagged that lol
---
I've officially given up playing on Herod. I was trying to play with my friend there, but he took 2 weeks off work and zoomed up to 60. I'm just now hitting 51. 
---
I simply can't do a single quest without getting ganked by horde repeatedly. And since there's fewer alliance it's not even like groups are happening all the time either for dungeons. 
---
Rerolled pve today.
---
Do you have the battle.net desktop app? I wasn’t even aware you could launch WoW via steam
---
WHAT ARE THOOOOOOOSSE
---
My apologizes for not being specific haha. I wasn’t saying you as in you specifically, u/BrewingEndurance, but just that’s the common response/argument that I see all over this subreddit &amp; in-game chat. I was speaking generally to squash that argument before someone comments it
---
Just lvled till 30. How long should i expect my journey to be ? How does 30-60 compare to 1-30 ? Is it twice as long? Would like a rough estimate

Well, if shamans are Doctors, he’s trying to complete his dream of being the Spin Doctor.
---
I mean, without the guild what's holding you to the server
---
&gt;Why the fuck should you be entirely entitled to the pile of gold just because it's already been converted to a BoE you can equip?
---
Rarity. If there aren't any on the server, then getting it to drop may be one of the only chances.
---
No one is 'entitled' to anything, but if it's going to be used for actual game play?
---
If the cost is cheap enough and the item abundant and the people random? Yeah, it should just be gold.
---
I'm not sure about "required" to get BiS gear, but at this point that should be what you're going for. If you don't have full BiS, I don't think any reasonable group will forbid you from coming. Our general goal is to be level 58+, and you're good to go. We're not too concerned with people's gear at this point, maybe for later phases when you need Tier 1/2/3 gear to continue progressing, but right now it's kind of a free for all on what gear is required.
---
how do you get control of world chat?
---
It’s not the 2 handed weapon that is annoying it’s the tanking skill. I’ve tanked with 2h and dual wield successfully with mind of mana levels. But with that said there’s a lot of healers there like priests that get lazy and toss shields on us and get pissy when we can’t get enuff rage to pull aggro. It’s all about player skill.
---
Is the AH the only place where value comes from? No? Then you are wrong. If I place value in the item enough to equip it, thats its value to me. Just because it could have sold for whatever doesn't mean thats the value to me. Shit, how can you be so wrong trying to prove someone else is wrong? You are conflating value and $$$, which are not the same thing. Maybe they are to you, but they aren't to normal people. Value can come in many forms. It isn't always money. and the person who equips an item isn't taking money from other people because they never had that item before it appeared. He isn't ruining value except in your eyes. You value the gold, other people value the item. If its an upgrade for me, I'm gonna use it. I'm not stealing gold from anyone in the process, because they didn't have that item or gold in the first place.

~~Why can you not just designate a lvl 35 alt for Flask making?~~ Are there some things BoP you cannot making at 35?

Ahh, the Flasks can only be made inside specific Raids/Duns.

If you have 2 accounts one horde and one alliance you can do it no problem.  Why do you think it wouldnt be possible? 
---
It doesnt look like they added a bnet account. Looks like they just whispered him.
---
I found about 9 of them doing my time in the pots game. One for me, one for alt, one for guildy, 2 for AH, vendered the rest.
---
It's a lot of fun
---
Needing an item should have made it bop
---
I always helped out paladin, warriors or priests to kill their mobs since they take like forever to do so. 
---
Don't help paladins anymore, i /wave, they sit down to drink, and when i'm killing something it's "stun + autoattack"
---
I enjoy killing them tho, after bubble i just sitndown and wait their heals.
---
Fury prot builds are for end game raiding. When dps out scales your tps. For dungeons tactical mastery is so useful for the initial pull. If mages keep pulling the pack off of you it’s ok don’t worry, they will frost nova and then slow them and continue to AoE and ice blocking if they mess up. The pack will most likely be dead soon after.
---
Just keep any mobs off the healer. Before a boss pull ask for some more time to grab aggro. If they don’t wait try your best to grab aggro back But if they die it was their fault not yours. 
---
I kinda like when dps pulls off me on bosses as it tests my abilities to control the situation. I mean it’s not good for the group if you wipe but it’s a great experience to learn from.
---
Yeah cause we are all private server minmaxers
---
I'm an EST player playing on EST server because I
---
That's a 50 DKP minus.
---
I would love to see progression servers that you can copy your classic character to (and keep your classic account for classic+) I think the retail experience would be way better if I could play through all the expansions in the matter of 2-3 years and get all the content in 'phases' without massive breaks in-between.
---
You're totally right. I should not have framed my response in such a way.
---
I’m not downvoting you and I’m not arguing whether layering could be bad. People were adamant blizzard was not going to get rid of layering, despite numerous statements otherwise. They made this up, and they were wrong.
---
Yep. Brokentooth is *technically* the best outside of corner cases like Blessing of Sanctuary, but in practice it's just generally not worth it when you can just go to Swamp of Sorrows and get a 1.2 speed cat easily. There's this weird thing in the Classic community about prioritizing pet attack speed over everything else though even though there's no benefit to it.
---
I’ll play what I want in whatever spec I want and tell people who expect otherwise to go fuck themselves.  The fuck kind of entitlement is this?????
---
Shellfish quest in the desolace. I made about 120g in about 6ish hours
---
The half way point in exp is at lvl 43
---
It wasnt a guild tradition but it was my tradition, on my private server guild whenever someone left I would say "and now his watch has ended"
---
Yeah, but they don't touch daggers, ranged weapons, or staves.
---
42 or 44 is the halfway point in time played. 1-30 is about 25% of the way.
---
I love pkaying the least played classes. I chose druid for classic and ive been having a blast. I'm 58 and constantly get msged to tank or heal a group
---
That's why I'm saying that "everyone greeds, ninja needs, you haven't rolled" is a stupid situation to put yourself into. 
---
Let's say 3 people greeded, Ninja needed, and 1 person has not rolled. It now is beneficial for the 1 person to also need. This gives the ninja only a 50% chance of winning the roll.
---
Let's say 2 people greeded, Ninja needed, and 2 people have not rolled. It now is beneficial for both of the people to also need. This gives the ninja only a 33% chance of winning the roll.
---
Let's say 1 person greeded, Ninja needed, and 3 people have not rolled. It now is beneficial for everyone to also need. This gives the ninja only a 25% chance of winning the roll.
---
Let's say Ninja needed, and 4 people have not rolled. It now is beneficial for everyone to also need. This gives the ninja only a 20% chance of winning the roll, equal to every other person.
---
By this logic, just always roll need.
---
where's gehennas wth

Like everywhere? Questing during peak hours is pointless.
---
hey man I'm not that easy
---
This is my favorite thing people say who know absolutely nothing about blizzard.
---
1) Blizzard deals with far more backlash and money spent dealing with false reports allowing multiboxers than what they make. There is a few thousand multiboxers. They aren't doing it for the money, nor have they ever.
---
2) There is hardly any advantage at all. You don't make 5x their gold, you MIGHT make 2x, on the best days. Any solo farming AOE grind mage will out farm almost any major multiboxer. You don't do 5x their damage, because you're not multiboxing 5x mages, almost all multiboxers are composed teams of healers, tanks, and situational DPS, damage is hardly even relevant, you have TONS of downtime, watch any fucking multiboxer stream, there is constantly issues, you can have any or all of my macros fail, your software fail, you hit the wrong macro, your heals fail, its a regular thing. You DONT need to find a dungeon group, that's why most do it, that's not some kind of insane advantage over normal users, join a guild. I leveled 5 characters to 60 in the same I could of leveled 5 characters to 60 doing it solo, because leveling 5 characters while multiboxing is one of the most inefficient leveling schemes in existence. While you kill 80 mobs for a drop item quest, I must kill 500+, waiting on respawns, and relying/hoping other people aren't competing for mobs means that my quest times are 10x yours, meaning I am far slower, even on a 1 account average.
---
You obviously know literally nothing about multiboxing, and you're just making things up as if its a perfect world. Don't theory craft something you have zero experience with, because you're not basing any metric in reality, just trying to fit your own obscure opinion that is clearly wrong and misguided.
---
You could be growing 10K at him and he wouldn't do it. 
---
You got to understand that he could get into mayor trouble redistributing this for money. 
---
Nothing is keeping you from sending this file to a quality print shop and getting it printed though.
---
thats not a gear upgrade and therefore a moot point.
---
Most pre-raid bis lists give both phase 1 and phase 2 lists that change things out for Dire Maul items.
---
That's not even half the servers.  It's 13 of 35 NA realms.  Basically it's only the low pop realms.   
---
What's going to happen on the popular servers if the population never drops?  Or what happens when the population jumps when the war effort starts?  It will be enabled again because the game cannot handle 2k people in one zone at the same time.
---
How accusatory. You know nothing about me other than I think you're fucking idiots for passing on BoEs and then posting on Reddit complaining about not getting the loot you didn't roll on.
---
I tell guildies this all the time. Everyone is going to have to grind mobs at some point.
---
Yes but I don't think it's something I'm noticing at my lvl.
---
Yeah, the pitchfork and torches of anti-multiboxers came here to do exactly what this thread called people out for doing. Got to love stupidity with a hint of irony. Makes the best dishes.

And my sword!

Forgive me for being naive but how does it help?
---
Yea, I’m mistaking it with something else. They definitely sell, there’s just a lot of competition for those mobs outside of early morning when servers near empty.
---
There are druid only flight paths???
---
Now to find out how the plotter at work works.
---
You would eat away at the XP he will get. Having said that it is still pretty decent XP especially if you are a class that can kill tons of mobs at once. And your friends have a lot of quests for that dungeon
---
So true and so annoying
---
They were wrong; but assuming Blizzard would not keep their word was not weird at all.
---
If the transfers are still open I think earthfury has a healthy ally population.
---
Depends how extreme you're talking. If you have something ridiculous like 2000ms ping? Then sure, it'll take an extra ~2 seconds for something to show up on your client compared to someone with ~20ms. If you're talking about something like 100ms vs 20ms? Most people aren't going to notice a 0.08 second difference in how long it takes for something to show up.
---
And beyond all of that, the bandwidth of your connection has nothing to do with your ping. Bandwidth is only about how much data can fit through at once. WoW only transmits very small amounts at a time so getting a higher bandwidth connection will make no difference, the primary factor is how close you are to the server.
---
Pretty certain that you can't use the Gnomish Mind Control cap to throw people off the boats. It doesn't MC you the same way Priests do. It makes you their pet, so unless there is someone in the water that they can send you off to attack, they don't have a way to make you move.
---
It's intelligent load management to prevent lag, congestion and bottlenecking in starter zones. Feels weird but works great.
---
Where are your legs Rag?
---
newsflash. A good 90% of guilds are not competitive.  Getting consumables is as easy as going to the AH and purchasing it,  can hardly compare it to gear that is often rare or not easy to get...Let people play how they want to play.  The tier set might not be the absolute best for his spec, but that doesn't mean it isn't good gear.
---
That's kind of a weird thing to have happen. Is there more to this?

I think he's just trying to impress people or something as if playing on a private server is an achievement lol. Gromsblood were not 50g lol. Like what?

Hahah!
---
Might be the first horde from our server ive encountered on here. 
---
I have absolutely loved the balance as well.
---
Hillsbrad skirmishes are so fun, the back and forth until one side wins is epic and even if one side is dominating for a bit it usually doesn’t last long before backup shows up and the clash just gets bigger. 
---
I started on Mankrik (normal server) the first week of classic but rerolled to a PvP server and chose Blaumeux because it’s a PST server. 
---
Couldn’t believe my luck with it always being high pop, no ques, and the faction balance (seems like we both got lucky in this regard). 
---
Not sure what level you are, but if you know of the horde fellas that were safe spotting in gadgetzan last night..they got reported a lot lmao.

[Obligatory Frank Zappa!](https://youtu.be/fiu6DFXeF9A)
---
My brother is leveling a priest alongside me, and while it’s a great class, the majority of his dps comes from wanding stuff to death. It’s not very exciting but at least it’s efficient.
---
DPS you can just stand around and focus on your rotation. Tanking you have to gather this mob pull aggro off the healer and generally have situational awareness. Christ caster DPS is even easier. You can be blackout drunk and still be able to target of target the tank and do your rotation. Tanking is a good skill to learn and have but I completely understand the urge to just coast off other peoples skills for an hour. I like healing for pretty much the same reason. You can be a great healer and be only partially paying attention.

This is so insanely lame. So all the original exploiters got the chance to level up stupidly fast and the rest of us are all screwed now? First he raid XP we never got to exploit got nerfed and now this? GG blizzard.
---
Good man, thank you for the support. =)
---
I wonder if they were goofing on ya. If I got an item I was going to use and someone said that AH comment to me I’d reply similarly.
---
get one and time your hamstring spam between your MH attacks - same goes for anything else. You basically want to see MH &gt; yellow &gt; MH &gt;yellow &gt;MH &gt; yellow on CD? Hamstring and each time you go over 60 rage you want to use a heroic strike.
---
Probably not, I know they all spam Living Action and Free Action Pots.
---
Obiviously someone is going to equip it if they are gonna pay 500+ gold for it.... its not like its gonna keep being resold over and over. Literally the only reason they would buy it off the AH is, to in fact, equip it.
---
Hey! For me, 3g96s would make me extremely happy and wealthy.
---
It’s a more interesting dps mechanic overall. Weaving in heroics and hamstrings is more fun than SS with energy after white swing and keeping up slide and dice. 
---
And you can get really good with LiPs to avoid dying as a warrior if pulling agro in trash is that big of an issue. Rogues do as well as they do. Warriors do as well as their tank allows
---
Good thing I wasn't being an ass.
---
I love fearing groups of alliance in the back room.
---
Why was i not able to do it then? That makes no sense.... Is it because I'm on a pvp server and you are on a normal one? 
---
Wait no you have to be on pvp server because you killed horde
---
To be fair to those people modern blizzard has given them a lot of reasons to be skeptical.
---
WoD was supposed to contain models updates for all races to use the new facial rigging from MoP.
---
Except Blood Elves/Draenei/Worgen/Goblins "would be coming sometime later in the expansion"---Oh wait nevermind, Goblins and Worgens will be coming at legion launch.
---
Sorry, did I say legion? I meant
---
 7.1, no wait 7.2, sorry 7.3... What? Why aren't they out? I said 7.3.5... Oh, it's already 7.3.5? They'll be coming with the next expansion.
---
Hey! 8.0 is out! Huh? Where are the Worgen/Goblins? Oooh, I meant they'd be out sometime during the course of this expansion. They'll be ready in 8.1. Sorry, I meant 8.2..... Actually I mean 8.2.5 see? We finally have models to show after 6 years!
---
Then there's Enhancement shamans/Feral Druids getting fixed in 7.1 wait no 7.2. wait no 7.3. Hey BFA's here and we've made them even worse, but we'll definitely fix them in 8.1 see, here's a preview of shammy changes that're bland and fail to fix anything... Wait, what's a feral druid? You mean guardian druid, right?
---
What was tangible? Issues from other games? Tangible means based on touch. Blizzard classic had a clearly laid out glide path, they chose not to listen to that based on intangible reasons.
---
I have a question, does the hammer itself Hand of Sulfuras have an internal cooldown for the proc? If so, I guess it’s great but not super special to have windfury synergy regarding it? 
---
I mean it’s good to proc 1 fireball really quick, but is it possible to proc 2 in one Windfury swing?
---
Mostly, RP is done within and between roleplaying guilds.
---
I've found that, despite BB being roughly 2:1 for players, there are more Horde roleplayers.
---
You can form IC groups, but everyone has to be a RPer ... this weekend the Grim Maws are planning on hitting Scarlet Monastry in character btw.

Way to contradict yourself in the same sentance.  And If you could read my other comment I literally say all you have to do is say no. Not cop a fucking fit like a little girl because someone simply asked you to tank. I assume your shit and have been humiliated trying to tank and say things like "warriors suck at AOE threat" "what is stance dancing" so now refuse to tank. Your reaction to me simply saying dont play warrior if you cant handle a simple "could you tank please?" Is astonishing. If you were at all smart youd tank to find groups and get geared for your favorite spec faster not bitch and moan like a 45 year old unhappily married housewife.

Because I have to use brain power to play 5 characters at once, meanwhile most people can barely play their 1 character at 70% correct.

This is literally Blizzards justification.

Quest with a group
---
You only want your health bar on top of your actionbars?
---
Please, come to my office and tell my coworkers this with a straight face. It will go down so well. You're going to change the industry!
---
Dammit you are right, either way I now know better lol
---
So it helps with PVE damage rotation. You always want to use your abilities between auto shots to maximize dps. If you  don't pay attention you can "clip" your auto shot and you will miss out on an auto shot. The times is there to help you not clip any auto shots unless you want to.
---
Holy shit imagine being this dense
---
blockadblock = nope
---
The faction barrier is already a KOS list. 
---
KOS lists don't work anyway. When anyone feels personally attacked by opposing faction members they add people to the list regardless of circumstances. Lose a gank that you initiated? Stick that no lifer, potion using, cooldown popping scrub onto the list.
---
I killed an Olympus officer (asmongold's guild) that was running towards a thorium node I had been clearing towards. I got a message from a level 1 a few minutes later saying I had been put on a KOS list. 
---
It's basically just a list created by petty people who really shouldn't be on a PvP server.
---
We do the usually ding when some levels but we also have a dude that follows up with DONG. He’s our DONG Master
---
Is the quest to kill the 40 elite for the WW axe doable at 30 with a level 30 priest there to help?
---
As a Mage I'm of course intrigued...but also confused.
---
Why is it Mage prio?
---
Iirc, the profile is just for the sizing and location of all the bars, it doesn’t override the spells/macros/bindings of the actual action bar slots, those are still saved in the character profile.
---
yes, but with the extra 1% could mean you can switch out those shoulders and get +20 agi....   it would be very close.
---
Announcing BG queues would *not* be cross server might have encouraged more people to roll Alliance on PvP realms. And yeah, then see how it goes.
---
I'm Horde, I killed Alliance, but yeah, I'm on Deviate Delight, which is RP-PVP. I don't know man. Unless you think I'm faking that screenshot too. But I'm pretty sure a few more people will be able to test this out and chime in that it works.
---
Could your add-on be modifying the context menu, somehow? Or try it out next time you're in a neutral city and practically humping someone to see if that makes a difference.
---
endgame is here
---
LOL! As a Shaman main, this really hits home.
---
Wont change anything. Just more gear from more places. Gonna be some better drops from those sources.
---
yeah health and rage would be nice. it stops me from looking too left, and it would de clutter my screen by not having my character frame right there.
---
Ok well I see it often. Guess you just have gotten unlucky.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
Thats how it was for me during normal vanilla. Raids started at 9pm server time which was midnight for me.
---
We did this, and even do some 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5's. shit was dope, and we are doing it again.
---
Yup, and no addons too!
---
Invest now, sell in a year!

After this post I have realized about 40% of this reddit are just complete morons and assholes. I'm glad you got your account back, and whether they stole it, or bought I off whoever did steal it (Probably the far more likely outcome) it is and will always be your account, as long as you created it. That's exactly what Blizzards TOS says. I'm glad you found someone to treat your situation properly.
---
I really regret rolling on an EST server as an EST player. Mostly because I don't get out of work until 11pm, and I can't find any guilds that start raiding that late, or just raid on weekends. I really should have thought about that ahead of time... But I'm level 59, so it's kinda late for that.
---
If its a "possible upgrade value" then it should also be a "possible AH value" theres no guarantee youll be able to find someone to buy that item. Youre making the assumption that its going to sell for what you think it will. When more often than not itll either sit on AH and not get sold cuz no one has the money to pay what you think its worth or itll eventually get sold after you drop the price a few times.

Hell there are 3 pairs of boots of avoidance on my server's ah that havent been purchased in days.

Pandaren
---
It is exactly the same thing, just on a scale of severity.  That is a very severe example, somebody in guild spamming for layer invites is a very mild example (but increasingly severe when you consider how many people are doing it).  
---
Also that tired "someone else would've" argument is bullshit.  First of all, one thing people are layer hopping for is to level faster, which isn't even a material resource like a node but still has an impact on the game.  Second of all, the entire purpose of hopping a layer is to find something that someone else has NOT gotten.  That's literally the whole point.  Who's to say that node/mob wouldn't have gone unclaimed for another 10, 15, 20 minutes?  Multiple respawn cycles?  The only way you can make the argument that it doesn't increase the rate shit enters the game is if you suggest that the node would've been instantly gathered by some other player anyway.  In which case no one would be layer hopping at all because it would be completely pointless.
---
And I'm not going to split hairs over your use of "really".  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you were actually considering the severity of the effect when you wrote that, in which case you'd be (mostly) correct.  But I've still seen tons of people on here make the categorical argument that you shouldn't care because it doesn't affect you, which is just wrong.

The shield talent is pretty crap so put these points into lightning shield, it helps with questing and dmg in pvp. Can’t you also put the 3 points into the dodge talent? I think that would be the best
---
That is not even close to what I am saying. I am saying why would you automatically cede an epic BoE to a Warrior in a PuG who you don't know is even gonna use it and make use of it efficiently.
---
Super scumbaggy as you're not using it, you're selling it.
---
Not familiar with the stereotype of 2H tanks being overly cocky, but I don't get why so many people are arguing in favor in 2H tanking. Tanking is about mitigation and threat generation, both of which seem superior in defense stance with 1H+shield.
---
windfury does not proc on hit effects
---
Every server being at Medium population or higher when I get home would say the sub count is still doing just fine. And that’s with a handful of them being Full  
---
The more accurate thing to read from it would be that server populations have spread out and less people are bunched up in the earlier zones
---
How dare you try to guild your guild member.
---
Seriously though, there is an obvious logic gap in how they are doing this. That's insane.
---
I'm actually not sure if that's neccesary on classic, but on pservers logging off made you leave the party so that's why.
---
I run a Resto Druid exclusively.  I've healed tanks who run with 2H'ers, and tanks who run sword and board.  I definitely burn through mana quicker when a tank is running a 2H'er.  I've never had issues with the group pausing while I drink though.  
---
I do prefer a tank with sword and board though.  Just because I hate drinking......
---
&gt; We battled in a small tauren camp when we were separated--she held three of the Bristlebacks off by herself. But the odds began to overwhelm us. I led some away only to see her overwhelmed by newcomers. In my rage, I turned to face my enemies, but they brought me down easily with their vast numbers.
---
&gt; I awoke to a tauren druid tending my wounds--he had come across me on the Gold Road as I fell.
---
&gt; Please, &lt;HUSBAND&gt;, find some sign of my wife. 
---
Then, stick a dead orc female inside of it.
---
Idk sure seems like it on fairbanks. Maybe we are a server of try hards or something. My guild has already been raiding for 2-3 weeks.
---
Your point of view is so blatantly wrong that there is no point in even beginning to  attempt to explain why. You are invested in your ignorance indefinitely.
---
Hots aren't really used that much in raids though other than on tanks. They aren't efficient and usually just result in overheals.
---
Hm. How many people said that if Blizzard makes too many servers to accommodate launch hype that many of them would die out after 1 month? 🤔
---
I would buy this as a poster, no hesitation. Amazing work. &lt;3
---
&gt; Can you describe how you left combat 5 times in one duel.
---
Any ability that allows you to peel... lots of classes have them, roots, travel form, stuns, frost nova, hamstring, fear, etc.
---
People getting full tier sets and steamrolling MC meanwhile I'm only lvl 42
---
This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
---
thing is, in some months is when DM comes out and the [Unyielding Maul] comes. This mace is only slightly worse then warden and is free!! so once DM comes out, wardens value plummets.

Damn it. I really like layering. :(

Wait til you find out about people stealing / selling raid ID's.

Activision fired most of the GMs/blizzard support staff. No surprise that the quality of support has taken a nose dive

What makes yoy think they are bots.

Report and move on. Nothing else for anyone to do
---
1.12 had crossrealm BGs though, didn't it?
---
But yeah, they should have waited to see how it worked with single server BG queues first.
---
Nothing wrong with asking. Just say no.
---
Tanaris has a few good quests for that level, and if you just want to grind kills, the wastewater humanoids are easy to kill, drop lots of cash, cloth and trash and that area is heavy with chest spawns
---
Is it still possible to transfer off Herod?
---
I want to do that, but it's not showing up. Do I need to wait until it has a queue tonight?
---
Welcome to hell.
---
Honestly I am sure those accounts get banned fairly fast. They are adding membership using cheaper gold from WoW and getting a token, then coming into classic to spam. So its cheap enough that its worth them doing.
---
Can't wait until it's gone on Kromcrush, I am so sick of seeing "layer inv please" constantly in every chat channel. As always, players find a way to ruin things.
---
No, it's not the same thing because one was an exploit and the other was allowed within the game mechanics.
---
just keybind all the stances. You don't need any macros beyond that.
---
[X] I’m *not* in this picture, and I don’t like it.
---
&gt;Also, do you guys think Blizzard should do something about faction imbalance?
---
I don't think any of us reliably *know* the server imbalances, and how much of a balance is enough to constitute it being imbalanced. We *think* servers are imbalanced. But that's it. 
---
And if Blizz were to do something about imbalance, what should they do? Would you allow Horde to faction swap to Alliance or something? The easier solution is to merge realms, or allow server transfers. But Whitemane is a top 5 server. It will not open to incoming server transfers for the foreseeable future. It will not be merged with another server either. What you can do is bide your time for the next wave of server transfers and go with that. Or, pick a server that's Alliance heavy.
---
It only took me 2 hours to do half a level on a sunday afternoon. I'd do it again.
---
whenever someone joined my guild on Ashkandi-US, we would say Whalecum, and whenever someone logged off or left the guild, everyone would spam f
---
What the fuck does that have to do with anything?
---
Maybe once I’ve bought the epic mount. I’ve got a few things up my sleeve that should make me a bit of gold in phase 2, so maybe I can splurge then. Will they drop the required +hit% I would need as dual wield?
---
Lmao I'm terribly sorry you cant read 4 sentences. No wonder you cant tank. Go play retail toxic little boy.
---
Yeah, I don't expect AV to be very close to how it used to be.  Players are usually familiar with the objectives and how the bosses work.  It's gonna be a good time still, but not as interesting or random as it used to be.  Still can't wait!
---
there isnt that much spellhit in the game, till ZG releases
---
But how about your life, now that you're on every alliance guild's KOS list? Must be tough being the most wanted man in the Horde.
---
Then he can farm gold and buy it from the auction house, same as everyone else.  I seriously cannot understand why people struggle with this idea.  A valuable BoE item is not an item at all - it's a big pile of gold.  It's the same big pile of gold for everyone.  
---
If Edgemaster's Handguards drops, it doesn't matter if there's a dps warrior in your group.  Because it's not Edgemaster's Handguards.  It's 400 gold, for everyone.  To the warlock in the group, that's his Maiden's Circle.  To the mage in the group, that's his Robe of the Archmage.  
---
And for the warrior, that's his Edgemaster's Handguards.  Or maybe it's his Flurry Axe?  Or Cloudkeeper Legplates?  Who knows.  Who cares.  Because it's 400g, period.
---
Found the guy that doesn’t understand probability
---
It is alrighty. At this pace you probably won't get your mount at 40, but it is not all that important. Got mine at level 45.
---
Current server had more auctions, so everything you need is for sale and cheaper. Also, moving to an alliance dominated server is basically a PvE server. I don't want that.
---
I just don't invite the warrior, problem solved.
---
Magitards.
---
Sounds like a shit guild, with a shit GM and scared shitless members.
---
"no u"
---
Yeah they are amazing. And fear is ridiculously strong in Classic. Warlocks are great in 1,12.
---
I hope, that they will not rush the phase 2 Because of the that. It will be great to have some sort of community involvement in the phases progress, like community vote in-game or so. I am lvl 43 rogue, but i like to travel a lot to various zones for quests,  enjoying the world, making professions (230 minning, 235 engineering) - already got mi engineering trinkets with my farmed materials - great feeling. I dont want to just rush through content. 
---
I Also visited almost all dungeons during my leveling with great people. I have a friends on my level, we level together, compare, help with getting mats on our self crafted gear - this is how mmorpg should look like. 
---
I think, that there are a lot of other players like me and i think, that mainly on pvp server, this playstyle could be broken by adding phase 2 too early.
---
Just my feelings. Sorry for my grammar, not a native speaker.
---
Bro... its called *mage*blade not lockblade, not warlockblade, not warblade. *mage*blade
---
AOE farming was not a big thing back then.  People forget WoW recruited people into gaming.  There were loads of people who didn't even know you could eat food to recover health.  Gaming was not very popular, it was fringe. 
---
Fifteen years later, twitch, all sorts of social media, youtube, cheaper computers, phone games, etc., have all created a generation that is now very good, informed gamers.   It's a big difference.
---
Aside, Blizz put in an AOE damage cap sometime before or around the launch of BC.  This would limit a lot of this.
---
Too much to unpack here, but this is not representative of the experience I had. Play the class and spec you enjoy. Sure anyone can cast frostbolt, but I found an extremely high skillcap on most these classes for PVP. For example even Hunter is easy to play, but could be very complex in PVP. Mouseover viper, switching tracking, pack&gt;monkey&gt;hawk, pretrapping, flaring, fake trapping by macroing /sit when fighting rogues over 55 abilities to use etc.
---
hey! :( ^its^level^20
---
Good point, and an important distinction.
---
You could probably just follow the weapon progression of an alliance rogue
---
I thought I had 'caught up to the curve' because certain areas of Tanaris are farmed the hell out; the Wastewander camps and the Pirate cove to name a few.  The lack of layering explains things.
---
Every single argument against this policy comes down to semantics over the definition of "Need/Greed" without people actually understanding the mechanics of the loot rolling system or simple game theory. It's infuriating.
---
It could be a few things like maybe people are waiting for CDs. But in my experience that's not normal with good groups
---
Step 1: Roll need to win a valuable BoE item and equip it
---
Step 2: Keep the item in your backpack during future runs and equip it when you roll need and win another copy of the item
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: Profit!
---
Edited because I’m a noob and all steps were in a single paragraph
---
Reward from 'The Argent Hold'.
---
Definitely a nice aoe shield
---
This guy scared me when I was younger lmao.. now I’m just uncomfortable
---
But do you have the rage to sustain it?
---
Things like this is what keeps me on a PvP Server, I’m usually a solo player and it’s frustrating to be ganked in contested areas but this type of PvP makes it worth it.
---
Once you hit 36 whirlwind is life. Well atleast until 40 and you get mortal strike/Bloodthirst.
---
(I’m) Jealous!
---
"WuBwUbWuBwUbWuBwUb...."
---
It's not that ridiculous.  If he's a higher lvl, it cant really hurt to see if he'd be willing to tank vs what you've got already.  The worst he can say is no.
---
I dont know why people have such an issue with being asked a question.  You just have to say no thanks, and everyone can move on.
---
Man, classic really is harder
---
It's definitely higher than mages, but with the debuff limit it always seems lower on raid bosses.
---
Stupid
---
I main war, I am always *prepared* to tank. But if someone is LF a DPS and accept me coming, and then drop the "but we need you to tank." I'm out. I dont always want to tank. And, if I did want to tank that is the easiest to find a group for.
---
You would because the addon captures your parties positions from /yell and adds markers to the map. This isn't serious btw.
---
Cats and wolves.  Earth elementals also an option but are typically higher competition.  The dragonlings in the east will be an option later in your low 40s.
---
I guess that's just personal preference. As a druid you can jump around to any form you want with 1 button. 1 button and I can be a new animal. I'm guessing that in the average 1 hr of play a druid shifts at least 30-50 times. In between those you will see your char and their gear. I think wanting to look at your clothes 100% of the time is weird, but whatevs gl;hf
---
It's not a problem yet.  When I was arm/prot or practically full prot and some arms tanking was fine.  Took some time fo adapt to the dps not waiting to open up on dps and just going full on right off the bat but once i locked down charge, berserker, bloodrage, whirlwind, switch to defensive stance sunder/ revenge every4hing was fine
---
But I had to overcome the dps not giving any time for me to generate threst.
---
I switch to fury prot just to test it out. I haven't entered an instance yet to tank I'm just trying to anticipate the best way to approach it because without tactical mastery im.not sure my opening rotation will work, was just trying to see if anyone had an input or could offer what they do as fury prot 
---
Gonna get into brd tonight and see how it goes. Might fail miserably but if not thatd be good because as fury I can farm mobs in open world so much quicker than as arms and that's what I wsnt.
---
I want to have viable dps for farming mobs in open world and also be able to tank without having to switch specs back and forth.  And arms just too slow if you ask me.
---
I accomplished in 30 minutes as fury what it would of taken me 2 hours in arms last night just killing mobs in open world for trash drops and leather.  
---
I've never tried fury in like 15 years and was blown away how quick I was killing shit.  Was alot of fun.  Way faster than arms
---
Naughty secrets.

INFO:  How did the few “raiders” obtain their status?  Were they running guild 5-mans working to gear for the raid?  Were they farming consumables for raid nights?  Were the trials not doing the same thing?  Was is just them being tight with GM?
---
Councils can work, but more often than not they are corrupt as hell.  Unless there is real reason the few raiders were ranked ahead of trails during everybody’s first raid night, let the guild die now before it wastes more people’s time.
---
I'm a little bit disappointed that you didn't use his PoV and play the "You'll always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow" clip at the end.
---
I bought some inferior shoulders by like 1 agility because they look like shoulder pads from blood bowl.  I hated having to upgrade. My cowl to a old skool leather helmet, but luckily you can hide it in the settings
---
Just wait until you hit 60 around Phase 2s release.
---
Everyone is going to be fighting over worldbosses on 12 hour times.
---
I've led groups where when I finally find a warrior to tank, he says its a no go if there is another warrior. We just kick the dps warrior and invite one of the other 20 dps lfg.
---
If they need it they can also always buy it at the auction house, everyone is equally entitled to BoEs because of the opportunity cost of equipping the BoE (it can be sold and used to fund a different BoE that's an upgrade.) That's been the way of thinking about it and the social norm for handling it ever since Everquest.
---
I always clarify before a run that everyone should need on BoEs and have had no problems or complaints farming pre BiS content this way.
---
we are 3 warlocks in our raid, after 3 weeks of raiding, none of us have any loot from MC and ony lol
---
Being a druid on vanilla was awesome in this respect. I was one of 2 druids so when it game to tier sets we always got them super quick. It was awesome.
---
I was walking around about 200 yards from Gagetzan and got ganked!  Please bannnn

And here I thought expressing opinions on a public forum was exactly what public forums were for.

I tagged it as art, if you don't want to see it.. filter out your flairs!
---
I know that you want 9% Hit Chance for DW Raiding etc, but let's say Im lvl 57 and Im fighting lvl 55-57 Lvl mobs, what hit chance would be sufficient?
---
In retail, at the start of Legion, I returned after being gone since early Cata and I accidentally equipped an item that souldbound, but I didn't want to because it was potentially worth a lot of money. It was just one of those things I did on autopilot and then started freaking out right after I did it.
---
I submitted a ticket right away begging for mercy asking them to unbind it, and it took them 2 or 3 days to respond. By the time they did, they said this happened too long ago and our policy is not to undo soul binds after more than 24 hours or something, sorry. I'm still mad about it.
---
It's the same for everyone. It's handled server-side and it's set to the same distance that it was in vanilla.
---
It does feel too close sometimes, but I think that's authentic - I remember there being jokes about stealth devilsaurs that carried over to stealth fel reavers in Burning Crusade.
---
Yeah its fun when someone 20 levels higher than you camps your corpse for half an hour, kills you again when you rez at graveyard, camps there, then boasts about it on chat. Great fun for everyone. /s.
---
Keep your forced flags, thanks. PvP servers are rubbish, and the people who use them have the attitude of "level or you are rubbish" and not "the journey is the destination". No thanks. I like enjoying my game.

You really only take Tailoring for that small amount of money from mooncloth and for the Caster BiS. It is similar to Alchemy. I can make potions for my guildmates and get a few gold from transmutes, but this is it. Though I can make an average of around 10 Gold per day with alchemy.
---
XD nice XD that’s XD really XD cool XD
---
Literally made 3g or less from an Uldaman run after selling the grays I got from the dungeon. Maybe if the greens sell (if you get any) I will make 5 gold.
---
I think it might be necessary to have a button that is simply /cancelaction to stop you wanding properly, yes.
---
MISHA KILL! MISHA COME! MISHA! MISHA! MISHA!
---
Shinatawa is a great player and really funny dude when i grouped with him, gz to the man x
---
Yes you are
---
Downloading a chat add-on is the only way I think. I use “Prat” personally doesn’t change as much as the chat add-ons.
---
Yeah, players are spread out in levels, and aren't logging in as consistently.
---
There are 'active' players that started at the same time that are anywhere from 20 to 60, especially with rerolls/server hops accounted for.
---
I'm pretty new still but wanted to try PvP, is there a way you guys attack certain people in that mess or is it just AoE and good luck?
---
No, view distance is intentionally limited.
---
It is actually. Blizz made a blue post about a rule that was already there back in vanilla stating you are not allowed to engage on players in neutral cities by hiding in zones where city guards cannot get to them. It is a bannable offense and people were banned for it. Look it up.
---
You need to be less of a condescending twat.  
---
Private Servers run by Eastern Europeans in their basement were able to handle far more load than current Blizz servers.
---
Man that would be so annoying. I dont want to have to fuck around on my second monitor everytime i want to chat with a guildie.
---
Was wondering that myself.
---
This is why WoW needs to do the Warhammer online thing: Have loot drop from players in PvP. I'm not saying players who die lose gear, I'm just saying, generate random gear drops just like you would from mobs.
---
What server is Low pop when yourolled on it? I dont even see Low pop realm right now unless you play on Oceanic Felstriker.
---
Do you seriously believe these fake stories
---
Tier gear really is terrible for some classes/specs, it's not just min maxing. An example as a mage, the T1 shoulders give you +13 int compared to a brd drop, but you also lose a whopping 15 SP. At that point it's not just min maxing. Only Helm, Legs and Boots are worth using if you have full pre bis.
---
Well, it's coming from Will Ferrel, what did you expect?
---
Sorry u lost ur buff
---
How much can a hunter drink on a raid boss in classic? IIRC there is a combat pulse every couple seconds to put everyone inside the raid instance in combat. I know it's possible to drop combat and drink a tick but can you drink to full?
---
That's how it was in vanilla....#nochanges

Claw makes it so your pet basically only uses growl once on every mob. Do not recommend.
---
Are gorillas any good? I thought they got thunderclap or something.
---
I tried to do this the other day but and was swifty killed afterwards by the dudes gnome rogue friend. Rip.
---
My only bad run so far has been SM Cath with a 36 Priest, 40 and 42 mages, and a 39ish Rogue.
---
The mages could NOT agree on what they wanted to do and kept asking me to pull separate parts of the cathedral at the same time, or pull a big group in a certain direction without specifying the direction, or turning a small pull into a big pull because one of the mages decided to Scorch another group. We outleveled the content and it was still the worst run I've done because I just could not wrangle in those two mages, we wiped at least 4 times.
---
At least nobody was an asshole in the end and we exchanged thanks.

You IRL
---
Why? theres not even any low pop realms. Why would you want this feature when the servers are perfectly healthy?
---
those skills are a tiny blip compared to catform if you're doing anything other than instance mashing lol
---
Can I please hit 60 first?
---
Perfect opportunity to say "Felsgoodman" and you blew it!
---
Ummm.... 20 agi = 40 ranged attack power... Agi also brings crit chance.... Rule of thumb I've always used 1 agi = 2.5 atp
---
Throw in Shadow Bracers and take out Truestrike and you can gain more 23 agi. which more then makes up for the difference in Carapace Spine Crossbow. (HORDE only)
---
?????????
---
But it's not "abuse" to that same bannable degree. It's not creating more spawns, as the layer persists. The "mob refresh" operates under the assumption that other players are not doing the same thing on the other layers. There are three ways to make the farm quicker.
---
1. Reduce time to tag mobs while they are not tagged(or find a node).
---
2. Increase damage done once mob has been tagged(or have higher gathering skill to prevent failed casts).
---
3. Reduce the window of time between mob death and respawn(or node being gathered and respawn).
---
Layering "abuse" (what you guys are referring to) only provides help with 1 and 2, but it does not change 3. Obviously you understand this as you put quotations on mob refresh. 3 Is the only one that is bannable by blizzard(unless their have been other bans I don't know about?), so we can only assume that is how blizzard is defining it. I agree that it's dumb and the worst abusers should be looked into, but it is not "abuse" in Blizzard's judgement, as far as I can tell. So pretty much, unless you can force shit to spawn faster than it can, Blizzard doesnt seem to think its abuse. 
---
Btw I'm not even necessarily arguing, I just think it's a very intriguing topic.
---
The only thing that blue post says is that if you're fighting a monster that is more than 10 defense higher than your weapon skill, the first 1% of hit you have is ignored.  This is different than the hit reduction needed as that delta decreases, see: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill which tells you that if you are at a delta of 10 (e.g., you have 305 Guns and are fighting a monster with 315 defense) than the miss chance AND the hit cap is 6%.

---
Or, bear with me here, you could just look for a tank...
---
Less than a 5% difference.
---
Pretty sure blizzard puts mobs in like that as “bot traps” specifically to catch people like this.
---
It's not laws lol. You pulled that shit people would still just blacklist you.
---
You can alt + Z to hide your UI if you don't want it for the screenshot ^^
---
OH, my bad, you guys go right shamming, grats on your totem!
---
Hahahahahah!!!! Exactly!
---
What I don't like is when people do it, but post stackable items individually.
---
Like dangit, I will buy all that COD if you want to save the listing fee, I don't want to click 20x per stack.
---
Then dont? Be a grown up and play one video game.

Here you go " Copyright law vests the original **work's** copyright **owner** with the exclusive right to prepare **derivative works**. Therefore, the **owner** in the preexisting **work** must authorize the creation of a **derivative work** in order for it to be separately **owned** by another."
---
The best way to power level someone is through mob tagging outside dungeons.  Don't party with him,  but let him get the tag on a mob and then you kill it.   Hell get full xp.  You'll know he had the tag when the enemy name plate goes gray.
---
FYI you left Horde Travel Point out where you labeled what everything means :)
---
I wonder if so many people left. I'm sure there were a lot of retailers who had a sub anyways who just wanted to check it out. Weird timing to do it when it's totally overrun anyways but I guess that was a huge influx of non permanents
---
&gt;Ummm.... 20 agi = 40 ranged attack power
---
It does, yes. 40 ap - 26 ap on Truestrike gives a difference of 14 ap which is worth roughly 1 weapon dps, like I said. It gives a very slight amount of crit as well (20 agility gives about 0.38% crit) but it's pretty small and likely more than made up for by less autoshot delay from the 3.3 speed Carapace compared to the 3.2 speed Blackcrow.
---
How?
---
Hmm. I’d definitely look into it some more. I’m interested myself as I intend on getting an auction addon tonight before i hop on and the double tooltip will probably drive me insane
---
First scene in WoW to make me miss Dark Age of Camelot in a long, long time.  Very cool.
---
Because of the rage gen early is complete ass with a 1h and shield. No rage = no threat. You still get the damage reduction in defensive stance with a 2h. If you're prot you get better bang for your buck sword and board once you have shield slam but only true masochists level as prot. On the opposite hand, arms has tactical mastery and sweeping strikes allowing you to charge pop SS bloodrage and then ww. For huge snap threat especially since most people ignore kill order. But you do need a shield to swap to it when it's called for(bosses that hit harder, specific mobs that hit harder, or overpull)
---
I know it's a meme spec, but once I hit level 40 I genuinely want to reroll feral to balance just to try Moonkin.
---
As a tank I fully support my DPS warriors in their chosen role.
---
Now: If you charge a mob right after I range-pull and stun them? Congrats, you just promoted yourself to tank. Now **I** am dps. (And remember: kitty has threat mitigation. No matter how much damage I do, you're tanking.)
---
Where's the insult?
---
*Naughty Secrets!*
---
SM, 1k needles, badlands late 30’s, hillsbrad, and dustallow all helped get me to 40 while avoiding STV
---
It's more about the player interactivity dude.  Warcraft has always been about opposing factions and this is a chance to collide with them out in the world organically.
---
Then by happenstance, reinforcements come at just the right time.  They felt like they were in a movie, but it all happened by itself.
---
It's not about a challenge, per se, it's about an experience.
---
Honest answer: people weren't, and were just using layering as a boogeyman to claim that people didn't earn things legitimately (e.g. crafting Sulfuras).
---
Even at 5g per item (this would mean weapons from bosses) you wouldnt even get half the cost of a warden staff for vendoring 40 of them. Cloth blue items at 60 from dungeons dont even vendor for 2g unless it's a chest piece. You'd have to vendor probably, realistically, 180 items at an average of 2.5g a piece to achieve 450g, which seems to be the average price of a warden staff.
---
I get it, there isnt a set rule of etiquette, but generally if a very expensive item drops, everyone rolls need on it. You're just being petty about it because it's not being handed to you.
---
So, try and get it authorized.  Or don't, whatever.
---
I don't care anymore...
---
I didn't say I wanted it, just that I fully expect it to be implemented at some point.
---
There's low pops in EU
---
It's funny I kinda wondered if this has already taken place a few weeks back. I noticed when playing that there just seemed to be way more people everywhere, all the time. I thought maybe layering had been reduced. Seems I was correct. Good on them.
---
Fair enough. Nice taking quotes out of context. How bout the ppl who expected servers being of vanilla realmsize? Most people against layering expected blizz to give us vanilla serversize. Layering on a 9k server doesnt equate layering on a 2.5k server. Sorry to say if you didnt realize.
---
It borderline depresses me (not really) that the "everyone needs for gold" mentality is winning. It fucks with me, when was this EVER a thing in WoW? Let me rephrase before people jump down my throat.
---
When has this ever been a thing and they not be a douche bag? Cause you're right it's always been a thing. But you're a dick if you did it way back when and you're a dick now. Just cause you're coming in here with your "technically" tryna say we are all playing wrong and you have the right way to do it. No man, follow how the game has been played.
---
That’s really to bad, they only way to avoid low lvl dungeon retards is to fullgroup from your guild, but if they already quit it’s kinda too late, unless you happen to find another guild full of cool people, which I am having trouble doing myself. Only got two friends to play with so I usually end up having to find 2 more for dungeons and they rarely work out.
---
Wait... so you transfered to a new server and youre suprised how new it is?
---
It isnt dead, it is a new server. Of course the population is going to be smaller. No realm is dead yet. They all have normal numbers for a full realm from vanilla.
---
:paladins:
---
No one really notices a good hunter tho. That's the crux of the issue. They notice hunters when their pet ass pulls and they need on gear they shouldn't use.
---
A good hunter is a ghost to most people, a typical run, the satus quo.
---
Runecloth boots or gloves. The pattern is like 5g and even though you make the items at a loss you're total cost for for levels isn't much.
---
*echos of first 60, first MC clear*
---
Most of the learning I need is the stance dance itself and getting comfortable with the keybinds between stances.  Just need some muscle memory!
---
Can't tell if meta-joke or not.
---
Blindweed is 40s a piece on my server and they are fuckin everywhere in SoS. Truesilver Bars sell for vendor value and Thorium is pretty damn iffy.
---
Eu here , i have +1 h from servertime and by the time my 1 yearold goes to bed , and i do regular house chores its 22.00
---
I'm losing my mind, I've had it since I started playing and just dealt with it, but now that I'm trying to disable it and can't figure it out it's annoying me even more haha.
---
still its just like using ss with a dagger practically which is awful
---
This goes for the cat too. Back in Vanilla TBC I had quite the racket going on in my PVP server by selling the feed for chickens and camping for the cat and selling them to my faction by transferring them across faction.
---
happy for warrior?
---
This is just like the master looter change in retail. Blizzard trying to protect their community from eachother. It will just lead to less social interaction. Besides, easy as fuck for assholes to abuse this system as well.
---
What is the add-on used for the more in-depth character stats?
---
No. I can vendor your BoP gear for gold, too. Who's to say an extra couple agility for you isn't worth 5g to me? Why shouldn't I roll need on everything?
---
That has never been how it goes.
---
It is a common fact that warriors can’t read. Just like putting 0 points into intellect in Fallout 3, my warrior is functionally retarded. On my RP server I make my Mage friends transcribe quests and road signs.
---
Yeah, honestly there probably won't be near the demand for rare cosmetic stuff because the crowd that likes that has more for them in retail.
---
Also there are a ton of people stockpiling twink gear, it probably won't sell near as much as people think.  The serious twink players already have most of the gear they want.
---
Wah, it’s too crowded.
---
Wah, it’s not crowded enough.
---
That’s you
---
Yeah, I get what you’re saying. If I made the effort to learn, maybe it would feel good. It’s just that every time I’ve tried, it feels too weird. I guess I’m just set in my ways. Just like anything, if you do it long enough, you get good at it. Ive never felt like the play style hampered my performance, though I get the argument the “high end” PvP requires more snappy turning and this a lot of players prefer the more mainstream method. 
---
Just wanted to throw my experience out there that the game can definitely be played and enjoyed with other methods.
---
Big Dick Enchants
---
I don't want to meet either of you in game tbh
---
&gt; However 90% of the tanks you see running dungeons wants the same gear the fury warrior wants
---
I hope that's closer to 100%. 
---
Sure there are a few + defense pieces, but tanks are usually better off just getting the huge STR gear anyways for tanking.
---
No ones currently on ah though :(
---
Bootleg private servers are far more stable than the trash blizzard gives us. It’s pretty pathetic
---
"Abuse" is probably a loaded term to use, to be honest. It is, technically, an abuse of the mechanic for unintended ends, but you are correct that it isn't abu*sive* on the level of the dungeon/raid refresh that was going on previously. At worst, it's an annoyance to those of us that get tired of seeing "layer invite pls" copy-pasted in guild and world chat.
---
Unless, of course, it can be determined that shortening the time between mobs is causing gold inflation to happen. But I'm mostly saying that as a Devil's Advocate hypothetical, the bloat of gold from layer-hopping compared to without would be very small.
---
What's that?
---
No I rolled on one of the original servers that will never be dead.
---
&gt; We can read guides, watch YouTube clears, and have addons that help with boss fights. Yes, these addons existed in vanilla, but not when we first cleared MC. They became more popular around Naxx (maybe BWL though I don’t recall using a boss addon for BWL).
---
Literally all of that stuff existed around BWL before AQ was released.
---
Haha, thanks, mate!
---
At the bottom of the island is a good naga spawn, in between there are some wolves.
---
If you swim to the larger island, there's a cave full of Naga that you'll never fully clear out due to the dense spawn, it's got a ton of mining nodes too so it's great for miners.
---
my guild does this as well
---
you know the panda guy, Chen Stormstout from Warcraft 3?
---
Because they are not perfectly healthy.
---
Blizzard destroyed multiple PvP servers with the way they handled free transfers
---
5% for same-level mobs, 1% more for each level above yours, and 1% more for raid bosses.
---
9% is only so your special attacks don't miss. I forget the exact number, I think it's 24%, which will make sure all your attacks hit, including offhand. Hit% is your strongest and most valuable stat until somewhere around 18% hit.
---
No shit, but not everyone will instantly roll need on items they are only planning on selling. Especially when the picture for gold coins is shown as greed.
---
You know medium pop now us more people than full servers back in vanilla days right. There’s still thousands on at a time in medium
---
If it's BiS items, I would gladly pass any valuable item up if someone actually has need of it as BiS. If it's a twink item, I agree with you.
---
Well, it was low pop server when we got on it, Heartseeker.
---
We have some other friends playing on Faerlina and my friend was new to wow, and I didnt want his first impression being waiting in queue for hours. We want to play with them eventually.
---
Back in vanilla, i ran UBRS everyday with my guild for months, as a hunter it was easy mode but i never EVER saw the tier 0 chest drop, i got 4 sets of dal rends blades we ran it that much.  I did manage to grab full tier 1 but never EVER got the leaf.  Goals this time is tier 0 chest and leaf everything i dont care :P
---
As a warlock its really not, unless I get a ton of lucky crits I am not going to beat a mage's dps.
---
And so are the classic guides, you can see all of the constant updating in the [changelogs](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/changelog). So far it is going pretty well, getting a lot of good feedback from the people who **actually read** instead of just talking smack because its cool :)
---
Shamans can self rez
---
I always see people talking ablut the bank alts what is the purpose of an alt for the bank?
---
Nice day*
---
Just because you decide someone is a bot doesn't mean they're bots.
---
I got 80% of level 58 by running LBRS.
---
The price is going to vary heavily by server when it comes to stuff like that. My advice is to hold onto it for now, as there isnt really a good market base right now. Most of your potential buyers will be looking to get it cheap to resell later.
---
I could break this down as well and explain why you are wrong all over again, but I don't think you are capable of understanding it. Try to think about it like this. 
---
An item worth 400g drops, and it will give the rogue who isn't min-maxed yet 10% more damage. However, if he were to sell the item for 400g, he could buy gear more applicable to him, and gain 30% more damage. In this scenario, the rogue should sell the item for 400g, EVEN THOUGH its still 10% more damage for him, because of the opportunity cost of the gold giving him 30% more damage. 30% damage increase &gt; 10% damage increase. The correct choice is to sell it. This is not a difficult thing to understand that the AH price should be the value of the item, not however somebody feels like it should be his because he can use it.
---
I’d say the price will likely skyrocket when BGs are released because it is a top tier 2h twink weapon for 30-39. IIRC it is the slowest weapon in the game so it is pretty crazy with things like WF. 
---
I guess it’s up to you if you want to wait that long.
---
This is awesome! Since you are still taking edits — I’ll throw down this one — you’ve masterfully drawn the Silithid holes, however it looks like you forgot to throw one down underneath the text for Un’goro’s down in the south of the crater.
---
That's your choice. I use the Character Notes addon. Do that to me once and I'll never tank for you in the future. If I get invited and see you I'll say that I have a problem with you and you leave or I do. Guess who usually gets priority. And since I spend 95% of my time tanking there's a good chance of that situation coming up.
---
Building bad will against other tanks is a bad way to get future tanks.
---
You sound like someone that most people just try to ignore because of how stupid you are, and you're obviously bitter about it because you realized what's happening. So now you're trying to lash out at anything that you think may be different.
---
For me, there is no functional way to fix it. They would have to simply release World of Warcraft II. And that game would have to be similar to WoW. Even with the completely ruined lore they could assemble a game that could get me to play again. But they won’t be able to.
---
I'm a good boy that passed on Ravager at level 38 since Ele is better at 40/45.
---
We didn't leave because it was crowded. The server was already a medium-high pop not full. We transferred because the option was opened up and someone took it so we had to follow quite simply.
---
vendor has been king for green items
---
Sorry but you're wrong and stupid, druids can do everything.
---
Clearly you're bad at this game and only read forums/tier lists from min-maxxers and don't actually know anything about the game you play. I don't expect much else from a warrior smooth-brain though so /shrug
---
cheers
---
Every drop is a pile of gold from the vendor, then. Why should you get priority on BoP gear if it's still gold to the rest of us? Who's to say the extra stats for you are worth more than the vendor price for me?
---
We will remember that shit in phase 3 when Staff of the *Shadow* Flame drops.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Ill agree that the server was not open at launch, but it wasnt 3 days late. I came home from work after being in queue the entire day for Skeram - and saw they opened Smolderweb just a few hours earlier. The part about try hards not being on Smolderweb i will give you though. Most of them went to Herod or other massively populated servers. Also Smolderweb population is typically at medium so its not as big playerbase wise.
---
This was after a large WPVP battle that happened here [https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyLivelyAsteriskDuDudu](https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyLivelyAsteriskDuDudu)
---
I'd imagine if I didn't already have these established characters with the little bit of backstory I've developed with them it wouldn't be a big deal to me. Realistically I'd probably retire my current characters and make a new one that I could write a bit of backstory for so it made sense that they can do all these different class roles. I get the appeal of having all of your progress on one character. It drives me nuts that I have different rep levels on my different characters currently. I never did get Draenor pathfinder, so if I wanted to go back and do that I'd have to figure out which character has the most quests done, the most rep already gained, etc.
---
Deadmines.
---
Though I don't remember using the terminology BiS/Pre-BiS back then, DM-Tribute had good loot for every class, iirc. And it was fun.
---
And every raiding Warrior and Paladin will be doing the Quel'serar quest for awhile.
---
Only the "add character friend" option is greyed out for players of opposing factions. I was scouting around in ghost form and discovered that the option to add Battle Tag friend is still available on players from the opposing camp.
---
Probably an oversight tbh but disabling it probably requires more work than what is worth. When some rando stranger sends a Battle Tag friend request you can always just refuse. I only add character friends because Battle Tag exposes my real name, and my Battle Tag friends are all ppl I knew IRL (with their real names as well).
---
It stopped being that way with the hotfix. Pre-hotfix, it was absolutely “hop as many times as you can.”
---
I wish,that was back on 2009
---
Just did it today...seriously felt like I was going to the grocery store, forgot something, had to go back...went home to realize I forgot something else.
---
Mountain Silversage, Ice Cap, Plaguebloom, Dreamfoil, gromsblood, and I think sungrass and ghost mushrooms are still sellin well.
---
Typical alliance. Ganking when Horde are busy doing escort quests
---
I love BRD too.  It's strange but the atmosphere is so great in there, I can smell the smoke and feel the heat from the flames.  That dungeon is so atmospheric, much more so than any modern dungeon even though the graphics are technically far inferior.  I think the huge size helps and the music and sound effects.  It's just such a large place with so many different types of areas that it's like an entire city inside a dungeon.  I mean, come on, there's even a bar with a rock band half way through for when you fancy a break!
---
Does double crusader stack?
---
Its time to look at the awful server lag that happens in the big pvp fights now then, indie company i know but put some extra money into setting up the servers so it aint a slideshow
---
Yeh if your in stv can’t prgoress go hangout in SM lib arm and cathedral till 40. Go grind monsters in quieter zones desolate swamp of sarrows arathi.
---
It is what I did when I first quit right before Wrath. Just give my gold away to friends who are still playing, give away anything else of value and just focus on school.

LOL!  OK.
---
Paladins want very slow not very fast
---
I understand, but you have to understand my meta is "get everyone through this" I get that some people want their char min maxed perfectly for bragging rights as the best geared or whatever on the server and they are willing to restrict themselves to one role to do it. How many leveling deaths did that warrior go through to be able to tank "better than a druid."How many times did he have to grind for gear? How many groups did that rogue have to put together to run dungeons and spam "need heals and tank." Show me a raid with 0 druids, show me a pre-made bg group NOT looking for a druid. This "jack of all trades master of none" is a meme and a dumb one at that. I don't need my class to have mastered the game by being that class. I master the game and jack all the trades.
---
imagine having 1k gold to throw at prebis
---
i dont know if i can go back to retail, i just dont understand it anymore.  I like classic because of the simplicity and the look.  I have other games on my play list and  to many other hobbies and shit to do.  Its sad because it looks amazing.

5 seconds to activate FAP btw what an absolute joke server quality
---
Deadmines? When did Deadmines become DM? I thought it was always Dire Maul.
---
Edit: Spelling
---
Their shadow build is ok
---
Agalloch. Nice name.
---
Enchanting bar none has the best end game usability and utility. Every upgrade a person receives is another enchant they need done. Expect to go broker than broke leveling enchanting though. Once you get 300 its guaranteed profitable.
---
Tailoring, LW, and BS should only be used for the BOP items you plan on making. In general they are not gold makers.
---
Same. Fury tank. It's pretty fun. If it gets rough I throw on a shield, but that's only if it goes south.
---
A good bed for fucking?
---
That actually makes the story make MORE sense. Consider:
---
-priest MC breaks after you cast one more spell. Example, if you fort the target, you would need to re-cast MC in order to Shield as well
---
-OP said he got TWO buffs from the Druid, and the MC cap has a cooldown so there was no re-control possible 
---
-this scenario is rare enough he probably didn’t KNOW that MC cap won’t let you boat-funk someone, since priest MCs are far more common
---
Which is why the top parsing Paladin on WoW logs is a spelladin with the crowd pummeler 😂
---
I take care of plants... power plants
---
My man...you *gotta* get better at this if you are going to insult people.  Practice on some others then get back to me.  Until then, buh bye!
---
Got it!
---
Well np at all! You don't need to apologize mate!
---
Let us all upvote your main comment :)
---
Thanks again!
---
I dunno, it just ruins the coolness to me when things get funneled items because they're famous.
---
Well, it's not just contested territory but like UC's version of redridge mountains or duskwood.  Being Alli there is quite tough as a consequence.
---
Watch perplexity run flags in wsg on youtube.
---
godsake please just give us Phase 2 so we can World PVP
---
So cringeworthy.
---
Tbh I'd rather do 5% less dps but have an extra 500 or 1k life as a dps. You do 0 dps if you are dead. The QoL is amazing. Mistakes happen and the extra life helps immensely.
---
For some reason people in Classic have been using DM for Deadmines instead of VC for VanCleef and DM for Dire Maul.
---
Oh, I agree that many warriors need to stop being afraid of the responsibility of tanking and man up. It was never like this in vanilla as pretty much every warrior then knew it was their role in the group.
---
But if you ask for DPS and agree to bring a warrior along as a DPS, then deal with it. You made that decision and no, it doesn't start all over again. Next time, that group leader needs to write in chat "LFM - Need Tank and DPS". Then it the warrior whispers him, THEN they can ask if that warrior might like to tank. But saying they are looking for DPS and then shaming that DPS warrior into tanking is just poor form.
---
Gotta think of it like it's popping out 30 hp every second since it affects 5 people.
---
Blizzard is a shit company. Don't forget that they only gave us this after we pulled teeth for a decade while they made fun of us to our faces.
---
How do you get it so peoples names in chat are class colors? I was looking for that the other day and couldn’t find it.
---
At least be honest. I don't want to create group too. Too much work for me and then keep searching for People for over 1 hour is not fun. I better skip all dungeons and join them only when I see "lfm 1 dps"
---
I can admit this. I am a lazy shit head and I don't care mate. But I really wouldn't blame others for the way I chose to behave.
---
Try it too.
---
\#nochanges
---
Ugly
---
Hahah should be very interesting when honor gets added, I can’t wait. 
---
So glad we aren’t one of those servers with huge balance issues. 
---
See you out there, for the alliance!
---
I have already  stockpiled all sorts of dragon whelplings. They went for 10g a piece three weeks ago when players were desperate for gold.
---
Imagine when layering is removed. Which server is this?
---
My point is they were not around at release. And even for Naxx, today, we can look up every fight and know how every fight works before it is even released. When Naxx was first released, we had to figure out each fight with occasional hints from guilds ahead of us. Yes, addons came out that gave warnings eventually, but not at release. 
---
All of this isn’t to say this is bad. It’s different. Classic is not vanilla. It has similarities and differences. If you expect a perfect replica of human behavior, you won’t get it.
---
This reminds me of welcome to nightvale for some reason
---
Warlock.
---
I mean, by that logic, if you're running a raid with less than the maximum number of players, people should be expected to be allowed to bring someone to sell gear to for their personal gain.
---
dude. The guy you're argueing agianst is giving actual tactics and reasons. your arguements in truns just amount to "mages dominate lol" without saying anything that actually backs it up.
---
Wtf all the dads and zoomers I added to gather 5 boar asses in the barrens quit at level 30
---
People are just too sensitive so they don't notice the posts that agree with them so all the posts about min/max stand out and they get hurt and assume everyone is attacking them all the time
---
Look, if there's a lower level tank already in the group and I bring my warrior in to DPS, I'll just manage my threat and keep DPS'ing.  Sometimes I'm in the mood to tank, sometimes I'm not.  If I get asked to tank when I whisper for DPS because I wanted to DPS, I'll usually say no.  If I get told to tank, I'll laugh and quit the group.
---
Yeah this is it. I mean, a bunch of lvl 55s cleared MC on the first week, and I guarantee that there were at least a couple ret pallies in that raid. But I can also guarantee that none of them are getting the loot for Thunderfury.
---
Amen brother, amen!
---
Good one bud, great argument you really got me there.
---
Why do I remember that ring dropping in sm lib? Is that more Mandela effect?
---
There is a major difference between random pug and guild and you know it. Argument in bad faith. If there is no explicit written communication on how gear is handled, it is not "ninjaing" for a BoE epic
---
before classic came out, there had been 10 years since I last played. 
---
But that whole time, I fondly remembered two voice lines (and pretty much only those two)
---
"Tell me.... tell me everything!" by him, and then "Release your rage!" from Archmage Arugal.
---
 It was a joy to hear both again after so long.
---
Nice AFK kills, you must be proud
---
By "highly doubt", I mean in terms of actual player ratio. Even though it says 50/50, I don't think that is actual representative of legit players. Lots of people in my guild have bank alts and leveling alts, I wouldn't count them as more actual players.
---
You don't want to go there.
---
Only twice now tho!
---
DAOC had by far the best pvp of any mmo. I wish it was still popular.
---
Do you give all of the diamonds to the blacksmiths and all of the righteous orbs to the enchanters? 
---
Like, if you can’t craft with an item, then your only use is greed, right? 
---
But if I’m going to use it for an enchant for myself, that’s an upgrade for my character, same as a piece of gear. So yeah, would you be salty if I needed on every righteous orb? Absolutely. You’d probably kick me from the group, even if everyone else in the group had zero need for orbs. 
---
It’s the same with boes. 
---
They can all be bought and sold. A warden staff for your druid could be a Krol blade for your rogue or a freezing band for your mage, so why would your druid have priority on the staff? 
---
Looting rules absolutely are not the same whether it’s a disposable green or an epic boe.
---
That's what you get for leaving Blaumeux
---
This server is perfect
---
So then why not just craft your BoPs and drop tailoring altogether?
---
I think he means there are far better items available in those same dungeons compared to T0.
---
threat generation is higher with a 2h. You are dealing more damage and taking more damage and generating more rage which can be spent on more sunders. As long as you have enough mitigation such that your healer isn't sweating, there should be no issue with equipping a 2h to tank with. I've done most of my runs with 2h tanking without issue, only throwing on a shield for harder hitting bosses or when we pull 2 groups on accident.
---
This is an MMO dude, there are other people playing.... What made you decide that everyone running around you are bots?
---
It's 3rd best for hunter, and the other two are from quests. No reason for a hunter to ever roll on hoj, unless no melee in the group need it.
---
I'm so happy I'm a pst player on an est realm, I get home from work at 3 am server time.
---
Key word there....casual.
---
For some casual players they will use that Shadowfang for days or weeks. Not everyone plans ahead or reads guides/WoWhead/Reddit.
---
There's plenty of people who are just enjoying the ride and leveling at their own pace. They may see that weapon and think "Damn I wanna use that" and feel powerful for the time they use it.
---
If you think its correct to gain 10% more damage instead of 30% more damage just because you want to, then I guess there is no point of discussing with you. Also anyone who uses the logic of " I'm not stealing gold from anyone in the process, because they didn't have that item or gold in the first place. " is probably a bit on the... special side. You could literally use that flawed selfish logic to ninja loot every single item that drops because nobody had it before then, but you seem to think its "smart" in your mind.
---
Newsflash: you are wrong, your ideas are wrong, and you shouldn't laugh at others. Also, don't be a hypocrit, its okay to not understand logic or follow what others are saying. In your own words,  [https://gyazo.com/85ced022aa63d1d7adeeca5b33529bc4](https://gyazo.com/85ced022aa63d1d7adeeca5b33529bc4)
---
Yea, that is really weird for me. VC is Deadmines. DM is Dire Maul. That's how I have always known it.
---
That's a niche build. 99% of the paladins dpsing are just using command, which needs a slow weapon. Crowd pummeler works because it's crowd pummeler. Without the attack speed charges, crowd pummeler would be just as bad as equipping any other 2.0 speed level 30 weapon. Destiny is a shit-tier ret weapon.
---
Edit: your use of emojis is both annoying and unwarranted and logging onto your 3 alt accounts to downvote me concurrently doesn't invalidate facts.
---
You had purge to break the CC once, but rvr combat was amazing and i miss it so much.
---
Because the norm for running dungeons is using the name of the dungeon as a shortcut, not the last boss. Not to mention dire maul isnt out yet, and if it would be you wouldn't ever say "DM" you'd say "DM east, DM west, etc etc.
---
If theres actually people using the term VC it must be some american thing because i've never seen it called this way on europe servers. Not now, not back in vanilla.
---
Oh I just felt I'd add that if you start combat at range, don't bother with the shield. It's very mana intensive and often wastes time through having to regenerate for longer to compensate.
---
In Monster Hunter we call this "fashion hunting". Where instead of opting for the BiS minmaxed clownsuit, we compromise to make a good looking set that is slightly worse dps wise. The true endgame.
---
You better believe I'm gonna get the whole dungeon set on my hunter, and eventually the tier sets as well.
---
HAEL HER WOONS!!!
---
Can any experienced warlocks rate my gear and advise some upgrades for leveling? I'm not sure how to weigh the effectiveness of flat +Shadow Damage compared to Int or Spirit and Stamina. I just hit 40 on a Gnome Warlock (affliction spec) and I'm rocking the following:
---
* Head: Whitemane's Chapeau
---
* Neck: Explorer's League Commendation
---
* Shoulders: Inquisitor's Shawl
---
* Back: Sorcerer Cloak of the Owl
---
* Chest/robe: Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe
---
* Bracers: Aurora Bracers
---
* Gloves: Hands of Darkness
---
* Waist: Regal Sash of Intellect
---
* Pants: Shimmering Trousers of the Owl
---
* Boots: Sorcerer Slippers of the Eagle
---
* Rings: Seal of Wrynn, Ogremind Ring
---
* Staff: Staff of Dar'Orahil
---
* Wand: Rod of Sorrow
---
Thanks in advance
---
Did it last night. Get ready for a lot of ghost wolf running. 2 boat trips to Sepulcher and Tarren Mill, one run through Ashenvale, and back to Southern Barrens and Rachet. If you don't have those flight paths, probably 2 hours minimum. I took 4 because I was leveling herbalism, hitting a couple extra flight paths, and doing a couple of delivery type quests that I remembered about.
---
lmfaooo imagine thinking as a streamer ass loser with 5 wow accounts you can be some judge of other people xD
---
&gt; They were with the prepared pack who all kinda knew what was going on and now they're worth the people who are less knowledgeable and cause more problems in dungeons.
---
Fuck you and fuck people who think like that.
---
Aw shit here we go again
---
Now if you could have this be the in-game map that would be cool
---
can't do that when I get hit for 1 k by the mage
---
This was a followup to this fight [https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyLivelyAsteriskDuDudu](https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyLivelyAsteriskDuDudu) After they won, they charged the closest hearth point where raiders gather for the zone
---
You are getting way too personally wrapped up in this.  "Jack of all trades master of none" doesnt mean you cant fill roles well, it means for every role you play as a Druid, there is a class that can do it better.  Thats not me being mean, thats just the truth.  The beauty of being a Druid is in its flexibility.  Druids are the only class in the game that can play every role reasonably well, the tax they pay for that is not being able to do it at 100% effectiveness.
---
High level zones are already impossible to farm resources in. All the mobs are dead in the popular farming zones while groups stand around waiting for respawns. There will be at least twice as many players if they collapse the layers, and this is with the vast majority of the player base not even being 60 yet.
---
How is Blizzard planning to address the overpopulation issues?
---
You’ll definitely find the opposite as you continue to level. Warriors have a way harder tome solo than rogues.
---
Enjoy MDMP lmao
---
So fast!
---
I can understand this mentality. If a higher level/better geated warrior joins than our current shitlord/angel tank, I will ask nicely if the higher level minds tanking. It wasn't our intention to fund a dps warrior, but sometimes it just works out.
---
With the AH being all over the place atm, what are some solid gold farming methods at 60? (I'm mage btw)
---
Real question is, what addons are in the center of the screen? the rage bar, etc?
---
You thought wrong
---
it's the wow version of "my dad can beat up your dad".  Anyone who says this shit is either literally 12 or acting like it.
---
For Paladins, it’s dull wield.
---
This is not related to economics in any way. It is just a selfish behavior you protect and justify. If this is your view on things, thats it.
---
Lol deposit
---
it's a term used in MOBAs a lot. It's when you go to another lane to kill something. You gank them. With the rise of MOBAs in the last few years the term has become synonymous with attempting to kill someone.
---
We wrap that up Monday. It’s been awful 😓
---
*Polymorph* laughs in feral
---
It makes sense. Every dungeon is abbreviated by it's name. SM, RFC, RFK, RFD, WC, ZF, etc.
---
Then you have the deadmines which is for no reason at all abbreviated by the name of the last boss that most people can't remember anyway.
---
DM = Deadmines 90% of the time that abbreviation comes up.
---
VC is a stupid abbreviation. Change my mind.

Ya, fury warrior rotation is super fun, but I think combat rogue rotation is also fun. You have to eviscerate/rupture as well, so it's not as simple as you put it. Fury does WW/Bloodthirst as well. I was under the impression always rogue was a more convenient fury warrior, cause of the precision talent and being able to dump your threat is a pretty big deal. Slice and dice can get 100% uptime easy.
---
I think I'm going rogue, because if I don't manage to find a guild, I could mess around in world PvP and have some fun there. Perhaps sneak into enemy cities or towns. Ya, if I ever get AQ40 on farm in a guild or if they get rank 14, I'll be pretty jealous of those fury warriors, cause they are more valuable to the raid and do more deeps while still being able to provide support in the form of tanking.
---
However, I will have some peace of mind knowing I didn't have to undergo a lot of tough times to get there, fury warriors have a tough leveling journey and gearing process, have to tank in dungeon pugs, and have to wear leather at the start. They had to suffer through 70% of the game, to finally enjoy the last 30%.
---
The thing about world pvp is that the fights are rarely fair. You take advantage of the situation any way you can and win by any means necessary.
---
Kek
---
Our priest does this to me... she’s my girlfriend too lol
---
The only bad thing is I believe there are some zones in TBC that require flying. I don’t think really as much in Wrath.
---
That’s all fair and games tho. OP situation is much different, it’s basically an edgelord being hypocritical who stated throwing a tantrum.
---
Yours is someone who got his main, we all do that haha. I remember I used to park my main on the same zone. ^justincase
---
dire maul didnt even come out till later
---
dm was always deadmines.
---
BoE gear can be bought from other players, if you win a need roll and equip a boe you saved yourself the money it would have cost you to buy it.  If you win a a BoE roll and sell it you gain the money that you sold it for.  In both cases the end result is the same: the players effectively gain gold equal to the cost of the BoE.  The benefit is the same for both players.
---
This is NOT the case for BoPs.  A player who needs an item receives the item, a player who does not receives the  vendor gold/disenchant mats from it.  There is an asymmetry there, and nearly everyone in the game would agree that the player who receives the upgraded gear gets the bigger benefit.
---
Math is hard but decade is 10 years
---
I feel violated having wasted my bandwidth watching that
---
ive been in 3 guilds that do this
---
Just tailor bro.
---
I don't know why they put layers in if they intended to remove them, all this does is build unrealistic perceptions of how many people the server can support and when the layers are removed suddenly there aren't enough mobs for anyone anywhere and everyone is going to be bitching about over crowded servers.
---
I know your point, your point is wrong. 
---
&gt;If the priest would receive much more benefit selling the 100g mage item (even if it’s an upgrade for him) on the AH and spending it elsewhere, then he shouldn’t equip it just to lay dibs on it if he himself only values it at 1/4th of 100g. Doing so is just selfish.
---
Doing so is what he is entitled to due to the intentions of Blizzard.
---
&gt;Common sense says that if the priest equips it and gets 25g worth of value, vs selling it on the AH for 100g, he should sell it on the AH and buy other things worth 100g to him.
---
Common sense says that it isn't directly 100g. It's not a bag of money. It's an item. And immediate upgrades take priority in a dungeon group. That has been the intention of Blizzard and always will be.
---
That's why the rolls exist in the system. That's why there is a Need Before Greed system. That's why when Blizzard made their own PUG system Need Before Greed is default.
---
And my totems!
---
Nothing's getting out of hand. I've yet to see a single bot. Same as on retail, the major complex bots are out of action due to blizzard's improved detection. There are a few pixelbots running in virtual machines, and some kamikaze bots using unlockers that have been detected for over two years now.
---
Classic WoW servers are crowded and it's impossible to run a simplistic bot without getting reported. Just because a bot you saw is still around two days later doesn't mean there is a problem. The bans were never instant, it can take weeks.
---
Yeah well wait until you get to un'goro where the tar monsters cast a 2m disease that slows weapon attack speed by 50% and movement by 30%. Oh and it's uninterruptible. Thankfully I figured out it has a short range and if you run when you first see it casting you can avoid it.
---
Alliance players who want to get another aqual quintessence certainly do.
---
I'm 53 and only got one Blue BoE. And haven't been able to sell it. Barely worth 10 g
---
why? arent you just giving it to them on a flash drive?
---
Those people were the biggest tools I've seen in a while. They couldn't comprehend with their small brains that layering was needed for the first couple months and that it'd inevitably get removed once the hype dies down.
---
For me it always seems like gnomes are the gankers
---
Trying to figure out if thats better or worse than having skin pockets
---
43 on mine and it seems easy so far.  Maybe a gear issue?
---
i mean, it's pretty natural to be mad about being ganked by someone 10+ levels above you.  However it should be obvious in this scenario that it was because of your own actions.
---
I never really get why people message others after being killed by them.  Don't they realise that this makes the kill twice as worthwhile for the person doing the ganking?
---
It's not about that it's more about letting the newbies/casuals have enough time to get up to 60. I think a minimum of four months is enough. If they rush p2 they risk losing LOTS of players in their 50s due to people camping/ganking literally everywhere
---
Make sure you stack up on your pummelers and consumables so you can actually win a fight
---
It’s in the name of the skills. Open your skills pane and see there’s Swords and Two Handed Swords, Maces and Two Handed Maces, and Axes and Two Handed Axes.
---
It’s the total opposite. A scumbag doesn’t NEED it, as in usable for their class.  They want to GREED it, because they’re an inconsiderate piece of trash. You want to make gold off of BoEs do it off of BoEs in your own class. That’s fair, and doesn’t screw anybody over.
---
Just farm your pre-raid BiS
---
One of the few bad memories I have in vanilla is getting that MC cap and seeing it's just a pet control bar and not like priest MC at all.
---
I can still dark pact your ass though, and /lick you while I do it.
---
I agree with the leveling part but at max I feel like there isn’t much variety at all. At least for rogues I’d say.
---
When it comes to a BoE worth hundreds which is rare and also depends on economy, I don’t think anyone is just going to greed or need right away. People will pause and hopefully communicate right there what to do. I’d say rolling need for everyone is a good idea as well since you can’t guarantee someone will equip it and not sell it. A BoP thats an upgrade you at least know it’s not tradeable.
---
Got mine today - 45th run
---
TL;DR
---
I got caught Cheating and Blizzard finally got me.
---
You don’t even need to find a casual guild, just be active in the guild with dungeons pvp and helping with quests and people will like you enough to not care that you are ret in raids. A good friend is more valuable to a guild than a good player.
---
and occasionally some awesome art/music/video OC.
---
You’re actually entirely false because this thread wasn’t about taking X over Y.. it was about viability of a certain class/spec combo in a VERY specific situation.  I’m content being called a tool by you, I’ve been called worse by better people. It’s apparent you either lack eyeballs or brain capacity to comprehend what i was getting at.. have fun never running back because you always have a priest for the simple fact that you’re too lazy to run. GG
---
Got an alternative?

---
I have most of my peices and im gonna run more at 60 since most of my freinds are behind me so i wont be raiding anytime soon
---
My biggest thing is that my friends are a bit ahead of me. They just started LBRS today :(
---
It was the first time around, I guess people in classic are changing that? I did play Vanilla as Alliance and it was always referred to as VC. This time I am Horde so I never saw it mentioned before.
---
What a level headed response
---
Nope, it’s their responsibility as the seller to do the necessary research on the value of the item being sold and it’s their responsibility as the seller to enter the correct price. Yeah it sucks for that guy but next time you better believe they’ll be more careful with their listings. This was an excellent learning opportunity for them. Double, or even triple check before you post to the AH.
---
I watched a fight ensue in guild chat over someone using VC instead of DM. It was bad. P sure he/she rage-g-quit too.
---
Thanks I’m at the bar gonna watch later
---
Well to be fair it would be hard to differentiate between Dire Maul and Deadmines if they were both referred to as DM.  But VC is dumb lol
---
It's a grey area. Having multiple instances of the game open at once and all being controlled by a person using third party software is a-ok as long as there is an actual human pressing buttons.
---
Yep that would be a bot. Report it and let the gm know you have a clip to prove it. No reasonable player would ever spend that much time on one mob that is obviously glitched.
---
&gt;Since these can be sold for a lot of gold some redditors 
---
This tradition is significantly older than the /r/classicwow subreddit.
---
How about "They can't remove layers they will make the queue worse!"
---
60 is the norm for most servers to be honest. I didn't rush to 60, I have a full time-job and hit 60 exactly one month after release. Most have hit 50+ by this stage.
---
I rerolled on my old server and will give the server a month to hopefully have enough 60s to do a raid.
---
Wait according to the roll, shouldn't bilbo have gotten it?
---
Laughs in stoneform

Lucky, mine was from amazon so likely I won't see it till the 8th.

Just hit ‘scan’ then watch some YouTube. There’s so much info and parameters and settings but you don’t need to utilize them all to make some gold.

I agree, I played on the US server in vanilla and this is how I remember it as well. Dire maul came out in later patch so it didn’t replace Deadmines (DM) and not to mention, Diremaul had wings so it was specified as DM east, west or north in LFG.
---
I've been ganked countless times by allies on a very balanced server.
---
&gt; All the no life psychos are on Horde taking their anger at the world out on the "pretty" races. 
---
This is such a ridiculous assessment of horde players it doesn't even deserve a response.
---
Blaumeux is an amazing server, always 'high', no queues, and from last i checked is really close to 50%/50% balance of horde/alliance
---
It is instantaneously leaving a form and returning to the same form. In conjunction with Furor and Wolfshead Helm, you will gain 60 energy at the cost of a shift. This will greatly increase your DPS.
---
Some may disagree, but I don't think its worth it for questing until you have 31 in feral and Natural Shapeshifter from Balance. You will burn through your mana and kill your sustain.
---
&gt; tanking requires a little bit of thought and game knowledge/dungeon knowledge and some people are not comfortable doing that leadership role as you said, they set the pace. 
---
As a warrior tank it's easy enough to invite someone else to do the pulls (ideally around a corner), and then open with charge + demo shout + def stance to get all the mobs on you (or carry over rage and remain in def stance).
---
In vanilla it was considered almost ideal for a hunter to take that pulling role because they had long range instant cast abilities and could use frost trap very effectively if they pulled (also having a host of ways to get out of trouble if the pull isn't ideal).
---
&gt;I didn't make it past your second paragraph sorry. You need to go back and look up the definition of automated.....
---
People like you do. I already did, and linked it four times in this thread. Automation is a self regulating system that doesn't need a human to operate. Multiboxing is not that.
---
Also, you not making it past the second paragraph shows your immaturity and you willful ignorance taking over.
---
&gt;I can guarantee you 1. The definition won't mention a game of any kind
---
It doesn't need to. But the definition of "bot" does, which mentions automation.
---
&gt;A process that requires human input can still be automated - see most factory work
---
Just because factories have automated systems doesn't mean the factory itself is automated. Bad example.
---
&gt;You seem to be pretty deeply rooted on the wrong side of this argument, conveniently ignoring a few key things.
---
I'm ignoring nothing and people like you are ignoring the definition of automation. There is nothing automatic about multiboxing. It's an input pass through. It requires human input.
---
&gt;I'm not interested in convincing you
---
There is no convincing. You are wrong, end of story. You have no objective evidence to support it because people like you fundamentally misunderstand how a multibox works.
---
If I need on a BOE in the run I pass the next two.
---
Just ran temple and it dropped.
---
mages bad
---
Lbrs is really solid
---
Alliance hunters don't have access to something like the hit trinket the Horde get, so HoJ is the only 'dps trinket' for hunters until Dire Maul comes out. Still, it's disgusting when hunters need on it considering they can replace it with an easy to get blue while it's bis essentially forever for rogues and warriors.
---
*cries in Perception*
---
MOST important is ridiculous lol. Helps with down time considerably? Yes.
---
Spirit has gone full cycle from being extremely underrated back in the day to extremely overrated now.
---
I see people say "LFG VC" or "Need 1 for VC" all the time.  American realm
---
You're not gonna play with hunters ever again because of one player? Yikes.
---
Fuck yea brudda! 
---
P.s. I don’t actually care that you self promoted as I have no issues with it. I just had to say it to save you from the rest of the hounds on here
---
Luckily the system sorta self corrects itself and you'll be getting xp and gear very quickly if they help you out. For example, ask them to run you through some BRD runs and you'll be amazed at how fast you'll be leveling. Our lvl 49 Priest friend already has every one of his BiS pieces from BRD, can't even equip them yet haha.
---
i mean, dreamfoil and gromsblood sells well.  Weirdly swiftthistle is cheap as fuck, good time to be a rogue.
---
It's BoE, why give someone the ability to ninja loot it and all roll greed first? Everyone rolls need and if someone actually needs it that person/those people can reroll if they didn't already win it. If the guy who originally won the Need roll decides to keep it to AH it then that's reasonable as well, but kind of a dick move.
---
How hard is it to understand that a fucking 500g BOE drop is worth 500g. If its an upgrade for you, its even greedier to tell people not to roll because you want an upgrade. 500g buys a lot of upgrades for anyone, you dont get to tell people not to roll on it because YOU want it. This doesnt apply to fkin BOE gear.
---
Bc’s go for 400g on arugal

druids are the best pvp class. entire metas evolved around the ultimate goal of trying to protect your shapeshifting fap chugging monsters, and to catch the opposing teams
---
I solely regret it. It basically ruined my classic experience.
---
Just a heads up you can actually change it so your bnet friends only see your #battletag instead. 
---
There is a toggle in account settings.
---
I have petattack macroed. It's my opening button press.
---
when VW's about halfway to the mob I CoA, cast Immolate, then cast Corruption on the tick Immolate resolves. If left totally alone, my VW will normally tank with these three dots applied in this sequence forever.
---
I typically begin wanding immediately and VW tanks 2-3 attacks before I take aggro. mob is usually dead or dying by the time it reaches me.
---
When I need to heal and gain mana back, I /petattack, apply CoA, wait a few autos for VW to establish threat and drain health then tap down, and repeat until full. May not be the fastest way but it drastically reduces my downtime and expense.
---
For going fast, I use Succubus and essentially the same rotation, just I take more damage and the mob dies a little faster. have to stop and eat and drink every 2-3 kills though
---
I don’t mind being ganked by someone within a reasonable level range. Plenty of times I turned the tables or got away. Other times you die. But getting swatted by a 60 at lvl 30 is just shitty.
---
Did you check z-perl?
---
I’ve been taking my time leveling troll prot warrior, rested during week and using AH for money - I’ve been funneling gold  into strong spirit / Stam  gear and I don’t even need to eat to heal, I have like 1050 health and every tick is like 70 hp
---
This is completely correct. There are small tweaks depending on your level but for the most part sunder til 60-80% is a good strategy.
---
Dal'rends is better than Peacemaker beacuse of the agility enchants that can be put on them, but that isn't out yet so Peacemaker is better (and easier to get). Hand of Justice is BIS for alliance hunters, horde can get Guard Captain which is better, nothing else is better until Dire Maul.
---
30g is still cheaper than what it went for back in the day when I got it in vanilla.  It was around 300g.
---

Invicta on Benediction?
---
I played a warrior / paladin / shaman back in the days of vanilla. I wanted to roll a mage this time around but a lot of my friends said they'd be playing a mage, so I rolled rogue instead.
---
A month later and all those friends barely play, are still under level 30 and here I am with my 60 rogue, wishing I just rolled a damn mage. 
---
Will be rolling on another server with some newly made friends and I'll finally be able to fulfill my dream of playing a mage.
---
Mmm I thought Warlocks scale the best when it comes to AQ and Naxx shit?
---
Idk what magically severs you people are on because I have seen it at least once per zone I enter and quest in
---
Judging from queue times, it is definitely people playing less and quitting rather than spreading out. I'ts only natural people were playing 12+ hours a day during release just to race to 60 as fast as possible and now there just isn't as much to do.
---
YOUR TRINKET SUCKS
---
Herod is mostly horde
---
not only broken but stupid. I have seen multiple crafted LW and tailoring pieces on the AH for LESS than they vendor. These kids are literally undercutting themselves out of money. It is so frustrating to see.
---
Most guides I've seen say to max out the first two talents, skip the 2nd row, then get Feline Swiftness.
---
I'm not going to join a group that is doing specific things that I don't want to do....I never said I'm forcing anyone to do full clears. Yall cant fucking read for shit.
---
I'd say don't even use it after until you find yourself rage capped.
---
Thanks :)
---
According to Classic Wowhead, all the blue pvp gear is item level 63.
---
Yeah at 33 I was struggling with SF mobs so I was gonna come back there around 36. I’ll check out desolace, thanks
---
I normally go to 50%, I am only 34 so don’t have WW or MS yet, what do you do after sunder?
---
Try disabling Enchantrix. It might've been bundled in with one of your other addons.

this site is a great resource.
---
horde zzzzzzz
---
Random question, but at what level did you spec resto?
---
60 is NOT the norm for most servers.
---
I did play vanilla in alliance and i cant remember anyone saying VC even once
---
I love this bro. F that guy.
---
Thats what I did last night in a BRD as a 55 tank with a 60 warr. I just let him have the mob he was killing while I tanked the others and focused on the team. It worked just fine. Its when tanks get too obsessive being the center of attention that they lose track of the big picture, protecting the healer and the clothies.
---
Lol i bought one for 48s this week too
---
Druids like you make me smile. I understand at a certain level not wanting to heal because your in all agility gear and have no int so your mana pool is tiny
---
Soooooo what is gunna happen when Dire Maul opens?
---
They didn't. Original devs have talked on streams about the over world population and ways they made it dynamic before vanilla release. They were afraid that new people to do the game wouldn't have enough mobs to do quests and would quit. The dynamic spawn effects are reduced as you get higher level. For example I'm in Badlands now and stuff seems to slowly re-pop even if the area is heavily populated by players and the mobs are all killed.
---
Yikes. This is a very dumb hill for you to die on. You lack a basic understanding of the concept and have chosen to invent your own definition.
---
Here's a last bit of food for thought;
---
&gt; If you're one person, doing all the input yourself on 80 characters on 80 keyboards then great for you! Because you're still just one person doing all the work spreading it over 80 accounts that you have, there's nothing wrong with that.
---
&gt; But if you're using a third party software program to SEND your keystrokes across 79 other accounts, uh yeah that's basically botting. Those other characters are not controlled by you, they're controlled by a program. You control one of those characters and the others are computer programs. Same way bots are computer programs because the user isn't inputting directly into them.
---
DM is deadmines. I played vanilla and never called it VC. When people refered to Dire Maul they always wrote DM East, North etc. This was on EU servers though.
---
Because the inflation of gold has already started. 100g is now chump change as people are leveling their third characters. Meanwhile I'm sitting at 40 and just got my mount.
---
Problem with different queues is stubborn new players can oust the longstanding players. Good be rectified by offering server xfers, but only for factions with regard to balance. Like horde only on this server gets to go to one of these 4 alliance-heavy servers and never get queues again.
---
actually gnomes have the largets penis to body ratio, you're just jealous you can't swim in pussy for maximum pleasure. nice try though
---
Ask the Hunters that bought my Heavy Leather Ammo Pouches!
---
There are millions of guides spaning 15 years of knowledge on macros.
---
They are simply said using programming language to cast or sequence abilities for your character. You will find everything on google even begginer guide and morde in-depth guides to macros. They are certainly optional! BUt if you wan't to improve your wow knowledge learning to use them can be very useful sometimes.

I've rolled elemental around 37 when i got tired of grinding sm for that axe and did almost no damage because i got stuck on some shit weapon. Invested around 3g in some greens, skilled elemental and did 2 more dungeons for equip. Never looked back. Way more fun and versatile while questing, in pvp, in groups in general.
---
You can be carried thru mc at 55.
---
Just because they pay high doesn’t mean you will ever see a cent. That’s pretty extreme man. It comes across like you can’t enjoy something unless you take it to its furthest extent
---
What's a decent mob to grind from 25 to like 28 if I just feel like grinding
---
I’ve heard it goes to whoever rolls first if there’s a tie
---
I have an int set for healing I wouldn’t think it’s viable in my agi gear or at least I’d have to drink a shload hehe
---
The only way to treat those situations is to troll the person thats angry and act like you genuinely enjoy their rage until they feel stupid
---
Man, thank you a ton. I really appreciate it. I have been trying to figure this out.
---
Agree to disagree. Personally I love the feeling of everyone trusting each other to greed and need when it's a genuine upgrade, BoP or BoE
---
Then you should respecc into elemental and stop caring about enh gear.
---
*crying in 1 minute heartstone channel*
---
Do these item procs scale with intellect or only direct spell / healing boost?
---
Could a warrior stack  Paladin intellect /
---
Spirit plate and that life steal chest : skullflame shield for immunity during dungeon farming?
---
Druids make excellent tanks and are commonly used for off tanking or even main tanking occasionally in raids.
---
Plus unlike every other class, Druids have a spec that makes them both good tanks AND good healers: 0/30/21. So they can alternate as needed simply by switching gear.
---
What an offensive piece of shit this person is being.
---
But usually you would tell your friends what’s going on. This guy also deleted his discord as well didn’t he?
---
I don't have an issue with not reserving items.  But if I'm tanking scholomance, and there's an arms warrior in the group DPSing, and Defense gear drops; the expectation, and etiquette are that the tank Needs on that shit while everyone else greeds.
---
Need on the roll that you're playing in the group.  If you feel differently, tell the group 
---
"I know I'm here as DPS, but I'm trying to build out a tanking set; everyone ok if I need on that?"
---
I'm on Faerlina lvl 36 and most of the zones are empty with the exception of a few like STV (which I avoid like the plague) and maybe Arathi Highlands.
---
Oof miss retail?
---
Its super trash. You need 3 pieces just to get a jump of by up to 28 spell dmg? You can beat that with one piece of gear. Arcane dmg is very rare in the game so the resistances help little to none. The only decent thing about them is the high int, but the scales per piece dont make any of it worth the effort. Id say the same thing with the green dragonscale set for healing as well. Both super undertuned compared to the black ds set, which is okay to good at best.
---
Ahh the ninja comes out. 50% of the server is mages, you arent getting random requests. Especially with your bad server wide rep. You're probably alliance tho, so thank u for helping me squish opponents easily by denying them gear!
---
What's the add-on that puts your character frame in the middle of the screen?
---
The furor talent in the resto tree gives you 40 energy or 10 rage upon shifting into cat or bear. So powershifting is exiting and re-entering form almost instantly to basically refill your energy. If you time this with standard energy tick with the help of an addon you can increase dps a lot
---
Because every leveling guide tells you to go herb+skinning or mining.
---
what dungeons do I run at level 52 for xp?
---
Yeah, that's true. But I still would prefer multiboxing to be bannable.
---
mobs are usually easy but most gankers hit me at half health and i shift to heal then no mana to shift back at try anything.. i just run off most of the time. i struggle with more than one mob too. and yeah, gear is just quest items. i should go buy that blue helm.
---
Blizzards stance is basically it isn't against TOS but if you get scammed they wont help you.
---
Sorry, if you took something to sell while another could use it, you're a filthy, greedy ninja. If this "logic" was accepted by remotely anyone, your precious BoP bis get would be getting needed for vendor gold.  
---
It all comes down to gold anyways, regardless of the party member. You don't need a 5G item any more than anyone needs a 5g item, and since it's able to be liquidated into exactly 5g it's fair game for everyone. Plate shoulders for 5g are exactly as valuable to the tank as the 5g cloth shoulders they can trade for are to the mage. It's a loot token essentially.  
---
Maybe your logic is flawed or you are missing something. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dclqse/ninja_logic/f2bj8pv/
---
I distinctly remember them saying layering would have a cap that matched Vanilla server size. Unfortunately I cant find the official statement from Blizzard but I can certainly find other people referencing the cap.
---
Does this mean all 13 realms will sharing one layer as in all can meet up and stuff? or how does it work?
---
Should have leveled dual wield.
---
I know, I know "but MAH HIT CHANZE"
---
Look, I played a warrior in vanilla. I remember leveling with a 2 hander. Well you know what? Now I can stack sunders way quicker than you can, which ramps up my damage way quicker. Once I stack 5 sunders, I just build up another 40-60 rage, and charge the next mob and can immediately stack all my sunders again. For the most part I was playing with blue weapons, which were not hard to get. There were either enough cheap ones on the AH or I got a couple of dungeon drops. Sword of Omen from the SM quest line was nice. Even buying the occasional blue weapon from level 20 on I could afford my mount at 40.
---
I also got Mograine's Might, and tried switching to 2 hander at 39 as soon as I could equip it. It was so slow I just went right back.
---
If you could afford 2x Crusader enchants it would be even faster than 2h, but alas this is my first character in Classic.
---
10/10 would level DW fury again.
---
Tanking fucking sucks and fury/arms is fun, idk what else to tell you
---
Stop kicking me for only wanding I pay $15 just like everyone else
---
&gt; There is a strong argument that a BoE epic that is sold on the AH gives you the gold to buy a BoE piece that you need from the AH
---
I totally get the logic, but all I hear when someone says that is "I need this because I can't buy WoW tokens any more."
---
PvP flagged as a factor? Idk. But  I’ve been added by the opposite faction as well when I quested in hillsbrad
---
It’s not ToS but you may get scammed and then it’s GG as far as Blizzard is concerned.
---
Very clever, much original, wow
---
I think my server, Deviate, is one of those, but it still is constantly on mid population and the impact of losing layering was very noticable. I wouldn't think it's small enough to consider mergers, considering I started late (11 days ago) and I'm still seeing way more people questing than I did in Vanilla. And I think my server here is one of the smaller ones.
---
What DPS classes are wanted for raids that isn't overpopulated and has a good chance of getting gear?
---
Any ah tool is only as good as your scans. Keep them up to date and do them consistently everyday and you’ll be good
---
Curious how the OP photo is “garbage quality?” 
---
You can see literally every pixel perfectly. Yes it isn’t a screenshot, no it doesn’t lose any of the information trying to be shared.
---
All weapons are shit tier ret weapons ;)
---
It is actually quite useful level 50 at least from an efficiency perspective. It heals 75 dmg every two seconds total, if you heal every group member. For a total of hitting everyone with a chainheal if it ticks through.
---
As a warrior, this only exacerbates my already irrational level of hatred for hunters.
---
The simple tip for healing is: the healers job is to keep the tank alive, the tanks job is to keep the healer alive, the DPS’s job is to not be noticed. You should heal the tank and any non avoidable aoe damage. If you know you won’t go oom and can heal the dps do it. I generally heal the dps always but 9/10 times if a dps is taking a lot of damage it is because they don’t know/care about threat and don’t know/care how much more difficult it makes the run when they take Aggro.
---
Oddly specific

I have no affiliation to this subreddit. Your downvotes mean nothing to me.

Btw, alliance is better.

Good fella. S3 now.

got a fps drop playing this video.
---
Call it DM east/west like always?
---
I never see anyone refer to Dire Maul in LFG chat as just DM. The wing is always specified.
---
&gt; MS &gt; OS, easy rule.
---
I don't think you understand that MS for every single warrior tank you come across until 60 is arms/fury. If you think you're going to get a fully specced prot warrior in 5 mans, especially in low level ones, you need a reality check.
---
Just play both! If you plan to play casually there's nothing stopping you from having two characters and switching between them.
---
I mained a Shaman for 13 years from when I played vanilla WoW up until I quit during BFA, so personal bias makes me tell you to pick Shaman. 2H wep Enhancement was hella fun. I spent most of those 13 years as a Resto Shaman since I got forced into healing early on and just kinda stuck with it because I got good at it and eventually came to enjoy it, but Enhancement is what really made me fall in love with the class back then.
---
Currently maining a Warlock in Classic since my train of thought was "ok, I'm *not* going to be a Shaman this time around", but my next character or main alt is 100% going to be a Shaman and I will be PvPing as Enhancement.
---
Sure it does? I'm still going to roll on DPS gear even if I'm tanking. How do you know they don't need it? I had some rando mad at me for rolling on the tank helm off Gyth even though I'm going to be OT in Molten Core but was specced Arms that UBRS run.
---
No clue on Felstriker, but prob 20+. Ironfoe on 6th Emp
---
As undead priest I gotta back myself :)
---
Prob better to sell the boes and invest in gathering stuff that will sky rocket come phase 2. It’ll be infinitely harder to gather and those ranking will sink hundreds of gold.
---
You mean Sunken Temple? The dungeon abbreviated by it's name?
---
every gold doesn't count as much if you're a druid - just buy the skills you think are important.  You'll get the mount soon because you start getting a lot more gold when you hit 40.  lvl 40 mount is not that competitive for druid because it's such a small increase.  In fact, it's often more efficient to use cheetah form vs mounting because of the mount 3s cast time.
---
It's actually a hidden option built into the game. I think it was something like /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Even if Classic+ were real there’s no way anyone thinking about “what’s next” a month into release is actually going to still be playing in 2 years.
---
Should I wait to hot 60 to switch to sm ruin from drain tank? Level 52.
---
Guild leader is trying to increase traffic to his discord. Probably streams and wants people to see him streaming in the viewer list. Can almost guarantee he is at the top with a purple name.
---
I think this is a US vs Europe thing. It's been VC forever in America.
---
How do you know they’re a bot?
---
there's always a bunch of people that say WHALE CUM when a new person joins. started it the first day, and we're still going strong.
---
Oh sure, it’s the 1.10 patch notes :)
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10
---
This is my first epic !!
---
That is a pump for diesel... which is not explosive. Needs to be unleaded.
---
And if that item was worth 1000g on the ah would you just let it slip away because the person  'says' they're gonna equip it? I'll take my fair shot that the game allows. What is so baffling to me is the assumption that people dont lie cheat or steal. I've said it so many times, if you dont know the people you're playing with, you cant guarantee their motives. So yeah I'm gonna roll need on that extremely valuable BOE. Even if my char cant equip it.
---
I disagree with you, can you not just accept that? Is it *correct* to gain 10% vs 30%? Whatever you do in an RPG is *correct* if if gets you to your end game goals. I'm sorry I don't view the world through your narrow lens. I also don't go into so much detail on my character that I look at it through gains in percentages. Does it have more Str? Cool. Its an upgrade. Sorry I'm not a min/max player like you. I go with what works. I play the game differently than you, and thats ok, no matter what you say. I'll also laugh at who I want and you aren't the news. LOL.
---
Just abandon your character until hopefully they release paid server transfers.
---
Oh, uh, yeah, you got me, man. You're just too clever for me.
---
I just wish someone who does get legit mad about this could tell me why. I can’t think of any reason. Hate the system, not the players who are taking advantage while it’s here.
---
I’m not even bullshitting, I asked for an inv an hour ago and someone whispered me “fuck you” and ignored me before I could even respond.
---
Pushing against the same loot etiquette that has always been in the game, so you can make  gold, is the only Entitlement here.  Have fun stealing and pretending otherwise though.
---
No. You chose to follow the fool. Just because they make an impulsive decision does not mean you have to support them. Actually taking time to weigh options would have been the prudent course of action.
---
I'm on Arugal OCE alliance. Which also has a 40/60 split apparently.
---
STV is a shit show for alliance regardless of faction split. We don't even have a flight point there so it naturally gets more horde players as it's easier for them.
---
Add in the fact that a huge amount of players set their hearth to gromgol STV as it has blimps to major cities and its a very close flightpath to their end game dungeons and quest areas and all of a sudden you have an abundance of 55+ horde hanging around the zone wasting time aswell.
---
Go quest in desolace, arathi highlands and swamp of sorrows. Fill the gaps with SM then come back to stv when you have a mount. Once I did this I barely got killed anymore and havnt had much troubles in any other zone since.
---
GL
---
No biggie it was like that in Vanilla but not in classic. Didn't know till I tried it myself.
---
I was healing in a SFK run where a hunter rolled need on various things, most I didn't care but made the mage  finally exploded when he needed the blue cloth gear and won.
---
CharacterStatsClassic
---
Owl or gorilla, for the aoe ability. Holds Agro really well especially if you roll BM
---
Sunken temple is good, took me 2 runs to get all the quests finished (long chain called ancient egg from hinterlands/tanaris. Another quest pickup at a troll temple in hinterlands, 4-5 more from all over like SW explorers league) other than that some 52’s will grind the start of BRD black rock depths but ideally you’d be a little higher lvl. Maradon is also decent especially if you need the hit chance ring off princess tho make sure you’re just doing princess runs- the other entrances to this dungeon will be somewhat poor xp. Also at 52 I did some feralas quests and got myself to un’goro for some fast lvls to 54. Good luck!
---
I think what he trying to say, albiet in a condescending manner, was that you guys shouldve probably told your friend not to transfer. If it server was never at capacity and having queue times, I dont see what the point of transferring was. Sure the leveling was going to suck, moreso with the zerg leveling masses. But itll pass. Seems like he saw the grass being greener and didnt think of the long goal. 
---
Two cents are over, I still agree on having paid character xfer.
---
I never once heard it be called VC in vanilla. Maybe they did on your server, but it definitely wasn't some unanimous truth.
---
That would have actually been more impressive.

Can confirm, 11% hit
---
Technically people can offer swapping services, although i havnt seen any being advertised. OSRS has an abundance of it
---
There are world PVP quests that give rewards. The problem is the rewards aren't usually good enough to motivate people who just want the reward, and when they are, people just do the minimum necessary and go turn off war mode.
---
I never said it was
---
I played on K1 and K2 and leveled Alliance when K3 was F R E S H.
---
On Kronos 3 there were a lot of shitty games against premades but you know what? You picked WSG and waited out the GY camp as a ghost and your next game was against random hordies where you could get kills and rank. So casuals could still get pvp gear, just not the top stuff. And faster if they pick the minority faction. It's not as if they ever had a chance at the higher ranks anyways. 
---
It's still a big issue so thanks for reminding me. I had forgotten. But it's also still true that being in the dominant faction means you wait longer for games. So announcing that BG queues were restricted to your server might have helped with the faction imbalance issue even if it turns out down the road that keeping single server BG queues is more trouble than it is worth.
---
That wasn't specific at all.
---
There are still people that think horde will do well when BGs come out. Me seeing that any kind of organized attack crushes the horde, Pretty sure that balanced numbers would be pretty bad for horde.
---
It’s because they are noobs or so desperate for a “I’m a team player!” moment that they won’t even realize when they are being swindled half the time.  Putting a dumb smile on a dumb noobs face just because they can equip and “its an upgrade” because they have NO idea how itemization works, what drops to go for at what levels, it’s just a coincidence these people are normally 4th place dps I’m sure.  It is not our fault people are TOO LAZY to read about mechanics like for example why slower weapons are better in which situations and how to play their role.  And they show up in garbage greens so anything’s an upgrade.
---
Well you should've known after running through the entire barrens for your fire totem quest.
---
I was apart of the implementation team of a billion dollar business, and our T1 to T3 supports would send us tickets to handle because they were out of their scope, does that make me who was a person who was above a T3 support(Our team actually didn't even handle tickets normally) now a T1?
---
That's not how Tier based support systems work. People are give tickets based on what they are supposed to be able to handle. I was on a team of admins who handled all the major systems in the country, so we were given tickets that only we could resolve.
---
No company wants to waste more time having people work on a ticket more than once.
---
I unsubbed from here in the weeks leading up to launch, it was an absolute toxic shithole if you didn't go with the circlejerk sky is falling crowd.
---
It doesn’t have all the bis. It completely ignores world boss bis. It ignores a lot of stuff.
---
I still cant forget huntard getting my betrayer of humanity years ago
---
There were two ways that roll could have ended. The vid was one, his post was the other.
---
That AMA pre- launch people were asking for *more* layers
---
I keep reading this from Horde players and it just makes me laugh so much.
---
Yeaan I loved playing enhancement but I never got to roll people with the 2h spec.... I also have a thing for maces and I don't think any other classes besides pally really use maces...warriors almost always opt for swords or axes for orc right?
---
I started this at level 51... Currently 54 and still dont have all the mats to make robe of the void, but have run a few dungeons to get other BIS and gold to buy the rest of the mats.
---
Your entire argument hinges on the fact that you don't consider the benefit that selling the item could have. If you want to equip a 100g item that would give you less benefit than selling it for 100g and buying other more applicable gear that's better value for you, then I guess you go ahead and make that mistake. Basing the group decision of this mistake seems selfish.
---
Commenting to download it later at home!

At least they are realistic.

DM East, DM North is Dire Maul. DM is Dead Mines, doubly true with the tons of people that have never heard or seen Dire Maul.
---
This game is pulling in a LOT of people that have never played the game.
---
What’s ur sp? Im 46 and has 127 sp with lock quest staff plus a few shadoweave gear and mask from zf. I also speced into dark pact, drain tank build, i have absolutely zero down time, i throw all four dots on mob and drain life until dead. Sp is number 1 priority, then stamina, i totally ignore int since i can tap and dark pact for mana.
---
I farmed Armory for 2 days straight on my shaman just to get Ravager and that stupid tabard. Didn't drop and I did respec to elemental out of frustration. Today I got Ravager of greed roll on my 2nd Armory run on priest. Still can't bring myself to sell it. It just didn't feel right.
---
I am still on that bandwagon. We are missing a lot of skeletons. MAKE SKELETONS GREAT AGAIN!
---
The tier 2 gear.
---
It's pretty funny how the lack of reasoning works. Recently I had a KOS guy in Badlands and was ready to settle a grudge with another 60.
---
Dude was level 42 and I had to stop and wonder why I had him on KOS a moment before killing him
---
T1 is legit for Feral. Might even be better for Feral than it is for Resto. Tons of armor and stamina on every piece.
---
Resto Druids really want bonus healing, not raw stats, but that set is almost all raw stats.
---
So you should get it because you're greedy and entitled and fuck everybody else so they should be polite and pass. Got it.
---
Yet here we are, you looking like a moron, and me calling you one. What an amazing and wonderous world.
---
I think so with the racial? Not really sure, but you can certainly use a mace as a Warrior as well.
---
Just go Shaman to start with and level a Warrior on the side, in my opinion. Again I'm biased, but Shaman is just so much fun.
---
The only issue that comes up is that you need a shield equipped to use it. Meaning, unless you have some weird macros set up, you'll have to unequip your 2 hander to use it.
---
OSRS isn’t owned by blizzard. I’d really like to see a blue post on this before I risked trying it though. I also don’t see why people are against it? Someone earned that gold and they are spending it on something... it doesn’t hurt the economy and it doesn’t lose blizzard any money

"it's what they called it when I played vanilla."

That's one messed up abbreviation.

It's a very good staff for vendor spec. So yeah, you are wrong.

now we just need more herbs and mines, 330 or so black lotus a week is about 500 to few :D, with these server caps.
---
&lt;Laughs in Bonebiter&gt;
---
Well if I do 4 dps GY and a +2 lvls warrior(compared to 2nd highest dps) joins he's going to tank whether he likes it or not. I'll try to keep aggro with ambush on one mob with evasion/ghostly strike etc to make it easier for both him and the healer but the fact he's gonna be tanking is out of my control.
---
The networking is intentionally shitty
---
They are called huntards for a reason

Check the comment section in classic.wowhead.com's page for runecloth bag pattern.

Find my main comment. There is a link to the orignal post where I sourced the original map from. Flight paths are still present though.
---
You probably didn’t even play real vanilla.
---
We tried to get another guild or to say “anytime” and if they did they got down ranked to the lowest rank in guild. So for example a guildie runs you through a dungeon and you say “thanks for the run” and they reply “anytime” they get down ranked
---
Sounds like he ruined your pvp server experience.  I return kindness with death.
---
had a mage sheep me to heal me then hit me with a dagger.  killed them 4 times.
---
had a pally watch a shaman survive an encounter with like 3% hp.  the pally walked up to him and did a /salute.  I camped him.  Seriously what kind of carebear shit is that in STViet nam?
---
Ded game lulw. RIP classic August- sep 2019. /s
---
Let me rephrase your argument in logical form (it's just easier for me to process this way, and also please let me know if I'm paraphrasing incorrectly as I don't want a good, productive discussion to fall by the wayside because of an incorrect assumption leading to a strawman fallacy)
---
- The feeling of getting loot drops and equipping upgrades is fun and one of the main reasons we play the game.
---
- There is additional utility (let's call it "fun utility")in having that fun that would be lost or discarded if we simplified BoE drops by splitting them.
---
- Therefore, in order to preserve the utility, we ought to depend on others, and others ought to depend on us, to collectively maintain that utility by only rolling need on BoEs that we plan to equip because:
---
- The additional advantages of this "fun utility" outweigh the potential risks of others defying the proposed norm and rolling need anyway. The advantages of the "fun utility" also outweigh the potential disadvantages of exclusion (warrior specifically excluding other classes that would be able to use Edgemaster's when looking to get it as a drop,) confusion (bucking an already established norm among veterans,) and inequality in other utility (some specs' BoE are in higher demand and classes looking to farm lower priced BoEs will get less utility if we accommodated this model.)
---
My take on this is that for this model to stand, point 4 must be a true statement and yet it's very hard for me not to believe that the hindrances of this system outweigh the benefits. Sure, it would make the game more lively if you played only with the same people and agreed to farm content in a way that everyone gets upgrades. In a guild setting or on very small servers it might work very well but if it's your expectation to do this for PUGs you will undoubtedly have a bad time. What are your thoughts on this line of reasoning?
---
So if they both proc you get 200 strength?
---
While tanking in the last couple months, the Hunters haven't been the issue...
---
And after seeing a warlock mob pulling for the team using their succubus, I don't think I'll ever complain about how a hunter handles their pet.
---
It does work.  I just tested it. Right click the name plate of the opposing faction and you have the option of adding a battletag friend.
---
Is there a blue post or something on this? I’m not too worried about being scammed as I have a lot of BFA gold and would risk it... as long as it it’s verified to be not ban worthy
---
Because those "level 38" tanks (which is a number that you pulled out of your ass) will never be a raid tank, right? You'll laugh at SM. You'll feel different about MC, Ony, or BWL.
---
Good luck being an asshole to everyone and avoiding the consequences. Even if my group sucks I'll just finish the run and then leave to heal some other group. You only hurt yourself being a jerk.
---
I have 1 person ignored on my server.... i cant imagine having it full already. Are you trolling people then getting upset when they troll back?
---
I’ve accepted that my kos list knows better than me and to not question it.
---
????????? layering just got turned off u retard hahahahah
---
"Who doesnt need gold?"
---
Nat Pagle doesn’t enjoy fishing?!
---
yeah you're right bro let me just pull an arcanite reaper out of my asshole
---
Someone got raider status for defending the guild masters decision, so god knows really.
---
We’ll never really know but it’s unlikely that they were able to farm so much that it’ll affect the server economy for a very long time anyways, unless they stockpiled some obscene amount on many bank alts across several accounts. And blizz would know about that.
---
Just note when he gets online for a couple days, find him, and give him a good ganking lol
---
Right, Where are we going?
---
Them wildvines alone are 40g
---
Hard to say but I would say 50g
---
We had a guild run or DM last night. Barb dropped from Van Cleef and I (war) and GM (hunter) roll on it, but then also, the mage rolled. We asked him why he'd roll and and says 'its a bit of an upgrade for now'. MF that sword has +12 attack power! I won it luckily but some people man.
---
Nope. That's why I clarified it for you.
---
&gt;He also edited the post without marking it, but he said something about a specific scenario of ninja looting,
---
I edited it because my phone autocorrected boe to bow and I didn't notice it; I didn't change any content.
---
And then we run into the other side of the issue: as far as WoW has fallen, the modern game is still \*the\* gold standard in the genre. Nothing else competes with it. If Blizzard introduced WoW2, they'd only be competing with themselves. They could only hurt themselves.
---
Added to that, I honestly don't think Blizzard has a game development team anymore. I literally don't think they could create a new game. D3 was a clusterfuck, and the entire IP is on life support. They didn't even make Diablo Immortal. And they sure as shit were not actually working on Diablo 4 before that Blizzcon.
---
Overwatch is salvaged remains cobbled together by the few remaining members of Blizzard North (the only team to actually make any good games). The fact that game is any good I believe rests squarely shoulders of Kaplan's direction. 
---
Hearthstone was an attempt to recycle all their assets and investment from their failed CCG. Hearthstone has seen virtually no development since release, and the game had to buy out a smaller indie studio to create minigame modes for it (which they've been repeating for years now).
---
They almost had something with HotS, and then they got cold feet and pulled the plug \*because it was the first real project post-Blizzard-North-Blizzard had released.\* They expected it to set the world on fire, because after all, they're Blizzard right? That's what Blizzard games do, and this is the \*most\* Blizzard game. Except they're Blizzard in name only. Under the hood all the staff was new. (The devs themselves knew that, and with less oversight they're actually getting work done now. The management (read: Activision) doesn't have that kind of introspection.)
---
All their teams do is produce content updates to games they already have (and in the case of Diablo and Starcraft, not even that).
---
I just can't see Blizzard releasing a real game of any serious quality again.
---
Make it relevant then. Bear?
---
Its also selfish to tell people not to roll on a 100g item because its an upgrade for you. Its 100g for everyone, why should i pass 100g because you need more intel. Theyre both valid reasons to roll. The sooner people realize that the better we will be. If i can sell the BOE item for one or two BIS items why wouldnt I. There clearly is a flaw in the design and blizzard changed it later.its just the smart way to do things.
---
Do you want to know top dps class in classic 1.12?
---
... It's warrior.
---
We use well Job for everything instead of good job
---
Alt+f4
---
I mean... did you play way back in the day?  That’s when it started.  Gold farmers were everywhere.  They would need on literally anything sometimes.  It’s not the main reason for it, but that sure didn’t help.
---
If you guys want to rage about people needing on boes (which you should do.. need on them I mean), why don’t you get mad at blizzard.  They could have kept it bop. Why do you think they changed some to boe?  It’s not to benefit the people who immediately find it... that makes no sense.  
---
It’s to create a valuable item(in some cases) that become so valuable it’s stupid to equip it.  The rich people deck out their alts or gear up for twinkled battlegrounds with them.  Or they are just not great but they will still sell.
---
Just look at boes as the same as rolling for chests.  And where it starts is boe blue and higher.  It’s that simple.  If it’s a boe recipe, pattern, whatever.  If it’s only worth a small amount no one really cares.  But saying you need a 300g thing more than everyone else because you can equip it right this second isn’t going to persuade anyone.
---
wtf
---
Aight so its a swapping service with a middle man. The swapper has rates, say, every 1 gold on classic costs 100g on retail. You trade the middle man 100g on retail, he trades you 1g on classic. He then goes and has a slightly lower rate for people buying retail gold for classic gold so he makes a profit at the end of the day. Only restriction being what server you’re on, which could be problematic. Some of the richest players in OSRS have been doing this for years.
---
How about the people that continue to give their money to a company they seem to despise and shit on every single day? I get people’s issues with blizz, I have my own, but if I outright hated them I’d stop giving them money lol
---
Reduce the number of keybinds I need to play the game. As it stands I have to have WAY too many buttons, plus stance bars, stealth bars, shift bars, ctrl bars, all just to basically do some damage with a spell or whatever. It is too many buttons to keep track of and it gets annoying. This is why when I came back it didn't stick this time, and why I'm playing classic.  
---
That and they need to open the talents back up.
---
I personally saw “of healing” drop so I assume the other spell damage suffixes are available (and not just stat suffixes).

Ad hominem attacks, nice.
---
That website lists my protection warrior BiS including 1% hit chance. I don’t think tanking will work too well with hit so low. It has an incredibly high priority on + Defense for some reason.
---
No addon. Just right click your character portrait in the top left, click "unlock" and move it wherever you want. Same for the enemy portrait.
---
Not a warlock but I'm willing to guess it's more than a 20% dps loss. Wearing full Felheart over BiS gives -89 spell damage, -2 % spell crit and +1% spell hit.
---
Responding to help you remember!
---
Honestly I enjoyed that quest. I play a resto shaman and when I got to the end of this quest the water elemental told me to protect and give life and I feel like he gave me purpose.
---
Dude, I was just making a joke that turtles have the lowest dps of all pets, and are therefore worst at holding aggro.
---
After taming that wolf you need to have it use the skill you want to learn several times.   Kill about 5 - 10 regular enemies with the new pet and you will learn the skill, after that you can train your other wolf
---
&gt;Your entire argument hinges on the fact that you don't consider the benefit that selling the item could have.
---
Because it's not relevant. It is an indirect benefit, and indirect benefits is not the intention of Blizzard.
---
&gt;If you want to equip a 100g item that would give you less benefit than selling it for 100g and buying other more applicable gear that's better value for you, then I guess you go ahead and make that mistake.
---
I wouldn't need on it and I've never seen anyone need on BoE epics in my 13 years of this game except in screenshots. Greed has always worked and is the intention of the developer.
---
&gt;Basing the group decision of this mistake seems selfish.
---
Ignoring the intention of the system just because of gold is selfish.
---
Yeah jesus, only hunters ever fuck up pulls! And it's all hunters that do, not just below average ones!
---
Thanks, I've found something called Nauticus but apparently it's been dead for a while. I'll make a real thread about it later might get lucky and someone'll know an addon still working.
---
It’s nothing to do with me screwing up and more about being quicker while also eliminating the chance for the game to do its usual dumb pet things. If you want to use eotb then go for it, I’ll keep dismissing my pet.
---
That questline from Fordring in EPL gives a boatload of exp.
---
Dynamic respawn is still a thing even without layering. If someone's killing all the mobs quickly, they'll respawn faster than normal.
---
The people screaming it's not Classic get real quiet when you remind them that servers holding as many people as they can now isn't Classic either. It was either layers or fighting with 100 people for quest mobs, because servers can hold way more people now than they did back then.
---
Uh oh. I better tell blizz they've been charging me all these years in error.

Haha thanks, make sure you try the 470mb tif file.
---
That's right unless you're spec'd deep into BM. Frenzy talent increases attack speed after landing a crit. More attacks = more crits = more frenzy uptime. Broken Tooth also allows you to only put 3/5 in this talent for max uptime instead of 5/5.

by arms I mean people who respec arms between raids sometimes.  pretty much all dps warriors raid fury.

Lot of good that did us :(
---
What does [nostance:3] actually do here though? Seems like the same functionality without?
---
Makes sense for more complex macros but seems unnecessary here.
---
For sure man. I was just getting frustrated because people think abusing layering to respawn instance bosses infinitely and just swapping layers to find what they're looking for are both "abuse". I probably came off as a dick, but it's just so irritating when you can clearly tell they haven't bothered to learn about the situation.
---
If you guys only have 3 warlocks in your raid for MC, I may have found your problem already.
---
You'll probably want Parry and Tactical Mastery, and then finish out Fury; respec at 40 for Bloodthirst, then go back to arms for the Tactical Mastery again or the prot tree.

Well this is oddly generic.
---
Most of the people you run into will be as well. Get in the game!!!!
---
The beauty is there's likely some drops for them as well! If you do BRD for example, they still probably need HoJ, or ironfoe, or the savage chain.
---
Yes. Every server will have packed guilds contesting the bosses.
---
dont hold your breath for official blizz stats
---
Really going out of your way to misrepresent what i'm saying. Obviously layers are not going to be larger than the server size.

My point was that the previous posters definition of what qualified for need vs greed was too vague and left loopholes for misunderstanding.
---
This just reminds me of me as a rogue in vanilla. This happened to me when I was running MC and ZG with my guild. I was rocking Krol and a dal rends thru bwl. I wanted to switch to daggers. I even think I had lobo from av. For some reason my guild kept giving the daggers to hunters. Eventually, after a month and a half, I just called it quits because nothing was dropping weapon wise. Eventually I switched guilds and all was normalized but I was told repeatedly “you will get perditions.” Hey man, I just want some weapon. Been rocking the same thing for like 4 months. Never did get perditions and ended up with CTS
---
The wowhead comments for that quest kept me entertained while I was farming.

There was this artist who did really cute pictures of all the bread vendors in every major city. Including Myra.
---
The current amount of obtainable hit gear for cloth spell casters is 4%. Spell hit cap is 16%. Mages get to 10 in frost, and 14 in arcane with this. Warlocks can get to 14... Only with dots. Maximum hit on shadow bolt is 4% currently. You tell me if that extra 4% is worth it. Probably not.

---
Blood rage as a tank smh
---
Druid and paladin(to a lesser degree) while being viable are certainly not better at tanking anything. Warriors simply have way more tools than either of them to do the job. Another thing is a lot of warriors don't know how to utilize their full toolkit, but when they do, there's no comparison.
---
Wtf why does my guild have 6 people classic is dead
---
I don't have a warrior/shaman so my group just did arm once for the quest and then we spammed Cath together
---
I had not given it much thought before now, but are block and parry actually discouraged when tanking?
---
Oh and one more thing! Tell your group this as well. Communicate what your loot is going to be. This goes a long way.
---
I'm only 16 so far but I've been reading more about the drain tanking method you speak of. Seems to be the new meta. Thanks!
---
Wait did you find a macro solution to soft fix it? Cause the ones I tried didn't work.

Got my warden staff for 250.   Doesn't matter either way.

Well I’m not like that at all unless I smoke weed, and I’m not knocking it for anyone who can smoke in moderation and it’s absolutely fine for them, but to deny it affects a significant amount of people in a detrimental way is just plain naive.

Love it when wow pops up in unexpected places. My dad is a retired firefighter, and I did a ride along with his department a long time ago. One of his coworkers played on his laptop at work, and showed them Leeroy Jenkins one day.

His advice to just kill every green mob you run across was probably the best piece of advice I got for leveling in Classic. Just keep the grind going at all the times.

You can simply grind mobs in the Plaguelands (including [Scholomance](https://classic.wowhead.com/zone=2057/scholomance) and [Stratholme](https://classic.wowhead.com/zone=2017/stratholme))  to get a headstart into your Argent Dawn reputation. Mobs will stop  granting reputation fairly early on, though, with the exception of  dungeon bosses. Whenever you're killing mobs in the Plaguelands, make  sure to always have an 📷[ Argent Dawn Commission](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12846/argent-dawn-commission) equipped to get Scourgestones (explained later in the guide).
---
* Normal Undead mobs in Western and Eastern Plaguelands will grant reputation until **3000/6000 into Friendly**.
---
* Elite mobs in the Plaguelands and normal mobs in Scholomance/Stratholme will grant reputation until **11999/12000 into Honored**.
---
* Bosses in Scholomance/Stratholme will grant reputation **all the way to Exalted**.
---
Your're obviously right but in my honest opinion, people who get upset and wanna cry about a tilted and somewhat lofi pic they stumbled upon online appears pretty spoiled and need to grow out of that mindset.
---
Weird how wow peaked in Wrath which is seen as the ultimate middle ground between retail and classic... but yeah who wants to go back to peak wow anyways right?
---
You're acting like it. Why is it unbelievable that I played in vanilla? Basically everyone I knew that was into video games at the time played it.
---
Joined a guild on Zandalar Tribe named &lt;CHAD&gt;
---
Every time someone joined everyone online would spam CHAD! Ifsomeone had an awesome drop or did some amazing pvp outplay everyone would call them CHAD or say CHAD MOVE or the good old CHAAAAD.
---
Best thing was that if people gquit, then the whole guild would spam BETA for several minutes.
---
It was so dumb, yet so fun ! For a few days anyway..
---
Feel free to go look at their share price history before typing an emo paragraph next time
---
Yeah, would think so too, but +healing and + fierywrath are the ones that are listed
---
Shifting out of and back into a form eg trying to tank and no rage to maul a target, 1button to cancel and troop bearform and furor allows you to have 10 rage.
---
Very. I used a gorilla from 35 to 40 solo farming sm lib. Thunderstomp even at rank 1 does a ton of damage and generates alot of threat, although it comes with a minute cd.
---
They are good meat shields and threat holders but they dont have a focus dump ability like bite or claw so their dps is lacking.
---
First meme I’ve actually laughed at. Well done!
---
If you actually demanded a reroll after someone that genuinely needed and wanted to equip the item won it then you are a genuine, grade A moron.
---
I ran this fucking instance 6 times last night. 1 Scarlet Legs and 5 fucking shoulders.
---
I think I'm up to 12 runs at this point and I've only ever seen the legs or the shoulders drop. I don't even want Ravager, I just want the helm. 
---
FUCK Herod.
---
That's true
---
I hate playing Warrior and Death Knight in retail and those used to be two of my favorite classes
---
You have like four buttons that do an instant attack with a fifth one that lights up
---
They all play that way...
---
And they butchered the Warlock fantasy so much as well...
---
Every class feels like you just build up bar of resource and dump it as fast as possible
---
Verry good video man, thanks!
---
I'm at a point where if I know I'm going to die I just stand still and perform no actions and dont emote or say anything.
---
God I want transmog in classic
---
Edit: Why am I getting down voted for this? It's literally just my opinion
---
Just all need. It's the fairest choice by far and avoids loot drama. If someone does not need and wanted to, have them /roll. If they win, give it to them, if they tie, roll-off.
---
~eye~ would personally pass on an item bc I think it’s polite. that’s what I just said. I’m saying that EYE personally wouldn’t need an item I don’t need. I am not entitled to an item somebody else can use because I want gold instead. I am relinquishing my claim to an item. I would love to hear why that’s more greedy than the alternative but it’s ok; I don’t agree with you and I don’t have to, so you can tell me I’m greedy as much as you want.
---
Fucking Jody I found you!
---
The basic premise for survival is that they don't wear tissue paper for armor and therefore are able to take a hit or 10 before needing a heal, unlike mages. Warrior AoE DPS is actually really decent. Plus you're only waiting for one guy to rehydrate, not 4.
---
Edit: sorry to answer the spell question, the Shaman drops WF totem, and Warriors go HAM with Whirlwind/SS/Cleave.
---
Demanded is strong word. Asked is correct. They already had it and the choice was theres. If you can't read then you are a genuine and grade A putz
---
*Outplayed*
---
Hopefully this means phase 2 soon.
---
Night savers are supremely cheap, but you need to first grow a tree from sapling to buy one
---
I have nothing good to say about this.
---
Did ANY of us actually read "nestingway" or did every single one of us get "nesingwary" out of that word spaghetti the first time around?
---
as far as pve servers go, Westfall \[mostly alliance\] and Mankrik \[mostly horde\] are pretty high pop (iirc between 40-50k players\]
---
Rogue vs. Mage for alt or possible reroll
---
Hmm. It’s possible that people with Wowhead’s app just haven’t seen it drop yet. I had to farm those bosses a ton to get my tank shoulders (~12 resets and 6x possible bosses they can drop from).
---
Yah when in my cat set mana can be a problem.  I'm alchemy so luckily I can pot up if needed.   2 mobs can be rough, I usually have to war stomp then root/heal.  Most classes have issues with that.  
---
For gankers,  its usually root and run, then come back and get them when healed. :)  but yah, druid can feel a bit squishy.
---
I stacked stamina in PvP. As a priest you are generally a prime Target because you can heal. The longer you can survive, the more damage hopefully your teammates can do... Oh wait. I'm talking in battlegrounds. 
---
I default to others for random world PvP. Ignore my comment until the battleground phase. Lol.
---
&gt;en the GM is online, he has a mod that auto replies “Keep the chatter in Discord” 
---
The easiest solution is to put that shitheel on ignore.
---
I will feign death when I know it's inevitable, hoping they will take mercy on soul lol.
---
They usually proceed by slashing at my dead body until it's more dead.
---
And people wonder why I like druids at end game lol Easiest to gear by far!
---
By that logic I guess classic release made the S&amp;P 500 go up as well lmao. 
---
ATVI was at 50.19 August 1st and 50.60 August 30th. When did classic cause a massive bump again? 56.03 on September 10 but 52.25 today, guess the layers getting removed caused the value to go down. 
---
Do you see what I’m getting at?
---
Edit: ATVIs market cap is FOURTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS
---
That's a great idea. If that was the plan I would sub now and actually play classic
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com
---
Supposedly that's a private server bug and you can't heal them if you're alliance but anyone feel free to correct me.
---
the content is so easy that you can do it in shit blues and some greens BIS is not required
---
The first absurd need roll is where I draw the line. Once is enough.
---
I only play as tank and I plainly refuse to continue the run unless the item is given back, a valid explanation is availiable (like "I fucked up misclicking need guys, here is X silver/gold, please /roll" or the ninja is forcibly removed.
---
- Plays RNG loot game

- Gets bad RNG

Intellect doesn't provide spell power at all, so no, this doesn't scale with intellect.

Wonder what the Operation would be called for UBRS
---
Ooooh that's a bummer
---
In your world people just straight up cannot farm recipes, I'd rather pay the price of the odd ninja from one or two guys to have a functional game.
---
It's herd immunisation, if everyone blacklists and reports ninjas there are less ninjas, if they won't have an issue there will be more.
---
In vanilla there were guilds who literally died because they got known as ninjas from not controlling members, several people just were unable to run dungeons and ended up leaving server, it worked in vanilla so it can work now. That's the whole point of having a community.
---
Quit spouting shit idiot. Someone that legitimately wants to equip an item should get priority on it in a dungeon, regardless of whether there's a chance they just won't equip it and will be a dick and sell it on the AH. If they don't equip it on site, make a mental note of their name, easy.
---
Ignorant people with your sort of greedy, self-serving mentality are precisely the type to avoid in dungeons.
---
They are humanoids, so no, can't skin "humans". It is correct.
---
Fire heals.
---
I look forward to these. I've never wanted a WoW show in this style more!
---
Haha, you replied to *my* comment you absolute moron.
---
What class makes the most out of engineering?
---
Possibly scholo key as well as work on your strath/brd keys but you got most of it.
---
As a druid tank, suddenly I can't be in full tank gear.  I'll receive no damage and thus receive no rage.
---
double click the fast forward button
---
Look, if you want to need roll a 100g piece of gear that you wouldn't even pay 30g for it yourself, win the roll, and equip it instead of getting much more value by selling it on the AH and buying better gear you can go ahead and do it. Nobobdy is here to tell you that you can't make dumb choices and ignore the AH in an RPG game if you are headset on it. 
---
The issue comes when you want to make dumb choices at the expense of your party members.
---
Oh, cool. Didn't see any other comments about them and currently on mobile, so didn't download the big one. Will try that!! &lt;3
---
Tork wrench comes from a level 20ish crossroads quest, so be sure to hold on to it.

What’s the exchange rate? 50k retail for 5g Classic?

Not worth a dime tbh, lvl 19 twinks will go for gravestone scepter woch is a bfd q reward
---
There's a reason boe items exist. That reason, and the only reason is that they can be sold or traded. Every item should be bop in your mindset.  You can't treat a boe item the same as a bop and claim rights to it just because you can use it, a boe item is of equal value to everybody by design. If I win the roll on a boe item I can't use I can sell it and get one I can. If you win a boe equip item you CAN use, congratulations, you don't need to go through the trouble of selling it to buy another. What boe item drops is irrelevant, only it's gold value is important as any class can use its value to get one they can use, basically everybody is rolling on an item they can use. If you don't understand that you're a little dense.
---
That's like being confused by why an nginx server serving plain HTML over HTTP can handle way more clients than Apache serving PHP over HTTPS/TLS1.3.  Throw out accuracy and security for "Fuck it, close enough" and you'll get way better performance.  
---
Or a simpler example would be calculating the circumference of a circle using either pi=3, or pi accurate to a million decimal places and being shocked that one of those calculations takes longer.
---
The only real thing spy ruins is clicking on people, it's about a million times easier to click their name on spy than it is to actually click them if they're hiding or trying to to be targeted.  
---
That being said, basically every other function of spy existed on various addons in retail vanilla and we used them back then just fine.
---
Life Tap....
---
I dont think we are on the same page. I will say that my ingame experience has been great with pugs, on 4 different BoE epics. 2 were straight up passed without discussion  to the person who thenequiped it, the others 2 groups rolled greed except the 2 people who again equiped it.   
---
I would say to establish loot rules before any group. That is all you need to do for any model to work. 
---
Unless the person forming the group has some other rules in mind, It should be set as need before greed. The AH doesnt get a vote. I will have to finish my reply as my phone is dying.
---
But it is a profession, because you have to put time and effort into leveling it.
---
Yes, mages pay for training, but they don't sit there for literal hours spamming lockboxes hoping for skillups.
---
I have never played a rogue, but there is no comparison there at all.
---
Better question..... why are you so upset that I don’t believe or care that you played. Should probably actually never comment you’re to soft. Also I still doubt it.
---
By use it, they mean equip it right away.
---
That doesn't change the fact that i want to min-max my character
---
Hmm ok ty ima sell i t now then
---
On herold, I was told the warden staff was going for 250-300g meanwhile the alliance is 500+.  I was able to get it for 400g while the cheapest on the AH was 600g...
---
I mean theres literally 4 or 5 other non crafted 5/10 man blue 2hers better
---
average level is like 45-50 now
---
literally unplayable
---
I like how you based your argument on a version of the spell that doesn't actually exist. The actual values are really important, you can't just make up arbitrary figures and determine whether that makes a good spell.
---
Let's consider a spell that costs 100 mana, has a 5 second cast time, and deals 10 damage over 10 seconds to a target within 10 yards. Obviously you should never use that.
---
I'm dead before my heartrate can rise
---
This is the easiest farm for sure. I did that for my mount. Dinged 40 while doing it and went straight from there to grab my mount.

---
Started this last night, I'm determined to finish. The money made off of sealed trunks is amazing tho
---
Well the players have spaced themselves out.  It's by continent, so it's not a 'servers cant do it' but more of a 'this wouldn't be fun at all'.
---
I'm perplexed by the lack of ghost mushroom!
---
Dreadforge reaver is a blue and even then destiny is pretty meh
---
Which is likely a couple years down the road.
---
That's why we need classic+. If you roll need it should become bound to your character immediately. Solves 98% of the issues at hand.
---
30 minutes is a loong time i'd say. 
---
We had an experienced raid leader and we spent maybe 5-10 minutes max on the first try. After people had gone to the toilet and so on.
---
After having been a part of different guilds, before raiding. i could easily imagine many guilds being slow about it, solely based on how undedicated the guild leader can be.
---
It will be much lower once you've done it succesfully, unless it's just a group of people who are never prepared, both ingame and IRL, in terms of food and toilet and whatever.
---
I feel like its efficiency is only on paper. In practice, I don't find it meaningful.

Single layer means if someone is on your realm, you can meet them. With the 2 layer servers there's a chance they aren't in you layer and you might miss them. 
---
It doesn't mean cross-realm.
---
Pickles did nothing wrong
---
Shift-clicking the person's name and seeing they are level 19, and not 50, is a massive, *MASSIVE* indicator that they are looking for Dead Mines and not Dire Maul.  
---
Especially considering Dire Maul **isn't even out yet**.
---
In situations like this it's almost always better to just grind on whelps or something on the east side of badlands. The loot is better and you have a chance at making a few hundred gold if you get a dark whelping
---
Did he use a mind control cap and start making Bill Cosby references to you?
---
i personally draw my line of tanking in DPS spec about half-way threw BRD. after lord incendius is about where i go nop. (so doing the entire sunken temple is fine.)
---
with that said if i join a group as DPS i join since i want a break from tanking i wasn't spamming chat for 20-30 minutes to get into a group to tank i could just have gone tank LFG and within 5-10 secounds i have 3 people wanting me to join and an other 8 dps people wanting me to form a group with them in it. it is a scummy thing to expect a warrior to DPS when that is not what they wanted to do.
---
I played from 2.0 til the cata prepatch and that whole time deadmines was VC primarily on my server. Never played pservers.
---
This is false. I'm on the server he transferred from and it is kicking quite happily at the level 60 range. Several MC/Ony main raids and pugs run each week.
---
Cringey dork lmao go do a  psychoanalysis on why ur such a loser instead
---
It's not a terrible example, it's the same reasoning but to the extreme. Why would I pass on other classes BoP BiS items as a priest since I could use the gold or disenchantments? If they need on my BoE shit you can be 100% assured I'm going to need on everything for the rest of the run. We all "need" gold, right? You ninja my BiS I'll get mine vendoring your BiS. That's why it's a shitty mentality, with that kind of arguments no one benefits from the loot system and dungeons become a lot less interesting.
---
Lol. Selfish. Sorry that I want to be treated equally as others for doing the same thing they are. You’re right. The other dps warrior obviously deserves to be rewarded more for his effort compared to my effort. 
---
Clearly you are in favor of pay gaps for equal work. It would be selfish of you to want to be paid more when other people have more bills to pay. 
---
You really are actually that dumb.
---
I am starting to see more high/full on bigglesworth than stalagg.  It may be a coincidence as I have only seen it twice lately but I havent seen stalagg higher in over a week. These are the only 2 I have characters on so it is the only 2 I look at.
---
I haven't needed to contact support in the last few years. Every single time I did before then, it was always a great experience - legitimately the best online customer service I'd ever received. Very sad if they have indeed fallen so far.
---
Depends what you want to do... Broken Tooth for PvP and Wolves for Raids. However I like to just have the one pet for all... Probably the best bet for that, is the Worgs from SFK. They have 1.2 attack speed, so pretty good for push-back. They have the all-needed Howl for raids. And with +5% Armour, can do alright in the open world.
---
Do you sell the sealed trunks? Of sell what's inside?
---
In Classic, Paladins feel like Paladins.
---
In Retail, Ret paladins feel like glowy rogues, Holy feels like a priest, and Prot feels like a cheaper Warrior with a frisbee.
---
Why would you phrase your response so poorly and stupidly?
---
Fucking this. Every time I join a group it has a warrior and we still need a tank and I’m just like omfg I’m just gonna go Reroll war cuz y’all are all retarded
---
Yeah... that's why I play PVE. I want to relax and grind - not have unexpected adrenaline surges.
---
I believe it is one of the extras with auctioneer maybe enchantrix and other components.
---
My sides are hurting so bad. I was Bilbo, 15 years ago.
---
Do you use slam at all when leveling as fury? Of course i mean with a two hand
---
Of course, no heathens in my group!
---
Exactly. Simply shift-clicking the person's name will tell you EXACTLY which instance they are referring to. Anyone upset about using either is retarded.
---
Trash
---
hahahaha
---
really regret vendoring that
---
unsurprisingly unoriginal
---
Yeah water breathing would have been nice lol
---
Running a guild and organizing a raid is no fucking joke dude.

Rofl plz do more

I think the idea is that the creators of the map should be getting your money. Yes this guy made corrections, but it still isn’t his intellectual property. The idea that you own something you came up with is important to society as a whole.

Your genuine appreciation is gold enough.
---
So freaking true. I’m always needing against a hunter.

Yet he still got this shit funneled to him, because streamer
---
What's funny is that it doesn't happen often.  Just like 1 group out of 50 running a high level dungeon that night that is spamming for two hours since they can't find anyone.
---
They should definitely merge the smaller servers because a percentage of these players may stop subscribing and playing.
---
I don’t disagree. Similar skill sets imho.
---
You might better ask the pros at /r/woweconomy
---
Pfft how can I tell how big it is without a banana!
---
I had an underworld band drop on a mara run. It took a lot of convincing from the rest of the group to get the mage let our warlock have it. He insisted we all roll need.
---
Wow! Market fluctuations cause by a single game, that’s definitely how the stock market works. Listen dude if you want to believe Classic is the sole cause a MASSIVE company like ATVI to have stock fluctuations that is your choice, but it makes you wrong.
---
I think I'll seize the market and roll an alt. Only thing I can do for now, thank you.

Yup. Or you could have to pick what faction before you get to join a que.

Lots of Mages are trigger happy AF, don't act like that ain't a thing just because you are calm and composed like Gandalf :D
---
You need to grind the whole time.  If a quest makes you go from point A to point B, you should never do just that.  Grind mobs from point A to point B.   Always killing....this will help you get past those dead parts of levels with no quests.

It's not the hardest thing to do, but I had just gotten mor'ladim's sword and was excited to use it

Lol no you want to see what people are wearing
---
As a Warrior, it's especially hilarious because I'm definitely not joining that group knowing that there's another Warrior already in the group who is obviously nothing but a DPS Warrior.  I hate them more than these idiot Mages running around because not only are they going to make my life difficult during the run, they will also roll on the gear I can use, including the tank gear which blows my mind because they're clearly never going to fucking use it!
---
Let them come
---
Uuuummmm...I have no idea what this mean.
---
I'm on a government computer, which blocks anything related to games, otherwise I would click the link and read for myself.

I think the problem is that classic is hosted on same servers that host live and are optimized for sharding and for live in general.  doesn't work the same as it used to back in the day or like the private servers. Its exacly the same type of lag you get in massive fights in live servers, which is kinda shame. Blizzard for sure could afford proper servers for classic but they just didnt give a shit
---
Ibb?
---
Did you get her?
---
I think in p3 ill go to dual +15agi but for now I like lifestealing

And you sound fucking retarded. Why should i pass on 100g. Why dont you buy the item if you need it. And yes, that means needing items that I could use also. It goes both ways.  Youre also being greedy when youre telling people not to roll on a 100g item just because YOU can equip it. If everyone needs it we all get a shot at a 100g. Its even more fair this way you peasant.
---
Or I don't group with tanks like u who think they're special because they've got a taunt and instead have a guild and friends list full of tanks :)
---
Hope you have fun competing for gear with the rest of the fury dungeon tanks at 60, SM won't last forever
---
ye boi, same here. Then you get to farm devilsaurs in relative peace
---
Following a similar ideaology, except specifically for the sake of wPvP I respec'd to MM at 30 (when Scatter Shot becomes available) and have gone straight down Survival since. I plan on running 0/21/30 at endgame and this will bring me right to it.
---
Plus, aimed shot crits are super fun in wPvP.
---
Uh yeah. Thats literally what the phrase means. It amazes me that you keep attempting to be ironically sarcastic yet continue to use examples that only prove my point.
---
Either you're a troll  or you're an idiot.
---
/s?
---
One of the absolutely huge things for me in classic is the community. As I level I run across the same dudes over and over again. We periodically group up and take things on. I add people to my friends list and when they see me in the zone they ask for help with something or vice versa. I love it. It makes me glad I rolled a tank. Last night I was going to go to bed but some people asked me if I could tank for them (I was in stormwind farting in the AH) and I decided to go ahead and do it. Smoothest run I've had and it built the start of a relationship with those players. If it was a /lfg or raidfinder group I'd never see any of them again.
---
I at least give like 20, 3 is pretty low lol

I like the idea of putting something in the cake. Thank you for your suggestion!
---
That is why you start a new character on the new servers and not transfer.
---
Also, 55+ is not the norm, while some are max level, majority of players are anywhere from 30-50 across all realms.
---
Most of the people who hit 60 have rushed there and now realise (Unless you are in a dedicated steamer guild/raiding guild) that the raiding portion is minimal.
---
&gt;Nobobdy is here to tell you that you can't make dumb choices and ignore the AH in an RPG game if you are headset on it. 
---
It's not a dumb choice. It's literally how the majority of rolls have worked the past 13 years. The AH is not relevant toward the **INTENDED** usage of the system, no matter how many times you try to weasel an argument for it. It doesn't matter thaat it's an RPG, an MMO, or an MMORPG. The system wasn't intended that people press need to auction the item. End of story. Placing your dumb values over the intentions of the system is the dumb choice.
---
&gt;The issue comes when you want to make dumb choices at the expense of your party members.
---
It's not an expense. Them potentially not getting an item isn't an expense. It's them not getting something additional they don't need.
---
"blacklist"? xD
---
Usually, when our GM/assistant GM invites someone, they'll give us a heads up. Most of the officers, including myself, will say something like, "And that's why I'll never trust [GM] with a jar of peanut butter again," "And that's when I knew joining this guild was a mistake," etc.
---
It's a good way of getting a laugh out of everybody, and letting the new recruit know we're laid back just having a good time.
---
You’re also giving him more rage which means more damage so he’ll be tanking easier! Win win. 
---
As an actual prof spec warrior, I just stun the mob and go about building threat on the others. Keep my taunt for the aoe mage or warlock.
---
I haven't found this at all in my journey to 60. The overwhelming majority of people I've grouped with have been honest rollers.
---
Not to mention piles and piles of leather/mail if you're dps.
---
Hots don't crit though.  Sure not popping out of bear form to cast anything else meaningful.
---
For some reason I can’t hit shift-S while also jumping. Anybody know how to override this?? Thx
---
Its not. Its bis for defensive stats but youll replace it in AQ for the cat mace
---
Bis is atiesh and crowd pummeler
---
It hurts to read cause I know it’s true
---
Might cop some flack but I was Level 39 and thought I’d look for BT when I first entered Badlands, checked the maps online to see the spawn points, did 2 laps of the 3 reported spawn points and on the third round trip BT was there. All up 15 minutes spent looking for it. Tamed it just as another Hunter entered the area.
---
I had another wolf mob on me too, I had about 10% health left at the end because of the other mob, the other Hunter didn’t provide any assistance and I know he was secretly hoping I’d die so he could take BT for himself.
---
KOS lists are definitely a thing and great when done right.
---
I found a 60 horde hunter ganking AFK flight path Alliance and spamming "go to retail" in /yell using a faction translator.
---
Proceeded to gank/camp him 6 times until he eventually managed to grab a wyvern out of there. 
---
Added to KOS so I can continue to gank and camp him in the future.
---
Only the strongest survive bro.
---
Or 250%
---
No, YOU want to see what people are wearing. I could care less
---
No, because as a guild you are functioning as a unit and everybody is financing the guilds progression, if a boe item drops a guildy benefits from then they can have it as it's furthering our ability to get more items we can use without them needing to buy it. If im in a pug it's need on boe so we all get an equal shot at the gold value to do with as we please, in a pug you are not working towards a greater cause together, you are just clearing a dungeon together for quests, gold or bop items.
---
You're probably the rogue or mage that thinks BIGDICKDEEPSAGHHHHHHH is the only way to play and that when you draw aggro, it's the tanks fault.
---
What does this have to do with anything?...
---
Mmm, tranq shot
---
Personally, I enjoyed 19 throughout vanilla and tbc. We had a rival horde guild of 19s that we ran into in wsg all the time. So much so that we ended up coordinating meetups in the barrens and holding tournaments and 2v2/3v3/4v4 fights.
---
I never liked killing the nontwinks in BGs, honestly, but I guess I get why people WOULD enjoy that. I did, however, enjoy ganking level 20-30 players in Stonetalon Mountains and Southshore as a 19. 
---
When BC came out and arena skirmishes were a thing twinking REALLY got good.
---
Shit I just started STV.
---
We do the same stupid shit in my guild, except we also spam F when people join.
---
Left..not STV
---
Right..STV
---
I'm using bombs while tanking and it's been amazing.
---
It is entirely feasible to have this on live. Hell, the game is called World of WARcraft. That used to be important to Blizzard. Stroke that big brain ego elsewhere.
---
Hopefully Blizzard will not let those class do pitiful damage for 2  complete years. That would be unreasonable.
---
Why would anyone delete their characters (Especially at max level)?
---
I get that "Wow addiction thing" but jsimply just walk away and dont play, let your sub run out. its as easy as that (Don't try to say otherwise as ive played this game on and off since 2004 and its been easy to walk away, hell i havent played retail since half way through WOD)
---
Iirc that questline just wasn't finished. It was supposed to be longer but they probably gave up for release.  
---
The npc says 
---
&gt;For the time being, I shall give you what you need to focus your spells and to call upon the spirits of air. Take this totem, and when you are ready, train with me some more.
---
What quest line let's you upgrade the dungeon sets?
---
Because then how else would he shill his stream??
---
[yup!](https://imgur.com/Rt2JgOd)
---
Just dinged 60, haven't done anything but dungeon quests / gear runs since 54. Only just got everything I need out of BRD and am looking at strat/scholo now.
---
Endgame definitely starts before 60.
---
Very american comment
---
I wasn't disputing that.
---
You realize the issue is the group in question was inviting DPS when it seems they wanted a tank?
---
Probably massive drop after 30 days game time expired.
---
/r/holup
---
Don’t downplay how garbage this is.
---
There’s no excuse for this especially given how much money Blizzard is collecting from all of us.
---
you're right about them being bugged and how to fix them:
---
/cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
/cancelaura Predatory Strikes(Rank 3)
---
i mean, I guess it's clutter, but it's better than losing the buffs
---
I did it 6 times on my warrior. 1 helm, 5 ravagers.
---
My guild has a discord bot that anytime someone levels it comes into the voice chat and, very loudly, yells "nut!". If the bot is ever broken everyone in discord will yell nut instead. 
---
It has now progressed from just "nut!" to several different parodies. Examples include through the fire and flames, but every cord is nut. Instead of the iconic duh in bad guy, we have nut. And so many more.
---
Watching 4 dudes spin to win and drop nonstop cleaves while I toss them heals, chase down runners and play totembot is really fun, ngl
---
What part of the quest were you up to? There's a lot of different npcs that you need to talk to so knowing what you were up to will help.
---
Some warlock do life tap to get mana. I however do this to feel pain so I know there's still something I can feel
---
probably because the buffs only last five minutes, I don't know how long it takes to clear molten core, but I don't think you can get to Ragnaros in that time.
---
Maybe for Onyxia though.
---
And how exactly do you handle ninja events in a group like this?   Court martial?
---
Shred and being positional is always better in my experience. Pool energy for TF before Bite. Or TF into Ravage out of stealth to open. Rake on bosses and to cleave 3+ targets. Rip is a hard choice, if your group is killing the bosses slowly or if the boss has a higher armor rating or higher level it may be more beneficial.
---
Imho wolf'shead is largely over rated. You will never have a mana pool large enough to effectively use it while leveling. At max level gear gives you a large enough mana pool to make a significant dps gain. Either way the 20 energy is useful, just less than people make it out to be.
---
As feral dps I typically can out damage most other dps in the 35-45 range but I imagine as gear gets better pure dps will pull ahead.
---
correct, rejuv doesn't scale at 100% like renew.  that was my point.  and a downranked flash heal will destroy regrowth healing and snipe meters.
---
who cares in an ally guild
---
how to fix them: add this to the top of your bear/cat shift macro
---
The game was regurlarly balance over the scope of WoW vanilla orginally so that player could play their prefered playstyle. In it's current what you say is true about someone who wants to raid as Ret but hopefully blizzard will not leave the game in such an unbalanced state for two complete years.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNvDUO42Hys
---
Yeah. 
---
In reality there’s not a lot to do at 60 in phase 1. It’s limited anyways. This is the best time to play an alt, especially as the last 40’s to your entire 50’s will be hell to level in come phase 2.
---
Watch the last 10 seconds of the video.
---
What server are you on?
---
Já
---
This is actually ridiculous.
---
The amount of resources and cash they have, and they give the BARE minimum in quality as to appease shareholders spending concerns.
---
Old Blizzard is dead.
---
Glad I didn't order one now after seeing that figure. The colors look very bleh, and not nearly as much detail as the original image showed.
---
So... more powerful blades or dedicated blades could fix that problem.   
---
The real point is that to have those things it costs more money and in the instance of dedicating blades again, you lose the resiliency aspect of virtualisation (assuming they're clustered).   
---
I get that not all problems can be solved by throwing resources at them.. but this is literally a resource constraint problem.
---
I was upset about the possibility of layering never going away, and now I’m pleasantly surprised! See kids, it pays to be pessimistic.
---
All good. Any irritation I may have implied towards you is just leftover irritation from the chuckleheads lower down defending layering as a fair practice. Irks me. XD
---
No they couldn't. They weren't running a true WoW emulation. They made many compromises to do what they did. 
---
Not even close to the same level of scale and technical services like ddos protection or robust anti-cheating monitoring.
---
It's still impressive what they did, but to honestly believe they "could handle far more load than current Blizz servers" you have to be fairly ignorant.
---
The same basic networking rules apply to every game in existence. A linear increase in player density doesn't correspond to a linear increase in network load.
---
It appears the rose-tints of private servers are even worse than vanilla players rose-tints!
---
Stop being so emotional and reread what he wrote. Its the least frustrating option for everyone. You might be a happier indivual once you realize that.

I was wondering why the cities seemed so much more lively

Venoxis EU
---
Hey now my druid begs to differ
---
But you literally didn’t use Presence of Mind, you just popped Arcane Power and casted it normally?
---
I don’t remember what its called. It comes out with AQ though. Requires you to do DM, UBRS and a few other high level dungeons and pay money. Look up Feralheart Raiment. That’s the druid upgraded set.
---
If everyone is lagging, what is rng about it?
---
 Nothing next to *30m* debuff that gives 45% increased physical dmg taken by the silithids in southern un’goro.
---
PO TA TOES.
---
BOIL EM, MASH EM, STICK EM IN A STEW!
---
Jesus thats a dense answer
---
Yup, this one.
---
Hopefully the game will not stay in such unbalance state for two full years. who would want that?
---
&gt;It's the same for everyone. It's handled server-side and it's set to the same distance that it was in vanilla.
---
Now that connection speeds are better than they were in 2006... maybe they'll increase this distance... seems like it's too small but maybe they have a good reason for keeping it that way for now...
---
Is there a version without the flightpaths? This would be awesome for DnD
---
Is the pet immune to spells thing op?
---
Ya I have to agree. Glad I held strong and didn't buy one
---
37 here
---
Actually what you say is an assumption in my own comment. It is disappointing, as a customer, to deal with a corporate bureaucracy that has become bigger than its own product
---
Not my experience at all. Warrior dps has just the same chance as getting in a grp as other melee.
---
Multi dotting barkskin hurricane can pull 3-4 mobs. Pop a regrowth before pull and drink after. By the time youre topped off everything is off cd.

Its faster than bear or ST

Your cites realm sizes, not layer sizes. Today's lecture is: you need some reading comprehension.

"Mark Kern saying that the population cap was entirely driven by design during his interview with the ClassiCast"

Well yea, I mean if you get scared you don't want to ruin your pants right.

I've read 35+ quests reward more money which helps alot. I'm 35 and I've seen a jump in my coffer
---
Maybe you should try getting front row seats to a hot broad's sweet butt trumpet symphony before you get all judgey, Judgey McJudgeface.
---
Ive never rolled very well, always /roll 1-1, and never win anything....
---
“I will” fucking best line of the convo 😂😂
---
&gt; It was either layers or fighting with 100 people for quest mobs
---
There was a 3rd option. Lower the server caps to actually be like classic. Boom no layering necessary and no insane waits for mobs/quest items.
---
I’d say you should be in the 45-55g range in your low to mid 30’s to hit 90+g by 40.
---
Yup?
---
Yeah, this is 100% the problem. And it's both something that can be fixed, and that should've been expected by Blizzard if they had done some research into player behaviour on pservers.
---
yeah, I didn't know the whole story about it.  Didn't realize it wasn't his.
---
Too bad...  Well, I still think a lot of good work went into this and he could try to work with the original artist to come up with something they could sell.  Sounds like a lot of people on this thread would pay money for something like this.  Nothing wrong with letting someone know there is a market for something...
---
I guess it's up to OP to decide what they want to do with it.
---
And handle this, like civilized men to move on..
---
The AQ gates opening is going to be interesting
---
So much for layering, tbh. The only problem layering solved were the lvl 1-5 areas being nigh unplayable on launch. All the other problems it was supposed to fix still need actual solutions.
---
Why would a tank ever join that group rofl, if anything the orbs should go to the tank as there's 0 gear in all of strat for tanks last I checked.

I would be better if I had a QT Grand Inquisitor Whitemane to blast me with her toots

Did I make you angry somehow? Why are you name calling? I have had two in-depth conversations with two different people on this topic, in this thread. In the beginning, they too had the same outlook as you do. By the end of it they agreed that what I'm talking about is fair. We had pleasant discourse without disrespecting one another. I wonder if you think I'm the first person with this idea, because I'm not. It's actually a very popular opinion. If you actually care about why someone might feel this way then you can look into my profile for my most recent posts in this thread but I'm not going to continue with explaining for a third time with someone so disrespectful.
---
Horde only wins anything cuz they heavily out number on the majority of servers. I can't fucking wait for bgs lol.
---
Why a bow without stats?
---
I’ve got some work to do!
---
Executing a mission mid planning and getting everyone killed?
---
Hmm. Yea I think a court martial would do it.
---
oh god no just use JOPP its the same thing but they deleted all the fucking inputs and outputs.
---
bar of soap in a long sock.
---
I just got my Swift Green Mechanostrider for 900 and I'm only honored with Gnomes, is it different for another faction?
---
You really need to declare the loot rules if your not doing the system in place for new people they won't know.
---
I don't agree with that whole well it has a gold value why shouldn't I have it thing is what I think is greedy that's not from preventing anything.
---
Especially at launch. Lots of people will log in those first few days of phase 2.
---
It's been scientifically proven if you /roll 100-100 you'll roll 100 100% of the time.
---
[I hit the PoM Pyro macro at the end of the first cast.](https://i.imgur.com/AKXP0br.png)
---
Even a lock with okay gear and okay skill is valuable to the raid because of utility. Soulstones, summon portals, healthstones, and imp buff are all valuable.
---
Welcome to classic my friend =)
---
That's the joke.
---
If we're talking absolute most, either hunter because of the guns &amp; ammo, or to a lesser extent rogue for the practice lockbox
---
Ninja?
---
I like tanking in mmo's. But i can say i've not had a ton of fun on my way to 41 tanking stuff.
---
The DPS treat the game and retail and then scream at you for not holding threat.
---
Astranaar needs some work
---
because it removes any skill, tactic and coordination from the equation.
---
That doesn't really address the question, as it's possible to give someone gold in BFA and receive gold from the same person in Classic. 
---
That said, it seems like a massive risk to take. Since there's no direct transfer happening it would be pretty easy for one party to just take their side and leave. Even if it's not directly against any rules, it's a bad idea.
---
tell them to hurry
---
Really puts into perspective how many ridiculous mountain ranges are placed as area boundaries.
---
I love how everyone blames player for having a prefered playstyle thats not aligned with the current meta instead of adressing thr elephant in the room : Class balance.
---
Everyone says that ret pally do 1/2 of the damage a fury arms would do. If thats the case shouldnt we just ask class balance instead of throwing rocks at player that are playing the game in a way that was intended. Enhance, Ret and moonkin were designed to be flavourfull dps spec. Why not ask for balance for these class instead of asking players to switch class or spec?
---
Sorry that ones dead, I'll take a look. The owners of these discords are responsible for initially providing non-expiring unlimited use invites, but I'll track down new invites when it's brought to my attention that one's dead. Thanks =)

Edit: Updated
---
I'm curious, do you have any experience with computer science or software development? Maybe you do, and we're just talking past each other. I'd love to hear you justify your reasoning instead of just insulting me. Because it similarly amazes me that you don't see the silliness in that last statement. 
---
Pretty much *every* piece of software that you write is going to run smoother/faster in the future. Yet I think we can agree that not every single piece of software can be considered 'ahead of the times'. That would make the phrase meaningless if everything qualified.
---
If you think "I wrote this brute-force algorithm that solves the traveling salesmen problem! It runs like shit, but in 10 years it will run a bit faster! I'm ahead of the times!" is a sensible statement and proves your point then I'm perplexed. That phrase would make any software developer I have ever met laugh.
---
0 gold.
---
Didn't go full resto until after this. Before that I was HotW/NS
---
Or are idling in cities or instance or are playing in shorter sessions. To be honest this says very little about the actual population.
---
Woah TIL!
---
In the case of a tie there’s a hidden reroll until one wins. I’m sure it’s got nothing to do with who rolled first, and just sounds like a myth people believe because they observed it once or twice.
---
&gt;But usually you would tell your friends what’s going on
---
Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. I used to play UO where stuff like this was relatively common, people would give away everything or drop their houses and then never log in again, because they realized how unhealthy it was and needed a complete break. 
---
Some people need to go cold turkey with something like WoW because any small reminder can start the addiction again.
---
&gt;  if you own BRM any raid groups will just layer. Its annoying and boring and needs to go.
---
I haven't seen anyone try that yet.
---
It only takes 1 or two corpse runs to get past someone who "owns" BRM, so not worth layering.
---
Damn. I really need to stick to a main and live this journey
---
Excuse me motherfucker, YouTube raid and pvp clips 2006-&gt;2011 would like a word.
---
Its either this or Linken Park, accept no substitutes.
---
That's an incredibly weak fallacy. I'm 60 - I even have a tier 2 piece and multiple prebis-level items. Of course this is still irrelevant, and your argument only looks weaker. 
---
Someone who layer exploited might have a couple hundred gold than me. So what?
---
The vast majority of 60s aren't regularly exploiting layers. The actual advantage they gain is small. Their impact on the economy as a whole from their layering is probably not even measurable.
---
It's amazing how passionate people can be about something they can't even begin to quantify.
---
Reminds me of the "layering is going to be around forever reeeee!" argument that looks so silly now that most servers are down to just 2 layers.
---
Maybe you didn't get that memo.
---
&gt; You had purge to break the CC once
---
Unless someone from the zerg broke it with damage.  Root and sleep were the long duration CCs, and both broke on any damage.
---
Considering that it's a dps job not to start damage 0.2 seconds after the tank pulls then yes he is stupid. I still don't have ravaged because I've run arms 30+ times, it's only dropped for me maybe 6 times, and every single time a shaman has won it. I gave up.
---
I see, I did not know that.
---
What the actual fuck is a PVP ability?
---
Your earning potential increases so much between 30 and 40 that I really wouldn't sweat milestones. 
---
I think the more important metric is whether or not you're keeping up with professions. Earning potential from a high level profession is much more relevant than whether you're +- 10g or so.
---
Good info, ty
---
Hmmm I got a weird build where i went in prot tree until I got two shield blocks then went fury so I can main tank when need be but am working towards the flurry skill.
---
I'm level 36 and fighting mobs around my level and can non-stop (need to eat every 9-10 mobs or if I fight 3 at once). I stay in battle stance so I don't really use ww and I never ranked rend past rank 1. I'm using whirlwind axe and usually proc execute after 4-5 hits.
---
Hamstring fishing sounds interesting but seems kind of rng based.
---
I'm still new though so I don't know much but I'm surprised I see so many people saying things like warriors are bad at soloing or they are always rage starved. I never feel that way.
---
where do people find these girls?  here in the UK its just "omg lol i drink so much wine and watch so much netflix and have a personality disorder lmao btw i hate kids and men"
---
I wonder how much worse it is for them because I tank and I usually won't join a group with a warrior dps. I like to make it hard on them in the hope that they might tank instead someday (which also helps 4 other people every time they go to tank since tanks are in such short supply).
---
Damn that's almost a spell trained.
---
Thrash blade off-hand procs main hand extras.

Unless you mean because it misses so much.

Centaur Cave in 1k needles is good. Levelled my Hunter there from 25-30. Ended up with tonnes of cloth as well
---
thank you for this!
---
This is from Stubby. Its a part of the auctioneer addon that helps you to see what market value is on an item as well as its likely disenchant / disenchant value. Its useful in some situations but annoying in others.
---
Pretty much this. Get some/lots of threat on skull and tab sunder/whirlwind/revenge.
---
Luck.
---
sure at the start that is true but you will quickly find yourself in a situation where you are roll against rogues,hunters etc. for your pre-raid BiS stuff so you might aswell bring a warrior since they will roll on the same shit.
---
Your reading comprehension could use some work.
---
Immediately left a guild where a user spammed this and a rabbit ascii art when users login or join
---
I had 23 gold at level 34 and still managed to get 90g at level 40 without any farming or anything. The few levels before 40 you get quite a bit of gold. I'd say about 10-15g per level just by doing quests and dungeons and selling loot to vendors.
---
Ah yes, I'm actually not too far off from the Skeleton Key already. Good point, thanks!
---
Might just skip most quests in Winterspring for now.
---
Everyone needs gold. You can sell one boe and buy another for your spec. Never greed a boe.
---
"I've seen matches hotter then you!"
---
Very false
---
Hunter. Not a ton of hunters, not a ton of competition. Claim everything in the game is hunter loot.
---
I'm not a tank but I have a macro written for every single skill on my bars. I use static bars so nothing ever moves. Shrunk the bars to 50% size and I barely notice them. Pretty much every macro has start attack and the respective stance written into it. I like it, hope it helps. I recommend skarm tanks macros or the ones you find on wow head and icy veins
---
Incendius? Way too many healers here.
---
i've done this on a few mmos- guilds or servers i'm on are EST, i'm PST. stuff usually starts just after i get home from work on weekends, and we never stay up past 9 my time! it's really nice. i get to go to sleep early!
---
Funnily enough after getting my 12 sticky tar, after much frustration and near-deaths, that's exactly where I went. Although I don't think it was 45%, but just +45 increased damage, which is annoying but not quite so bad
---
I would love to have it not spam local defense.
---
This really isn't that complicated.
---
The need vs greed system works great for BoP items. That's because the monetary value of a BoP item is so much lower.
---
I mentioned in another comment that if you really need an item, you will go and buy it. And that makes a great example for BoP items. they're worth about a couple gold, right? If Ironfoe drops, and you can't use it, it's worth about 5 gold to you. 
---
People that roll on it truly need it. If they could go to the AH and buy one for 5 gold, literally every single mace user, even priests probably would just because it's kinda cool. 
---
But that's not the case for BoE items, because the reality is that most people dont need them. If you really did, you can go buy it. They just want them because it's free. And nevermind the other people who can't use them but could use the gold for it. You just feel entitled to free gold because you happen to have gotten lucky with the drop.
---
Well there are server transfers occasionally.
---
Its only a really an issue if you insist on playing on a high pop server.
---
Yes!
---
The realm cap was increased across all realms, it's a single number. The number of layers however varied across realms. That means the layer capacity is different on different realms. (Layer capacity = server cap/# of layers).
---
You're making an unsubstantiated claim ("layers have some arbitrary cap similar to old school vanilla realm caps" no citation).
---
There's no layer cap or else you wouldn't be able to join groups from full layers (no evidence of that  ever happening).
---
Now we know which realms have 2 layers and which have one, but the 1 layer realms don't have half the capacity or the "medium, low, full" designations would not make sense the way blizzard explained them. 
---
Not sure if you don't understand any of this or if you're just being difficult but that's as simply as I can explain it. That's like three reasons why we can know layers are not set to some arbitrary static cap imposed by blizzard (spelling it out so you don't mistake "not a cap" with "no conceivable size limit")
---
About 60% of the people who are likely gonna raid on Classic aren't even 60 yet.
---
this has just reminded me that horde are regularly people, not the vicious ganking FUCKERS that i hate on a day-to-day basis.
---
just goes to show how easy it is to hate someone you can't communicate with
---
I'm more generalizing a shared KOS list via addons or whatever. I was added to a "blacklist" for "ganking" a level 48 hunters beelining to the thorium node I was clearing in a silithid hive/cave thing. How does a shared blacklist/KOS list determine why a person is added to it? It's pointless if it's cross faction. If you're just keeping track of your own personal targets then that's just a personal grudge and is completely normal.
---
Yeah, it’s not really an issue because I’m enjoying the game a lot. I’m not having a bad time because I’m leveling slowly, I was just wondering how others leveled so fast.
---
Even 2% is worth it, locks main output of damage comes from shadow bolts in raiding. Not sure how many locks you roll with but theres one curse per lock and three, sometimes four of the curses that are strictly different debuffs and not damage.
---
IT'S BOE MORON. Why do you think that is? It's intended to be sold or traded, if a boe item is worth 50g on the AH then it's worth 50g to everybody regardless if they can use it or not. A greedy and self serving mentality is you thinking you deserve that 50g more than anybody else in your group, everybody helped, but no, you deserve the 50g and everyone else can go fuck themselves because you're a prick. I don't care if you equip it in my face and use it until the end of time. It's base value is 50g, we're rolling on 50g.
---
If you and 4 friends bought a lottery ticket and won 10,000 you can't say "actually guys, I'm going to keep this for myself because I have 10,000 in debt and you lot don't." You all contributed so you all have equil claim.
---
Why did u transfer out of blaumeux, server is populated but no ques, factions also seem well balanced
---
Oh thanks, can you elaborate a bit?

Fury Warriors and rogues share like 60% prebis

YOU'RE SUBPAR, GIMMICK OF A CHARACTER IN HOTS!
---
Maybe, but comparing Classic to a duct-tape-and-glue replica of the 1.12 servers is asinine.
---
Knowing servers pops is really bad for server health
---
Cool, but I’m level 26

He chose warlock for the virtually free mount.

&gt; ***DON'T USE THE ABOVE IMAGE, IT'S NOT UPDATED!**\*
---
Then why did you post it?
---
A thing to note is alot of eng goodies require eng to use, so best to use on a main. Rogue and hunter can vanish/feign   and attempt to res after a wipe with eng. Eng is amazing pvp profession. Alch is a great alt profession.
---
I believe he's part of the Scourge Invasion, which is not for a long time.

Battle shout generates more threat than demo shout

39 warrior here. I insist on sword and board even if people ask me to cleave and use the ravager proc.
---
You can probably recover it
---
Warrior get out of jail free card: My 1h weapon skill is too low.
---
&gt;Newsflash: you are wrong, your ideas are wrong, and you shouldn't laugh at others.
---
&gt;But telling others they are wrong and have to do it your way is where the disagreement comes from.
---
Goes on screed telling me I'm wrong, says me telling others they are wrong when I never did is his disagreement. Then tells me I play wrong and that I was insisting others do.
---
Horde dominates most servers. They have it easy. Do you want the easy way out?
---
But people won't keep spaced out will they? I mean the main cities and Blackrock area surely are overflowing with players

I've not seen it in here but the Wolfs from LBRS are stupidly strong.
---
They come with rank 8 bite, rank 4 howl, and rank 3 dash. 1.5 attack speed. Good health/armor/damage since it's a wolf.
---
Howl is also a nice bonus to any melee you have in your group, which in raids will be your ENTIRE group.
---
If you're still having fun in that guild and enjoy playing with them, then stay.
---
If there's no one to talk to, no one to quest with or dungeon with, I'd say it's better to find a new guild.
---
Wildvine on my server is like 1g each, so those 3 stacks are at least 60g.
---
&gt;You are trying to "logic" away the entire spirit of an RNG gear based game.
---
Because it is logical, and the people who designed this game were mostly logical. Also what is the spirit of the game? Whatever you want it to be? A boe that gives you a gold windfall is still RNG, and nothing about the RNG has been tainted.
---
&gt;Why dont bosses only drop gold ?
---
They drop BoP loot, not BoE items (At least in 5 mans). Irrelevant.
---
&gt;Why isnt all gear bought with gold at a vendor?
---
To allow a player driven economy where players sell BoE items and have interesting interactions.
---
&gt;I like seeing other people get theirs too. It might even be a fun part  of this Massive Multi player game we play. It is the reason why People  who can actually equip a drop get priority over the auction house.
---
Why can't you be happy when players buy loot that they have been working towards? Saving up 500g to buy a edgemasters is just as satisfying as getting a random Ironfoe drop.
---
&gt;There is so much RNG involved, it is one of the best things about wow  when it happens. You think that experience shouldnt exist, to be  replaced with greedy strangers and a trip to the AH?
---
Why is taking gear less greedy than equipping it? You have never explained this point, this isn't an argument it is name calling. Why is a 500g windfall less fun than a 500g item? If a rogue finds a Krol Blade and sells it for Devilsaur is he being greedy or just doing what makes more sense? It's like being pissed off someone traded a gift card for another gift card that they can spend at a store they like more.
---
&gt;I mean really take a second to appreciate how excited someone is when their 500g w/e  BIS epic drops for them.
---
It didn't drop for them, they just assume it is for them because they are greedy and considering their needs over the groups. Economists have a name for this phenomenon, it is called the Edowment Effect: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp) You irrationally value things you already own more than they are worth, except you never owned the item in this case. This is why you value people getting the loot and equipping it over selling it.
---
&gt;I cant imagine running with people who would be eager to shit on my day  by taking such a fun and lucky occasion and turning it into gold for  themselves.
---
Why aren't you shitting on my day? You are claiming the item for yourself when it has already been made clear the item is just as useful for everyone.
---
&gt;I benefited more from not fucking others over.
---
Maybe you are fucking us over by equipping something that could be more beneficial to others than to you?
---
&gt;The whole servers plate is actually less geared because all plate is insta /need for fat gold lmao.
---
THE AUCTION HOUSE DOESN'T SELL TO NPCS! SOMEONE BOUGHT THAT ITEM AND IS USING IT!
---
&gt;I mean Im siting here imagining what it would be like if this was considered  common loot ettiquette.
---
It was the standard in Vanilla. I would know, I was there.
---
I had 9 gold at level 30, 26 gold at level 35, 45 gold at level 40, and I were able to buy my mount at level 42 without help.
---
They really need to increase respawn rates for mobs, herbs, mining stuff etc...there is just nothing to be found right now. I can't level because for every mob there are 2 players fighting over it. And whenever I see a node on my minimap it is already taken by someone.
---
Good job!... ally scum.
---
Depending on your server they may not be joking..
---
Yes they do, lol. You are taking this game WAY too seriously if you are saying a MOSTLY PuG group doesn't get any loot. That's beyond non-sense and shouldn't be allowed. Blacklist these people, warn everyone about their behavior. It's a game man, Giving only "raiders" loot is BS. They can't even fill out a 10 man raid, wtf are they smokin?
---
Hunters set is beastmaster. Almost all .5 teir armor is garbage and too pricey. The only thing I ever saw that was impressive from them was rogues boots, which gave a deeper stealth. Super rare effect.
---
Not entirely sure the point of getting T0 as a hunter anyways. The set is such garbage, its awful compared to the other classes. You can make the 4 piece kind of work if you manage to work in hit % though.
