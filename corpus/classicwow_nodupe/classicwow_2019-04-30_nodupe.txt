I'm familiar with Skarm. His channel is a great starting point for burgeoning tanks but I disagree with him regarding Feral tanks and how they should be played.
---

---
I'm not claiming that I am the best Feral tank in the world, but Skarm's specialty is Warrior and that's where he's the most knowledgeable.

Super chill dude (I have references that can verify this) looking for a guild to have fun with during Classic WoW. I was like 8 when I played during vanilla so I don't have THAT much raid experience but I've raided and done PvP in every expansion since.
---
- NA PvP or PvE
---
- I could do any class but I'd prefer warlock or priest
---
- Could be Horde or Alliance, whatever works
---
- I'm in central time zone and I can raid Monday, Tuesday, some Wednesdays, and Friday's 7:30 to Midnight.
---
- My priority is finding a good group of friends that are looking to do raid content on a regular basis. Basically if you're reading this and have a small guild hit me up.
---
What takes more skill in vanilla? For endgame pvp *arguably*, leveling is tougher in vanilla and its bit close. PvE retail takes the cake and runs with it
---
The only "cannon jump" I've ever heard of is using it on Van'Cleef to evade bug the adds and make the fight much easier.
---
I raided as a resto druid back then but I actually remember all the warlocks putting up Curse of Dooms at a specific point of the fight, so that they all popped at the same time to push the final phases of the fights... sort of like an execute.

You pretty much got it, you have a tank group (really just a melee group with imp and pally/shaman), melee groups (1hunter/1+ warrior/rogues/*shaman*) and caster groups (important casters + *shaman*), generally warlocks for tranquil air on horde or just whoever needs mana the most.  
---
  
---
Innervate can be cast on any friendly so you don't to worry about that.
---
That's impressive considering the intro told you concisely what the numbers mean.
---
You're probably right, that version of wow was never on a pserver.
---
Firstly... I don't think you'll be power leveling anything without help... Especially not a paladin.
---
Second, you'll take whatever fire resist gear you can get, but it won't be incredibly necessary depending on your guild. 
---
I don't know of any good holy paladin guides, but max rank FoL is okay for the most part. You'll be down ranking HL (I believe rank 5).
---
All consumes. Mana pots, flasks, cooked food etc
---
I do the same thing. 
---
Most classes in retail dont need a ton of buttons, so I only use 1-5, shift 1-5 and then 1-9 on my naga. Plus a few other random keybinds like scrollwheel side to side for stealth and mount and stuff.
---
My UI is setup as a 2×5 bar and a 3x3 bar next to it. 
---
For whatever reason it seriously improved my ability to press the right buttons.
---
pserver trash
---
yeah i'm not saying i don't believe you, i just wanna know why it happens cos i like that kind of thing
---
aimed shot and mutlishot scale in the same fashion as MS/cleave/HS/SS, and white hits scale the same for hunter/warr/rogue as far as i know.  warriors are a bit different because they can rage dump with slam or bloodthirst if they're fury, but rogues seem like they should be comparable to hunters in terms of scaling
---
I’ve always killed VC then jumped down to Cookie. Never though of going around first.
---
Then you evidently can't read very well because the intro literally says explicitly what each end of the slider means.
---
I think you're last point is a big reason. A lot of people like to ride the hype wave of new games, so what if Classic proves to be massively popular? This means for them that they are on the outside looking in now.
---
From a business standpoint Blizzard is going to do what makes them the most money. That may end up proving to be devoting more resources to Classic in the long run over retail.
---
Rogue is just absolute trash in retail. It's only had everything good about it taken away and casters have been buffed in every way imaginable.
---
Hunters were pretty popular back in the day. Simply the easiest class to level in a difficult leveling environment. Not sure if classic wow will attract that audience though.
---
Flying in classic would less insulting than this survey.
---
The game is almost 15 years old. And people have loved it for that long. These are the people that made classic possible. Dont be sad. We owe them imo
---
Homie, I created my account on February 20th 2005. Why do you gotta act like you're better than someone.
---
That was easy. Didn't have to click anything but submit :)
---
&gt; Classic fails to entertain Blizz will be smart enough to add new content or release TBC!
---
Eh, the community barely wants changes to classic and doesn't trust Blizzard, dropping TBC I can see but adding content is exactly what this sub constantly battles on
---
I'm pretty confident we will have a few healthy servers in the major regions, honestly if we get 5 full servers per region that would be a success for me
---
Post naxx content would be pretty cool. I understand the desire for TBC, but it seems weird that a company would really a re-release their entire franchise again. 
---
Once BC is over people will be begging for wotlk etc..
---
Being able to purchase lvl 60 characters in classic is less offensive than this survey.
---
The intel is so poorly written. It's quite ambiguous.
---
"Over my dead body" what? To keep it as it was or to change it?
---
"This is a must" what? To keep as it was originally or to upgrade to the retail version?
---
It's interesting, but I'd recommend spending the time to write proper questions in each input.
---
Jump and turn to face enemies when running away so you get to dodge/parry hits. So it looks like this: auto run forward, spam jump, whenever you are midair, turn towards your enemy but turn back before you hit the ground.
---
Save energy/mana for cc/silences. Conversely, take advantage of mistakes from someone just unloading everything into you. So as a rogue, you want to save energy for a kick vs casters with good cc spells. You don't want to use everything on damage. And as a caster, if you notice a rogue never saving energy, wait until he runs out of energy is left with auto attacks before using your spells.
---
When you're out in the world, position your camera angle to the most likely place an enemy player would come from. For example, always keep a look out on the main roads, or flight path/quest nodes. This increases your success in wpvp tremendously when you can see an enemy player and prepare for an engagement.
---
Another Wpvp tip is to leave mobs close to the main roads alone when you're grinding. This way, enemy players running by won't see a trail of corpses to follow to you. Similarly, when doing caves, if you can stealth, then skip the entrance mobs and go for the ones inside. This way enemy players can't see you're in the cave or if they do, they need to deal with the entrance mobs first which gives you a warning.
---
Autorun and constantly using your camera to scan your surroundings should be a habit.
---
Use hills to shield your approach, even if you approach from behind. The way camera angles work makes it really difficult to spot enemy players approaching you when there's even a small hill in between you two. Use hills to get the drop on your enemies, especially as ranged classes who can cast/fire through hills.
---
Set up defenses when you need to remain stationary. So this means things like flare/trap at your feet when you're recovering as a hunter. Setting up totems as a shaman when reading quests. Shielding when you are a mage/priest when waiting for an elevator in thousand needles. Etc.
---
It's gonna destroy that sub, we're gonna have everyone who believes in working for something and the long haul instead of getting rewards for doing fuck all. I can't stand the amount of bullshit that /r/wow cries over, the game is so goddamn easy now that it's become boring. Gear you get means fuck all, you become desensitized to epics because they're practically forcefed to you. Can you remember any names of the epics you got from BFA? I can't and that was this passed year, but classic? I could tell you every single piece I was wearing 14 years ago. I hope the retail game just becomes so unplayable that only the whales are left like RS3 and OSRS.
---
it was nerfed later in tbc, since the guy who got world first L70 did this trick.

Thing that legion had that WoD, bfa, and pandaria had, was the lore. It played alot into the story. These other expac just seem to have "a" story, but it seems to be not quite relevant. Almost forced or something like that. Plus illidan is a MF g

Thanks for the info.

8/8 T2 has 200 spell damage, and additional judgment damage. 5/5 T2.5 + 3/8 judgment has 201. So unless the non-tier armor is that good, AQ is not noticeably better in that area. Lots of AGI, some STR, and crit are the big improvements. Soulforge has 94 spell damage just to put it out there.
---
In Oblivion I made a custom spell that was 100% chameleon. Chameleon is the spell that only grants you partial invisibility but does not break when using abilities. With 100% chameleon I can run around doing whatever I want, casting whatever spells I want, sneak attacking whoever I want, with no consequences. As long as I keep chameleon up enemies don’t even know I’m there. I also have 100% sneak and don’t even have to attack things unless it’s necessary for the progression of a quest. Tbh it’s game breaking and takes most of the challenge of the game away, but as a super squishy mage I’ll take what I can get.

&lt;Deus Vult&gt; Horde / PvE Server
---
&lt;Deus Vult&gt; is a core of hardcore WoW players who have been clearing end-game content since WoW came out, and continued to do so across every expansion in the game.  Currently, all classes are welcome to apply.
---
We will raid from 11pm to 3am EST (8pm yo 12am PST)
---
We are adults now, so we are putting together a serious, yet casual, raiding guild to make Kel’Thuzad our bitch.  We are going to have “Less Raids, Better Raids”.  All members are expected to log in early and bring their prebis and consumables so we can dominate our server for the entire expansion.  We will be using a fair and transparent turn-based loot system called Suicide Kings, to keep loot quick and fair so we can get back to what matters, killing bosses and having fun.
---
We plan to be a top guild on our server, while investing less time than our competition.
---
We are recruiting all classes in anticipation of Classic.
---
We are raiding from 8pm to 12am PST (11pm to 3 am EST) on Friday and Saturday nights.
---
Send me a DM here and we’ll have a chat and get you a Discord invite.
---
There were rumors of them giving prot warriors this ability for a long time.
---
Now that's OP lol
---
That was wow until like 1.10.  How tf would you not know that as you started playing on "February 20th 2005".  Were you stuck at level ten for a year and a month?
---
Yeah, being banned is a major fear... is the site in question nexus mod?
---
Airwave - when things go wrong (Original mix)
---
Skindred - nobody
---
Dimmu Borgir - Puritania
---
lol
---
Tanking as warrior is my absolute favorite thing to do, but at 60 raiding can a casual player tank? I hear tanks in vanilla have to spend much more hours playing to be able to raid.
---
I think it has to do with how much damage hunters gain from AP. I'm sure there's a write-up for it somewhere but I can't find it, lol.
---
Warlords of Draenor had the burning Crusade Zone nostalgia, whereas Legion had burning Crusade Legion and Illidan and stuff nostalgia
---
Yeah paladins only become god tier pre-wotlk patch.
---
I'm not sure either, I've hardly played the game except Cataclysm and on private servers, most of them being before Nost where the we had extremely glitchy and just plain fucked up servers. 
---
I really love the warlock in vanilla, mainly because of all the rpg elements and odd ideas that have been thrown at them. So many curses, spells, demons, extra demons, mount quests etc. They are also a very rare class, especially on alliance. They have lots of small annoyance which I like, but most probably hate with a passion, I'm just weird that way hehe. I have a tender heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.. warlocks have plenty of all three.
---
The only real problem I have with the vanilla warlock is that they just can't catch up to the mages in high-end content because ignite is bugged and doesn't drop the charges, so it just keeps growing. I feel like if that was fixed then they would be somewhat equal, but if it is fixed then the mages would cry pure crystal water and because 50% of the server rolled mage just to see ignite tick for 10k, Blizzard will have to make it stack infinitely as it did during vanilla.
---
The Snickerfang Jowl or w.e gray is stackable and vendors for like 5-8g per stack, they also drop Traveler Backpacks. I found Skullflame shield from a dog before.
---
what did you do to farm gold
---
Pretty much all popular alt rock from July 04 till end of 08.
---
“Raising their wife’s son” haha uhoh I hope this just means stepson but I have an inkling you meant something else.
---
Legion was in-between WoD and BfA which put it above average instantly. But from the raids I did, the lore, the mythic +'s, all the different zones you could go to, the damn mage tower which I loved when I came back to try it out, etc etc.. I actually did enjoy the expansion.

If you're afraid of being banned, I 100% understand not wanting to use it. But Classic is already going to be less "moderated" than retail and I can tell you from experience after using mods for roughly 3 years, I've never had issues. 
---
But I understand the fear of getting even a 24 hour ban against your account.
---
Same mate. Me and my buddies Are all coming back. Only difference from then and now is that we all work full time, some are soon-to-be parents and stuff. But we will have a freaking great time with leveling and random stuff. Gonna be great to be able to game with my best buddies again!
---
Umm... ronald reagan was a hollywood actor before being president?
---
Because they have people who are actually playing lmao
---
noob, you must get a better wand
---
AOE grinding is overrated until 40. If you have the mobs at 40 aoe grinding is insane. Always have a wand at lower levels.
---
This was in every classic WoW video. I used to listen to this song constantly while playing!
---
Only the highest end guilds will bring a single druid to be the 3rd or 4th offtank. (Or guilds full of wrath/cata babies who dont know better). Using a feral tank is like bringing a enhance/ret or shadow, you can justify 1 of 40 for the unique buff/debuff they bring, but more of any of them and you begin to gimp your raid not help it with diverse builds. My ideal roster would keep a feral druid on it, but Im not certain how much playtime youd see in naxx progression--which if youre intending to raid classic, seems like the whole point. 
---
Guilds that are less hardcore wont have the members who are willing to put in the time to be a worthwhile Bear tank. As others have said, you are a worse warrior, in nearly every way when it comes to tanking. To equal a given warrior you have to outplay him. If your skill is equal across both classes, you will always perform better as a tank on a warrior. 
---
But, highend guilds will often keep a single feral druid. Since you are leather, you become an easier tank to gear out. Getting 3 sets of prot gear and 1 set of bear gear is quicker than 4 sets of prot gear. On fights where they dont need you tanking, you're a valued support dps. 
---
Resto druids are needed in raiding, typically 1-3 are desired. You've got very little competition on gear (other druids and shaman/paladin on non set items).
---
To top it off, druids are powerful in pvp, once you know how to play it becomes exceedingly hard to kill you. Which means the enemy expends a load of resources (read as players) to go kill you...allowing your team to freecast, or they ignore you and focus your team...allowing you to freecast. You also are the best flag carriers, and imo--good AB flag defenders. 
---
Balance is dead. Shit damage, shit mana efficiency, no gear, would take too many items from mages and locks.
---
Buncha dudes that were already pretty good made MB right around when CT was splintering so they absorbed some of the bigger personalities.

---
I'm assuming you mean [this](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18236)
---
Looks like only mages can do that though, they hit way too hard for a Paladin to be able to farm them.
---
Im like 99.99% sure that what ever is a higher increase takes place, so no they do not affect forms. BUT its great for when you get out of form, so they are great
---
Good, I should be able to own those items.
---
I don't want to, but I should be able to if I so choose.
---
Hi, I’m the video creator and my channel is not monetized. Have a nice day
---
I read your comment perfectly fine. You said people get geared really easily then go to Mythics for upgrades. So yes that curve is braindead easy then super hard, but as I tried to say, that's a route some people take, but it's not the breadth of difficulty BFA offers which was my point.
---
And that aside you aren't even entirely correct. If you're going to slowly gain gear from outside raids you're already getting Mythic Quality gear from your weekly cache if you're doing a +10 (and if you can't do a +10 you aren't going to do Mythic raids) so Mythic raids aren't offering anything more meaningful than your weekly Cashe (Which is a much easier way of getting Mythic Quality gear anyways)
---
Not bad.  Toyed around with it for a few.  
---
Couple of suggestions:
---
\- When searching for an item, instead of having to type the entire name out, can it grab the first (or closest) match?  That way instead of typing out "!item Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood," you could just type "Ashkandi" and it would return the same value.
---
\- I'd love to see an avatar for the bot.  Looks a tad plain at the moment (understandably.)
---
Excited to see where you take this.  Thanks!
---
It’s just that I wouldn’t want to bang one
---
Surely you understand what a joke is, right?
---
This is why my alt is going to be a Mage.
---
Would making an alt mage just to sit in town and sell portals be good for gold making? Not interested in really playing mage end game but wouldn’t mind just sitting around town making portals
---
Transmogs and barber shops...? Anyone who wants this needs to not play Classic
---
Hi, this is my video. I was simply trying to make the argument that speed running is a way of making old content stay interesting, and looking to show people who don’t play private servers that speed running is a big deal in that scene.
---
Not sure where you got the “bringing in viewers” thing tbh. I mentioned it one time while talking about Method world first races because in 2019 the amount of viewership a certain type of content/topic generates is a pretty solid indicator of how many people find that topic interesting.
---
what is this weapon you are speaking of?
---
When will the results be released?
---
Kalgosh, you can legacyplayers me on EL HAITCH. I raided MC ZG BWL AQ. So yeah I know what I am talking about.
---
Getting 40 players and farming gear is not difficulty, it s a grind. You're the fanboy here.
---
Considering we’re running MC on a personal private server this Wednesday with new recruits? High.
---
Well? How can we see the results?
---
On average, across the last 4 pserver characters ive taken to 60, I get killed 1.5 times a level or so.
---
Sometimes I got 3 levels without a death. I get my pvp kills of opportunity, get outta dodge before the respawn and win the counter gank if it comes.
---
Sometimes I die 6-9 times a level--everytime I go into Marshal's Refuge.
---
Sometimes I ignore the alliance and just grind and no one bothers me at all.
---
If you want trouble, stir the nest. They will come looking for you. Typically players 10 levels above you have little reason to kill you--if they do, they just enjoy doing it.
---
Tailoring also helps immensely for insurance against bad/no greens, especially at lower levels where every stat point makes a difference.
---
I've read that when it comes to surveys only the top end and bottom end matter, as if they were true/false questions. Everything in between is discarded as it's considered uncertain. Not sure how true it is but I've always taken surveys in that matter. I used to do MTurk for a while back in 2010 for beer money lol.
---
It is just straight up the way the scale, I think. 53 agility per crit and 2 ap per agility is worse than 29 agility per crit and 1 ap per agility like rogues have (why agility for hunters was changed in tbc).
---
I do think other classes just scale better, though. They changed hunters to scale with agility like rogues in tbc for a reason. If you are a raid buffed rogue with 500 agility, that is 17.2% more crit and 500 more ap (35.7 dps). The same on a hunter is 9.4% crit and 71.4 dps. I'll take nearly 8 crit over 35.7 dps any day.
---
Doing mostly transmog runs, with a bit of battle pets and high price toys, but it will take a bit for most of them to sell
---
I mained a mage through the latter half of vanilla and can’t believe I never thought to do that. I sure as hell used those teleports for myself, though.
---
This my team vs that team mentality is so shortsighted and stupid. I hope that there are more good MMOs of all flavors out so that there is actually competition, innovation and shared ideas. There is no one "right' answer. There should be the old style and the new style if the player base supports it.
---
Guild banks are a 10. Sharding at launch is a 5. Class balancing is a 7 because I want it but I dont know if I want the side effects. 0 everything else.
---
But there is no randomization of stats in neither raid or dungeon loot. Or were you referring to WF/TF?
---
Can I tank as casual? Hear in vanilla tanks had to play much more
---
Unless you're top 10 on the server I wouldn't bother. All levelling zones are going to be massively populated for a solid 6 months after release.
---
I'm 31 and this feels like something I'll probably post 12 years from now. Keep doin your thing man
---
Aye, people know what theyre doing now. The no lifers wont take 8 days to 60 like they did on retail. This time itll be sub 4 days. 
---
And they know where their prebis is. After that, its: farm raid mats, raid, log out, gank. And if classic wow is near as addictive as it was in 2004-06, well they wont be logging out.
---
Because Classic will always have more glory than modern.  Nobody cares who killed the latest hard mode boss.  But I guarantee when C'thun goes down for the first time in Classic, it will hit the front page of /r/all.
---
oh man ghetto heaths… wonder if those will make an appearance in Classic.
---
Now show Patchwerk vs Mythic Jaina. Lul
---
Is it though? Some people are content living life on their terms. If it means having to sacrifice a family you'd probably be better off not having in the first place, so be it.
---
Warforge/Titanforge.
---
I like achievements  kind of wish we could have some for classic. Rated that one 10.
---
I think it depends on you and your expectations. You can certainly raid casually but I wouldn’t expect to be a MT. But if your pre bis geared or better pugs that need OT etc would probably take you. So it’s more up to you. For me personally I’m not a casual but I also have the same hesitation as you as far as raiding mainly because I don’t know the raids like a MT should. But I know my personality and class preference and it would be a waste for me to main any other class.
---
I'm tempted to role a mage solely for this reason.
---
&gt; I mean even with modern frame rates and such ret paladins are still going to be bottom of the dps meters, warriors/rogues/mages are still on the top. These are the kind of things people pretend will change in Classic.
---
Really? I haven't seen anyone except fringe kooks saying that and they always get made fun of. I would love it if it did somehow turn out that they were viable using Blizzard mechanics but I think it is staggeringly unlikely.
---
&gt; I don't think the average player who has never played this game before will have much trouble in MC. Its meant to be an intro raid, it always was pretty easy.
---
I'm very interested in how Ragnaros will play out with genuine Blizzard mechanics instead of "Blizz-like" pirate server mechanics, and whether or not you can brute force it without fire resist gear on the bulk of the raid. I have a suspicion that a lot of pirate server guilds are going to get a harsh lesson in retail Ragnaros but time will tell.
---
Playing on these private servers over the last year and good god these people can be cutthroat as fuck
---
One of my last good memories of non-raid content in retail was leveling a non heirloom'd character in cata on deathwing.
---
So much pvp, so many "well geared" people who didnt know how to play. 
---
Everytime id get to a new instance, id turn off xp, farm it for the dungeon blues then go do wpvp for a few nights, level to the next and repeat.
---
Bouncy boobs
---
You get it.
---
All of vanilla was a quest to out-gear the alliance so i could smash their faces into the ground better.
---
With engineering it's not too hard ;p
---
Thanks for the kind words. There’s a reason I don’t post my content on Reddit, this sub seems to react negatively to anything that isn’t a meme.
---
My channel is not even monetized but I just get downvoted when I point that out, so it seems like a lost cause unfortunately.
---
Facts right here. Leveled a mage on a pserver and aoe grinding is miserable until you can start doing pulls in instances
---
those are called shills. blizzard has plenty.
---
Since there aren't many female dwarfs, people haven't seen their casting animations. Those who did know how glorious these are.
---
Suit yourself, more dwarf pussy for me!
---
Thanks for the explanation! Is this only in current WoW or in vanilla too? Also what does "greed" do?
---
They have the best healing animations IMO
---
Big yikes my dude
---
This is amazing
---
Are you retarded?
---
Completely agree then.
---
Thanks but PvE server won't make a difference. It's just got to a point where playing WoW feels like a chore
---
Sorta sad how short the great BC was.
---
Got wife that wants to play alongside me and kids to fish for me, life is grand.
---
I have a full-time job servicing portals for the lazy and discount beverages. 60 mount, here I come!
---
&gt; So yes that curve is braindead easy then super hard
---
so we agree   
---
&gt; but it's not an actual curve anyone takes since you can also get mythic gear really easily   
---
how exactly is that supposed to work?
---
Will be huge for a month or two then drop off significantly, i'm sure.
---
itemization was way less linear, for all thats good and bad. I assume this is common knowledge by now.
---
I don't want xmog, but barbershops make sense with RP and doesn't effect anything at all
---
Yeah...wait now what exactly happened there? I heard they had some foundational issues at the chruch--even had a contractor go down and take a look, then all of a sudden the entire town just went up in flames.
---
No one's ever really gone.
---
&gt;benediction
---
We called it "Mines" in vanilla. Every server I played on.
---
DM is Dire Maul: LFM DM East
---
Type in DM Wow into a google search shows a zillion results for, you guessed it, Dire Maul. some dating back years and years.
---
I can only assume PServer newbies who never played Vanilla call DM Deadmines.
---
I agree with you.
---
4/9 LFR btw. Also I killed the first boss in NM so I know what I'm talking about.
---
It will be a long post with my reasoning behind each item. My work schedule is crazy. Be patient I will deliver my list for you two who eagerly await it.....

Leveling characters in Retail is not fun.
---
The zones are all changed around, the quests are condensed, they changed a lot just for the sake of change without considering if it was a *good* change. There is no challenge, there is no feeling of reward. The dungeons are shallow husks of their former selves, and the majority that queue up for them are just looking to finish them in 10 minutes flat with minimal interaction with the other players. I have seen players kicked from WC for not having heirlooms.
---
Even if you put restrictions on your own characters there are dozens of other people running around in heirlooms one-shotting everything, speeding past you in their obnoxiously loud chauffeured motorcycle mount, popping every toy they have on cooldown. Higher level players in low level quest hubs with mounts the size of Magmadar standing on top of quest NPCs. Everyone is transmogged to the nines.

That's because in Vanilla EVERYONE on every server I played on called out wings: LFM DM East, for example.
---
DM Wow search on Google brings up pages of Dire Maul results because that's what we knew it as back in the day. We called Deadmines "mines" as did every server I played on and everyone in the WoW community did back then.

I can only guess Pserver players who never actually played Vanilla call Deadmines DM.

That just sold me the Shaman class, gonna make it an exact lookalike troll and yell totems totems totems! and Frost shock! during raids
---
Hunter and Shaman are the two highest pvp skill cap classes in the game that don't get nearly enough credit for being as deep as they are.

---
Female trolls have the goofiest fucking run and they look just awful. Also that HP regen...I wouldn't call it godly.
---
This is for vanilla WoW. I don't know about current WoW, I think it's mostly personal loot anyway so there isn't much rolling involved.
---
Need always beats greed, so if 3 players click greed and the other two click need, only these two players will roll against each other and one of them will win the item. And those who click "pass" exclude themselves from getting the item. If everyone passes, the item will not be distributed and can be looted freely by everyone who had the right to roll on it.
---
Usually, if you only want to sell the item, you roll on greed. But if you actually want to use it, you need on it. Although those rules can vary from group to group, e.g. for off spec or hybrid items.
---
Brother, there is nothing wasteful about an Azure Silk Hood.
---
true, but without cross realm dungeon finder I would have never run any of the old dungeons. not nearly enough people leveling per server to run any specific dungeon throughout all of the expansions without something to help them find each other. not very rpg obviously but running the barrens by yourself isnt exactly the old experience either.
---
&gt; That's a terrible excuse for disliking this!
---
I didnt know you need an excuse to dislike something
---
This. Exactly this. I too have a mentally taxing job (Sysadmin for a hosting company), so I'm anxiously awaiting classic's slow and steady pace.
---
I third this
---
Bags alone kept my characters going for a long time before I got heavily into Blacksmithing then I was pretty self sufficient from there. Then throw in Jewelcrafting when that came out and that supported all my characters.
---
Why?  I don't understand.  The poll just asks what class you'll play so why would you double the %? Of the people that responded to the poll 1,637 voted Shaman, 7.63% of votes.  You're just going to make that 3,274 votes because its a faction specific class?  It's just saying 7.63% of people are going to play Shaman like 13.19% are going to play Warrior.  You can only double the percentage if you're asking what percentage of &lt;faction&gt; is playing that class.  Right?  I'm so confused.
---
Mostly 0's, but guild banks got a 2, and launch sharding got a 4 cause I'd like to see a better alternative, but its an acceptable compromise to make the game playable.
---
It's nice. It's REEEAL nice.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; He was just trying to get people to realize that rose-tinted glasses are real. Seriously, play like any game from your childhood and you instantly realize you remember it looking 100x better and being 100x more fun than it is.
---
I was worried about this too, but as soon as I started a new character on a private server, I realized that the rose tinted nostalgia glasses stuff was BS. Classic WoW was and still is AWESOME.
---
&gt; Well stated, and I resubbed a few days ago to farm up gold to get those free months of sub (didn't buy BFA cause fuuuuuuuuck that, I want to save money).
---
I've heard about paying for your sub with in-game gold, but is it ever really a good idea? Even at minimum wage you could pay for a month of WoW by flipping burgers for 1-2 hours (depending on where you live).
---
How long does it take to farm enough gold for a 1-month sub?
---
Curious, I don't have kids yet but they're in my future soon, what are the times you typically play when you can? Mornings? Afternoons? Late night?
---
I would assume most have sold there account
---
Do you like passing judgement?  
---
Do you want to uphold all that is good and true in the world?  
---
What about being known as a "Warrior of the Holy Light"?  
---
If this sounds like something you may like, then I introduce you to the Paladin.  
---
Let me advise, leveling is going to be slow. But who cares when you're a Divine Hero who sheaths themselves in plate armor. Life is pretty damn good.  
---
You are a true hybrid class, you will specialise in PVP and PVE mostly as a healer &amp; buffer.  
---
If you think assisting your allies is "Annoying" or a "Pain in the butt" then please stay away from a Paladin.  
---
Your sole purpose in life is to assist the weak, bring justice where necessary &amp; vanquish all that is evil.  
---
You will most definitely be a viable 5 man tanking class, given you have to manage your threat and have NO "oh shit taunt" button. You will have to vividly understand your rotation.  
---
But most of all you're an amazing healer. Like gosh darn... Paladin's are just freaking SWELL when it comes to healing.  
---
Did I mention you're GREAT at healing?  
---
One of the most efficient healers to even present themselves into the game of WoW, I mean sure priests are "better" but they wear dresses.  
---
You wear amazingly heavy holy infused plated gear that wields you the power to withstand immense damage as well as assist your allies with amazing buffs &amp; health.  
---
If your sole purpose is "For the Alliance" and you want to assist your allies in destroying all that is evil. Go a paladin.  
---
Not to mention you can be a Human or Dwarf.  
---
As a Paladin you will be forever in need and loved by all.  
---
Oh yeah, you can bubble hearth.
---
Fukkin made me lul out loud
---
And tank group
---
Maybe whooooshed him.

Love this video one of my all time favorites.

For me that song would be The Killers - Somebody told me. I first heard it in this PvP video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_T8EJLZ9lY&amp;t=523s
---
haha, i do this alot
---
I want guild banks because I’m that person who makes images out of the items much to the guild leaders annoyance.
---
Um. Clinton won the popular vote by 3 mil? And surveys are to see what's popular among the people.
---
Retail wow has the bg right now
---
r/InclusiveOr
---
LFR and phasing were added in cata
---
Eh, I work part-time and have alot of time to kill, would prefer farming old dungeons than being out and taking a 2nd job. And as for income, before I could get about 100k a month back in the middle of legion (I remember hitting like 500k on my bank toon, then shcool and girlfriend responsibilities kind of hurt that)
---
For how much
---
'Bout tree fiddy.
---
Uh, no. Deadmines was ALWAYS VC in my server.
---
I saved up PTO to be able to take a full week off for launch.  That is pretty on par with being a responsible adult.
---
If anything it strayed further from Classic then even WoD had. World quests, Mythic+, fun ability boosting weapons and some well designed raids made for a good x-pack.
---
Keep in mind Legion had the longest development cycle of any expansion.
---
I had In Keeping Secrets by Coheed on repeat in the Barrens and every time I hear it I think of the Barrens now.
---
The only friend I know of that still plays told me that he's staying on retail because it's more family friendly in regards to time investment.
---
Thanks!
---
Ok I get Transmogs, but barber shops? I know barber shops were not in Classic and I'm fine with that - but I wouldn't mind them being in, why the 100% hate against the barber shops? They literally just let you change your hair and skin color lol.
---
Between work, lifting heavy-ass weights, cooking, and feeding the machine, and othe rmindless ahit like lawn and laundry and remembering to wash my ass...

Rosewine ring and Fordrings seal are both very good rings with 1.12 itemization
---
 
---
&lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What’s it mean?**:
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
**Our Philosophy**:
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.**So what about loot and stuff?**:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart**:
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**:
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times**:
---
TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)
---
**Guild Priorities**:
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).
---
**Contact us:**
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT](https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT)Website: [http://gofguild.azurewebsites.net/](http://gofguild.azurewebsites.net/)
---
Drop us a line under and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
Honestly I don’t think they’ll offer transfers or name changes. Mainly because they’re trying to limit the added cost of running those servers. That’s also partly why they’re limiting the number of starting servers.
---
The expansions are a new IP in the sense they are new stories and extend the WoW lore (yes, I know. Not /technically/ a new IP). Classic is a re-release of existing lore/world. So while you're maybe technically correct, you're missing the point.
---
I’d argue they look better than most races in most sets.  Female dwarf rogue in shadow craft looks awesome in particular.
---
Similar feeling to when my first child was born -
---
Dinging 60 for the first time
---
Downing pre-nerf Cthun
---
First time mounting the epic mount
---
So I have a bizarre schedule.  I only know what I am going to be working 2 weeks in advance, and they are a random amount of shifts on random days of the week and weekend.  So I could potentially work (or be off) any day of the week, and the vast majority of my shifts start at 1pm or later and go into the wee hours of the morning.
---
So all of my play time comes in the evening and night, and depending on if I start late the next day, or if I have someone to watch the kids for a few hours after I get up in the morning so I can sleep a little longer before work, I will typically get to stay up a bit later to de-stress from the day.
---
But on average I can count on 2 or 3 hours a night still, which suits me just fine.
---
yep, its not only the reagent cost but also the money you could be making not being in a city/hub providing the service
---
I would hope atleast 10k
---
...expansions are not new intellectual properties. They are still World of Warcraft. You're making up BS definitions here.
---
You're planning on being sick at launch? I hope for your sake that your boss doesn't play WoW lol
---
In hindsight I should have realized that.
---
Some of the stuff on here most certainly has no place ever being in classic. Transmog, are you kidding me? That’s almost as retarded as thinking LFR would ever be in it. Just no.
---
The pirate area in Tanaris is extremely good for AOE pull farming. I used to gather about 12-14 mobs and ice block to gather them all. Frost nova blink, blizzard, etc.... it worked extremely well.
---
Yeah I agree with you man. Seems like they could pump in out sometime in June, and I like the E3 idea. 
---
Go June!
---
&gt;they will not allow them to simplify fighting strategies to "smash one button" orgies
---
wait, they're taking out all the raiding content up til AQ?
---
I find farming gold is never worth my time vs. just buying a token... it's unfortunate, maybe I suck at farming...
---
I miss the old days when WoD was considered the worst expansion, and the other good old days when Cata was the worst expansion...they should really stop making worst expansions.
---
I haven't played in 10 years so a lot of this could be obvious by now.
---
&gt;useful macros
---
I remember having a macro for Ice block and Remove Curse.  The ice block macro uses ice block on first press and cancels on second press.  My remove curse macro was a mouse over macro, mouse over target (instead of actually targeting) + remove curse.  I'm sure there was an easier addon for this but i never bothered.
---
&gt;specific instances of spell de ranking
---
Rank 1 frost bolt and rank 1 blizzard were my most used.  Rank 1 frost bolt is a quick cast, useful for catching people on mounts, flag runners in wsg, and toying with bad warriors.  Rank 1 blizzard used for catching stealthed enemies like rogues or druids.  If a rogue uses vanish, quickly put down a rank 1 blizzard.
---
I believe you can also make multiple ranks of mana gems, so good to have highest two or three ranks created at any given time.
---
&gt;tricks
---
When falling from great heights, blink before you hit the ground and you wont take fall damage.
---
If an enemy is about to use line of sight to interrupt your cast, you can channel arcane missles and the full channel will complete if you started it back when they were in line of sight.
---
Fire/Frost ward, amp/damp magic, and detect magic are all good buffs  to protect your important buffs from being dispelled/purged too quickly.
---
Landing cone of colds while running away is key to kiting, jump-&gt;turn and cast mid air-&gt; turn back around and continue running away before landing.  (also make sure to work cone of cold into shatter combos since there is no ice lance in vanilla)
---
If a ranged gets the drop on you, you can blink behind them right as they are about to finish a cast to interrupt that cast.
---
Mana shield is good if you're up against anything that attacks quickly and pushes back your cast bar, like hunter pets.
---
This is all ive got for now, one of the reasons I liked mage so much was because of all the nuances like these you can learn to elevate your game
---
and if you're horde you have the teleport. and then you're in front of Gnomeregan after 15min with nothing to. have you thought through raiding as a feral druid tank and farming multiple pummelers (not really stackable) every week, maybe twice or even three times, and doing that for 11 months straight? on top of getting Dire Maul, Darkmoon Faire, Songflower!, ZG &amp; Dragonhead **every** week to be a good tank?
---
I can't imagine how you would choose such a playstyle and call it "casual"
---
damn son nice switcharoo
---
Female dwarfs are so nasty
---
**&lt;Stoked&gt;** will be a hard core **PVE** focused **HORDE** raiding guild on **PVE oceanic servers.**
---
**Main goals:**
---
	To have fun enjoying wow classic.
---
	To push our class and raids to the limit.
---
	To clear all content efficiently.
---
	To clear Molten Core in week 2 or 3
---
**Raids Schedule:**
---
Progression raiding: up to 4 nights per week.
---
When content on farm: one to two nights per week.
---
Raid Nights: SUN/MON/TUES/THURS
---
Raid Times: GMT +10 (Times to be decided)
---
20 man raids will be on off nights or a night when no 40 man raids are scheduled. 
---
	
---
**Example:**
---
Onyxia Sunday night, Molten core Monday night, Onyxia Thursday night
---
AQ40 Progression Sunday and Monday night, Molten Core and Blackwing lair Tuesday night, Chill 20man raids Thursday night.
---
**Member Expectations:**
---
Members are expected to be willing to learn their class and role. To be willing to change 	when needed and and become a better player. You do not have to have hard core raiding 	experience or Vanilla wow experience. These things are of course welcomed but not 	essential. Members need to behave in a mature, professional, team focused manner. I want to 	foster a fun-loving gaming environment where every member is important and not just a 	name on a roster.
---
**Loot System:**
---
TBA (possibly loot council/DKP hybrid. Will be decided closer to launch)

Getting full greens for the first time in Classic feels better than getting full BiS in retail.
---
The movement speed bonus enchant on boots (8%) stacks with Travel Form (40%) and the 4-piece PvP set bonus (15%) on both TBC and Vanilla private servers for a total of 163% movement speed. You can test this by using Travel Form and chasing someone with a normal mount. The Druid moves slightly faster than the person on the mount.
---
Not sure about Ghost Wolf. AFAIK the movement speed bonuses are case-by-case. There's not a one-size-fits-all rule as to what stacks with what. Someone would need to test each one individually.
---
What are they gonna do, confirm he is a human? Buy a suit for that, fuck that.
---
I’ll play it regardless of sharding. As will many people.
---
Oh boy, another sharding thread. Just what we need.
---
Your meme is backwards, or not funny. Pick one.
---
Literally every other Blizzard game has had a beta, why wouldn't this one? Especially for something that requires lots and lots of fine-tuning.
---
They're not just taking old files and re-hosting them, they're taking modern WoW and heavily changing it to be like 1.12 again. There's bound to be bugs and glitches and inaccuracies that need to be smoothed out.
---
Why is it "naive" to assume that a game will have a beta, when every other game from this developer has had a beta?
---
It entirely depends on what you want to do. Yes, you can tank 5mans no matter how casual. you can also be tank in MC and ZG without giving too much effort (except the FR gear for Ragnaros). however, it also depends on your raid group. if you have crazy competitive DPS players, you'll be expected to keep up your threat (TPS), which is done best if you maximise your DPS with Fury Defiance specc, enchants on all gear, offensive options for most gearslots (like Lionheart Helm), and all the consumables available - for example Mongoose + Elixir of Fortitude + Elixir of Superior Defense + Juju Power + Juju Might + Gordok Green Grog + Smoked Desert Dumplings + Mighty Rage Potion (on every Bosspull at least).
---
so you can tank in MC as casual, or as hardcore. however, once you enter BWL and AQ20, there's the limits to casual gameplay. you can run around in full T2 and Broodlord still oneshots you if you don't have the worldbuffs and consumables and proba ly Titans Flask.
---
It’s sad when you’re a sad sack chained down by a kid with another adult who hates their life too. 
---
Most people aren’t happy at all. 
---
Being free to do what you want when you want is priceless. Bonus if you’re your own boss!
---
What's loot trading? Do they mean trading away soulbound loot for 2 hrs or just straight up putting gear in the trade window?
---
Its a religious thingie that kids go through at 14 so they get a lot of money and gifts.
---
It has been addressed so we just have to stop complaining and accept the fact that there will be some sharding at launch.
---
I think the reason it's not well received is because people are mistaking your emphasis on speed running as if it is the only thing classic WoW offers. You are targeting a very specific demographic here, one I'm also not included in and frankly don't care about. I miss the epicness of being with 39 others and reliving those moments downing bosses from way back in the day. Obviously it's gonna be 10 times easier, but that's not the nostalgia most of us go for. 
---
Of course, you are 100% right. Speed runs are indeed the only thing that will make PvE content interesting on classic. The current skill cap of the average player is so much higher than in vanilla. Imagine mythic ghuun being released in 2005. Holy shit.
---
Lol here I was reading the thread the exact opposite, I don't think I had ever done VC without Cookie first.
---
Me!
---
Mine will be just a little too young this summer. So close to ascension, yet so far.
---
From such triumph too lmao
---
From a corporation's perspective, you are right.  Anything not a 10/10 means someone is getting reprimanded.  But as just some dude's for fun survey, it doesn't matter.
---
We won't know if blizzard will pull a 180 and fuck us over with sharding. We just have to wait and see. Keep your fingers crossed
---
BfA is above WoD for you? I didn't even make it to 120
---
Very interesting video Ohgee.
---
I definitely do think that speedrunning will be the de facto way for guild to be competitive against each other, just like in private servers.
---
Is it gonna bring massive viewersip like the world first races do for retail wow? I personally don't think so, main reason why is because world first races are monumental occasions that don't happen very often.
---
Speedrunning is just essentially runs that you can potentially do every single week.
---
Very few DPS wars have Ironfoe on pservers and as the guy above you said: there is a lot of data to compare to- they might be wrong but they aren't that wrong.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
I'd rather have a more chill environment and take an extra week to clear something than to listen to "THATS A FUCKING 50 DKP MINUS".

I did this yesterday, starter account and everything. It didn't take long, and made me want to play Classic even more.
---
“No, it’s the kids that are wrong.”
---
I'd be down with achievements being linked to my retail characters. For example, if I do all the quests on my classic character, it'd be cool to get that achievement for my retail account.  Or if I miraculously get an awesome mount drop in classic, I'd like to be able to have the mount on my retail account. I'd imagine that something like achievements might be released later in the classic life span if ever. I know that I'm down with #nochanges, but a lot of friends of mine would love to have some of the classic achievements we didn't get before deathwing on our main accounts.
---
Shaman during AQ, Warlock during Naxx.
---
Shaman don't really gain any power from AQ to Naxx because their Naxx gear is all focused on healing, not damage, but Warlocks keep improving.
---
That's nice

Occasionally there's some... unique drama. Last week or so there was a banwave that hit a *lot* of confused players... apparently there was a lot of (100% against the eula, but who reads) model edit software being used. Some of it was touching up gear, some of it was making characters quite... busty. It was a change of pace in r/wow to say the least
---
I won’t make that mistake again lol.
---
man what a punk move.
---
It depends. Some fights will have certain requirements and you may need to move people around for what works best for those fights.
---
There are some general purpose compositions you can do. But it's gonna mostly depend on what you've got to work with, and then going from there.
---
They've already stated this will be a temporary measure in the initial starting areas only. It won't be permanent or in zones probably past level 20. While it is pretty lame, it's not the end of the world. Classic will be fine with or without its implementation
---
&gt; I think rushing to 60 and trying to clear MC worlds first or asap misses the point of the game
---
Oh good another person trying to tell me what I should or shouldn't like about the game. I got news for ya pal, there isn't one specific "point" of WoW, there's a wide variety of things for lots of different people to do and no one way of playing is "The" best or "the" point of wow.
---
I've played Vanilla, I enjoyed the leveling and the questing. I've done it, I know what it's like, I don't like it. I want to get to 60 and I want to to do end game content. That's the best of part of wow *for me*.
---
That’s why I couldn’t get a mount until 50 something.
---
This could be redone for a warrior looking at trade chat or Lowell if that’s a thing.
---
&gt; Learn to predict your opponents moves as much as possible while being unpredictable yourself.
---
This is was always my winning formula in PvP.  Get inside their decision making loop, cause them to freeze up/make a mistake by doing something unexpected either offensively or defensibly, and then keep them off balance so they can't recover.
---
While leveling on a private server I used FD on a hunter 8 levels above my hunter just at the right moment to cause him to freeze up for 5 or 6 seconds while my pet beat on him, popped a huge health pot, and finally pet stunned him when he started getting back into his loop and finish me off.  This was an encounter that started with him SS me from shadowmeld, trapping me while I was mounted and lining up for an aimshot and ended with me around 400hp and him lying dead at my feet.
---
There are lots and lots of examples in the game of percentage increases being both multiplicative and additive so you cannot conclude anything from the tooltip alone.
---
     Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%. 
---
I am not sure what the base chance to resist stuns are, but lets say its 5%.
---
Either the racial adds 25% to that for a total of 30%,
---
or it increases the base chance by 25% for a total of 6.25%. You cannot tell from the tooltip alone.
---
I tried to play one of my 20s on a trail account after not having played one for ages.  When I logged in and it tried to get me to pick my spec...  It was so bad.  They feel so neutered.  They've lost so much.  I just couldn't do it and logged out.

You'll get to experience World PvP in an environment where people choose to engage in PvP based on the fun of it rather than doing it for a reward, and the world will be full of people looking to PvP for the fun of it since there is no instanced battlegrounds until later.
---
That's something you've never had the pleasure of experiencing before.
---
You forgot bringing priest for shackle undead shit makes strat dead and scholomance with a mage easy mode.

I am going to play a mage for the first time ever as a long time melee dps and tank from vanilla through BFA. Time to shake things up.
---
We found the boar killer.
---
Your point is valid. I'm not THAT afraid if they can't really detect it, it would make for a more enjoyable experience anyway.
---
So, what's that modding site that you mentioned? I'm curious.
---
Like a couple of people who responded pointed out, the real week 2 guilds aren't just going to recruit and hoping people show up, they're actively building a community and play together now. THey're playing on private servers, they're running their own personal servers, they're already running weekly raids to vet their recruits ahead of time. They're planning leveling routes, they're running leveling routes together.
---
The serious guilds aren't just actively recruiting, they're actively building a guild. If you've been raiding every tuesday/wednesday with 45+ other people for the past 2 months when classic drops you're going to get a pretty god damn high number of those people switching to classic, leveling just like they've practiced and continue with those raids they've been doing week in and week out.
---

I think I miss the economics most of all. I bet people smarter than me have been doing this for a long time, but does anyone have a good tool for wow market data collection? # of units for sale, prices, and dates seems like it would be simple to automate.
---
If I wanted to make a tool like that myself, where would I even start? Is Lua still a big part?
---
Sharding has only been confirmed for launch but no details were given regarding post-launch, not good!
---
I've been thinking about this as well. I'm looking at going resto druid or holy pally in Classic. I leveled a resto shaman to 60 on pserver and did ZG/MC, but it became painfully obvious that I would be happier with a class that can tank 5 mans for easier grouping without "LF1M need tank then g2g." for 30 minutes. I don't really want to relevel again alliance side to find a guild. That would just burn me out before classic got here.
---
I plan to take vacation, but 2nd week MC just seems mind boggling. I probably could hit 60 within two weeks, but a balanced 40 man raid? I just don't see it unless it's a guild like Method.
---
I'm a paladin so I dont have to worry about it.
---
1- RoF and hellfire are both fire damage and get the same damage increases from deep destro.
---
2- Hellfire does more damage than RoF at any rank but the downside is obviously taking damage yourself.
---
3- very few locks go deep enough into destro unless for pvp ( most just stop at ruin ).
---
No, you just don't seem to get it.
---
I did that all the time last time I played on a Private Server.... But I was playing Warlock. :P
---
Launch sharding = A necessary evil
---
Post launch sharding = No, absolutely not
---
Barber shop = Honestly I don’t see a downside 
---
Mount Journal = Again, not really any drawbacks there imo
---

---
Spell damage is a poor leveling stat fwiw.
---
I gave it 8, I’d like achievements minus instance achievements so there’s no “link achievement for inv” crap

Except the [T 2.5 set](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q8oGm808oGo87coGk87qoGR808oGV87V) ..I think it might be the most hideous set ever made. The rest are amazing though
---
Nope, you just don't understand.
---
On the surface I thought that too but then I feel like there would be a large number of people treating Classic like a side thing to farm things for their “real” toons.
---
Your attempt to be insulting is amusing, so ill make it simple since googling "Meeting Stones" seem to be difficult.
---
[**Patch 1.3.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0) **(07-Mar-2005):** Meeting Stones added. 
---
Vanilla had Meeting stones using the same model and textures as the Summoning stones in TBC. They were markers that players could use to meet up. 
---
Private servers have Meeting stones using the same model and Texture as the summoning stones from TBC. They are places to meet up.
---
Neither stone can be used to summon people, and nobody ever used the built in group finder to form group, because its terrible. I honestly dont know if private servers have this function built in because I would never be dumb enough to spend 20min running to the dungeon by myself to check. I will form a group in the city like everyone has always done. So it really doesnt matter.
---
The stones themselves were part of almost the entire lifespan of Vanilla.

---
If it's weeks of fighting for my mobs and waiting in queue for hours more people won't play then if sharing is implemented. Guaranteed. Myself included.
---
99% of the content is a faceroll snoozefest. That last 1% is difficult and requires lots of coordination and effort. It's a rather steep incline... Not to mention that content is hardly accessible. It's not easy to transition from doing LFR to Mythic raiding. It's a niche community that is pretty insular. Not to mention progressing from MC &gt; Naxx is a lot more gratifying than progressing from LFR &gt; Mythic. Do I really want to play through the content 3-4 times? Not really...
---
Here's what happens next because original eq does it. Different servers going to tbc, wotlk, and the other expansions with boosted exp called progression servers. I'll love if I'm right.
---
&gt; Mythic raiding or high level pvp does take skill
---
But everything outside of that is piss easy.
---
World quests are braindead. Normal/heroic/m+0 dungeons are AoE facerolls. Normal raids are AoE facerolls. Heroic raids require you to actually know the mechanics but are easily puggable. Mythic raids and high level M+ are literally the only "hard" things left in the game, everything else is ridiculously easy with little/no threat of failure.
---
&gt; itemization was way less linear, for all thats good and bad. 
---
Which is one of the reasons why no reward ever feels like progress in BfA.  It's not the only reason, just one piece that contributes to the hollow feeling we all get once we've ticked the boxes and the next wave invalidates the last.
---
It's like pulling on a tapeworm.  You think you've got it all, but you don't.
---
&gt; I assume this is common knowledge by now.
---
Okay?
---
When I first started playing on pservers a few years back, I used to get mad when mages asked for 1g tip for port , I'd argue that I would pay the reagent but they'd still refuse.
---
These days I just trade 1g before I even ask.
---
Sometimes I wonder if this meta developed due to pserver greed , I'd love to believe that it won't be the same when classic hits and prices will be watered down but heck, it doesn't matter much anyway, best thing to do is to be friends with a mage to avoid all the extra costs.

Some others have come along the way as general MMO background songs.

“This could be the end of the World.... of Warcraft”
---
I think the problem is that there ARE people who will try to force you to speedrun; you can see it currently in pretty much every random group in the retail LFD. They want to get in, get XP, get loot, and get out in ten minutes or less, and they’re not shy about kicking or abusing people who violate that conception.
---
Classic WoW is a different beast entirely, and speedruns are (hopefully) the exception rather than the rule. I think this community is having kneejerk responses to anything perceived to be catering to the ADHD speedrun asshole meta and/or encouraging its adoption and proliferation in Classic.
---
I’m not saying it’s right or wrong, but it’s that kind of mentality that drove many of us right out of WoW entirely. WoW Classic is drawing some of us back with the promise of harder content, slower runs, and a sense of exploration. If it gets trampled under by the gogogogo World First me-first level sprinters, it’s going to drive us right back out again.
---
It's VC. Putting DM is just obnoxious.
---
Lol, not what twinking is about buddy. I was into the guild vs guild stuff
---
No. I'll still make ambush crit montages with linkin park, rammstein and dragonforce songs, horrible idea OP
---
Helped with it on both retail and private servers multiple times.  It's really shitty because for over half a dozen quests you gotta drag your whole raid there.  Its very easy to get the quest done once when everyone is excited about it and there isn't much to do, but repeating it is a tragedy because no one wants to do that content twice (and most of the content is not shared. i.e you go to do Weival and you have to kill him once for every person on the quest, which blows).  Especially after AQ40 is already out, you'll have a hard time convincing people to take time outside of aq/bwl/mc to come help with a world boss thats a pain in the ass, drops no loot, and is just one step in a long chain to get items that aren't even BIS.
---
It takes a long time, and you need a lot of help. Multiple world fights that require 40 people, the final fight we did with 80+ by teaming up with another guild.
---
I'll obviously help my guild do it yet again in classic, but I will not be happy about it.
---
I would be more inclined to believe you’re genuine after your last post. 
---
I went back to my team dev to discuss drop rates and the core mechanics. I’ll see about posting something later.
---
I’d recommend herb tailoring. Mats are going to be expensive for a while before the economy forms and balances out. You can use the money you make from herb to pay for tailoring imo.
---
I changed my mind... not smooth jazz. 60s rock. Bad Moo(n) Rising would be a beautiful background song for my Tauren PvP video.
---
During our progression attempts on Rag and a few weeks after, we grabbed the +83 Fire Resist buff from UBRS before the fight. Without the FR buff, was pretty tough. I expect that will be enough for Rag, but we'll see.
---
Those Truefaith Vestments are the shit!

Seeeeee ya!
---
Isn't it equally likely that private server knowledge will interfere with that though? Like the warlock pet summon thing that people were so sure about.
---
Hell with that. I can't cut because of work. I would die.
---
Pretty sure they gave that answer as well. They said they know classic is about the community and when competing for things there should only be one and not multiples. They're well aware.
---
No.
---
will this feel like it did when it first launched??
---
no. we need drowning pool and slipknot and disturbed for full tier nostalgia. go hard in the paint or dont go home.
---
50silver?  Pfft stay off my server man I’m not wasting my time unless it’s at least a gold.

Hey this guy doesn’t know about sharding /r/classicwow fill him in.

Honestly this is as dumb as the “Lol Classic will fail who would want to play Vanilla wow” crowd.   
---
Different ends of the spectrum, same tin foil stupidity.
---
&gt;Can we all agree that the cannon jump is just a strange way to flex in these P-servers
---
I mean, my groups did that on my first character in vanilla too. We wanted to skip as many mobs as possible back then.
---
a mediocre ret paladin.
---
No changes.
---
*AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT*
---
No? But whenever people act confused as to why there as animosity in the community on this subject I feel the need to convey what happened over the last 10-12 years.
---
Farm fire resist or get epic mount first? This hurts my free time.
---
Undead 100%. Devouring plague and WoTF. Troll priest skill is some useless lightning shield.
---
We need more 10 minutes videos concerning blue posts. It's 2019, many people cant read.
---
But we don't care about private server shenanigans.
---
But them Truefaith Vestments tho
---
I played it for a while. I thought it sucked.
---
&gt; Firstly... I don't think you'll be power leveling anything without help... Especially not a paladin.
---
Paladin's capable of going pretty damn fast with 0 downtime. My recent record is ~112 hours.
---
Rank1 fireballs for dotting a rogue.
---
One underrated small but effective trick is when you have a melee rogue or warrior or whatever on you and you need to blink away, in the same instant as you use your blink, turn 180° from the dorection you are currently running, it will in many instances buy you a second or two before the attacker realise which way you actually went.
---
Otherwiise, keep a couple ranks of mana gems up at all times as you might need to use multiple of them.
---
Not that this is any next level shit at all though.
---
You do you man personally I’m gonna play a lot of classic at launch and if sharding is a thing past launch I’ll probably still play tbh. But I’m a minority on this. But they did address sharding and you really need to go scour the internet yourself before you jump to conclusions. If sharding keeps you out at launch that’s your personal decision honestly i think anything that gets me out of the 1-20 zones in first day instead of being stuck tagging one quest mob every so often will be okay with me. I don’t think that sharding will be I. The zones after lvl 25 and hopefully not in any contested zones.
---
Yikes.
---
Did this excact thing, i love that area!
---
Get a life.
---
Still not a power level
---
Alot of people don't know the implications of those changes, he's not just reading the post, he's stating why its good or bad.
---
I’ll be playing a warlock main and mage and warrior alts. If I only could have 1 character though, I don’t know if it would be mage or warlock (mage pvp looks really appealing.)
---
Anyways, warlock makes a good main for me because:
---
-first of all, I like casters/ranged dps, warlock play style and class fantasy, pvp gameplay, and some of the “fun” spells like doomguard...this is obviously just very subjective on what we enjoy, and these reasons are more why I am playing lock as one of my toons as opposed to why i am selecting it out from the others to be my main
---
-strong 1vX potential is important for me in pvp
---
-good soloing
---
-can have a versatile raid/pvp spec with SM/ruin
---
-ranged in raids will allow me to see the fights, since I’m new to to vanilla raids and want to see them in all their glory
---
-scales well with tier gear for pvp, which will make it a good character to shoot for t3 on, where I will feel like I am getting a great reward for my efforts
---
-I have a name I really like for my lock/persona I will abuse sometimes jokingly 
---
The later points are usually valid for 2/3 of my classes I want to play, but only for warlock are all of them true.
---
Wasn't it a 10-12 hour window?
---
So basically, all of my "adulthood", just returning to a more familiar gaming title?
---
the original comment was meant ironically. you’re defending it as if it were not a joke.
---
Giant soldier of stone, attack the moon!
---
No, mandatory "Let the bodies hit the floor" or don't even make it...
---
Nope. I will specifically make at least one Bodies by Drowning Pool PvP Montage because I gotta.
---
imagine having eardrums this weak
---
No one is going to trample anyone under anything...there will be the hardcore people pushing for speedruns, and there will be people who just want to take the game slowly. To each their own. Retail LFD is built to facilitate this mentality, sure. Classic WoW isn't really designed to facilitate speedrunning, so people have to go out of their way to do so. If you ever peaked your head into any of the current pservers for vanilla, you'll find a mix of everything. Some people are still running preraid  dungeons like ubrs/dm etc, some people are still in MC, and some are doing the higher end stuff for speedrunning.
---
BfA is more like Legion-. 
---
It's Legion with less interesting solo content/cosmetics to fill the void that is a lack of community.
---
Lol I bet people think your music is shiny too.
---
No progressive itemization?
---
Are you talking about yourself? Because I've barely played in pservers but started playing WoW back in early 2005 and raided Naxx too.

Was there any other scarab mounts that looked close in later expansions?
---
Honestly, any Coldplay song from Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head.. I'm literally right there with you on this one. I still think of Vanilla and TBC when I listen to those two albums. Man... You know what? I'm going to make a WoW Classic Spotify Playlist tomorrow, with all the songs I used to listen to during vanilla.

I'd suggest two gathering professions honestly. Spending gold to keep your tailoring up will sadly delay your mount at lvl 40. Having two gathering professions however will let you save up gold so you can eventually level up tailoring when you reach 60. You could also consider saving all cloth you loot while levelling, so you can more easily do the swap.  
---
Just my two cents :)
---
Or you're just too dumb to understand. Memes aren't for everyone i suppose

Yup, just getting fucking pissed off more and more each day that they leave us in the dark, my excitement has diminished with each passing day

I understand that the music must have some "energy" to make the video be exciting, but those songs got old really fast. I really doubt most people still hear the same songs they heard when they were teenagers.

Mining or herbing. Or skinning at launch just for extra cash because I don’t think herbs or metal will be selling for much at launch and you could relevel it after getting 40 or 60 and getting a mount.
---
Hahahahahahahaha. Ok, you got me.
---
Where did you get those flags?
---
Disc/shadow is a thing too. You can heal and keep buffing the warlocks.
---
Frankly I'd say unless you definitely want to go Pally, it's better off skipping it. I'd vote Druid. You have more options when you aren't healing. It's a worse healer, but better at everything else.
---

---
It took a single dev some amount of time to make the breakthrough that proved it was possible to do it *without* an unfeasible level of technical work and resources. Even then, that was a proof of concept and there was work to be done once they committed.

As someone who is going to be playing a mage for the first time I appreciated this new knowledge.
---
Same, as a hunter.

I enjoyed your video. I hadn't thought about speedrunning with respect to Classic, but now you mention it, it sounds obvious! I will enjoy watching guilds speedrun raids.

Tough to find documentation from Vanilla, but this is from TBC and WotLK. If they did NOT stack in Vanilla, but they did in TBC/WotLK, then that would be the kind of change that Blizzard would mention in their official patch notes.
---
well aren't I an asshole!
---
Chill environment is definitely preferred. It doesn't mean that the raiders should come unprepared, not knowing fights and with bad specs.
---
&gt; Casual players more than anybody should consider playing the classes that require the least amount of effort to be competitive that are also in demand for raid comps

And what might those be? (Asking for a friend)

99% of people won't even notice it. 100% of people will not be adversely effected by it.
---
i know right, they just arent ready.
---
Know the mechanics for every class.
---
Why?
---
\#banhighwarlordgear, nobody needs a 3.8 speed weapon to defend their horde.
---
Some people like OP apparently need their food chewed up by multiple people first and then regurgitated into their mouths.
---
I enjoyed legion for a while I think it had better systems than the previous or following expansions. The biggest problem for me in modern wow is the gear treadmill is more intense than it ever was also the severe social disconnect the game has now I don’t feel any value being a good player because I’m disposable now and of the hundreds of players I randomly played with in dungeons I don’t remember many of them. The few I do I met late in a random pug normal raid. They all quit in bfa though because bfa turnednthe gear treadmill to 11
---
Omg the .5% of the player base that cares aren't going to play! Classic is dead!
---
I like to buy vendor water at certain levels. Better then using say level 15 conjured water when I am level 27.
---
CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!!!
---
Do people really think a week of sharding in the starting zones will kill classic, what the fuck hahahaha
---
Sharding does not mean that zones will be empty.
---
Just that if overpopulated then the population of said zone will be split.
---
It will also be entirely unessecary and unwated past the 1-12 zones which I am sure is well understood by Blizzard.
---
It’s because bfa has the infinite artifact gameplay loop and the ever expanding gear treadmill of incremental upgrades of the same equipment.

Is it possible to not need exact spelling and possibly bring up a list of "you might've meant these" 1-5 options and you can pick and then it'll link?
---
Eg.
---
!item sulfuras hand of ragnaros , (wont bring up an item)
---
Did you mean...
---
1 - Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
---
2 - Sulfuron Ingot
---
3 - Sulfuron Hammer
---
Then you reply or something with whatever and it links that.
---
No
---
According to some rumors that are looking to be more and more credible as time goes on, it's all because they have Team A and Team B that work in tandem.
---
Team A creates some of their best expansion (WOTLK, Pandaria, Legion) while Team B creates most of the messy expansions (Cataclysm, WOD, BFA). You would think Team B would at some point learn from their mistakes and adapt from what Team A has done, but since they work in tandem and since development times tend to be extremely long, they're pretty much always playing catchup - hence why Blizzard keeps throwing out all of their good ideas with each expansion.
---
It's all rumors as I doubt Blizzard would ever confirm this, but it does make sense given how consistently they keep screwing up and redeeming themselves.
---
Because it's fun...?
---
haha ecksdee relatable!!!! :))
---
I feel like my wife's going to be less concerned about the $15/month and more concerned about the 15h/day :D
---
True. With demo though you can get soul link which reduces some of the damage taken.  I know when I played lock back in the day I really didn't use hellfire unless I had soul link.  I ended up using RoF a lot more though since I liked going sm/ruin.
---
Blues near the level breaks in battleground tiers ie 19,29,39,49 etc. most white meats, elemental *(earth sure fire water etc). Epics you may not understand such as edgemasters handguards if you find those early just wait a few months and you’ll have an epic mount easy.
---
Should be a temporarily obtainable item imo.  I'm going for Dwarf rep on my Druid in the hopes I can get an unarmored Ram but we'll see.
---
people seem to forget the videos of ragnaros speed kills, all hunter dps, all mage dps, etc., that existed back then
---
From what I've heard most guilds won't let an SP use vampiric embrace as it's seen as unnecessary, unless you are in a 20 man and can spare the defuff slots so I don't see why improved is worth it even though I'd like it for pvp. I love the idea of raiding as a shadow but what scares me away a little is everyone talking about how bad their Mana issues are, but I'm not sure how bad it actually is. I'm mainly looking for a class that can world pvp well while is able to raid well too.
---
Yeah I doubt that.  I was talking about wow before 1.10 when bwl and mc were relevant.  Yet you don't seem to remember any of that.
---
Whole lot of zeros. 1 10 and 1 5.
---
This sounds like a report I would watch 👍
---
I believe they've said no to this.
---
I went 0 on most of them but not all, but the one that I had to think about the most actually was dual-spec.
---
If you were to ask me if I wanted dual-spec I would say no, but if Blizzard announced tomorrow that it was in the game I wouldn't really care that much either.  
---
In a way, I sort of think it would be better for the health of pvp. People are so much better than back in Vanilla and with how hardcore the vanilla pvp system is, I feel like more casual players are less likely to want to farm the money and switch specs back and forth between raids just to get body slammed by hardcore pvpers. If you were to give them the option of having a separate spec at the ready, they might be more likely to casually try to gain ranks here and there when time allows.
---
Maybe I'm doubting the vanilla community too much, but that's just something I was thinking about as I took the survey.
---
That's a pretty good idea! :D
---
speed leveling, speed running raids, speed killing bosses, they were all a thing in vanilla.
---
They've spoken about it. Apparently lower level zones where a lot of people will be are going to shard, but higher level zones won't be from what I've seen.
---
1. I have green latency in a lot of my old screenshots (that threshold goes all the way up to 250 I believe.)
---
2. View distance looks pretty accurate to me too. I maxed mine out even if it made my FPS lower because I didn't care about it back then.
---
3. I started in March 2005 and my friends were insisting I download CosmosUI before I even hit level 20. In the screenshot I took of hitting level 60 I have MonkeyQuest, Damage Meters, ConsumableBar, Discord Unit Frames, TitanPanel... It really wasn't that uncommon.
---
MT heals: Always be casting, even if they are full and you interrupt the cast to save the mana and start again.  That way a heal is somewhere between the full cast time and near instant, rather than waiting the full cast time when n you need a big heal bomb on your shieldbro.
---
They sure are an experience. I’m pretty sure at one point our guild swore to roll opposite wherever they were lol
---
I wanted honour system from day 1 to encourage world PvP while leveling. Kinda sad they went with this plan but phase 2 should be pretty fun.
---
I remember it took me about 15 days played to hit level 60
---
Good thing is that my little brother was a console gamer. Bad thing was that as a kid, i could only play on Fridays and Saturdays.
---
Worst thing is that we only had one computer and my dad was a big pc gamer (playing a lot of  sc1 and d2) and he didnt work on Saturdays because he was a professor.
---
I want to play an SP so bad but I love to raid and feel like the spec has many worries in that area. If I'm looking for a class for solo PVP and raiding I guess rogue would be the next best thing?
---
It’s still going to be patch 1.12 data and models, so I’d imagine no. All models will be updated to their most current versions.
---
Ok. My point is that Nost interpreted it to give Orcs the very large percentage chance to stun resist. Blizzard gives them the much smaller one.
---
Thus my original point that the pservers got something pretty major (racials) wrong.
---
True. Then the Blue set in the 50s to prep for dungeon drops.
---
Not to mention reddit's audience is always growing. So obviously posts 7 years ago aren't going to have nearly as many upvotes as posts in the last year
---
Just have fun. Take your time.
---
It's a whole world to play around in.
---
Thats kind of the point of the poll.
---
August 10-20 is my realistic guess, July 16 is almost 2 months away so if it’s coming out then we’d have a release date announcement within a few weeks from now. I think we’ll get some sort of beta, apparently the devs said we’ll be playing classic before summer at blizzcon (implying a beta)... plans could have changed tho
---
I kinda hope gold farming bots become a thing again for this reason
---
Can I ask which 4?
---
I decided I had to narrow it down to 3, so I’m doing warlock/mage/warrior.
---
When I thought I was doing 4 I was also gonna do hunter. If I end up doing a 4th after my 3 mains, it would probably be priest or rogue.
---
Eh, in that scenario I say let em. The only effect it would have on us would be a greater number of players to group with/gank, I don't really care what their motivations are
---
Gnome is BiS alliance warlock for pve and pvp but you do you
---
The journey is pointless without taking time to smell the roses.  
---
You can only go in fresh once, enjoy it.
---
&gt; but also that said opinions are flat-out objectively wrong without as much as a single shred of validity.
---
lol. I'm not a noer, I play illegal classic. But to say an opinion is objectively wrong makes you literally just as bad as those you criticize. Just sayin
---
Absolutely not, I'd still call someone out for stupid shit that wastes everyone's time if it's recurring, but if a dude has to leave because his wife went into labor or something, oh well, stuff comes up.  Likewise if someone doesn't know a fight, it's the job of them to seek knowledge, and experienced players to help.
---
Thanks I'll follow this advice. Very excited to get into the game.
---
Take your time to understand how everything works
---
vanish immune
---
when people in orgrimmar chill on top of the bank and when people have campfires together. Or when you find someone of the opposite fraction who seems to want to be friends with you.
---
Leveling guides are designed for solo speed running. They skip all dungeons and elite quests, and any quests that are too slow like long chains or escorts. They also don't use much rested xp.
---
Time is money, friend!
---
Thanks. I've been watching/playing a bit of retail. I mostly understand questing, but raiding and stuff like that will obviously take a long time to learn.
---
What do you mean "interfere" ?
---
Blizz can check their 1.12 database to make sure something is "blizzlike" or not.
---
I think you may have misunderstood. I’m not labeling their opinions objectively wrong, I’m saying that I can’t understand why “wall of no” people label the opinions of classic fans objectively wrong.
---
To be fair some say that because they've experienced it themselves. I play on a vanilla server and had some of my friends join in with me but a few did end up leaving. They forgot how many QoL changes weren't in vanilla, and some of it was just nostalgia.
---
So yes, while people like me will love it and continue playing it, you can't deny that there will absolutely be a decent amount of people who play it for a bit and then go "meh I guess my memory of it was better" or something of that.
---
So both sides are right. There's those like me who will love it and stay around for ages, and there's those who won't and will move on from it. And that's perfectly okay, because that's what makes us humans unique, we're all different people with different interests and different ideas
---
Running to dungeons with friends. Always loved the long treks across zones to get to a specific dungeon.
---
A Warlock mate and I made our debut into 2v2 dueling listening to Dethklok. Melting faces to that metal was awesome, still makes me think of wow every time I hear their songs.
---
I initially gave achievements a 0, but after reading this comment chain I think if they left out the type of achievements such as item level goal posts, dungeon/raid completion etc and basically take out the achievements that people use instead of actually taking the time to inspect someone I think I wouldn't be opposed to achievements at all actually.
---
Haha, same!

The ability to move my characters up and down on the character select list even though this isn't a vanilla feature it's going to be amazing in Classic.  
---
Yep.
---
Fair enough but in my opinion it shouldn’t even be up for debate, similar to LFR. This is vanilla.
---
No. Better to waste time on your own goofy shit.
---
...no
---
I wish I could be you and re experience classic for the first time, you are special
---
Toggle show helm/cloak in the menu.
---
The mounts are two separate items.
---
It had few very good things : 
---
\-Class quests were back
---
\-Karazhan mega dungeon. Finally a real big dungeon with an oldschool feeling. It was by far what i enjoyed the most on retail for the last years, sadly it didn't last long the gear quickly became irrelevant
---
\-The secrets were very fun to do
---
But overall it still as the garbage modern WoW with all t's flaws, it's hyed mostly because it was less shitty than WOD and had lot of  content.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to guild banks because I've been the person who got tasked with managing the guild bank account in the past.
---
It's basically an unpaid secretary position during your spare tame. 0/10 experience.
---
That's what I've heard, thanks for the response. I'm definitely excited to get started. Hopefully I'll catch on quickly.
---
Nope, I’m trying to actually enjoy my experience lol
---
Why is silly comment getting upvoted? No shit they have 13x the subscriber count, the game has been out since before reddit existed. People have come and gone.
---
Reagents for minor spells like feather fall. Makes those spells more satisfying to use when you've prepared specifically for casting them.
---
After a couple years, probably.  Lol
---
In WOD the gameplay was still decent at least
---
I had fun rerolling and trying out stuff, and just playing my class in WOD
---
In BFA I just don't enjoy any class
---
Why
---
If you need 3 manual crowd pummelers in a boss fight, or 10 mcp for a raid, etc. does that mean you need shadow oil and enchantments for all of them?
---
Or is a bag full of unenchanted, unoiled crowd pummelers better than an enchanted, oiled ironfoe?
---
Builds an economy as well
---
People bind mouse scroll wheel to frost bolt and then watch a movie in raids LUL

Female dwarf hunter was my first lvl 60, I may have been ugly but people had love for their faction's uglier race/gender combos
---
vanilla&gt;tbc&gt;wotlk&gt;cata&gt;mop&gt;legion&gt;wod&gt;bfa
---
Should make for an interesting challenge once past doing levelling, raiding etc
---
Not gonna lie, I totally didn't lol
---
Healer machine broke
---
So how do you account proportionately for the paladins that can't roll horde?
---
I think there is a cash shop mount that looks similar.
---
Also there is the yellow green orange and red that are common drops in aq40 that can only be used in aq40.
---
Doesn't really sound difficult - on a caster or hunter at least, just slow and boring. As long as you kill things in a way so that you always have a way to run away and only go to areas where you're 2 levels above the mob you really are in no danger of dying on a PvE server. Enemy town guards, or accidentally autorunning off a elevator would be a pretty sad  end.
---
Prob from account selling.
---
Worst case scenario you can still farm the winterspring frostsaber on alliance though.
---
Wotlk barbershop only allowed for hair customization, not skin. And thats fine too

Raiding is a whole different monster in classic. No looking for group tool or raid finder. You mostly rely on a guild for 40 man raids.
---
Of course everything will be cleared by top guilds in a few hours, but that doesn't mean anything 
---
There will still be a lot of challenge for the average player
---
Honestly if you know how questing works don’t look at anything, gonin completely blind
---
The bis list will be different for each phase.
---
Is homie a robot?
---
I added the level 60 data in the post. I also filtered the data with "raid, pug" and other raid related key words. I found no difference in the class distribution. In the PVE server, PVP only is less than 2% of total population. Most of ppl prefer to do both not 50%.
---
Seems fun. I'd definitely try it a while after launch.
---
Fishing in Moonglade at night for nightfin, so peaceful and I was usually the only one there.

Go in blind for sure. You’ve plenty of time to minmax later. Enjoy!

Legion was probably my least played xpac.  It sucked balls in the beginning.  Never revisited until right before BFA.
---
I am using the data from light hope servers, which is the biggest PVP server right now, 7K +. Other servers either have less population or not classic-like, i.e., 5X leveling speed and cash shop.
---
If you’ve been there for pserver launches you’ll know why sharding is a good idea
---
I would image that most people are going into classic blind, most people who play now were like 5 when classic came out. And the game has changed so much that it’s completely different now. 
---
Don’t worry about that, join a casual friendly leveling guild and have fun talking to people on your month long trip to max level
---
IMO August is no longer summer. I work in the school system so early August summer is over for me.
---
I think it's overlooked just how much zones were physically squished in size in Cata. Things being larger and having to go everywhere on foot will add a sense of scale back to the game.
---
The data does not show specs.  We will not know they will use which spec to raid. It is just class picking. Specs are irrelevant here.
---
Yeah unbind a, s and d to help u get out of the habit of keyboard turning or back-pedalling
---
1390 votes 6.4% people would be Paladin. I'm not sure exactly what question you're trying to answer here but there's no doubling or halving requires. 1,390 people want to be a paladin, 1,637 want to be shaman, 1,628 want to be druid.  What does faction have to do with the percentage?  It's just, What class are you?  Not, What percentage of each class are factions made of or whatever.
---
wiping in deadmines during ship and corpse running back to the instance in westfall while everybody rages.
---
After reading these responses, that will be my approach. Thanks for the response.

Great advice, thank you. I'll start a search for a casual-friendly guild. Or maybe I'll even try to create one. Not sure the logistics of that. All in good time, I suppose.
---
"if other people didn't have the exact same experience i did, they never had any experience!"
---
hello darkness my old friend
---
Causal raid also included in the raid meta. The problem is casual raid meta has fewer sample size, so less impact on raid meta. The results will be way off if we just do the analysis based on casual raid. You definitely could find a spot in the pug or casual raid. But I would like to predict the trend based on the whole data. It is impossible predict the special case, because you could not meet the confident level requirement and merge errors. It is statistically unreasonable.
---
A blue Archaeology one
---
the pony tails, did they spin in classic?
---
Might tempt me.
---
Only thing that bothers me is your cadence when speaking.
---
Yes. it's actually more than 200 hours in classic wow. I added the estimate game time in the poster. That is also the reason I did this data mining to help people to make a wise decision.
---
no just a dipshit
---
All I want to know is if you can get the mount without the whole thing. I saw someone comment that said anyone within the window can get it but I think that means everyone who finishes the whole questline?
---
Jelly
---
technically phasing was added in wotlk
---
Just because it takes a long time does not make it fun or difficult. Remember the guy that picked herbs to 120?
---
You couldn't get them in 1.12.  They might have been there for legacy, but you couldn't get them.
---
Referring to the private server polls / subreddit polls. Don’t focus on the Clinton comment so much, your hard on for her is clear.
---
Yeah, I hear you man. I also want to play a warlock, because it is cool. But I do not think I will put it as my first toon. It is all about time. You need more than 300 hours to get ready to raid as I estimate in the post. But If you have time, two heads are better than one!
---
Bears still out-threat warriors by a decent margin without pummelers. Pummelers just allow your DPS to go nuts. They're certainly not required to be a good tank.
---
You can still be a viable DPS without them too, but you probably won't be top 5 without them. That's fine.
---
As for world buffs that's a whole other topic, but bears aren't significantly affected more by their absence than other classes imo.
---
Legend has it he’s still picking herbs 🌿
---
Buying stuff helped make the vanilla warrior leveling experience a little less brutal at times. Feels good to go wreck a group of mobs that gave you so much trouble.
---

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761
---
Because I am using the raid meta as standard. Raids and guilds are like buyer's market
---
I would say herb+other gathering or herb+alchemy. Pots for both of you while leveling, or extra income from selling herbs. Or just pure income if you run with only gathering profs. I think the variation of professions will be nice rather than the overlap. Like previous comment said, use gold and farming mats to level tailoring at 60 if that's the route you want to go. Then you could potentially have 300 alchemy 300 tailoring. But I personally go for class fantasy over all else, in the end. If it just feels right to level tailoring while you level your character you should do it! I leveled blacksmithing with my warrior back in vanilla, just fit so well with the gameplay for me.
---
Only viable tank? 🤔
---
Yes and no.  There will be a similar hype for the fun you’ll have.  The actual game play will feel the same, but it might feel a bit off compared to retail if you’ve been playing in the interim.  
---
You may notice a difference in the way you approach leveling and gearing.  There will be less unknown, so there’s going to be fewer feelings of exploration and discovery.  Hopefully the feeling of nostalgia and love of that version of gameplay will counteract.
---
Overall, if you really enjoyed Vanilla, there should be a similar positive experience with classic.  It won’t be the same for the in game reasons above, as well as out of game reasons (you’ve likely changed a bit since then).  But much of the game will feel like it did before, so enjoy.  I certainly plan to.  :)

old scarlet monastery, old darkshore and old barrens.

&gt;Causal raid also included in the raid meta. The problem is casual raid meta has fewer sample size, so less impact on raid meta.

---
It comes in waves. U get all hyped for a few weeks then realise it’s ages away and then u get frustrated and lose hype. Then after a month or so when some new info comes out it comes back
---
not the massive phasing
---
Got a good few pairs of those epic boots drop from those mobs whilst levelling!
---
It’s only for the starting zones
---
I have 9 planned for healing BIS and DPS BIS for various phases.
---
- PreBIS
---
- Phase 2, what's got replacement priority
---
- Repeat for phase 3
---
- etc
---
how was the phasing massive compared to wotlk? as far as i know it was only really used for some questing zones in both expansions, pretty much all of which you wouldn't set foot in after hitting cap unless you needed to fly over it for a daily or something
---
great answer, thank you!
---
I don't you understood the Itemization post at all from the sounds of it.
---
Some of the retail kids are going to be in for a rude awakening the first time they die in southern barrens
---
This is something I have little knowledge about, I guess people who play private realms can judge that better.
---
As far as I know some items used to be worse at one point or something? 
---
Maybe I would prefer progressive itemization if it has a point, but I don't know how much it will impact the gaming experience.
---
According to the Brady Games World of Warcraft Official Strategy Guide; “VC Van Cleef - Boss of Deadmines instance in Westfall. Sometimes used interchangeably with ‘Deadmines.’ (ie. LFG VC is the same as LFG Deadmines.)”
---
As the book is written based on the Beta, there is no definition for DM in the glossary.
---
I can't wait for Summoning Salt to do a WoW speed run video 10 years from now.
---
It is just a data analysis based on the largest survey we have so far. Just like all the market reports , it will help people to understand the data trend. You definitely should make you own decision.
---
Herbing will make you loads of cash. Especially later when there is more gold in circulation. Hold onto plaugebloom, dreamfoil, mountainsilversage, gromsblood. 
---
The new meta, or at least on pservers is to actually use a lot of consumes due to meters and logs. If people want to compete in hps or dps they will be using pots.
---
But they can join in the raid anytime they want. Guild leader will not judge their play times but their class.
---
Honestly im really looking forward to a static game that i know and love. No pinball of nerf/buffs to classes.
---
Also just really looking forward to farming and leveling fishing
---
Is that going to be in there? Cuz that sounds nice.
---
@ u/Rxoks
---
What a shit thread to post. 
---
Search sharding in r/classicwow and find already hundreds of posts and thousands of comments already addressing every possible iteration of how it may affect the game.
---
Your post “sharding will make the game dead on launch”. Fucking dipshit basic brain. Fuck off already with you pointless mongering. 
---
I hope you hold the position of your post and don’t come play on release, just from this one thread I already don’t want you in this community. Fuck off cunt.
---
Is this osrs?
---
Usually on day 1 there will be people spamming “join &lt;Guardians of AzErOtH&gt; “or some other silly name.  You can join any guild and most likely will be full of cool people leveling just like you. Once you get to max and understand the flow of things you can look to join either a more serious raiding guild or a Role playing guild or stay with the one you are in. 
---
A guild charter cost 10 silver and requires 10 player signatures to create a guild. As some one who was a guild master and raid leader in private servers, it’s a lot less stress to join one.
---
Name your mage Nestle
---
It makes a lot of sense. But self sufficient certainly isn't efficient.
---
All the stuff you said. Is basically exactly how I'd reply to this post.
---
Nice
---
Pally cause I feel like healing and for some reason love spamming flash of light. Plus them being amazing in pvp and pve is a nice benefit. 
---
Will be lvling the pally with a lock friend and a mage or lock on my own when he's not on... Probably. I don't think he'd play if he had to lvl on his own
---
Click this link, you will find the raid meta changed with patch. I used the average number of the raid meta

Can't wait for that.. have the first part but our daughter only just about 3 when it drops.. will have to train her to do simple tasks
---
Yes, I show the data in the updated post. Fewer people got to level 60
---
it's not the best money making possible but it's very decent
---
Join a guild, and don't be afraid to leave them if they have poor attendance/nobody online. Do everything. Quest, explore, pvp, run dungeons, craft/gather, explore again. Ask players for help. It's perfectly normal to completely miss part of the game if you don't talk to people. There are tips the game won't tell you like simply the best way to control your character. I had a friend recently try wow and after a week I watched them play and had a few solid quality of life suggestions. Keybinds and traveling tips etc.
---
A lot if us played for a long time without knowing we could autorun......
---
Don't be afraid to ask for tips.

Guess what, the AQ war effort never started in 1.12, but that's what state the game will be in when Classic's war effort starts. Your argument isn't working.

He talks about it here. It was a while ago but I dont know what else needs to be said. He explained how its gonna go.

##**The Dark Army - Horde - NA EST - PvP**
---
#Intro
---
We are The Dark Army. Our mission is to outnumber, overwhelm, and dominate our opponents in PvP content. Our soul purpose is to be feared by the opposing faction. As a guild master from Wrath of the Lich King I have personally lead a 230+ man raid of guildmates on Eastern Kingdom on my Discipline Priest. Join The Dark Army as we plan our march again!
---
#Goals
---
We will complete PvE content weekly in order to achieve BiS gear. Teams will be created with schedules to practice battleground content with a heavy focus on Warsong Gulch. Events will be held weekly to participate in massive world PvP warfare.
---
#Rules
---
There are no rules in love and war(craft)... Although when doing PvP events, players will be expected to follow orders from higher ranking members to maintain order. Players will be expected to show up on raid night 15 minutes early and maintain 85% attendance. Other than that, just be mature and have fun.
---
#Raid Times
---
As of right now there are no set raid times. When we have more core members, we will all discuss and agree on raid times. Ideally we will have at least 2 nights per week for raiding.
---
#Recruitment
---
* Officers
---
* PvP leaders
---
* Raid leaders
---
* Raiders
---
* Members
---
* Recruits
---
***We need raid leaders and people that love to PvP. Or people that have no experience PvPing but are interested in doing a lot of it when Classic WoW releases. If you have experience leading raids in world PvP/PvE or want to give it a serious shot, let us know. All members will be expected to maintain a certain level of maturity but age is not necessarily a restriction.***
---
#About Me
---
*I am 29 years old and I started playing shortly before the launch of The Burning Crusade. By the time I reached 60 TBC had launched so I missed all of the vanilla raiding content. I played casually up until Wrath of the Lich King where I started to play a little more seriously after finally acheving max level while max level content was still current. I lead a guild on my server which casually peaked at around 50 players online per day. This time around, I'd like to lead a more focused group of people to accomplish end game content.*
---
#GUILD EVENTS
---
1. Marathon March Madness
---
    * One giant army will zerg from one side of EK to the other side, killing everything in sight.
---
    * Kill on sight.
---
2. Eastern Kingdom Takeover
---
    * Teams will be strategically placed around Ally major cities.
---
    * On the raid leader's command, all major cities will be hit at the same time.
---
    * Kill on command.
---
3. All Aboard 
---
    * Teams will camp zeppelin's and boats preventing all continental travel.
---
    * Kill on sight, but DO NOT leave group.
---
4. Lowbie Annihilation Day
---
    * High level players will escort lowbies in large groups to engage in world PvP.
---
*If you want to join and have any idea for guild events please let us know!*
---
#How to join
---
**Feel free to jump in be the Discord server and leave a message in the recruit channel, https://discord.gg/wXqBJAy**
---
The problem with it starting is that you probably won't have the gear to sustain your damage for long fights, because shadow priests are very mana starved. It's better to have a healing priest to spec until shadow weaving then the rest healing. You can spam rank 1 shadow word pain for the weaving debuff. But also since warlocks are the lowest caster dps anyway, it makes almost no sense in increasing their damage since they have poor threat management, you're basically bringing them to wanding faster.
---
Make sure you only sell them a stack of 20 at the beginning of the dungeon, then septuple the price when they run out halfway through the dungeon and need it the most.
---
In true Nestle fashion.
---
In a raid environment I like to toss my 3 or 4 useful totems on the f1-f4 keys. The warriors will remind you if you’re doing it wrong :P.  Super easy to use 4 globals near the start start of a pull and keep them refreshed as needed. 
---
Pvp requires you to throw situational ones on some normal keybinds.
---
LOL no.
---
It is what it is. They are fat ugly chicks. I dont see the issue. It's just a fact. Kinda like how a troll is a troll.
---
Sure they serve a purpose. They make you appreciate that human ass in black mageweave legs a lot more
---
My argument had nothing to do with what started in 1.12.
---
Well, to be fair Clayman did come out in 00. Won't really touch anything after that.
---
Good point! We are also going to provide a way to toggle this graphically as well
---
Oops, I did exactly the opposite...  
---
"How conservative are you?"
---
0 = don't care at all  
---
10 = strongly conservative (#nochanges)
---
the weapons you can get at anytime once you have finished the whole questline, but to get the mount you must have completed the whole thing, AND turn it in within 10 hours of the first ringing of the gong.
---
Yes, you have to complete the quest line withing 10 or 12 hours of the first person, don't remember the exact window.
---
... no changes
---
Average is 11 days played
---
20 days to 60 is very slow, it's not 'average' by any stretch. I think even 12 days would be pretty generous, 8-9 won't be unusual for anyone trying to get to 60 in a hurry.
---
*A human warlock. No an* Human Warlock
---
Grammar please.
---
It's a mage spell that uses a Light Feather (white trash mob item, sell on AH) to slow the mage's fall so they go further and take no fall damage, breaking on taking damage.
---
Fact is, AQ war effort didn't start in 1.12, nor did all of the gated releases, therefore they made a modification to your precious 1.12 model, and they could very easily add the unarmored mounts to vendors as well.
---
Friends.
---
Don't give food/water/portals for free.
---
Do every dungeon if you see a group for it. 5-man content is insanely fun and you get to play as a team, yet have an important role as an individual. The biggest advice I can give is to be open to advice ingame, and be friendly. The last one is the most important though. 
---
You can know every detail about the game, or be brand new like you... but I’d rather play with you than them, if you’re friendly and they’re not.
---
Am I too late?
---
The reason people are doing this challenge in retail is because leveling is such a joke they need to make it interesting.
---
Classic leveling is already an interesting experience so there is no need to do this challenge.
---
#BringBackMontages
---
There's been a ton of talk about female dwarves, I think they'll be much more popular than before.
---
Flying made the world feel much smaller, too. 
---
Personally, I think flying in BC and Northrend was fine - the worlds were build around this mechanic (*huge* spans of land, flying quest hubs, dungeons/instances in the sky, etc.) 
---
Vanilla was not designed this way - introducing flying to Azeroth was a huge mistake. The Cata dungeons/raids that required flying seemed almost arbitrarily added (seriously, why is the entrance to Bastion of Twilight literally just a portal on a spike in the middle of nowhere.) They very easily could have just kept them on the ground, or add portals where it was required (Vortex Pinnacle, Throne of the Four Winds).
---
I still play Ultima 7 every few years. It holds up. System Shock 2 and Deus Ex holds up as well.
---
Great advice, thanks.
---
I think you misunderstood the Joana quote. 30 days of playing, not 30 days played.
---
The AQ war effort is a staged event, not a static item that got changed before 1.12. 
---
It's not my precious 1.12 model, because *MY* precious model would have the earliest version of AV ever made.
---
&gt; they could 
---
No one is disputing that they *could* do it.  They aren't going to.
---
It did not, xp per kill was heavily nerfed if mobs were grey to your out of party "killer", essentially making it useless until you could consistnetly tag lvl 48 mobs.
---
Good info to know, thanks a lot. I'll definitely plan to join a simple guild at first then a more serious one as I develop my knowledge of the game.
---
Minor upgrades aren’t so minor tho in classic. Many good.
---
Did the same thing. I blame it on the creator in being to vague!
---
Thanks I'll be sure to ask for tips and totally immerse myself in the game.
---
I was the first on my server to get the Blue Archaeology one. I wasn't even trying for it. Wanted the stupid Night Elf Trinket but got a mount instead.

Sharding in the starter zones on launch isn’t gonna kill the game. 
---
The crowds are gonna be so bad it’s not like you’ll even notice. And then after that it’ll be fine.
---
Lol, its by far the best stat unless you AoE grind.
---
Broom or Shovel w/ Fiery Enchant!
---
it is higher, it is based off ur bonus AP and it comes to around 200 AP with average gear at 60
---

---
Not having a daily requirement to log in.
---
Dear god, I love BC but **cannot stand** the precedent that it set with dailies. I understand that dailies were originally a very fun and good thing, but they have been used and abused relentlessly over the years to the point that nobody even enjoys them anymore. 
---
If I don't logon for 4 days, I don't have to say "oh, well there goes 4k rep/azerite, guess I can't raid this week because I didn't hit exalted/AP level X like I was supposed to!" 
---
If I don't logon for 4 days in vanilla ... who cares? I can just grind a bit more on the weekend (if I really wanted or needed to) or just catchup on whatever I missed during more popular times (honor/HKs/gold/dungeons).
---

I remember it still back in 2004, being in Stonetalon Mountains. I was running to that goblin hut near the venture Co and 3 night elves rounded the corner. Instant adrenaline rush, thinking "oh shit here we go this is it" while they just ran past jumping, doing night elf flips lol
---
I probably raised that average by a whole day by myself with how garbage and inefficient I was 15 years ago.
---
You might aswell start with an inhuman Warlock then. They are better imo
---
Argh, the screaming, the shouting and "the boys".. 
---
I am to old for the streaming culture because to me this segment was only annoying. Now I understand how my parents felt when I was showing them "streamers" of my time.
---
Here is his quote in context, it's quite clear really.
---
&gt; I used the /played command to see my times. I was always the first person to get to the end level (60 at the time) and I generally had no help from other players, as I did these entire runs solo.  The time it takes for the average player to level from 1 to 60 was around 30 days of playing time. My fastest time was 4 days 20 hours and 49 minutes with a troll hunter, as shown below
---
For tonight ya, but we can play tomorrow if you want?  I’m free at 7pm PST
---
Downing pre-nerf C'thun eh?
---
Dungeon leveling is extremely slow. Even if you had a full group instantly standing at the entrance it's going to be slower than questing. They are fun, and the items are good but they're not worth grinding to get that 1 item you're going to out level in 10 levels anyways.
---
Grabbing all the quests and doing the dungeon once (with a competent group) is the most efficient.
---
Just something to keep in mind. Dungeons are incredibly fun, and I way prefer doing them to questing but there's draw backs.
---
hahaha, I'm so glad to hear I'm not the only one. I'm also putting together a playlist once I pick up my old CD binder from my parents' house. I have a bunch of burned CDs that I used to listen to all the damn time while playing WoW, so I'm really looking forward to giving those a listen.
---
There are a few landmines though...I know on one of those CDs I have a Kazzer song (remember Pedal to the Metal?) and I bet that's not the only one...
---
They absolutely did.
---
Depends on your playstyle. If you are trying to rush through to lvl 60, then you can do it 7 played. If you are taking it somewhat slowly, and enjoying every moment of it then 11 -15 days played. 
---
All depends on your playstyle and what you are trying to accomplish. 
---
Hence you are asking this question, I am guessing that you are either new to the classic or you havent played it for a long while. In either case I suggest you take your time and you enjoy every bit of it! Eventually you will reach 60 and start grinding BiS gear. Few more  days while leveling wont make any difference at all when it comes to gear, but it will make a great impact in how you are perceiving the game.
---
Spend some of your vacation. They are not gonna yolo release the game 2 months and a half from now with no warning.
---
It takes me 4 days 9 hours /played with no rested xp
---
Skinning tailoring, some patterns take leather.
---
Most importantly, how many months untill i get my thunderfury?
---
Could you explain what you're talking about, only know the Cannon-jump to bug out VC adds
---
deadmines is VC
---
It's called "Slow Fall"
---
I do feel that’s a high average.  I believe I had around 10-11 days /played as a 12 year old noob.  I leveled a paladin btw.  Nonetheless I’m a numbers guy and that is still an interesting write up!
---
I just want my thunderfury
---
I put a 5 for the itemization thing, but that's just because I'm a dirty casual who doesn't want to look up when items get updated and don't mind the decreased difficulty as the main reason I'm into classic is the community.
---
100%
---
one thing that makes retail "more difficult" is literally just being unable to play casually. with vanilla you could log in once or twice a week, maybe complete a pug for something, raid if you can manage it, but with classic you NEED to log in every day and do SOMETHING mundane and boring in order to atleast keep up with the pack in terms of gear, so that when you WANT to run something you arent literally the bottom of the barrel. epscially if you are in a casual raiding group with people that can play every day, the disparity gets big quick, and its fucking bullshit quite frankly.
---
It's only unpaid if you're honest.
---
I'm joking of course.
---
Can someone unironically tell me if there are points in the leveling process where this is worth it as a warrior?
---
I’ve seen someone mention that buying the vendor weapon in the starter zone or in the first town is worth
---
Warlock, because reasons I guess.
---
What I HAVEN’T decided, is if I am going to stick with Horde like I always have or if I’m going to switch it up and go Alliance. Though if I do that I’m stuck being a Human because I don’t think I could handle being a Gnome. If I stick with Horde I’m going Orc.
---
**Patch 1.4** : Level 60 mounts purchased at vendors now have a **whole new look**. Faster undead mounts already have a different look and so have not changed. The new mounts can be seen standing near the mount vendors. If you have one of the old fast mounts, you can exchange it for one with a new look at the mount vendor.
---
Sure, that's fair. I think 20 is probably solid when accounting for the large number of casual players who have to look up every quest, check their map to know how to get to Westfall from Goldshire, etc.  
---
It's not too hard to run some other numbers while assuming 10 days played to 60, we just added it to the bottom of the post.
---
Int is king
---
Tho if you have good int gear it can take 2 drinks to bring you back to full
---
Until there's too many people in Westfall.  Until there's a seasonal event.  Until Orgrimmar starts to lag.  Until AQ is released.
---
Back in vanilla about 7 months before BC, I started my first toon. Playing solo with no MMO experience, no idea about the game, or any friends who played. Took more than 2 months and know I averaged more than 12 hours a day playing. So conservatively it took me 30 days played. I didn't even know endgame existed, so was in no hurry. Leveled professions, wandered an hour lost trying to complete a single quest, would stand at a dungeon for days trying to find groups to run through them a few times...etc.
---
So anyway, it depends on what your experience is, what your goals are...etc. I'm not looking for server first guilds with pserver experience, but my goal is raiding seriously. I'd hope to hit 60 around 12 days played, about a month in. Not following any leveling guides for sure.
---
i believe it only decays at grey, here is a guide ;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---

---
god that would make private servers fucking interesting.
---
Right the ZG trinket and another I forget, but was very similar. At 3 % boss life all our casters would pop these and try to pull aggro off the tank.
---
Answering a yes/no question with "yes" is not inclusive or chief
---
**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
We have a few names in mind, which we are discussing on Discord.
---
I am hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay the 10s for the guild charter.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
ehh....that's a terrible example.
---
As yes...in fact the War-effort COULD start in 1.12 (or 1.10 or 1.11, or 2.1, or 2.4 or any patch between 1.9 and 3.0.9)
---
As it was a Quest-based triggered server event.
---
It's not a global triggered event like the Scourage Invasion, which was limited time on a certain patch.
---
Someone has to progress far enough into the questline before it triggers the conditions to start the war-effort event on that server. And there were in fact servers firing the war-event during 1.12.1. And all through TBC. And a few in Wrath.
---
I had planned on Skinning and Mining. Vendoring the stone, maybe some of the lower ore, keeping the higher end and either vendor or AH for the gems.
---
That’s the gist of it, with 1 or 2 exceptions. 
---
It’s pretty subjective as to how much it affects the gaming experience. It will make the game a little easier, but vanilla is honestly pretty easy already - so really the biggest effect is just changing which dungeon you farm for gear.
---
The pvp gear is the only gear I really wish they’d do progressive itemization with cause the 1.12 version is insanely good. Like better than t1 epics good.
---
"Today we're talking about the skip that completely changed the competitive speedrunning of molten core, but first we need to talk about each bosses mechanics for no reason for 20 minutes"
---
I have no fucking idea what the name of the song is, But the summer them in Harvest Moon DS Cute is almost identical to the inn theme for alliance inns (dunno if horde has a different theme mind) and that always gets me thinknig about vanilla
---
I would really at least like the statistics tab.  Even if others cant see it, its a fun way to keep track of some fairly meaningless numbers.
---
Uh, yes. What part do you think is wrong?
---
Is this confirmed because yes!!
---
Perhaps the dev got the original 1.12 client going by modifying an old server code checkout, but that wasn't good enough for a blizz-quality classic option on battlenet
---
The pig tails did! Not pony tails
---
If you are a tauren you never go wrong with herbing
---
can't be worse than 10 y/o me.  
---
after learning what rested xp was I got the bright idea to run to orgrimmar and stay for a minute to get rested then run outside to the west, across the river to kill a single mob with rested xp. then run back to org and repeat the process over and over again.  for some reason it made more sense to me than questing cause I was getting a bonus exp. I think I had about 6 days /played at level 23
---
Get destroyed.
---
We're not sure....the alpha leak seemed to hint at it...but they were just riding around on it, so that doesn't really mean much, unless it was in a vendor and they bought it, and were trying hint that is going to be a thing.
---
But we don't know if that's the case or they simply spawned it with dev powers.
---
Idk if you're planning to raid,  but mage and lock are probably the most boring to use lol. 
---
I'm doing rogue, lock,  priest
---
I’ve interviewed one who’s coming back for Classic. A fellow Aussie too!
---
I mean it's basically like MDI in BfA but with raids. You could have speed clear raid vs. raid events with an official leaderboard etc.
---
F R E S H servers gonna happen anyway some time down the road of Classic.
---
Until people start requiring a minimum achievement score for things.
---
"Need 5 more for MC. Must have at least 5k achievement points."
---
The first part.
---
Although the OP should be more specific as the only loot trading they are allowing is in raids, where as loot trading in retail is for all group content.
---
Our memories are fickle things; every timeline has been weird we just block it out.
---
"Fake News"; they called that "Yellow Journalism" in the 1890's. 
---
 "Internet Hoaxes", we called those urban legends when I was growing up.  Crooked Wall Street?  the brokers who brought about the 1600's Dutch Tulip Mania make our financier's look like saints.
---
Try explaining the mass insanity of the 1970's (the clothing, furniture, disco, pet rocks!).  And you think now is weird?
---
But as you mentioned, we're getting classic WoW which makes this a good time to be alive!
---
That’s a bit of a reach lol
---
Hit rating is useless for healers so focus int/stam and crit and since pvp is your focus always try to go for the highest armor for slot too but if it’s really that much better cloth/leather (and eventually mail) will be ok instead of plate as long as you keep a shield handy you can stay around 40% which is important so you don’t die to melee and hunters as quickly. Your group comp is a dream team the skill cap is high but the potential of mage/warr/pally is unmatched as you have blessing of freedom which lets the warr move unhindered and a polymorph so one less target to fight and a de curse/remove magic/ and remove poison so no dots on any of you, and then to top it off your healer can spec reckoning then go holy and just delete people
---
Night shifter here. Summer is our slow time. I will be off between 1030 or 12. Usually stay up till 5 gaming and 6-7 watching youtube. So I'm hoping for 6-7 hours a day. More on weekends or other days off.
---
It isnt tho lol. I've had people actually say that kind of shit in retail, no joke.
---
Sure but he's talking about 2005 first time mmo players who didn't know how to look up a quest or install an addon and the 'game' was screwing around while levelling, not getting to 60. Really it's just an offhand comment to make his 4 days 20 h sound impressive.  
---
In 2019 any sort of gamer who wants to get to 60 in a decent time won't have any problems at all doing it in &lt; 12 days. Using 20 days as the 'average' for your guide is super misleading in that sense, because presumably the only people who care enough to check it out will be those players.
---
What in the fuck. 
---
Why do you not stay up till like 8am and then sleep till 4pm? What kind of night shift worker are you if your awake during daylight??
---
20 days is ridiculous long. 
---
On a pserver with “1.12” rates I casually hit 60 on a Druid in 7 days. With minimal addons, max professions, many extra dungeons, and about 300 hks. 
---
20 days would be a complete wow noob who doesn’t even google quests for help and spends a whole week in Ironforge exploring.
---
whelp that is settled Female Dwarf paladin.
---
I'm still going to have a horde main, but at least I will have something to play with the lady.
---
We should prepare for August... my wild guess. Assuming they just started an alpha, I'd say that is reasonable. End of July is pushing it, but really depends on how well the devs did. If they've gone bonkers since the demo, maybe the alpha and beta can be shorter. We dont really know the state of it at the moment. So everything is just wild speculation.
---
Attunements, raid progression, pvp rank, professions, epic mount are important things. You want to add a curl to your mustache. Cool.
---
Take it slow, don't worry about min-maxing, just enjoy the ride. You really only get one chance per faction to enjoy it at it's fullest.
---
Every character after that feels a little processed
---
Hi, /u/Lurpyftw
---
/thread
---
My suggestion is either warlock / Druid (boomkin). 
---
Especially on pvp server. Fear/root/ ss on Druid/br on lock makes them very dynamic.  And fear to meet in pvp.  
---
Two hunters is another option.  
---
Two paladins another.  Option making paladins more sane as your white striking all the time. It would also make you almost impossible to kill due to two healers.
---
Your math is **--WAY--** off.
---
&gt;XP to 60: 66,513,735

Real amount is 21,100 to level 10 - 123,600 would put you just shy of level 18 which is 126,500.

Your source for XP is garbage. It's not 880xp to ding level 2, it's 400.

That does appear to be implying 30 days /played. I don't think that makes any sense though. Even in 2005 we had census addons so it was easy to see where the big wave of players was on a new server. I was usually in the big clump, a bit forward from the center, and would come out around 8 days and some change. I have a hard time believing the rest of the clump took another 23 days played.
---
That's not a change, that's an addition.  
---
New mounts were added to the game, and Blizzard afforded you the opportunity to trade your old mount for the new one. No change in the actual item took place.
---
What alpha leak?
---
Lots of allys play Human priest.. There's only like 3 fights in all of vanilla wow that need fear ward lul.
---
Did you account for the spellpower set bonuses on both sets? I thought AQ generally had more than T2 but I may be mistaken.
---
The main reason to choose AQ over T2 is basically the agility - it provides decent mitigation via dodge for prot, and necessary crit for ret. Plus the gloves, bracers and belt can be swapped for more tanky parts or warrior DPS items as appropriate.
---
Paladins have lower single target threat than Prot Warriors or Bears and whlst they have convenient and easy AOE threat they still scale in a way that even with 3/3 improved RF you're going to be needing to think about threat output unless you're literally tanking in t2 for people in greens. Remember that the limiting factor for threat for paladins is actually mana - their burst threat is fine if they blow high ranks of everything and judge Righteousness, but in practise you're going to want JoW on a boss, possible downranks of consec and to be conservative with skills. The longer a fight, the more likely you are of running out of mana, so the more you notice the threat improvement talents when you hit the point you can't really do much more.
---
One note with the AQT2.5 set if you're serious as a long term prot paladin, the gloves are a non-set part, so if you dont run with 3/8 judgement you can take the mail crafted AQ gloves (Black grasp of the destroyer?). THese have a mana regen proc equivalent to about 50 mp5 apparently due to how SoR procs them twice, so are an incredibly good item to keep your mana up if you dont mind a small armor/stam loss.
---
That said, I'd only recommend skipping imp RF if you're making a pure solo-or-pvp build and never intend on tanking. As you may have seen, prot warriors in Naxx started hitting their threat cap such that they began using dual wield fury tank specs, or bears with pummelers, in an effort to ensure DPS could dps as hard as they could. Given that Paladin single target threat was already lower than this, it's guaranteed that at any level of gear above BWL really, DPS threat is going to start vastly outpacing Paladin threat, so by the time you get the spellpower gear to let you consider dropping RF, the DPS have access to even better scaling stuff.

First few weeks of raiding. You're gonna get both drops in one run. I can feel it.
---
Okay.  
---
The ability to attune yourself to BWL is not available in Classic's launch even though it's being based on 1.12  
---
That's a change that eliminates the "1.12 is 1.12" argument.
---
Ahh mb
---
to be honest, I'd have preferred if the dailies had been heavily limited. Like 5 per day or MAYBE 10. And then get to pick which ones you felt like doing that day. 
---
It wasn't in bad in early TBC, but by 2.4 they went nuts with dailies, and you could do like 20-25 of them per day.
---
Which not only meant you could actually do most of the dailies every day, the economy went absolutely insane from getting flooded with so much daily gold.
---
And wrath STARTED with that amount of dailies. And added even more, and I think also got rid of the daily limit or was that Cata....I'm pretty sure it's wrath, i'd double check to be 100% sure.
---
Do YOU, good player, want to keep a bag PURELY to use your weapon?
---
Do YOU, player, want to have to keep specific food at all times so you don't lose one of the MAIN FEATURES of your class?
---
Do YOU, player, want to have to learn timing between auto attacks to keep up good DPS?
---
Do YOU, player, want to get bullied on every loot roll?
---
Do YOU, player, want to play an admittedly not super amazing DPS class?
---
Do YOU, player, want to play HUNTER?
---
Oh, no? Oh...ok then...
---
In all seriousness, classic Hunter is a really unique experience and I'm really looking forward to playing it again
---
20 to 30 days is ridiculous. Basically all 1x private server who have published stats have average time to 60 being 10-11 days. Back in vanilla nothing was published by blizzard as far as i know, but it seemed most hit 60 in the 10-15ish days time. With outliers hitting 60 in the low 20's. I think calculating for the 8-12 days mark is much more accurate as an average.
---
Really? I thought i read somewhere that they will not launch with RP PVP servers. Will there be RP PVE servers at launch?
---
Orc female melee animations are far better, imo.
---
Yes, but after 1.4 the old mount models were no long acquirable. 
---
You seem to be under the impression that when classic launches it will be using a 1.0-&gt;1.1-&gt;1.2-&gt;etc type of progression in the phases and that just isn’t how it works.
---
The game launches at *Patch 1.12*, which means the updated models have been in the game for 8 patch cycles already and the old models have not been available for 8 patch cycles already. 
---
Do you understand now? 
---
More than likely you will *not* be able to acquire the original models.
---
&gt;It’s also harder to make money at AH given not enough money generated in the economy yet
---
This is actually thing that I am very interested about. It will be a lot of fun to see how economy starts to develop once day 1 there is literally 0 gold in game. I am really looking forward to see what happens.
---
The only time effective time to farm gold is the first two weeks of an expansion in current content.
---
&gt;he economy went absolutely insane from getting flooded with so much daily gold.

&gt;And wrath STARTED with that amount of dailies. And added even more, and I think also got r

Ignore skinning, the 3 seconds per adds up. Just get to level 60 a bit faster and you'll make more in the first hour.
---
The best leveling professions for gold are no professions, then start making gold that much faster.
---
The boat arrives. It’s FULL of the other faction. 😂
---
That's about what I was feeling too.
---
And what I'm saying is that Blizzard is launching Classic in the 1.12 with modifications, and not perfectly true to the 1.12 patch. Furthermore, some of the modifications they're making are in attempts to remain true to the patch era that each phase represents. One example is disabling the ability to acquire certain gear until a certain phase, which is direct evidence that they could just as well make the unarmored mounts available in their appropriate phase.
---
Make sure it’s the Second Edition for 1.12. The First Edition is from launch in November 2004. People are trying to scalp these at a premium lately, so make sure you’re getting the right one.
---
Sounds about right.

---
It is pretty specialised if you want to optimise your levelling speed, but there are people doing it atm. If you want to minmax check out Joana’s world discord
---
They haven't. Blizzard did very little communication until recently and practically everything they say is analyzed bit by bit. There's no reason to believe unarmored epic mounts wouldn't be in the game.
---
&gt; I'll let you guys know how worth it they are  
---
Spoiler, google is free.
---
eh...but BWL isn't available either, so there's no point to attune to it. Instance's servers down. Bugged out apparently. Could be [a year] before they get it fixed. Pity about that.
---
Though in all seriousness we probably WILL have an opportunity for the armor-less mounts, as the armored mounts didn't exist at release, and the only items that will be in at release are the ones that existed in patches 1.1-1.2 (they have their 1.12 stats but items added later will not exist).
---
Likewise the unarmored mounts are NOT the same as armored mounts added later. 
---
So there is a chance that they will available during Phase 1. And then possibly removed and replaced in Phase 2, as phase 2 is roughly analogous to patches 1.3 and 1.4, which is when the armored mounts were added.
---
And it would make sense. They do imply that we will have dishonorable kills but they'll be removed later once that phase of the honor system arrives. 
---
And the unarmored Mounts would be a bit a bragging rights reward for people who played during Phase 1, hit 60, and managed to scrap together 900 gold before phase 2.
---
just like the scourge invasion items will be something to show off to future generations after we pass the Scourge Invasion part of Phase 6.

We also added data at the end of the article so we can review 10 days /played numbers as well. :)

From the point of the first gong-ringer you have a 10 hour window (the 10-hour-silithus war) to ring the gong yourself. In theory there is no limit as to how many can get the mount, as long as you complete the chain by clicking the gong within that 10 hour window of the first click.

That being said, it wasnt common for more than 2-3 players tops on a server to do it.
---
I played a Mage on a private server. I will play a mage in Classic.  I give free portals and food/water to people all the time, but only a specific group of people.

The vast majority of those were fixed during beta or the first few patches. There were a few escaped for awhile, though I don't remember the list off-hand of which survived into TBC. (I couldn't use any of them so they didn't matter to me).
---
I know lvl 60 content is cool and you can get end game equip so from pvp perspective you can competing more in skill vs skill less in skill vs equip ... but as far as I remember lvling and pvp during the process was so damn enjoyable :) 
---
I'm not going to rush to lvl 60 ... I want to feel questing and wPvP in all range of levels. There is a history to enjoy behind quests :) ... there is this wPvP tension to feel during leveling ... and it would be a shame to miss it :)

Slide 25 snd onwards (I hope mobile doesn’t mess up the link but Kargoz has it in his Vanilla Warrior Levelling Guide on youtube.
---
Basically if an upgrade is in a reasonable price range and does a big enough difference, as a warrior go for it. Just don’t spend 5g on a sword you’ll replace in 5 levels if you’re in your 20s. If you’re really hurting, buy a weapon then be frugal for a while, grind some mobs for money a little bit or farm something up. 
---
Warrior is tough life, I usually run a DM group as ally once I got my westfall quests done in hopes of getting a nice two hander, hell a 1h in there is probably gonna be better than anything you’re packing up until that point:
---
This is exactly why my first character when classic launches is going to be a Warlock. I can waste all the gold I want!
---
And my second character, after the economy has matured a little, will be an herbalist/skinner. Selling all your cloth, leather and herbs makes more than actually have a profession while leveling.
---
If you're specing imp. Vampiric Embrace you haven't ever tried to PvE as a Shadow Priest before. Good luck managing threat and bring some Limited Invuln Potions that's all I can tell you.
---
The only thing I'd want you to look up is what your class does in the end game.
---
I'd hate for you to spend probably months getting to 60 just to find out that you're virtually restricted to being a clothie healer in raids as a paladin or that balance or cat dps for druid is just not viable unless you're extremely experienced with the class.
---
Paladin T2 would like to have a word with you.

Or, u could just use this build [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsV0oZf0xZxMgz0x](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsV0oZf0xZxMgz0x) spam 1 rank of shadow word pain give ur raid +15% dmg, buff and heal the raid. Way more usefull than doing dmg, if u wanna dmg with priest reroll to warlock.
---
Largely bad questions IMO.
---
Mostly just shit QOL stuff from either one xpac or half a decade + removed from vanilla.
---
More interesting questions would revolve around a rework of ranking maybe, rebalancing of PvE content for modern day, removal of worldbuffs in raids potentially idk.
---
Just shit that isnt "LUL DUALSPEC LUL TRANSMOG"
---
Right the 2h mace is 200 to 400 isn't it!
---
This reminds me of a video a buddy of mine made. It was just Retail BGs in Legion (I think?) but was deliberately made to look and sound like a shitty 2005 montage. If I can dig it up I'll post it in an edit.
---
The latency can be related to where you're from. As a Swede I had green latency all the time in 06' when I first started playing, we we're just early with good internet up here in the north.
---
yeaaaaah ... noooo
---
Your videos are so good, please keep up the good work 😊
---
I will be maining a hunter and solely leveling him through grinding mobs for rare loot. I'm hoping to get at least 2 crimson whelplings and if the gods are good, 1 emerald whelpling. Then I'm hoping to be able to farm the devilsaurs before the damn Chinese goldfarmers get a stranglehold on them. I'm definitely going to have enough money from the grinding to get my mount at level 40.
---
I wouldn't prioritize a shield, there is a great off-hand early on in Un'goro chain quest which provides 20+ spell damage and healing. Not to difficult to get, it's a good powerhouse for dungeons but provides no survival for pvp. 
---
Eastern plaguelands (or west I think) offer a green helm with tons of int and mp5, that's a real powerful tool too.
---
Underrated comment
---
That's not how that works. Blizzard has made it clear that their philosphy regarding items being implemented is that items that received itemization changes will be in their 1.12 state, and regardless of that, items will only be introduced alongside the patches they were implemented. This applies to loot tables, reputation vendors, but not mounts because... reasons?
---
You keep going "patch cycle" this, "patch cycle" that, yet you don't realize that Classic launches with only the content from the earlier patches. There's no later raids and **none of the items added in later patches, armored mounts included**. The only items from later patches are items that got their *itemization* changed. Mostly dungeon items and PVP gear. Unarmored and armored mounts are two completely distinct items with different item IDs.
---
&gt; [This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/160757)
---
These mounts are items and content. They're not a mechanic that was changed during Vanilla. You could make a point that the race-specific riding skills were, but that's not the point here. We're talking about unarmored mounts which are strictly items.
---
&gt;Did you account for the spellpower set bonuses on both sets?
---
Yes. Great insight on everything else.
---
Field Marshal Kaylanii. I was Giddy's friend haha.
---
that was a BC or WotLK feature i believe.
---
Ohhhh you’re right there are sites like that, will try one, thanks !
---
oh my bad, maybe it was just better to level with 2 accounts then? I know the reason i started playing wow in classic was because my dad was playing 2 characters and I played one so he didnt have to do both. I remembered it was because of some extra xp gain but maybe its just that party was better than solo back then(?) My memory is shit...
---
Imagine having a grip on reality and not publishing nonsense. Literally misinformation.
---
You misspelt Autumn
---
Paladin, heals damage enemy players if cast on them.
---
If thats how you want to play it, yeah, theyre not super efficient. But this person is playing the game for the first time, I dont think /played 60 time is the biggest issue as much as getting good at the game and playing with people. I'm also only saying that because I love dungeons... I do every one once to experience it, but some ill do way more, if I like it.
---
alarmist nonsense. If anyone srsly thinks the game will be DOA because they implement sharding for a week or so during launch, you're out of your mind.
---
Call of Elements addon for totem management is useful.
---
Skinning/mining is a good starting profession, but remembering the amount of players starting it might prove hard to get mining nodes.
---
I’m thinking of going skinning enchanting so I can just de all greens and quest items as I level.
---
Not a fan of short, spammable buffs in general. I'd say totems can get pretty annoying.
---
Any results?
---
Feels bad. Moving to a new place first of July, and my wife does not understand the whole gaming scene (haven't played that much in the last 5 years). I feel like we will come at a crossroad this summer - yes pun intended!
---
I started playing end of vanilla to bc with a hunter. It was still a thing then. It ran away if you didn’t feed it. Think around cata/wod it was removed. 
---
It was interesting to have lost a pet but so annoying cause you had to level it again.

Relying on a private server experience is also ridiculously wrong.

Man, they really mangled SM
---
Ahh boo. So for the lifetime of Classic we can presume that Firey Weapon/Lifestealing and 99% of weapons with a magic damage proc will ONLY do the listed damage and spellpower has no effect? Shame.
---
I don't suppose you know of any specific proc-related items that stand out in Classic for classes that can proc them heavily (EG, prot paladin with SOR and Reckoning)? I know the Hand of Edward the Odd was popular.
---
Otherwise I guess it means Spellpower on Weapon will be the be-all and end-all enchant for a Holy or Paladin wanting to do some damage outside of a physical ret-spec.
---
Yup.

they had some promotions off and on where you could recruit a friend, but all it gave you was a free month when they signed up.

The whole extra xp while grouped and leveling stuff and mount are from TBC, LATE TBC, like just a couple months before Wrath.

Only NA calls it VC, the rest of the world has always called it DM

Ridiculousness aside, I think if they had used a question like reworking the rank system it could damage the results. What would the rework change? When would it change it? Etc, etc. There's a grey area with questions like that.

RAF came within build 2.4.3 (August 5th 2008) - TBC
---
I think technically there was a "refer a friend" type thing in vanilla but all it did was give your friend a month of game time. No in game bonuses
---
Me too. I don't like "realistic" graphics in computer games.
---
Not having to be max level to be valued as a character. I remember being helped out by a level 50-something who saved me from being ganked by some 39 twinks, What a hero.
---
Take mining if you plan on going engi at 60 to save yourself a lot of money at 60, which can be considered money made in a way.
---
Thats amazing - got it for other classes?
---
Most good questions lack easy answers.
---
That's part of what makes them good questions.
---
I started day 1 and it took 12 days played time. Little under a month real time. I was in first batch of 60s on sargeras. First was a Chinese mage who bearly spoke any English. He did it in about 3 weeks.
---
You were annoyed that you couldn't wear plate as a priest? I don't see how that's a big problem
---
I still kinda hope undermanning will be the way to go as far as competitive goes. Something I personally find more interesting and is objectively more rewarding.
---
yea as I said i have issues remembering stuff now adays, my bad :)
---
Gotcha, thanks a bunch!
---
Barrens chat. I was just playing earlier &amp; there was an in-depth discussion between three people about wether or not spiders had a penis.
---
Why do you (as in you the majority of players) need to be spoon-fed everything ? 
---
You could make your bis list yourself it's not hard, it helps you think more about your class / race specialization and it passes time instead of spamming reddit :p
---
Here what you need :
---
[https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/) (to search for items use the phase:1 argument)
---
[https://classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) (for where it drops and drop rates)
---
[https://www.google.com/sheets/about/](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)
---
Should be on his channel (link in first slide), he has a video guide for every class afaik and useful links in description.
---
Oh wow that's really helpful! Thanks!!
---
If Classic fails there will be no TBC re-release. This is their test.
---
I pushed rank 12 on my server with over 1hour queues... we had to get creative and we farmed orgrimmar for honor while waiting (i was a rogue). And 50% of our games were horde premades that would leave and requeue because they had instant queues.... ending in us just speed running 3 flags in less than 5 minutes while we had 3-4 horde to spawn kill at the graveyard.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor !!!!
---
I always hide helm and show cloak.
---
I dropped to part time work, mainly for school but low-key for this too
---
&gt;As it was a Quest-based triggered server event.
---
Except it wasn't.
---
It was triggered upon the release of patch 1.9, you had to complete the quest of course, but all servers on 1.9 had the war effort started so his argument stands.
---
If a server were 1.12, not just 1.12 data but if it were on 1.12 it would have the war effort. It doesn't so the mounts are fair game POTENTIALLY.
---
&gt; no one thought Blizz was ever gonna do it.
---
that's kinda overstatement
---
Thanks I learned a lot from this
---
Selling a stack of copper bars for 1g or less, instead of 20g.

Take a room you two !
---
Depends if you want to tank, then troll else orc.
---
Male Troll warrior is not bad imo.
---
We just had a in-depth post about how Hunters do like 100ish more DPS when doing this. It is an evolution of Hunter DPS that wasn't common back in the day. Hell then hunters even dismissed their pets in raids.
---
Good point, I agree with you though I wrote it the wrong way, “misses a big part of the game” is more accurate
---
I only levelled up once fully, so am going to enjoy doing it a second or even third time, if you’ve already done that then enjoy the rest of it :)
---
Old gun sounds
---
Crown of Rag solved my helmet issue.
---
Definitely caused my ego to become one though
---
If I ever roll a warrior, using overpower on Rogues. It really never gets old. I'll probably twink one out just for the lulz
---
Me too pal. Me too.
---
Being excited to pick up health potions.
---
&gt;I've read that when it comes to surveys only the top end and bottom end matter
---
Depends on what kind of survey. In research things in the middle also matter.
---
Nor is there any reason to believe they would be.
---
Until we login to the beta, or it’s datamined, it’s really just speculation either way.
---
Facetime me and i will lead just put it on loudspeaker and point the camera at the screen
---
Even though these are rough estimates based on a linear leveling and experience gain, it still puts it into a very good perspective.
---
Like it or not, the people who have a full-time job(s) will not reach 60 anytime soon after launch. It just takes a lot of time. Considering (based on the recent surveys) that the average playerbase age will be around the 25-35 bracket, the *majority* of players will level slowly and not have much playtime to put in per week.
---
Thus, those who are unemployed or simply free will be able to reach 'end game' much more quickly. From this fact we can extrapolate that the *majority* of this playerbase will be mostly young teenagers, high schoolers and students.  They tend to have the most free time of all.
---
That said, I believe Blizzard should further think out the length of each phase and whether specific additions will be implemented sooner or later as per phase.
---
If the *majority* of the playerbase will not reach 60 in 2 months after launch, and phase 2 is planned to drop after the 2nd month, then there will be additional content added before the previous is depleted. Yet, there will always be people who will rush to the end, do all the content and then idle until the next batch rolls out.
---
I am expecting a lot of arguments and whining from all sides. Personally I am going unemployed for the first half year after launch to properly experience the world of Azeroth once more. It's too big of a thing to pass out on. Also if you can realistically (and practically) afford to dedicate all your time to Classic, you should definitely do it. We only live once in this life (until you ress as a newborn) so you might as well take as much as you can from it :)!
---
As long as she's okay with changing your adult diaper and bringing you food &amp; drinks, it's all good.

Pray for a smooth launch!  Days of crashes and downtime would be a nightmare.
---
I joined this discord [https://discord.gg/vx7UaxP](https://discord.gg/vx7UaxP)
---
It has some nice builds for endgame and leveling and some very knowledgeable people to ask questions to.
---
The purpose of a poll is to get more than one person's opinion.
---
Do you happen to have the values for hunters ranged attacks ? 
---
Some say there are no GB on ranged attacks and others say it's 60% for a boss.
---
Also why do you take 10% hit instead of 9 ? I thought you need 8.6% and the rest is wasted ?
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
I don't intend to treat this game like retail and know this is classic. I intend to go out and level and find groups along the way and know dungeon finder is not a thing.
---
Dude, just admit it... your math is shit. As everyone in this thread told you already, your numbers are wrong and so far from the reality.
---
Fast players who  worked on their route will take around 7/8 days. Someone willing to take their time, explore, level professions etc may take around 12/13 days (+120h to 150hours, which is already enormous).
---
Weather. Specifically rain. 
---
The immersion factor when a heavy shower through Northshire Abbey while killing kobolds (as a level 2 Warlock in a red robe) is something that's just so calming and beautify to me.
---
Hiding underneath the trees.  Same with the Defias.
---
DAE private servers bad xDDDDD
---
Lol nonit isnt. Sorry to burst your retail bubble. Yes, private server players ave an edge. Deal with it.
---
What is a mount journal anyway ?
---
 /facepalm
---
I'm done we pre-ordering, but I wish you a lot of fun.
---
The fact is, most people on this sub are "purists" to put it nicely. They are interested in playing Classic to relive past memories. Anything that could be related to private servers is an affront to how they want to play the game and instead of understanding that different people have different reasons for enjoying a game, people prefer to just downvote or get into an argument. Such topics include speed running, optimizing raids by strongest classes and using world buffs and consumables, ect. These things are seen as the enemy because they weren't how people played Vanilla 15 years ago. But it isn't even like that is the problem, it's more of the underlying issue with things on Reddit in general; people downvote and react negatively to things they don't personally like instead of promoting differentiating opinions.
---
That’s why I always charged more for water than what could bought from a vendor.  I’ve got better things to do with my time.  It’s also why I never bothered other mages for water when I was on an alt.  The few silver you save tracking down and bugging mages isn’t worth either persons time.
---
On my first toon I crafted a helm of fire before I got my mount. And yes, helm of fire requires lvl 45 to equip.
---
I've seen all of your videos and they are definitely very high quality content. Certainly a step above most you find on YouTube, especially for classic. Good job man!

You mean it was nerfed in classic ?

Why would I play the campaigns on old WC3 client if reforged is coming Soon (TM)?
---
Its neck, chin, and face are all the same thing.
---
I'm right there with you. And I'm only 27 :&gt;
---
Seeing the same people everyday.
---
Just keep your daily structure and replace other stuff you're doing to relax with playing Classic. Like, watching Youtube videos, Netflix, Reddit etc.
---
I'll keep on lifting in the morning just to maintain the habit and keep structured daily schedule. Maybe I'll gain weight a bit easier because I'm going to sit infront of my PC a lot more than usual.
---
repost
---
Didnt blizzard have to back down on that thing though? Wasnt it show in the end that the private server way was actually correct after all?
---
Why are people so stupid when it comes to Sharding. It is needed on Every Server for the first weeks!
---
Blizzard would have used it back then if they could, same with a guild bank.
---
Everything is soon 🔜.. I will die waiting
---
My first character was something like 20 days played to cap. I wore white items till red ridge cause the items didn’t match up visually.
---
Why don't you respec ? 100G a week is 2 hours of farming which will be fast since you're spec shadow.
---
Didn’t he get hot-fixed, then nerfed later?
---
A week ago, I felt the exact same urge. Pre-ordered Reforge and startted to play the RoC campaign to experience the story again.
---
I remember that I never made it past the higher Scourge campaings, so I have a lot of new ground to cover. I thoroughly enjoy it so far and can only recommend anyone to do the same!
---
Forget stitches, back up not to Afro Mor’Ladium - aggro 10 skellies
---
I really would love a Guild bank. Really do not know why people will put them self in such a pain to handle it if a second acc or spreadsheets.
---
It was confirmed by Kevin Jordan &amp; Mark Kern that it was just a limitation because of the technology back then.
---
Round, busty midget girls with beards?  Yes please!!
---
Why should I wait to play Classic if I can play BfA right now? Because you're witnessing a game in it's original state, without a make-over.
---
No, because it's a fucking roleplaying game.
---
&gt; If you actually bother to look at any actual data comparison between vanilla and a private server, it's likely the private servers are more difficult.
---
Wtf are you talking about. I didnt comment anything regarding difficulty, i just pointed out that blizzard has full copy of 1.12 data that is absolutely correct. Nobody cares about private server data, we want the REAL 1.12 data to be used.
---
This guy knows. A huge reason why WoW is so amazing is exactly because it shows WARCRAFT from a whole new perspective. And Warcraft was an RTS for three generations. 
---
Warcraft 3 was the peak of isometric gaming (it spawned Dota and LoL for Pete's sake) and the quality really shines in that game. To have WoW bring it all in first-person is just so bloody awesome.
---
Christ. No matter the class, it feels wrong.
---
Set your afk message as your food/portal costs and it will auto-weed out the people who are leeches.

Right, thats why i pointed out that you might use those pants for few MC runs, before upgrading to the DM item.

It took me forever to reach 60 on my rogue, I absolutely HAD to constantly buy the best possible daggers for my level range... Worth it
---
This. If every detail is perfect, your brain doesn't fill in the blanks. It's boring.
---
Yes, there was a time in classic when it was a thing... nice job contributing bud
---
Gotta catch em all!
---
I mean I can’t trust Blizz to make changes so yes I agree, but I’m talking some perfect world where we could trust Blizz to keep the spirit of the game the same.
---
If you do it on phase 1 you won't even take a dishonorable hit if you kill lowbies/quest npcs.

If yo uused the search function, on this subm you would see the same result over and over again.

You are actually incorrect.

I ll do tha same, keepin the clots and later change skining to tailor
---
A safe bet would be between June 21st and September 23rd 2019
---
Living off of welfare ftw
---
But... but... HOLY SHOCK!!!!!
---
I have no good comeback to that. Touché.
---
Source?
---
Yes.. then what could possibly come after an employee alpha and before release?
---
It was tongue-in-cheek. Notice the smiley at the end? I know there are multiple definitions of "summer".
---
However the "meteorological" definition is quite widely used (like where I live).
---
Wikipedia:
---
"The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere.[4][5] Under meteorological definitions, all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month.[4] This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year, in which daylight predominates. The meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Russia and Japan. It is also used by many in the United Kingdom. In Ireland, the summer months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann, are June, July and August."
---
Neithers loot trading or sharding or right click report or new graphics.
---
Shit logic.
---
took me about 3 months of mild to heavy play, and I dont know my specific  in game time, but I do remember  most people who were pretty  serious  was about 11 days played
---
Transmog is a fucking retarded suggestion.
---
Might as well have guns and mech suits.
---
First place I heard it was on a Tips video where he claims to have had an interview with one of the Nost developers.
---
There’s a few other videos claiming similar stuff. Most everything is hearsay, and I suppose claiming one way or the other is bad practice. Guess the only way to know for sure would be to data-mine the original Nost release and see for myself.
---
...not gonna happen lol.

I just hyped myself again fuck
---
Wait, there will be new graphics?
---
Entire reason I'm playing classic is because no new graphics
---
Spirit is legit the 2nd best stat for casters for leveling. Stacking int and stamina is nice and cool but you'll end up drinking a lot. with a nice mix of int + spirit you'll run out of mana much slower.
---
What's reforged?
---
I reposted this and the mods here locked it...
---
1st player: herbalism and skinning
---
2nd player: mining and enchanting
---
Both player can track one material, and easily can level the 2.nd one. Later you can change mining into tailoring (can level up easy if you put the clots away) and/or change skining or herbs to alchemy or leatherwork.
---
Played in a min max guil on a PS, and when I joined I had to replace 2 gear pieces if I wanted to raid. I would agree with the decision if the upgrade was substantial and not 4spell power in total.
---
YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!
---
Yeah, we have no Rogues on PvE Servers. I was surprised too.
---
If I didn't love too heal so damn much, I would have picked one like I did it in the OG release...
---
Since TBC I've keybound the R key to autorun. Just feels right and is pretty useful for anything from versatile combat movement to getting up real quick from your desk but you are on a 5 minute walk in Ashenvale.
---
Its a sandbox private server repack. Not supported by blizzard unfortunately.
---
Main tank? Then let the guild bank pay for the resist gear!
---
You could mow a small lawn or shovel a driveway for $15 nowadays. Some people may find farming gold enjoyable, though.
---
For those sweet auoto hits!
---
Gethering profs povide some money while you leveling, and later this way you can change them down for something more* usefull.
---
pretty sure they mixed up servers as well. idk, wow lost color in cata. also there were way more phasing quests in cata compared to wotlk. the whole leveling experience was more streamlined and solo oriented. the harrison jones chain quest is a good example
---
This is one of the unaswered questions we still have.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxghsVVooZx0xp0x
---
Is probably the way to go. Also you don't want to use SWP as it uses a debuff slot. Rank 1 mind flay cancelling to stack shadow weaving and then rank 1 mind blasts to refresh work well.
---
This is true. The pvp system, bgs, and later raids can all be worked on and tested after phase 1 is released.
---
All assumptions are worthless...
---
Here's my assumption.
---
lul
---
"It'S jUsT nOsTaLgIa"
---
I dont know, that's why I'm asking.
---
Wow wtf man this is crazy crazy good. I NEED this for druid and mage. I was planning on pvping at every bracket so knowing what cool gear to get  while I level is essential.
---
depends on what you understand to be a good tank then ;) but yeah obviously this depends entirwly on the DPS in your raids.
---
again it depends on the rest of your raidgroup. skipping out on a 50% attack speed buff isn't something you can just skip and expect your dps to not be affected. but if the other DPS in your raid slack, you can still be top5.
---
true, they aren't significantly affected more by lacking world buffs. but if the good dps in your raid have them and you don't, you'll certsinly notice.
---
You rat bastard
---
:(
---
I just miss the big class spells. I could do without the rest.
---
Please no release before August, because I can't take time off for July anymore :(
---
Don't you only need a very low level to disenchant? I'm going to have a disenchant alt asap.
---
Laughs in druid
---
It took me 12days while I did most quests in mid-level zones, did dungeons multiple times, leveled professions and did owPvP.
---
If I was focusing on leveling (but not following a guide) it would've taken me 8 days.
---
The whole thing took me around 3 months.
---
While I agree with you, AFAIK exp to level 10 is 27,600. Your 21,100 should out you at level 9.

Mini dungeons on the way to dungeon entrances.
---
I loved killing elites guarding entrances on the way to dungeons.  Not only were there sometimes quests to do outside the dungeon entrance, but more often than not your group would get an extra piece or 2 of loot to roll on before even going in.
---
Part of the fun for me was working my way to the dungeon entrance itself.  I am happy to finally have that back.
---
Is this the new ultra setting?
---
Try to explain more. Meanwhile, it got deleted.
---
Thunderfury was added with Patch 1.6 (BWL)
---
Are you meaning to tell me that non-elite mobs are easier to kill than elite mobs?
---
&gt; Troll Shaman and Orc Warrior. Trying to roleplay as well (even if there are no RP servers). And will take my time to level them both :-) I really like questing and doing dungeons in Vanilla.
---
Nowhere in his post did he say anything about RP-PvE or RP-PvP. All he said was that there would be no RP servers, which is incorrect.
---
Dive in, go with the ride. No guides, no planning, just experiencing the world and learning stuff on the go.
---
I'm more impressed that so many guys actually stayed in touch with the vanilla crew. The wow-people I'm actually friends with today came much later in wow.
---
Or just a place to waste some time with friends. Without the constant nagging of some ingame mechanic to do X.
---
You're just casually shitting all over people who want to play on RP-PvE servers. Wow....
---
Also, RP-PvE is just as much of an RP server as RP-PvP is, idiot. You don't get to decide for everyone else what servers are "real".
---
Players are never dishonorable kills.
---
Dude... I used to hit Master Sergeant easy before level 50 even from random world pvp where I wasn't even trying to actively seek people. At 60 going and finding people from 50-60 that give honor and start early? The blue set will be easier to get than anything from UBRS even... and it's as good as MC gear basically
---
Ofc you get downvoted...that's what heppends to people who resort to _ad hominem_ instead of presenting arguments. Attack what was spoken, not the speaker.
---
&gt;Did you so happen to waste hours on the shit show?
---
Never did, neither as a player nor as a developer. The former because I played Vanilla and playing on a PS would, in my opoinion, taint the memory. The latter because while I am a programmer, game development isn't my forte, and I am tied up in my work as it is, so contributing to time consuming projects elsewhere sadly isn't really an option.
---
Nevetheless, I respect the efforts that go into such projects, precisely because other than most people badmouthing them, I knoe a thing or two about software development, and how much effort has to go into something like a PServer just to get it running in the first place.
---
&gt;one could say it was a shit show
---
Yes, one could. One could also not be a disrespectful brat with no manners or empathy, and use a wording that doesn't make him look like a spiled 12 year old. It's up to everyone to make that decision for himself.
---
Most mobs are going to be a lot easier, on nost core servers the mobs literally just use their abilities as much as they possibly can, which makes some mobs much harder than they were originally. Some mobs might have new abilities that weren’t known on private servers but it’s likely not going to matter much.
---
My best recommendation for a tourist, take your TIME. God damn I miss my first time, broken hearted when I think back to it. This is harder on me than my first born. :cry:
---
&gt;everyone will obviously get the PvP weapons, which will trivialize PvE content, thereby ruining Classic WoW.
---
Not that extreme, but I do believe the blue updated pvp gear being available from the get go will be detrimental to the game.
---
Going back to school for that imba vanilla feel
---
I hit rank 8 on my lock in actual vanilla without playing too much in about a month's time.
---
What episode? I like the podcast btw
---
It's only an RPG in name.
---
Dueling in front of org. Seeing the same people there all the time. Trying to make a name for myself as a competent PvPer.
---
Meaningful loot and fixed loot tables. No loot casino.
---
I couldn’t tell you the name of a single piece of character my main character is wearing.
---
Exactly and they might do a second wave of servers with a different content road map maybe with 10 phases.
---
Depending on addons, If quest helper is available at launch it will cut times a lot even for causal/new players.
---
Rogue - Backstab positional requirements removed, and any weapon can now be used, not just daggers. Damage done by backstab ignores armor rating, and has an additional (non-talented) 25% critical strike rating. Cost reduced from 60 to 20 energy.
---
Come in the horde : we have cookies, less hunters, better racials and scarier rogues !
---
Larkonath, horde evangelist.
---
Even in pservers, which have more hardcore players than usual, there are plenty of casual guilds. The only 'hardcore' or min/max thing they've adopted is enforcing consumables, wbuffs and min/maxed specs. Which isn't that horrible imo.
---
Shhh we’re all gonna quit our jobs and run away together to Azeroth
---
at least that's actually a good weapon for a few levels
---
Joanna is a guy :p
---
Yes, this is true, but my thought is that you can DE a tonne of BOP quest items as you level too, rather than just send greens to to a bank alt. 
---
Also you can enchant your gear and help as you level. 
---
I'm still undecided on whether to level a shammy (for resto at 55-60), or a Hunter (my main was a hunter from 2004-2012). If I go hunter, I'll take enchanting for DM runs when it opens. Also, I can farm lower instances for DEs as I level. 
---
Still deciding though, maybe Skinning/Mining is the way to go, and then can decide once I am 60 what to power level. But I fear mining nodes will be hard to get due to the player numbers.
---
It's on the legion client with updated models
---
There's different BiS lists now than before just because of starting on 1.12. What class and role are you planning on? PvE/PvP? Min/max or casual or a bit of both?
---
Since alot of gear are hard to come by, there easier for us to help you of we know what your plans are. :)
---
not past level 20. 
---
spells below level 20 get reduced spell damage coefficient, sure, but spells above level 20 get the standard value. 
---
Unless you have so little mana that you can't even kill 1 mob (which is not a real issue) having more spell damage means you kill mobs faster. 
---
Spell damage increases *both dps and mana efficiency*. It's an amazing stat, and with greens "of frozen" or "shadow" wrath, the amount you get for the item budget is actually quite good.
---
probably the 2nd best stat for warriors and rogues until level 30+, for hp regen between pulls.
---
There will be no new graphics (apart from the *optional* engine updates, which is mainly shadows and water).
---
I'm in contact with like 4 people total, one of which is an old boarding school IRL friend. Out of the hundreds of people I played with, those are the only ones that stuck.
---
Definitively some of the most infuential private server guilds were mentioned as far as I could gather. I did enjoy the video as well, surprised return wasnt mentioned but I only played casually so I dont have the best grasp of the scene.
---
Warrior/shaman/priest
---
Time to lvl a mage alt!
---
Are you me?
---
On a scale from 0 to 10?
---
If you play Classic WoW to a devastating extent, you'll play Classic WoW for a month, afterwhich you'll face an intervention from friends &amp; family or find yourself so disgusted with the decline in your life that you'll quit the game.
---
Why not play Classic WoW responsibly? Set some guidelines or rules for yourself. You might get less out of Classic the first month, but you'll still be enjoying it 4 months later. 
---
Or I could be taking this meme far too seriously, and everyone isn't writing off parts of their life they shouldn't be.

You guys did 0's? I set almost everything to 'Over my dead body' D:

The idea is good but in practice it does not work.

The debuff slot is too valuable to be used to just "heal" 4 locks.
---
Since you won't be able to use your dot, you won't do much damage and thus won't heal much, a renew from a priest would be more useful
---
I used to put 10g in the window then change it to 1g when they clicked trade. Then down to 10s and so on to see if they'd keep clicking all the way down to 1c.
---
Playing it
---
yeah thats a good idea. I'll prob change skinning once I get to 60 and I've farmed the timbermaw rep (so I can skin all the mobs).
---
I've one friend who I met online in 2006 in another game who's still with me. We started playing WoW later that year, and in a couple of months we'll be playing together like in the old days.
---
I've known that guy for half my life.
---
Garbage and inefficient? We had so much fun fooling around.  I spent an entire evening crossing the world (which felt epic at lvl 19) to get to ashenvale and raid splintertree post.  We had died many times on the journey but we came across a pala (who had a cool mount!!) who led the charge
---
A few hours of battling later things moved down to crossroads and the fight continued.
---
So yeah there were many detours during my original leveling but it was way worth it
---
I dislike the idea of a museum piece, museums only attract visitors. If they want to go the route of OSRS and make community approved changes 2 years down the line that stay in the spirit of what vanilla WoW was about I think it would add to the longevity of the project.
---
A holy reckoning paladin with naxx gear is pretty much unkillable while able to reckbomb most people from full to 20% or less
---
Basshunter - Boten Anna
---
I think some are kidding.. Others, not so much. I'm in between the two.
---
Is it my turn to repost this next week?
---
I was the little girl a few weeks/months ago.  Now I'm captain of the HMS hypeship
---
Nah, taking a small cut is only fair.
---
I actually had more fun in WOD. Legion made me feel sick whenever I logged in, it was a weird time.
---
Short answer: Maybe
---
Long answer: We don't know yet
---
Also, they could charge for access.
---
Ofc you can just search the internet. But i still think it's neet that all NPCs' and world mobs' specific locations are listed in the atlas in the main index (The last pages). It just gives a tad more oldschool feel to use it.
---
&gt;so how viable is playing both Holy (PvE) and Shadow (PvP). Or do you mostly have to just stick to one or the other.
---
Both are extremely viable. Shadow is an amazing PvP class and Holy Priest is usually considered the best Healer in vanilla WoW, in particular when they start getting geared up.
---
However, without Dual Specs, you're mostly relegated to one spec. You can pay gold to respec, but it ramps up to I think 100g eventually. Its too expensive to just swap to a Shadow spec when you want to farm or do some PvP.
---
Nit really a vanilla thing but me and my friends used to do this fun thing where we were allowed to spend X gold on the AH and we had to build the funniest outfit we could
---
We also did 'turn off player names and play hide and seek' or 'try to blend in as an npc'.  One time my friend posed as a woman helping in the SW orphanage and i had no idea it was him walking about in there
---
He thought he knew, but he knewn't
---
It's just a meme. There are no female dwarves.
---
Personally. Orc fem better animations and gear looks just looks like it fits. You don't have to minmax pve, pve is ez. For me it's either orc fem ud male. They both looks amazing.
---
Hello,
---
i Found a but with an item :
---
!item Ringo’s Blizzard Boots 
---
 No item matching "Ringo’s Blizzard Boots" was found  
---
Something to do with the quote ?
---
I worded that wrong, what I meant was after all Classic content is released, if people get fed up then Blizz will add more content like TBC.
---
You'd bang a male one though?
---
Why do we care about an earnings report from 3 months ago?
---
I met quite a few guys later in game most of them from my city and quite a few from other city's. We had a all Danish guild, but back in vanilla it was a mix from a lot of different countries which I have no contact with now. And I don't mind, if I decide to play I make new like minded friends.
---
He wasn't saying fails outright, he said fails to entertain. Post naxx almost every private server sees a staggering decline in population, blizzard will either have to do a TBC server, release new "fresh" classic servers, or go the OSRS route and make changes/content in the spirit of classic (possibly voted on by the community).
---
I never got to play Vanilla myself, but...
---
Getting tools that are both weird AND situationally useful. For example, I hear there's this staff that let's you breath underwater. That'll be useful for exploration and questing. 
---
A lot of other MMOs would just "give" you a temporary water breathing buff or tool for that specific quest. Having earned that water staff will likely make me feel that more "powerful" and better off compared to those having to constantly go up for air. It's a good feeling.
---
Even the bugs in dmn drop trash which sells for a bit, plus they're easy as to drop
---
Lmao. Oh I can't frickin wait. For the Horde!!
---
Ooo that's a good idea.
---
Pserver? It was not that expensive in vanilla!
---
Ahh ok interesting!  Hunter gets much more top end damage but that doesn't scale as much as the crit.  Mind you, you seem to be able to get a LOT more agi on a hunter so perhaps you can address the difference somewhat
---
I read that beyond around 21% you get diminishing returns on the value of crit but I'm not sure i believe that
---
Looking at hunter tier sets it seems that the set bonuses are probably part of the problem, they're atrocious lol
---
Yeah I always thought it was weird too.
---
**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; Alliance community. Recruiting more players for Classic. We’re a serious progression guild with a 3-night raid schedule. T/W/TH starting at 7pm central time.**
---
**Currently, we are only looking for active and dedicated players who are interested in raiding with us twice a week on our test server. We believe that by playing together prior to the release of Classic, will give us an advantage in terms of progression as well as to allow us to get to know each other better.**
---
**We are not looking for those who just want to populate the roster and then never participate in any guild events (we have plenty of those).**
---
**If you meet the requirements and want to know more, send me a msg.**
---
You'd really tip at least 50s even back in vanilla, and some people tipped more than 1g. There wasn't really any set etiquette for it.
---
Undermanning for split raids to acquire gear much faster, yes. But nobody ever competed in who is most handicapped, that just never happens, it's not a good  aspect to compete in.
---
The only reason I'm not playing one is because they run like they're on the moon
---
Their animations are pretty cool and gear looks good on them, and it's something a bit different (plus stoneform!)
---
But yeah it's too slow and floaty lookin
---
Skin/fur (well, and horns) customization was there for tauren in late wotlk.
---
I think its a joke. Most people here have kids, partners and full time jobs. I'm sure there will be those who play it on beastmode, but that's the same as retail. I basically used to live in Azeroth during TBC. Can't do that anymore, not with 2 under 2 lol.
---
 I will probably have a real good couple of days or first week  and then return to my normal schedule, which I think most will do.
---
You could do that for VC and I’ve been in groups where people demand you do it for greenskin also. I’ve beat VC at level 18 no problem as a healer the regular way time and time again. The people who do it for greenskin are insane. If you have a healer that has any idea what they are doing there’s no need to cannon jump!
---
#70 :)
---
Can't wait to see the people who played vanilla for 14 years get outskilled by the retail player.
---
Vanilla is not hard, it's just punishing while retail require way more skill than vanilla.
---
And to be clear I prefer vanilla over retail but the skill gap between vanilla players and retail players is just huge
---
Eh, I myself used to give people food/water for free in vanilla, largely because I was used to being the only mage (yes, somehow, don't ask me how) while I was ranking up and it's mutually beneficial to just give people water in BG's. I just got in the habit of carrying a crapton of food/water with me and I really didn't care about giving it out.
---
But portals for free? Nah. Water is infinite, rune aren't. At least give me the cost for the portal unless you're a friend/guildie.
---
People keep swearing the 2h axe from AQ40 trash mobs worked with spell power with a 1:1 ratio added to the damage.
---
I don't see much arguing against blizzard adding content that expands on vanilla after naxx has been out for a while, as long as it remains in the spirit of classic. I trust blizzard to know that the people subbing for classic wow don't want stupid changes, over-balancing, or anything like that. But a new raid or dungeon here and there would be cool as hell, not very resource intensive, and would be enough to keep people playing for a very long time.
---
Yeah no dk to pull you in raid and 10 fps, lag. Im looking forward to it. Ill be playing mele so it will be even more fun.
---
If what you said was supposed to be funny, it wasn't.
---
Back in the day I never actually had a group do this, and I rolled 3 alts through it. I think that it’s because I joined at the point nobody knew what was going on. We did the skip on the pier part when you walk around I think at a later point in vanillas lifespan.
---
Chilling in Brill Inn
---
There’s no need. I healed it at level 18 0 problems whatso ever, but I’ve had a couple groups that demand we do it on greenskin also. It takes longer to get on the stupid cannon at that point.
---
They say they aren't, but they are!
---
No one hates them, they are just very rare.
---
A place where your mounts are being gathered, rather than in your bags.
---
The whole idea is kinda backwards. You count healing to damage without any consideration that example paladins pretty much cannot go oom, ever. So comparing the healing done to mana usage is useless. If the fight is long, the one guy thats absolutely going to be oom, is the shadowpriest. You could just add the 15% damage by having 1 priest hybrid spec to weaving. And calculating everything through 4 warlocks per raid sounds is... generous.
---
Vanilla bosses are atm killed VERY fast. Those debuffs slots are like GOLD atm. Cant remember if mindflays slow effect takes a debuf slot on a boss (and what it knocks off), but when paladin wisdom and light arent used on bosses, and those heal AND give mana to everyone, you can understand that you are NOT going to use piss poor SW:P on any boss. Well, lets say onyxia when you are doing it with \~20man and cant fill the spots.
---
You want to use your warlocks on tank group, not to theorycraft-based heal to damage so a shadowpriest could be counted as "usable".
---
A shadowpriest can hold his own easily, you can flat out OUT DPS ppl if you are dedicated (and the guild isnt that HC that they really care about the debuffs that much). Just play shadowpriest if you want to and find ppl that will let you do it. You are not going to be able to proof that its in the optimal raid setup and the best idea ever.
---
The underrated on pve servers is because ally have a better raid make up with racials and paladins, so generally you play pve servers if you wanna raid. Horde have better pvp racials and shamans so populate pvp servers.
---
They think they don't, but they do
---
I still talk to a few of my old guild mates. Sadly, only 1 has expressed any interest whatsoever. The rest keep telling me that kids, spouses and careers wont allow them any time to play. Luckily for me, the only thing I have to worry about is career and it's not like I put in crazy amounts of time, lol. Which leaves me PLENTY of time to no life WoW again.
---
You know it's bad when you're already planning at what level you will begin leveling an alt and when you'll start a twink
---
Yeah I guess it's just a different way of saying the priest class fantasy didn't work for me
---
What's F&amp;F?
---
I hope my WoW tokens are still valid - I amassed 7 iirc before I retired after Warlords, and my intention is to use them till they run out to meander through my memories.  I'll not get to 60, but I want to see how it was.  And they better bring the dark nights back - permanent twilight just isn't the same in Darkshore.
---
They already said that they will probably not allow addons that automate gameplay and LFG tools. I agree that it would be nice to get more information, though.
---
It's kind of hard to discuss addons in classic wow though without knowing what exactly they are and aren't going to allow. I think most people are waiting on more information before discussing it.
---
And, where do I see the result ?
---
Counter argument, this is why you should not play on a pvp server unless you can go all hardcore, otherwise you'll be on the wrong end of the stick: https://youtu.be/AJPjiq-Hklo
---
Not for a Warlock.
---
Hi, /u/bdonvr
---
They literally had separate RP servers if you are into that kind of thing. For most the RPG aspcet is only going to mean that mages cannot wield 2h axes and hunters need quiver and ammo...

&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+10

Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+10 (# of days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Cheers!

I saw a prot pally on my server back in Vanilla with a Misplaced Servo Arm with fiery blaze enchant and he had Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom and the trinket from last boss of LBRS. I’m not sure how well these items scaled but I remember people claiming that they did in some capacity.
---
Yeah, id say thats the best way. Might be slightly worse in healing, but PI is the key here.
---
imo both seem pretty off. 30 days real time is damn fast and many people back then were not concerned about reaching level 60 in a rush. 30 days playtime however is reaaally taking your time. I remember it took me about 20, while dicking around a ton.
---
Yeah, for most of my buddies it's the same. However, they still play retail, so it's not because of the lack of gaming time... I'm sad..
---
[Chopin Op. 27, No. 1.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QAcAWWU_0mE)
---
If they don't have it at launch I am 99% sure it will be activated down the line regardless.
---
We had a tight core in vanilla :)
---
Couldnt agree more
---
Wall jumping next to the bank in Ironforge
---
I'd like to see some testing once we get a beta. Because spirit on most private servers compounds with itself. Meaning you get more per point the more you have.
---
It might turn out to be the *best* stat for warrs/rogues. Which would be hilarious given how dismissive everyone has been of it throughout the game's history.
---
Well if you're insane like me you'll have your no life plan already in place where your main is tailoring/herb, your alt will be mining/alch and your other alt will be eng/BS (paladin). Gotta have that factory mindset
---
I don't want to say the S-word
---
Speed levellers will be hitting 60 in 4-6 days RL time when Classic comes out
---
I did it at 70 so not legit at all and it was a real grind even when I could solo most of the silithus stuff. I think anyone who really thinks they're going to get this on classic is going to be in for a shock.
---
There are plenty of guns in vanilla, and Shredders are basically mech suits.
---
I'm not saying I want transmog in the game (I really don't), but your comparison is pretty funny.
---
I thought sharding will only be in starting zones? But what does that have to do with this?
---
I might have worded it wrong. What i meant was, there is absolutely no data about the playerbase because the playerbase doesn't exists. So we can look on private servers, or we can ask people on reddit with more information. But what if Classic only will have 76k players in total, all from this subreddit.
---
&gt; Nobody is jumping from lfr to mythic raiding for 5 ilevel upgrades
---
thats exactly the point
---
Well, there's a set bonus which is bonkers with a debuff slot, 8-piece T2. The issue is rarely there's enough hunters in the raid for it to keep a proper uptime. 
---
Another big issue in hunters' scaling are weapons. Not-that-great pre-raid options, then Rhok (high chance to obtain the leaf, being it hunter-only), BWL brings Ashjre'thul (hunter-only again, insanely good) but then... you won't see an upgrade weapon until the very last boss in the game.
---
Which is why it would be nice for them to give us more information. When it comes down to it Blizzard don't really understand the limitations they should put on their API, we've seen this before in WotLK and AVR only to have UnitPosition give us radars in WoD and then nameplate anchoring in legion. Also removing the ability to create LFG tools would cause collateral damage that breaks a lot of other things in the game.
---
Spell batching may help that issue
---
We will see
---
In pservers that's the average raiding guild, not hardcore. Actual hardcore is requiring alts for split raids and having everything prepared for next raid before it even opens etc. If you don't use consumables or wbuffs, that kind of guild doesn't even exist for longer than a month but if it existed I would call it casual guild.
---

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally created in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest corners of the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the Burning Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of the world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination for all your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events taking place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however that concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will often spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
😔
---
And flying mounts and lfr and class homogenisation.
---
True story
---
I agree that it would be nice to get more info on the API, but disagree that it will make much of an impact on who decides to play.
---
Fans of classic aren't all giddy about which addons they'll be able to use in classic.
---
I will be leveling and progressing at a fair pace but I intended to read and enjoy the original quests/lore and take in the originally sized Azeroth in all its glory.
---
If blizzard doesn’t fuck it up and streamers play, it should get good coverage and more players joining.
---
Was that a beta thing? I don't remember ever wearing mail on my rogue in vanilla
---
I cleared BWL in vanilla. I weren't a world class player by any means but still... I think people expecting to speed run the place in 30 mins or less may be in for a shock. 
---
That being said I would definitely watch a video of a guild doing that in Classic! :D
---
You can also have an alt to level or use on the AH if something comes up and he's delayed or can't get on. You should both do this as things can come up in your life, just like his. 
---
As the last poster mentioned, keeping as close as possible in XP to one another is absolutely crucial... And as far as quests go, never do one that the other didn't do (besides class quests). This is important for cohesion more than actual XP gain/leveling.
---
I think the cool thing about keeping bgs server locked is because more than often you'd fight people in bgs who you've seen/fought around in the open world and be grouped with people on **your** server. The obvious question is what will happen to servers with less players, thats up to blizzard to figure out.
---
The only thing you should ever worry about as a Warrior in terms of gear is your weapon DPS. If you regularly kite as well then you should also look into getting a high avg damage weapon.
---
Aside from that you shouldn't go out of your way to upgrade your gear regularly. Just keep the highest mitigation/spirit gear to minimize downtime, get agi/str on the side.
---
PvE is "competitive" in the same was speed running is, for an extremely small number of autists.  Just enjoy the game my dudes.
---
Im looking forward to/hoping that Ironforge becomes populated again. It was the first capital I ever got to and it blew my 15 year old mind, seeing dozens of people going about the business made it feel so alive, compared to the ghost town it is now.
---
Also a good argument for larger server sizes.
---
wow is fine, example wowhead.com
---
What has one to do with the other? 
---
Blizzard is well known for saying one thing and later on doing the opposite and some things like *we have no source code* were obvious BS for anybody who had a clue how IT works.
---
Druid specifically isn't nearly as gear dependand while leveling.
---
I made a list of items that are highly beneficial for Druids and guaruanteed from crafting and quests. There are also items in there that you will keep forever. It is not a complete list but it goes a long way:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd7m8b/druid\_leveling\_and\_lategame\_items\_list/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd7m8b/druid_leveling_and_lategame_items_list/)
---
Are you seriously planning to become unemployed for 6 months once WoW rolls out? IMO even working 4h per day would give you enough time to fully experience everything as one of the first people on the server, unless you plan to roll multiple characters.
---
hehe yeah and if you have multiple hunters with tier 2... you've mostly finished already.  I doubt I will be going beyond BWL, maybe AQ anyways!
---
Blizzard doesn't do releases like "oh game is out now, have fun". Take today's date, add 3 months, that's the BARE MINIMUM announcement headroom they will use, to build hype and have time for closed and open betas.
---
I wouldn't doubt an announcement for a fall release any time soon for this reason.
---
Kind of a shame. It looks like you put a good amount of effort into this, but the data that you collected was either wrong or misinterpreted, which makes this whole article petty pretty useless.
---
&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]
---
**Introduction**: We are an Australian based guild, with a few others around the world in our time zone. We welcome anyone who will be playing Classic Wow as an Alliance character. 
---
**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs](https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs)
---
**Realm** : Oceanic (realm TBA once the list is available)
---
**Realm Type**: PVP
---
**Faction**:  Alliance
---
**Region**: AUS - Oceanic
---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: Loot council.
---
**Raiding Times**:  Weekends and some week nights - Again not set in stone but more than likely 6pm-12pmish. At the moment there looks to be multiple raids due to numbers. We will not restrict classes until after launch
---
**Intention**: We prioritize raiding and dungeons, PVP is secondary but will still be promoted.
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Standard Non-Harassment Rules.  Just try to be respectful of the guild, have fun but not at someone else's expense. 
---
\*You don't need to be a raider to join either, while some of us will be taking time off at launch from work, many of us promote a work life balance especially those with families (myself included). If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
Friends, help please! I am looking for pictures with all class spell list according to the levels of gain. I saw such a picture here, but I can not find it again. Maybe someone can help find it.   
---
Thank you in advance! )  
---
ps: I'm getting ready for the classic, I want to understand who I want to play: dru \\ pall=)
---
The video specifically uses the word "competitive" in its title, not "challenging".
---
If you're just an average raider, you're not going to be involved in any competitive aspect of raiding anyway.
---
Tips is notoriously wrong about basically everything. Don't listen to a word he says.
---
Warriors have it so hard and then later they have it so easy. 
---
Tempted to roll one again, but because of the time investment involved in Classic WoW I'm experiencing choice paralysis lol
---
It's not been specifically stated yes or no yet but the answer is *probably*: they were around in 1.12 and 1.12 is the patch Classic will run on.
---
So Blizzard haven't explicitly said yes or no about it, but the patch they're using as the base for Classic had cross-realm BGs in it.
---
"Another issue players reported was that Warlock demon summoning was broken – lots of players said that you shouldn’t lose your current demon until the new one appears. We double-checked and in the original 1.12 WoW, and there, as soon as you started summoning a new demon, your existing demon disappeared. So the demo actually matched how the game played originally."

---
Yeah, it's a beta thing. In the beta Rogues and Hunters could both use smaller shields called bucklers as well, but that never made it to live of course.
---
GW2 has both speedrun and low-man (unofficial) leaderboards for dungeons and raids. Both are pretty fun and could apply to Classic as well.
---
Mage water no longer can be traded to other players.

God mages would have the life then.

When thinking about an answer to the question of why bfa is so bad, I realized that a lot that I don't like about it also existed in Legion, so how was Legion so great when bfa is so bad? 
---
But I think you nailed it, Legion just had better design, more of an epic feel, feeling of importance, etc.
---
Man, classic is going to be epic. I hope they have RP-PVP server.
---
Blizzards servers would melt. So sad a third party private server project can handle these massive battles but a Billion dollar company can't.
---
You're arguing with people who are threatened by the mere notion of a competitive/tryhard aspect existing in a game they play, and lash out at content creators for being part of that scene. 
---
Don't expect much from reddit comments.
---
He means "S-hopefully not"
---
Got you fam.
---
Basic set up (assuming no Shadow Priest, no special fight etc. Horde)
---
1) Tank Group w Shaman and Imp-Warlock
---
2) Melee Groups combinations (Rogues/Warriors with Shaman and/or Hunter and/or Feral Druid). 
---
3) Warlock Group with Shaman (Tranquil Air totem). Some raids underestimate this.. but as good warlocks damage is mostly threat capped, -20% aggro means 20% more damage.
---
4) Caster Groups with Shaman (Mana tide etc). You can also put a boonkin here if you fancy.
---
Special: Hunter Group with Shaman Agi totem\^\^
---
There are a lot of interesting things in the campaign that I forgot:
---
* Ner'zul being secretly against the Legion from the start
---
* Tyrande freeing Illidan against the will of Furion
---
* The first encounter between Illidan and Arthas
---
* Timmy

Problem solved :)

Graphical remake of WC3.
---
Damn, I remember when TBC pre-patch game with all those new talents. It was so exciting to try new different things.
---
That feel is completely gone from the game from the abomination they call "talent tree" now.
---
I'd rather spend that one talent point for 1% crit for Immolate or something crazy than the current system.
---
What would the removal of LFG creation affect? I'm genuinely curious.
---
If ye dislike our lasses it probably be cause' ye cannae handle the \*thiccness\*. And if ye cannae handle thiccness, ye assure me ye cannae handle yer drink either.

I don't want tae speak tae to no one who cannae do either.

Indeed.. thanks to Diablo 2 and WoW I saved lots of money during my teenage years and early 20's. :D

Plus battle res, everyone invites the battle rezzer
---
Yeah this was nice on some encounter iirc. Saved. Burst for it 2
---
i'm pretty sure ones that do spell damage (e.g. doom bringer, fiery weapon, NOT rend's doomsaw) do scale, but at a reduced rate.  shadow oil should also scale
---
i was planning to play a holy/reck pala with a focus on spell damage and reckoning.  spell damage definitely affects seal of righteousness!!  if you have a decent amount of +dmg and a few reckoning stacks you can be doing a 2k damage swing without even getting any crits.  Add shadow oil and consec on top of that and you're putting out a surprising amount of damage
---
people think big crits are all that matters in vanilla but shadow priests never did big crits and they'll kill you VERY fast and easily.  if you were pvp'ing with that holy/reck spec you could be dishing out heals and then dropping a bomb every so often
---
i did some testing on a p server and there was a 1h axe with a 75 damage life stealing proc that was damaging and healing me for like 350  (though it didnt proc often) but i think the scaling was probably wrong on that.  it was like 100% lol
---
I was under the impression that the game will just be run on a modified version of the current Retail client.
---
I may have just missed the boat on this, but where is this Frankenpatch idea coming from?

Favorite was hardware store, I know it's not a specific song but I always liked the video https://youtu.be/Chc9DwDkWn0

There have been several cases where people have been forced to give up their domain ownership due to copyright infrigement. E.g a popular one is [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_v._MikeRoweSoft). If you profit from their trademark and Blizzard wants you gone,  there's not that much you can do.

**Microsoft v. MikeRoweSoft**
---
Microsoft vs. MikeRoweSoft was a legal dispute between Microsoft and a Canadian Belmont High School student  named Mike Rowe over the domain name "MikeRoweSoft.com". Microsoft argued that their trademark had been infringed because of the phonetic resemblance between "Microsoft" and "MikeRoweSoft".The case received international press attention following Microsoft's perceived heavy-handed approach to a 12th grade student's part-time web design business and the subsequent support that Rowe received from the online community. A settlement was eventually reached, with Rowe granting ownership of the domain to Microsoft in exchange for an Xbox and additional compensation.

I do enjoy osrs but have slowly moved away as it becomes more and more easier with "qol" updated that just buff everything and that pvp is not all that active outside of streamer events. I find myself fighting the same 20 people over and over again. 
---
I feel the majority in that game currently is against the ethos that got the game back up and running. 
---
For these reasons im worried that people from the current wow will play and vote for things like xmog, tokens, shorter hs cooldown and any other dud idea that the changes camp offers on this subreddit daily. 
---
Im not concerned blizzard will ruin their game. Im worried the people not keen on walking for 40 levels will ruin the game as they have current wow.
---
The people who can actually speedrun raids aren't going to even bother with you if you're not interested in doing so.
---
My experience playing on pservers was very reminiscent of actual vanilla. 
---
Most of the time I played with people who didn't even know the dungeons/quests, and were very friendly and social. Very rarely did I encounter the "tryhards", and when I did they usually just carried the group without saying much.
---
This isn't like retail where everything is a competitive numbers game, where everyone sims and has to beat timers/enrages constantly. Vanilla hardcore guilds are isolated cliques, and you won't interact with them outside of a random UBRS run unless you choose to.
---
Zugas from Eitrigg Helios ?
---
Feeding my pet to make it happy and using eagle eyes to watch ranfom things. One of my favorite hunter spell !
---
enjoy the quests - dont just finish them for the sake of xp, actually have a look at the quest text.  not all, but quite a lot of them are interesting and some of them lead to a really cool chain of events and you don't know which ones will give you awesome rewards down the line
---
explore the world.  there's hidden things all over, like vendors and extra quests
---
run every dungeon on your way up.  they're fun, easy xp and money, and the best way to meet people and make friends/find guilds
---
try to keep your profession at a reasonable level as you go (its 5 skill levels per character level) as its a bit easier to farm mats while you're leveling rather than going back at 60.  its faster at 60, but its also more boring
---
i would also say try to level reasonably quickly because a lot of other players will be leveling quickly these days.  when i first played wow it took me forever to get to 60, and you might miss out on some opportunities if you take that long!  basically just kill everything in your path and maybe focus on the RP more once you hit max level
---
joining a guild is super worth it, even if you dont stick with it forever.  you'll get quest buddies, help with questions, easier dungeon groups, freebies and mates rates etc
---
That ain't exactly a quick fix. It one of the worst grindes of the game.
---
probably not while playing but if you fake your country for a lower subscription fee or something it can get you banned
---
When i leveled up my first character in vanilla i bought a lv 50 epic because i couldnt hold back the epic hype anymore. And strangers gave me so much shit for it "waste of gold" "will be useless at max lv" etc. They were right of course. But fuck it, i loved it anyway!
---
How do you pronounce VPN? Vee Pee Ann?

Or do you pronounce ban like ben?
---
Talents
---
And its worth noting that you need to feed them constantly in the beginning until their loyalty bumps a few notches.
---
There is no competitive PvP in vanilla. Everything would have to be created and maintained by players. You'd have to have admins watch people play and update some ranking in an unofficial website etc. You'd have to make a ton of people agree and care that this is the official website for tracking competitive pvp.
---
At best you can have premade vs premade but those players will be forfeitting their ranking because dodging is far more efficient honor. On top of that, they can play the best they want for fun but deep down they know it's really just an unranked match not tracked anywhere which makes it unsustainable format for competition.
---
Does your Rogue also want his Buckler back?
---
My boy!  Look what they did to my boy!
---
Cant wait to run SM constantly.  Used to love farming GY as a priest while I waited for groups to form.
---
I had the opposite thought. If they were to put in achievements, which I don't feel *too* strong opposed to, I'd only want them for the most basic things. Level 60, dungeon/raid completion, exploration achievements. I think the other achievements like do x thing in y scenario in z zone it lame because it was only made as achievement fodder and doesn't feel organic. But you raise a good point too so I changed my mind to not wanting achievements at all.
---
If this is how you choose to go, try to not let the not-insignificant percentage of players who will bite your head off for "slowing them down" (or some such bollocks) get to you.
---
I am so glad i quit when BC launched.
---
This sounds like complete ass.
---
I already had that rule in Classic that I NEVFER buy Gear from the AH while leveling. That hasn't changed. I need every fucking Gold I can get while leveling to get my Mount and Spells.
---
Blizzard doesn't sell gold. A player gives you gold for blizzard balance. Yes you can still buy gold, but Blizzard isn't selling you the gold. They are just giving you something for real money that you can then trade for gold. It really isn't a terrible system. It wouldn't work in classic, but it works in retail where the only things gold can really buy you is game time and cosmetics.
---
Pro-tip, if you don't want to play with sharding on, play on an RP server. I forget if they have sharding turned off completely or just turned down wayyyyyu low but RP servers still keep an inkling of that server community.
---
Blizzard shouldn't even allow voting for such things
---
Lol i cant wait for the scrubs to pull Greenskin from the topdeck and have the whole ship come with him.
---
Its gonna bring back so many memories.
---
...and repair bills
---
A holy warrior, devout and noble. A true hero, yes, but a humble one who cares for the downtrodden and is not above aiding those who cannot adequately repay. A compassionate friend to the sick and a generous helper of the needy. A wielder of powerful, blessed weapons who is adorned with gleaming, well-polished armor. A fearless crusader who, atop valorous steed, delivers justice and will not rest until the forces of evil are scoured from the land!
---
Retribution Paladin! For the Light! For the Alliance!
---
Still works amazingly for twink Druid flag carriers though!
---
I wish the Remaster would come out before Classic. I preordered it straight away.
---
The best thing is if you give them braids they will move while casting spells.
---
I was on the Alliance side during that battle.  Good times.
---
Having a set of the whale for between pulls would probably save you a lot of money on food if it doesn't turn out to be terrible.
---
Much better to go enhancement and save all mana for interrupts and heals. If he levels as elemental pre 40-45 he will do almost nothing for the group damage. He needs to save mana for healing and he needs to drink almost every pull. This will slow you down alot. Better to go enhancement and use rockbiter or flame tung for most of his dps. This will make it so that he can heal after/before pulls and then not use mana for the 5 second regen rule while fighting
---
I feel like the only people who talk about rose tinted glasses are the ones who don't play private servers lol
---
Lol one Im on has a stack going for close to 3g.
---
Farmin them boomkins in darkshore all day!
---
You can't just out and out buy resist gear my man.
---
That is the worst grind in the Game. I did it after they nerfed it in TBC, before that it was ridiculous!
---
No, VPNs are fine.
---
They get outdated too quickly, and cartoon style game like wow is timeless
---
Aaaaand /gkick wenturi
---
No glamour so I can tell immediately how well a player is geared.
---
Our guild IT'er are wanting to know aswell. They plan on creating a custom version of DKP. But coding takes time and once classic is out they rather play than write code.
---
So to give all the addon developers some time beforehand by Blizzard releasing there stand on addons and API's would be nice.
---
1g?  Them aint vanilla prices.
---
I hope it won’t! I am currently in China and my Ping to all wow server regions is awful. I tried all.  Yesterday I tried a European Vpn and voila: constant 500ping meaning just a little delay but it is totally fine for me. 
---
Should be ready for classic now :)
---
Will be middle of winter in New Zealand. I’m absolutely fizzing to hermit crab my evenings away and battle to 60. Goodbye gym, social life and I hope my body is ready for the unhealthy amounts of Red Bull I will consume in the mornings at work when I couldn’t get away from the screen and trying to adult on few hours sleep.
---
BUT WHY DID THE RAPTORS HAVE IT!?
---
You ask us like any of us work at Blizzard and only now decide to make this announcement on your reddit thread...
---
Most people don't speedrun to 60, so you can't really say "garbage", since they don't compete. For those who want to level fast anything above 7d is "garbage" though with all the knowledge we have now.
---
imo taking it this seriously when you haven't played classic is a bit of a crime.  part of the fun is in learning and figuring it out for yourself!!  look at your holy talents, figure out what stats will be best for you!  learn the feel of your class as your play it in dungeons and while leveling, see how hard you can push limits.  tweak your gear once you hit 60 to find stuff that works for you.  Personally i disagree with cookie cutter BiS lists for some classes/specs, i play my own game.
---
last time i played i was a resto druid and i had a handful of items that aren't considered BiS but really saved my ass a few times - eg this world drop epic robe that had a use ability which gave you mana back every 15 mins.  On legacy logs I was one of the top druids on the server for MC even though I didn't use the normal spec, and i didn't use the recommended spells of spell ranks.  cookie cutter stuff is usually based on sitting afk and press 1 button without being interrupted - this is not how the game plays in practice.  Sometimes that 2 second regrowth with a massively high chance to crit is going to save your MT where that 2.5 healing touch will not
---
dire maul isn't out til phase 2 i think so dont worry about those items straight away.  they'll be nice upgrades after a while though
---
having some fire resist helps in MC, but is generally not very important for the ranged dps and healers.  fire protection potions are a must since they aren't too expensive.
---
with spell ranking there is generally 1 particular rank that is most efficient.  you want to be trying to maximise the amount of healing you can do while not going OOM on a fight - e.g. if you can cast 40 flash of light over the course of 3 minutes and JUST go OOM as a boss dies then that is better than casting 35 higher rank ones that leave you OOM with 30 seconds more boss to kill.  
---
I don't know if you vary the ranks on paladins as much but on my druid i was upranking and downranking constantly depending on what needed doing.  a lot of healers just spam and they overheal and waste mana on unnecessary healing but if you're paying attention (which is a lot more fun than just spamming anyway) you can be much more efficient.  For a while I was using rank 1 heals a lot because we had the old itemisation and there was this green off-hand which made rank 1 heal cost 0 mana!!  it healed a pitiful amount but because it was free i could get the '5 second rule' and regen mana.  it was great during progress raids when fights were longer and we had poorer gear and would go OOM.
---
as for consumables i wouldn't worry too much unless you join a guild that aims to clear content super fast.  You just want the cheap/easy stuff like mana pots, demonic runes, food buffs and of course fire protection.  If you can afford flasks its nice for things like your first night trying to take down ragnaros or whatever but it's a luxury
---
basically I say take the established ideas on board but play your own game!
---
I know it's TBC, but still suitable.
---

---
Not petty at all. Substantial.
---
Im rolling two of these for Classic, both main and one of the alts :)
---
We have to see. In retail if server laggs they just makes the shards smaller. Can't do that in classic. 
---
So I hope they are prepared for some 40v40 open world battles. They know its coming.
---
I am not familiar with GW2, is this what you mean https://www.speedrun.com/gw2? Maybe I don't know how to use the website but seems like a total ghost town.
---
Ah OK thanks, a bit like the key ring.
---
It's not like you have a lot of mounts in Vanilla, in fact just having one mount is an achievement in itself \^\^
---
The first blue chest you can craft with smithing.  Ironforge Breastplate.
---
God I feel like such a baller every time.
---
can you imagine if you were a classic dev and you frequent this sub, and you're seeing how much time and effort people are putting into discussing release dates
---
and you're sitting there just WISHING you could put their minds at ease and tell them the preliminary targeted date, but you can't because of an NDA or whatever
---
**[Crab Bucket]** is an **EU Alliance** 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent auction, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.
---
https://discord.gg/qN9ywMy
---
Well yea sure but it's wrong to present it as accurate information without explaining the bias. But what if Classic only will have 2 players in total, all from this subreddit?
---
Selling these wow tokens has been really smart finacially.
---
If 100 people play wow and buy gametime for thereself. They make 13 x 100 = 1300 euro.
---
If 50 people buys tokens and sell them to the other 50 guys.
---
Than 50 people pay 13 euro for there month. But the other half pays 20 euro ( price of a token ).
---
So the same amount of players bring in lots more money.
---
50x13 = 650
---
50x20 = 1000
---
Total 1650 instead of 1300.
---
Same amound of people. But with lots more profit.
---
Paladins are alliance only.
---
AOE won't be a thing at release due to overpopulation.
---
If you stay horde dual boxing : warrior + shaman (windfurry here I come !!!!!!!!!)
---
If you are a traitor ( :o ) : warrior + paladin (way less DPS than the horde combo, but all the other combos will be sub optimal while dual boxing imo)
---
Some people had quite a few back in the days, personally, I'd mostly rotate the PvP mounts. But yeah, it's not like they're taking up a lot of space, should be gucci without a mount journal.

Retail
---
Bad
---
Is there a question?
---
Allakhazam, that's something I haven't heard in a long time.
---
Can you post a image? Just curious if its cool to have
---
There are a lot of retail surveys that count any satisfaction after a store visit / customer purchase below 8/10 as a bad experience ! It’s interesting how some data is used
---
And as a newcomer you can get the weaker consumables for dirt cheap which is still miles better than not having any.
---
I love this. You actually tried to min-max your leveling but failed to do the math or test your assumptions. For a 10 y/o doing that would be way too much to ask though.
---
But people still do this mistake in a lot of aspects of the game. One of those things is consumables. For speedrun guilds it absolutely makes sense to run raids in full consumables. But in terms of overall efficiency it doesn't seem right to farm that much stuff.
---
There are some really powerful and gold efficient consumables such as mana potions, some decent elixirs and some of the food buffs that should always be brought. But full or nearly full consumables will increase the farming time of everyone by **hours** per raid, while only cutting down the actual raid time by a couple of minutes.
---
I'am personally of the opinion that most consumables should be used on a case by case basis. For example on bosses that actually are gear checks. Raiding in a good guild should be smooth, but anything that speeds up the raid beyound that has to actually be efficient in terms of time spent overall. There is basically nobody who knows wether that is the case with some of the expensive consumables like +spelldamage flasks, mongoose, jujus etc.
---
With world buffs this is another story, because they are incredibly powerful and the invested time and is very low. It is more of an organisational overhead.
---
I played on Nostalrius launch with no sharding or dynamic spawns. People really exaggerate how bad it was. It's almost as if they haven't experienced a big launch without sharding or dynamic spawns yet think they're an expert on the subject.
---
Because you played fked up retail, not Classic.
---
Yes i will be against that, most i can agree to is simple 3 year seasonal resets. Then again its my opinion, and here lies the problem, every one has an opinion and that's the problem.
---
LoL! I wondered the same thing.
---
Hi, I played on Nostalrius which had a massive launch population with no sharding or dynamic spawns. It only took about 2 hours for Durotar to calm down to the point where you could progress. I'm not sure where you're getting this "weeks" figure from.
---
I’m pretty sure this is a question.
---
Yeah till your like me, got so high forgot to toggle between pulls tanked half of a strat UD in spirit gear wondering why im squishy as shit
---
Stam + Spirit set FTW
---
Still ugly lol
---
Right now my only consideration was to implement this type of search for Classic, since there is a large audience for it and it’s the only non-retail version of wow officially supported by blizzard.
---
I would not be opposed to opening up the search to include retail data, but doing a breakout for other expansions is a low priority. I want classic search to be “finished” first
---
You knew what Sharding was yesterday according to your comment (Also, account created yesterday), and now you refer to it as;
---
&gt; Whilst questing and helping a dude out (whilst not being in a party), they suddenly just dissapeard out of no-where.  
---
Come on man, theres enough fabricated rage over on r/wow , we dont need to do that here do we? I'm on the hypetrain myself, but there are better ways to be excited than to needlessly shit on retail.
---
If you always dislike the music you liked say 10 years ago then you're just continually going through phases. Just because you no longer like the type of music you once did doesn't mean others should also dislike it or that it was "shitty".
---
Yeah the wow token is perfect in a game where gold doesn't really buy you any advantages. I kind of wish we had something comparative for classic but being able to buy gold in classic would just have much harsher affects. Being able to buy PvP gear or making achievements like an epic mount much less impactful for everyone just isn't worth it.
---
Eh, people definitely competed in handicap raids. Onyxia especially was downed with progressiveky fewer people. 
---
This will absolutely happen again
---
All noted. And thank you for input.
---
1) I understand the frustration with having to type the whole name, and want to move away from that. But there are some challenges with partial entry. I do have this suggestion added to my backlog though and will try my best.
---
2) yeahhh, I’m no graphic designer and am wary of using any Blizzard art in my iconography. If you know of someone or you yourself have some suggested icons to make for it I am all ears haha.
---
of the top of my head , frost mages and warlocks.
---
Ret paladins would say that

results where
---
Earning gold is part of the progression. In retail gold is not usefull, its only cosmetic.
---
I need a date....
---
Not with her no gimme release date or give me death!
---
Never said it won't happen at all...
---
The headline makes it sound like there is no other purpose in raiding.
---
Well, you said no one ever competed in handicap raids, but that's not true
---
Like anyone of us actually goes outside.. come on
---
Well, wont be playing wow for much of the summer as it will probably come out late august/early september by how things are looking..
---
Retail itself is not that bad, but its not classic. Where are paladin's seals, blessings different auras?? Why do you suddently have lower mana with ret and wtf is holy power.
---
I wish retail was as challenging as classic, group quests actually needed a group, elites would be elites. Leveling would be fun and people would talk to you and whatnot.
---
Classic can't come soon enough, i want to get exited about getting a blue item and doing dungeons and quests in the world.
---
If you take what I said out of conrtext and as literally as possible I guess that's true. But you should read it in the context of the comment I'm replying to.
---
Clever, Sir. Take my upvote, NOW! :)
---
Hey, people who buy small upgrades off the AH, don't listen to this post. You keep spending your hard earned gold on those gains.
---
Signed, someone who sells that gear and can afford his mount at 40.
---
Depends where your VPN server is located for example I'm using one in my own country so the lag is virtually nonexistent but other than that you're right it can afffect it.
---
I just find it cringey thats all, but thats just my opinion.
---
Its reasons like this that I still say Vanilla WoW was the most casual friendly iteration of the game. You could play at whatever pace you wanted.
---
Cant be worse than horny 16 yr old me.
---
Started in 05 didnt hit max level til after TBC
---
It depends when these stats are from. It was only about a year ago when they discovered that exp rates were based on TBC and not vanilla, meaning servers like Nostalrius had boosted leveling times.
---
For example, my first time ever playing vanilla WoW was on Nostalrius. It took me about 7-8 days played and I was playing a Warrior with zero knowledge of the game outside of Joana's guide.
---
Then I played a popular private server that launched with the fixed exp rates. I played the same race/class and I had much better knowledge of the game. This time it took me about 11 days played, and I was semi-rushing to 60 at the time. I was skipping dungeons, PvP, etc.
---
I could easily see more casual players take 15-20 days to hit 60.
---
Hm? Someone said they hope undermanning becomes the way to go for competitive pve. You said that was never a thing. 
---
It was a thing.
---
It will be a thing.
---
Not sure why you use words then say to not believe the words you're using.
---
Burning Crusade was great, best raids imo. WotLK was fun but everything was very easy in comparison.
---
I lost my enthusiasm when Cata launched. I quit like a week into it
---
Even complete ghosttown servers will have people there :D
---
For me there was never other spirits. Just a passing level 60 who decided he wanted to say I dont get to have fun today.
---
Pve server for life
---
Doubt it.
---
Classic beta isnt out yet.
---
I'm planning to take two weeks off work. Hopefully I can do it in that time if I put in effort, or at least close.
---
&gt; I wish the Remaster would come out before Classic.
---
Originally they stated Reforged comes out during summer. But we haven't heard anything concrete yet, so it might be slipping :(
---
That was changed way way way later. This method was used to boost athene to world first lvl80.
---
&gt; Garbage and inefficient? We had so much fun fooling around. 
---
And that's the truth.  I've got 7 WoW tokens I'm hoping to cash in, and I'm going to be taking my sweet time over it, same as I did back in '04.  I may get to L60, but possibly not.  I don't care.  I just want to go back to Stranglethorn Vale and pretend to be Robinson Crusoe, I want to time myself running in travel form from Darkshore to Tanaris to compare myself to a L40 mount and so on.
---
It may be sad nostalgia for an increasingly geriatric guy, but what the hell, bring it on!
---
Darude - Sandstorm
---
I would like TBC after classic :)
---
Yes.
---
Pre 1.12 version is OP in PvE because of the raid debuff, and the 1.12 version is OP in PvP because of the 2100 armorpen oneshots
---
we don't know yet.
---
They are already much more popular on private servers than they ever were in retail vanilla. Part of me hopes the player base has grown up enough by now to get over "lol fat chick".
---
Pussy
---
&gt; Hm? Someone said they hope undermanning becomes the way to go for competitive pve. You said that was never a thing.
---
I have not said anything about what was a thing. I am only saying what will become a thing. I didn't say someone won't try to underman onyxia or whatever.  Just that it isn't going to be part of the competitive pve scene like firsts and speedruns, because the nature of it isn't anywhere near as interesting to most people.
---
That's really hardcore.
---
Shadowmeld the Flag in Wsg aim shot the sorry bastard But youre druid.
---
Enough said
---
Thanks for that - it looks like I'm looking at playing 8-10 hours a week to be on my schedule for playing for 7 months.  I can do that.
---
Don't worry guys. I leveled on Nost (I am pretty sure XP values are the same) and casually got a warrior to 40 in no time. Time's change. We're a lot better now and if you struggle on something you look it up in a heartbeat and not on cryptic devices like Thottbot.   
---
I even got a 60 paladin to help me with the axe quest. It was fucking glorious.
---
Wow it amazes me that all of the extra things would be terrible for classic except guild banks and starter zone sharding. Pretty much anything else are things I wouldn't like at all.
---
I'am personally indifferent on itemizatin though. I think the plan they are going with is the perfect balance: release the items in their fixed state but add them when they were added roughly back then.
---
Thats why i hate permadeath challenges. It's all about playing in the most slow and boring fashion, instead of constantly being worried about dying which is what I guess is the way it's intended
---
as a horde player, when I found out about the wetlands, a contested lv 20ish zone and I was a lv 40 mage I couldnt ever leave the place...
---
Getting revenge was so sweet, I would maybe get 2 levels every few days just to get new ranks and rush back to gank.
---
&gt; On a scale from 1: “Over my dead body” to 5: “Indifferent” and 10: “This is a MUST” how do you feel about the follow topics?
---
I set a lot of 0, thinking it would be the most "nope" I could say, but I realize that the instructions don't say what 0 means. You really should not leave stuff like that ambiguous.
---
I like them. They stand up straight, they're blue, skinny, one pretty face everyone uses, decent casting animations.
---
Probably going troll shammy.
---
Do transferring server and opening it count? \*shy smile\*
---
Shadowmeld doesn't affect stealth, does it?
---
It is unfortunate that he didn't tell us what 0 means, yet still allows us to set it as an answer.
---
I had a female Orc Warrior in BC/WOTLK. Loved her. Tempted to roll her again, but the vanilla leveling experience for them scares me a bit. Tempted to just roll a priest or something for an easy ride to 60
---
Yeah it's also for fun and nostalgia.
---
I will try when I get it!
---
I do absolutely care. Classic is a social game. Helping someone out who is in the for the long run is something entirely different than helping out a retail achievement hunter.
---
Yeah it is neat and nostalgia. Obviously online databases are superior.
---
My first Mage in the first few months of vanilla was about /played 11 days or so. My next was around 9 or 10. I hope to do it in 9 or 10 again, heavily utilising rested exp bonuses.
---
I believe it's actually the TBC one with the old world in it as well.
---
It does.
---
I believe it's the TBC one with the old world in it as well.
---
You can do whatever you want. I plan to do mining and herbalism just to make gold.
---
When it comes to PvP... purge wants a word.
---
[Sure does!](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20580/shadowmeld)
---
OP never said he didn’t know what sharding was. Simply described it as what it is (players suddenly disappearing out of no-where.
---
The thing is they easily could, but they do not want to invest more money each month to provide it.
---
Yeah, same reason for me. But mostly how big difference the pvp will be without engineering, and PvE without BS.
---
I really hope there will be 0 retail incentives to play classic. For one it would hurt the classic community because of an influx of tourists that will later whine on the forums because they want X or Y be more convienent and it would also hurt the retail community because it would heavily dillute the non-obtainable rewards.
---
I'm going to Winterfell for the tiger.  See you in 2020...
---
He also doesn't say what 0 means, yet we are able to enter 0 as an answer.
---
EU, PvP Server, Horde, Druid.
---
Going all-in for the first 3 weeks. After that I have like 4 hours a day with open hours on weekends. (GMT +1)
---
Looking for a Guild to do hardcore pvp and some semihardcore raiding. Got a lot of experience on private servers on the vanilla side of things (cleared content up to BWL until nost closedown, did rank 12,...) , and a lot of exp on retail (duelist, hoth with over 1k rated RBGs...)
---
Hit me up with a PM and we can get into contact on discord.
---
&gt;Speedrunning is just essentially runs that you can potentially do every single week.
---
It's true that the retail world firsts are a lot more hype, that's probably because it takes retail guilds several days if not weeks of intense raiding to clear it, that's a lot of content and a lot of hype.
---
For vanilla it will all be cleared fast by top guilds, but i do wanna say that Darkmoonfaire and other seasonal world buffs actually makes a difference here, the perfect speedrun want these extra buffs which does put a time limit on it, not just every week.
---
What dailies where that if I may ask, because I can’t remember doing much
---
There were the factions to get the Nether Ray and the Nether drake, and then they added a faction with dailies with sunwell. Those are the only ones I remember
---
I raided back in TBC, and I only remember doing the nether drake quests on my main. So unless I remember wrong, those dailies weren’t close to must do
---
Troll for PvE
---
Undead for PvP
---
I don't know about Alchemy on warriors. I see no problems with it as you can make a fuckton of money with the right recipes. It's also not unhandy for leveling as a warrior as you have no other source of healing yourself during an encounter. Blacksmithing can do the same of course, especially when gearing up for raids and I don't know which crafted armour is BoP.
---
Engineering is basically a must-have for everyone who wants to do serious PVPing. Bombs are also not to be overlooked in AOE tanking.
---
Sharding prevents this kind of thing by the way, as do small server sizes because blizzard does not want to invest into more expensive infrastructure.
---
Mom!... I mean Dear! More hotpockets!
---
No sir.
---
You obviously didn‘t play classic back then. Everything was a hunter weapon if the dmg was good enough or it looked cool.
---
Classic
---
Tbh from how people describe retail it does not seem bad, just not how vanilla is designed. And its perfectly okay.
---
It doesn't define what 0 means, yet 0 is also an accepted answer. It looks like 1 may be the most "nope" answer you can give. 0 could be even more "nope" than 1, or it could be "I have no opinion", and we have no way to know.
---
I like the outside in the summertime in Denmark, usually.
---
My level has doubled since the last time we met, Rogue
---
Playing a rogue so you can pickpocket stockades over and over for 50 gold in an afternoon.
---
A great man once told me that it doesn't matter how fast you get somewhere, if you just end up dying as soon as you get there.
---
Spend your gold on spells and gear, people.
---
Thanks for the input. I'm not really into tanking, but love the fury playstyle. I do love PvP, but I kind of want alchemy for the moneymaking and the pots for myself and so on.   
---
I can perhaps ditch herbalism and have engineering/alchemy later on when the gearing phase is over? And have alt toons with herb instead? Or is that dumb?
---
Ignore bitches and acquire raid clears.
---
Depends on the server and dynamic respawns. Some mob farms will be down right crippled if blizz don't implent dynamic spawns like we see on private servers.
---
I do think 4 days played is possible but with some luck and being ahead of the curve all the time. Can't imagine what shape you personally would be in after that binge though
---
Choice paralysis. 
---
Undecided between Shaman, Priest, Warrior, or Warlock.
---
I played a lock in Vanilla and a Shaman in BC and a Warrior in BC/WOTLK. 
---
This shit is hard.
---
Majoly.
---
Bro they said its sharding for starting zones for the first couple weeks. JFC.
---
The second you would see wow combat with "real life" graphics you would die from laughter and not play the game ever again.
---
+1 of a stat being huge
---
Gg getting a item that is not even on the loot table untill 1.6
---
It's pretty obvious he's stirring trouble with this post, he just so happens to bullet point every controversial wow change in his first "on off" weekend of playing since vanilla 
---
OP a RPing troll
---
Something like LFG is basically completely tied to the foundation of the game, the ability to read/send messages to players along with the ability to interact with players. The legion version of the game has the entire process automated, in BFA it was moved to requrie a manual input from the player. There's almost no way for Blizzard to remove the ability to create an LFG tool unless they break a lot of things or limit a lot of things, which is why some kinda of blue post would be really nice.
---
Some say the passive increase is equivalent to 1 character level.
---
I don’t know why, but I’m mostly excited for the old Westfall map. I always had the best time there, questing, grinding etc. I actually remember shedding a tear after visiting Westfall for the first time after Cataclysm because I was so sad
---
It is, eventually towards the end of the game when you have best in slot gear. I personally value the threat management tools other DPS classes have over just raw numbers.
---
But Warriors are pretty much the kings of Vanilla when you're all geared up.
---
No that is what a lot of my  friends did back during classic. If you have the time, it makes sense. Can take some time to not forget about cooldowns etc though. 
---
Don't forget it costs a lot of time to additionally level up that 1-2 twinks as they ideally should reach level 50-60 too , else you can't get all the mats you need. For solo farming you can create a rogue and stealth around without much fighting.
---
What you most likely can't do is buying mats as you need most of your gold for raiding
---
And we coulda been playing with him on official classic but youuuu gotta play on NA smh josh
---
I don't think they need a beta. 
---
My guess is that they'll have an "open beta" to see how many people are interested in playing to be prepared for the release.
---
Automating sending messages is a lot different than having a UI that tells you everyone that's looking for the same dungeom/quest or automatically grouping you with those around you doing the same quest.
---
Don't worry about it. Unless you're in a guild that forces you to go engineering you should go with whatever you want, and if you change your mind there's always that remove profession button. Blacksmithing is not a necessity for a warrior in vanilla wow, only in Tbc. Besides, sharpening stones are usually pretty cheap on the auction house.
---
5man dungeons not being an AOE fest. I think that came with WOTLK, and really really hate it they since then. Loved vanilla/BC 5 man dungeons
---
I know, I’ve brought shame to my country!
---
Oh lol, I didn't even realise that. I put '1' on things I absolutely wouldn't like. Thanks!
---
Just curious, but those who say that ppl will do it under 20 days, what do you all reccon players daily played is?
---
Cause 4-5 days played then you know what you are doing and speed running.
---
Personally I think most will not be high-schoolers that can dump 12-16 hours in the game daily, more like 3 hours.
---
So let's say you spend 3 hours a day levling, that would be more like 40 days + irl time if you know what you are doing.
---
I think its fair to say that the general playerbase will cap in 1-2 months and not 2 weeks
---
+5 to stealth checks. Basically worth 2 points of master of deception in subtlety talent tree for a comparison.
---
Yeah, I had a female orc Warrior and a Rogue for this exact reason. I dont like their casting animations but for melee I'm a lady Orc all the way.
---
The plural of "dwarf" is "dwarves".
---
Ppl mostly roll humans because thats what they identify with.
---
NE because, badass glowing eyes and 7feet tall (females for extra gold income, mailbox dancing)
---
and lastly ppl roll gnome for the funny character.
---
Dwarves... just, not a lot of ppl identify with them and when it comes to female dwarf just even less.
---
We used to have a female dwarf priest in vanilla which was hilarious with the pigtal spell animation but other than that they were just very rare.
---
TL;DR I dont think people hate them, just nobody really identifies with them much, why they are rare.
---
Hoes does this even have 80 upvotes? This is definitely one of the dumbest/incorrect posts i've ever seen.
---
What? How so? The title just mentions that this is a video about competitive PvE in classic WoW. That doesn't mean that everyone has to participate in competitive PvE.
---
When someone posts a Breath of the Wild speedrun I don't get all indignant with comments like "how dare you tell me how to play my game!" I can play my game casually while also still checking out how other people are simultaneously pushing the limits of the game. 
---
I can't understand the mentality of you guys at all. It's like you feel under attack because someone else is enjoying a game in a different way than you are. I don't get it.
---
This is so funny because it perfectly shows how the "better graphics are superior" crowd fundamentally do not even *understand* the appeal of old graphics.
---
No one is arguing that higher graphics are prettier (if done right, that is). But more realistic is not equal to better entertainment in all cases. WoW rocks a special cartoonish style, it would change the *feeling* of the game for many people - a feeling that is essential. Vanilla is flawed in so many ways, yet people like it above more polished modern games because of the feeling of it, not because they honestly think spamming Frostbolt for an entire raid is "good gameplay mechanics".
---
Same goes for higher graphics as for style - it has certain feelings to it (and no, feeling is not a synonym for nostalgia, although nostalgia can have *some* effect).
---
Just class identity, sure Paladins arent super viable as ret, but at least they have abilities that do extra to undead and demons. Unlike retail, where they seemingly arent anything special.
---
Ah, there is it, the first of the assholes who get off on ganking lowbies.
---
There are two kinds of people; those who see their avatar/character as an extension of themselves or literally as themselves, and those that dont and just see a design or pixels or whatever.
---
The group in the first half think it's weird that a dude would play a girl character because they can conceptualize that person doesnt think they're a girl and isnt pretending to be one.
---
How else would a hunter deal with stealth??
---
\+1 , even in a mostly spanish server it was DM=deadmines DM X = dire maul wing
---
Modified patch 7.3.5 is just something they said on the Classic panel, so we know this is the **minimum** version they'll use. Someone said they upgraded to 8.1.5 on the new Classic client released a week ago on the CDN, but I have no idea if its true. Makes sense though, no reason to not sync the clients.
---
I haven't played WoW since the start of Wraith. But from what I heard the game mechanics in retail are entirely different. The things that made vanilla difficult are just not there anymore. Correct me if I'am wrong but I'd like to put up some examples for further discussion:
---
For example threat mechanics. Apparently threat is a non-issue in retail. In vanilla the threat mechanics are super punishing in endgame content (and sometimes even before that). There are many situations where all the players need to be aware of threat, especially on bosses that require multiple tanks.
---
Then there is much more kiting and single target CC involved from what I heard. This in combination with the punishing threat mechanics just makes for a slowe, more methodical pace. This is something retail players first need to get the hang of.
---
Another example would be organisation and social interaction. This is likely the hardest part out of all. Just keeping 60ish players happy, geared and on schedule is no joke. Also tied into that is preparation. It is non-conveneient to do content in vanilla because you need to prep for it. Attuments, consumables, professions, helping certain players to get key items/resistances etc.
---
In general good retail players will do fine in classic but they need to relearn the game I think.
---
You want to level as slowly as you did to 60 then do 60 more levels? You haven't played the new game
---
Good
---
Too late, you already aggroed him
---
These two things are part of the same system, addons communicate using the same functions as any other regular chat or whisper, this  is also how pull timers work. Yes in BFA blizzard have removed the ability to automate interacting with invites but that's bfa not the patch they mentioned when they spoke about addons at blizzcon. Even if they remove this feature in classic players will still be able to make an lfg too, it'll just simply be a dulicate of the current live lfg tool.
---
I never said anything against hybrids, I said something against ret. When the entire notion that a ret is useful because he can do exactly the same as a holy paladin with some RNG damage, then the argument for a ret is kinda bad since you just bring the holy.
---
&gt; Its a shame that if sharding gets introduced, scenes like this will never happen again :( (EDIT: The highly populated situations I mean).
---
\^OPs ONLY comment, made yesterday.
---
There is no reason not to call it sharding in this post if he already knew what it was, in stead, OP chose to act all "suprised" and "wtf" with that, and his other points, just to stir the shitpost-pot.
---
*Laughs in Warlock*
---
Every opinon is a good one! I just wanted to see what people would like. I wouldn't mind having servers up with new content or even balance changes (to make all specs work in a smiliar way TBC did, with decent gear for all specs).
---
To improve how vanilla was as a game. Fix the obvious mistakes but keep the gameplay and atmosphere of vanilla.
---
thanks i love the priest class in wsg premades
---
When WoW was huge, I was 13 or 14. I played FFXI but my brother who was 17 or 18 was playing WoW. I told him about Classic and he said he wouldn't play because he has done everything Classic has to offer. He was in a top raiding guild and I remember looking over at his screen every now and then and seeing Ragnaros. He went crazy when they downed it.
---
With that said, I've been researching classic wow things the past few days. No source is better than just asking him. It's crazy how he can answer all the questions I'm not sure of.
---
Thank you for your suggestion. This idea has been bouncing around in my head for a while. There are a few other things that I am working on to better improve user experience at the moment, but this is definitely in the top of my backlog as a feature request.
---
If you would like to better formalize your feature request for my bot I would love it if you could take the time to fill out [this form](https://github.com/mikeStr8s/ClassicBot/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=). That way I cant forget, and everyone can see it and see any updates I may have made towards implementation.
---
Thanks again
---
I think I've decided to simply level as ENC shaman and switching to resto at 60
---
Exploration, running around overall. That's what I'm excited about. Spending time having fun rather than wasting them for ilvl.
---
If you want to make your leveling time-efficient, make a leveling plan, hit 60 asap and then do all the reputations and ingredient grinds. It will be much easier to farm gold and rep as lvl 60 than 50.
---
Thank you for the suggestion.
---
I agree that needing the correct punctuation and spelling can be annoying, and that substrings should at least bring up some results. I am currrently trying to figure out the best way to implement something like this. If you have any suggestions or care to elaborate a bit further please fill out [this form](https://github.com/mikeStr8s/ClassicBot/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=) and it will become transparent to all users and development progress can be better tracked.
---
Oh wow, neat!
---
Its the literal nature of subreddits. They dont attract “casuals”. They attract purists like you said, and purists are extremely sensitive when it comes to their topic of choice. Literally _any_ slight deviation from opinions they hold is rabidly attacked before it can burst their bubble
---
Unfortunately those models did and as shield wearing class you are stuck with those bucket lids for first 30 levels.
---
I will try to achieve at least 2 hours perdiste but we will see... it gets a little anxious when you start on 40-45 range
---
One of the big issues with partial completeness is deciding what result is the correct one to take. In an instance like this, the choice would more or less be obvious but what about an item that belongs to a set where the first word in each item is all the same? Inferring what item was specifically requested is difficult.
---
As in other suggestions like yours I ask that you formalize this request by completing [this form](https://github.com/mikeStr8s/ClassicBot/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=) so that feature requests may become as transparent as possible in creation and development. This way you will also get a window into my development progress on this issue.
---
I got it on my first visit to the guy the other day on a private server
---
Don’t know if you don’t try ;)
---
Me and my GF play a bit on YarrHarr servers and even if she got me into playing retail WoW again. She's now the one who doesn't want to play it because it's so so so so so so so damn boring compared to vanilla.
---
That's how good vanilla is as a game.
---
Instead, we'll be having dates with our spouses/GF... whatever, watching sunrises and sunsets on hilltops in Barrens.
---
Teaching our kids how to navigate through mobs with ?? Levels.
---
Classic may be the same game from 15 years ago, but our lives are different now.
---
Now we can send the kids to play in Zul' Farrak while we reminisce with our old raid buddies in Gadgetzan.
---
 Only changes I can think of that I like are: sharding (for launch only), multiple slots for sending mail and being able to reorganise your characters on the creation screen.
---
I have a feeling live numbers will be pretty damn close.
---
Sharding at launch, a 10. Class balance is 5, I want it too but man I dont trust current Blizz really. Everything else 0.
---
On Geddon, adds around and Vael you'r just gimping your damage dealers. These fights are not necessary with FR nowadays.
---
sounds like i'm not the only one who would look at casting/attack animations when choosing a race.
---
You’re assuming that 1. That addon will be remade for classic (a 1.12.1 version for private servers or original vanilla will not work) and 2. It will have enough data input into it.
---
The intention of the bot was never to replace a search engine like google. That will always be more powerful in finding the item that you are looking for. It was more designed for the user to link an item like they would in chat. I understand that no shift-click feature exists but the fact that in order to link something in game requires you to type it exactly OR shift-click an item that you can clearly see the exact name. So if you were to link an item in discord you would already know the exact spelling of the item.
---
I get that this is not necessarily intuitive, but as I stated in other comments I will be working on getting a feature like this implemented in the future. I think that the way something like this is implemented is important and I want to do it right, so if you would be able to formalize this request please fill out [this form](https://github.com/mikeStr8s/ClassicBot/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=) and my development will become more transparent to you, but also to others who may have thought of this idea as well.
---
Thanks again, any feedback can only make this better for the community.
---
The scaling of abilities like that are based on whether or not they are AoE and what their cast time(Before talents and buffs). 
---
Scroll down to spell coefficient on this page, that should help. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_power
---
Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) out.
---
Joke is on you, I would die and play as an Undead!!!
---
If you're horde and not playing a druid or warlock then female troll is the only answer.
---
Honestly, it's incredibly dull if you don't have talents, professions. If *I* were to do this in Classic, I'd modify it to just being white/grey gear only, disallow use of the AH/items from other plays, *allow* professions but only for mats I farm myself, and allow talents. It wouldn't be as "hard" but it'd be a lot more entertaining.
---
Thank you for submitting this. I will be investigating this as soon as I can. I will submit an issue on [my github](https://github.com/mikeStr8s/ClassicBot) with this bug in mind and you can follow development on my fix for this there.
---
I didn't even reach 60 until BC came out.
---
When leveling, I'm aiming for at least a couple hours during the week. Maybe 8pm-10pm/11pm.   Once I'm 60, and I have gear, I'll try to raid 1-2 times a week depending on the time slots. So plan to maybe only play 2-3 nights a week at that point.
---
I don't want any changes. I want to play vanilla WoW and outside of launch sharding which will be a necessary evil all of these changes take something away from the vanilla experience, they do not add to it.
---
You are right with every word, but I am still scared I might have somehow "outgrown" the 2004 graphics. I really hope I can get that feeling you described back, but I have to be honest, I am not sure it will happen.
---
This is fun pvp. Having a rogue stalk and sap you non stop for three weeks straight isn't.
---
Saying Ding never meant anything, nobody gave a shit they jay didn’t want to be rude so say gz.
---
Gold isn’t an integral part of the gameplay like it used to be, and the value of something is relative, it’s perfectly normal for people to have 1m+ gold, first week of BFA I earned closer to 10m just from sitting at the AH.
---
He could be rolling a lock or a pally. In that case his strategy would make more sense.
---
Haha, faster than Onyxia in T3 gear!
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Nobody uses this generic website, GW2 raiders use [Raidar](https://www.gw2raidar.com/leaderboards) for speedrun records. Most guilds compete for boss kill times, however organized tournaments are usually full raid speedruns and/or imposed lowman bosses. Funnily enough these tournaments organized by the players themselves over the years always had more viewers than official PvP tournaments
---
Arguably lowman records are a bit more niche and only a few guilds partake in that aspect of the competition because you can't improve a lot when you're already doing bosses with 3-4 players only.
---
Thanks for the education. I must be really stupid not to understand that. My bad. Super sorry.
---
&gt;This is so funny because it perfectly shows how the "better graphics are superior" crowd fundamentally do not even *understand* the appeal of old graphics.
---
And this is funny because it appears that everyone who's favoring old graphics feels butthurt once anyone mentions that they would like to see better graphics and feels in charge of mentoring those who have a different opinion. I didn't even blame or criticise anyone in my comment and you are whinging as if I insulted your favorite pet. I maybe mocked you a little but seriously, in this highly unrealistic scenario (you know, this is a photo and we'll never even get that etc.) you should not take everything so serious. Especially not a game. Now go downvote me because that's what you're going to do anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Everyone here killed KT and got rank 14 so I'd imagine so
---
I'm planning on the timbermaw rep grind too, once about 55. I want enchanting and skinning so the agi to weapon is a great grind. Also makes sense to do it when I get the XP for it, turning in the quests. 
---
I like grinding lower level instances as many folk power level professions, so the middle level enchanting dust and the middle level cloth always sell well.

Also, if I decide to go hunter instead of Shammy (my two choices), then the DM run is great as a hunter, being able to DE a lot of BOP blues.
---
Would be a better idea to drop alchemy as you only need a lvl 35 twink to be able to hav Alchemy 300 but you need to / should be lvl 60 to herb in eastern plague lands etc.
---
Yeah, retail is not really preparation for Classic. It's more like a bad joke.
---
Also makes it close to impossible to get games on off hours and if your server has some annoying premades that do stupid shit like turtle in WSG or farm graveyards for hours on end you’re stuck playing against it again and again and again.
---
The female dwarf running animation is awesome.
---
Yeah, that's the other end of something being subjective - some might not like it for whatever reason. Personally I tried on pservers and I still very much enjoy it, but to be completely honest it's probably a lot of nostalgia. But no idea why some people use that as an argument against it - I just know I feel joy from it, so that's all I care about.
---
I believe you linked a wrong image, I only see some slightly deformed male dwarves.
---
Might want to use the term "radical" instead of progressive since it actually means the opposite of (non political) conservative while progressive doesn't really have any specific meaning outside of (US) politics.
---
Well, if you go by what they said, no. The game will be 1.12 and each exception has been explicitly listed. For instance you would not expect AQ to be available not because it wasn't in 1.12 but because they specifically said that AQ is not available despite it being 1.12.
---
based on you comment and username I am 99% certain I love you
---
Mods not gonna take this down for rule 7?
---
This it the correct answer.
---
Blizz has shown that Classic is not a typical release, so we shouldn't expect a beta like with retail expansions. There is a good chance we won't get a beta or that the beta will last very shortly. It's still 2 1/2 months to July 16th and a Classic beta easily fit in there.
---
Which part of Rule 7 do you feel this violates?  Also, Rule 7 leaves discretion to the mods - "*may* be removed".
---
Keybind everything!
---
As soon as you get a new ability create a new keybind and learn it, it makes the game 10x as fun as the game has inch perfect controls :)
---
d2?
---
Sorry i meant rule 1. Last week i posted a real life pic that looked like tanaris in here and they removed it for not being related to wow. Im mainly just venting about the hypocrisy of the mods rulings.
---
oh diablo?
---
nice, was it self hosted on your computer?
---
didn't he have a phone?
---
Except BfA is *a bit* more than a graphical update to Classic
---
If you don't buy all your spells you can get enough money while leveling to buy your mount. Just don't buy useless skills, gear from ah, consumables.
---
Okay that is funny as hell.
---
It was bond forming especially if you got a group together in a major city and had to trek out to it. Everyone shooting the shit chatting together even though you've never met before
---
who need wife and kids period but ok
---
&gt;Now anyone tell me again you want 2004 graphics back if this would be an option.
---
You directly *asked* for someone to tell you that. Now you are butthurt that someone actually did, despite your sarcasm?
---
&gt;And this is funny because it appears that everyone who's favoring old graphics feels butthurt once anyone mentions that they would like to see better graphics and feels in charge of mentoring those who have a different opinion.
---
"appears that everyone" - go look up what "vocal minority" means, since you apparently don't understand it. Most people that like old graphics have no problem with people liking new graphics, nor do they have anything against a toggle in game, as long as they don't have to use it. You are seeing a minority and assume that is a measure for everyone.
---
You were writing a condescending comment implying that people who like old graphics can't possibly do that if better graphics were an option, I'm simply explaining why both old and new graphics can be loved.
---
Yet now you act like some victim and try to make it sound like I'm raging over you. Once you are done looking up "vocal minority" you might also look up the difference between an "explanation" and a "rant", since you might be confusing those with each other.
---
If Blizzard turns the game to shit with RCR and WoW tokens, I might consider it because it's a solo endeavor that I can do casually.
---
If I manage to find a decent progression raiding guild that works with my schedule, then probably not.
---
Eh, the way I think about it is I could just pick up an extra shift at work and buy 4-5 wow tokens if I wanted. Not a big fan of farming gold, but some people are. I just want to spend my game time doing something else
---
Fiery Weapon enchant in endgame PvP.  
---
fuck efficiency, that stuff looks too good to pass up.  
---
bonus points if you put it on a Zin'Rokh.
---
I see you brought your downvote brigade to stomp out people who didn't care for your video!
---
If BFA was simply a graphical upgrade of classic we wouldn’t even be having this conversation
---
I would like to think Blizzard will do the fun decision and rent more server space temporarily while the pop is high but I get the feeling we're going to see even these areas sharded.
---
Holy shit this is near my house!

Yeah I saw that video as well. Did he mention anything about how and where he got his information?
---
If they are achievement hunting, they'd be in it for the 'long haul' regardless, no?
---
I thought legion was the worst, I actually preferred WoD (pvp was so much better and that’s all I do if I play any retail). Retail hasn’t been worth it post wotlk for anything other than pvp and after WoD you do such little damage and is kinda slow :( 
---
MoP is considered one of the best xpacs for pvp because almost every spec felt OP (which is ofc fun!) and that kinda made things balanced
---
Idk how I turned this comment into some pvp thing my bad lol
---
The overall reasoning is correct, but also situational.
---
I'll be leveling a war = a LOT of downtime. So my plan is to go full spirit+strength gear and use Skinning as a regen technique.
---
Sine i'll have to wait while eating anyway, why not to make some extra gold ;)

My kid will likely be around 10-12 months old when classic releases... That's old enough to play right?
---
Well, at least taking a year to get to 60 will be a hell of a journey.
---
I will be lucky if I have 5 hours a week. But we will see.
---
In vanilla some guilds had class leaders on top of guild master and raid leader.  During raids (in my guild) 1 class leader (usually Warrior, Lock, &amp; Priest) would be assigned to manage the melee dps, ranged dps, and healers.  We started out the way you described, but once we got serious about progression if you weren't speced for your role in the raid you didn't get in.
---
Slapping groups together and letting everyone spec the way they want is an ineffective waste of players' time.  Why would anyone choose a chaotic hodgepodge with a high probability of multiple wipes over the easy wins of a properly built raid with classes speced for the highest probability of success?
---
It may sound strict to some, but trust me it's far more fun.  Wiping and failing to progress is what sours raids and kills Guilds.  Players have much more fun when they are winning, getting loot, and progressing.
---
I apologize if I made it sound like every guild will tell you how to spec your class.  What I meant was that if your new to raiding, but it's what your interested in and join a guild that is focused on raiding, someone will help you spec correctly for the position you want to fill.
---
Unless they are a large bag of Richards who won't let you raid, and won't tell you why they won't let you raid.  
---
In that case F*** that lame @$$ guild. Nobody on the server likes them anyway!
---
Keep in mind that not all bosses let you use MCP's due to mechanics so realistically you can get away with a lot less. And yes, you need Shadow Oil on each of them so it can get a bit expensive.
---
It's manageable though. Can take a look at my latest raid if you want to see where I utilize Pummelers and where I dont:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bsNXWLBXfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bsNXWLBXfI)
---
I'd rather beat people with as many of their excuses stripped away as possible so no thanks to lowbie ganking.
---
Also I want scrubs to invest as much time as possible into the game before I start squishing them so they have some sunk cost/time fallacy to keep them sucked in.
---
Ganking lowbies is like killing a while generation of baby fish, not gonna go well for the real hunting season.
---
Yep, the reason is very literally that they can't handle 1v1 against others at their level.
---
I was in STV the other day on my Warrior, when someone shouted out in /1 that some 60 Hunter was camping lowbies at the Nesingwary quest spot. I mounted up and went over, killed him and waited. He ressed as far away as he could and bailed. He had no interest in a fair fight, just wanted to grief, but when he met a real challenge he had to run away like the coward he was.
---
Waiting for Blizzard to repost vanilla wow already
---
Probably from the vanilla databases, which are based on Wowhead data. The info about rep decay from completing higher level quests is probably accurate - the best bet for doing this is to quest through all the NElf leveling zones as much as possible, as outlined in the video.If you come up short, there are other ways such as runecloth or PvP that will raise faction reputation.
---
I bought these as well when classic was announced. Such lovely references
---
exactly, so long as you're enjoying
---
mods are not a monolithic entity. one may delete the topic while the others leaves it open.
---
I think you'll be dead if you post something else as stupid as this
---
And then a Shaman group (with a Shaman) to provide Shaman buffs to the Shamans.
---
20 days /played is stretching it even if you've never played the game before. If you've played the game before (I'd say any version) you should be done in 8-12 days /played.
---
Not sure I can entirely agree with this analysis, most of the time I see people here absolutely trashing private servers they're the same type of people trashing people who want 'purity' or nochanges and it's often accompanied by strawman arguments.
---
Vanilla dungeons battled hardened you very early.
---
As I interpret it it's not so much about the zones (well, of course you will need to be in the nelf zones most of the time) but about doing all the quests that give Darna rep at the appropriate level. Which sometimes include quests outside the nelf zones. But yes, for the most part in the nelf zones. But it doesn't mean always, and it doesn't mean all the quests. Cause not all quests in nelf zones give Darna rep.
---
One thing I am curios about is if it will be difficult to stay in the greens of the quests and not overlevel. Like do you need to be very cautious about getting as least possible XP as possible? Killing only the necessary mobs for the quests etc? That I'm curious about.
---
the content itself? no.  
---
comparing arbitrary accomplishments? yes.
---
progress raiding does not exist anymore. progress has already been made. the game is beaten.  
---
what people now tend to do is trying to run the content more efficiently.  
---
oddly enough speed run or kill records were mostly held by guilds outside of the progression race. by, so to say, more casual guilds.
---
lolno
---
Classic will run whatever client version is the current one. They'll update side by side once the game is out.
---
The alpha is 8.x something, the demo was 7.3.5
---
HI IM BAD SO I CALL EVERYONE AUTISTS BECAUSE THEY CAN DO STUFF I CANT

On the  BlizzCon '18 Classic Panel they had a bullet point on the "Design Philosophy" slide: Cross-realm grouping?Never.

Legion surprised me. I was sceptical at first (especially with artifact weapons, everyone gets the same weapon) but at the end I was pleasently surprised. But the AP traits and where to use it (when the grind was real at the beginning) and grinding for different artifact apperances was awesome. Night hold is one of my favourite raids like ever. Couldn't wait to stick it to Gul'dan after everything. Class specific campaigns had a awesome replayability with warious classes (all of them IMO), M+ was great. Loved the dungeons more than in BFA. Gear catchup was super easy. All of the raids were great. There were raids all the time in all difficulties because AP grind, legendary grind (I didn't like this system, without OP leggos you were a 0) and some items from older raids had a posibility to get a upgrade (mythic Ursoc trinket was OP for hunters) etc. Legion was awesome. Not the best expansion but defo better than ekspansions from Cata until BFA. Nothing can compare to TBC and WOTLK but Legion was really good.
---
It’s 200ish hours or about 9-11 for a veteran to level up granted if you are playing 24-40h a week about a month and a half depending on how many detours you take ie professions etc.
---
Up to date memes and modern video editing in PvP videos
---
My reaction when I streamer I watch said that..
---
I can play up to 4 hours per night... All depends how much I'm willing to neglect my family lol.
---
They were well known back in the day. Frostbolt is direct damage with 3 second cast time. 3/3.5 = 0.857 multiplier. It also has a snare effect which is 5% penalty so 0.95 * 0.857 = 0.814 multiplier.
---
Unfortunately no I will be playing 5h a day when returning to work before then my week off I’ll play 14-15h a day.
---
Timbermaw are good if you want the enchants, but otherwise I like to just get them to maybe friendly tbqh.
---
It's the guy who fucked Star Wars Galaxies up, so I wasn't surprised.
---
That’s because it’s edited to be the same colors as wow.  In real life it’s not blue.
---
Alch is excellent on warriors. BS you'll make fuck all gear for yourself unless you have rare recipes, but alch? Giant strength potions for days!
---
I don't know about insignificant, but I'll be glad for a Horde without pretty elves.
---
You probably loved them when you were 15 and you had plenty of time.
---
I had that it was useless.
---
The damage number fonts and popping criticals.
---
Modern wow feels like a wet noodle in combat.
---
Met a friend in BC who I've now played with for over 10 years. Watched him go through grad school to becoming a game dev while I went from high school --&gt; college --&gt; med school now. Crazy to think how long online friendships can last.
---
One must be hella stupid to pay that amount for an account that could be banned any moment for account selling.
---
You deserve better friends than that, man.
---
Feels like that's so low numbers you won't really have time to enjoy the game =/
---
Gotta grind it back up to 300
---
&gt; will be difficult to stay in the greens of the quests and not overlevel. Like do you need to be very cautious about getting as least possible XP as possible?
---
If you are getting ahead, then don't kill anything extra and do not log out in an Inn for rested XP. Vanilla is not very forgiving when it comes to leveling, the 1-60 leveling process was not originally designed to be a race to 60 &amp; beyond.
---
If you're going to be a PvE dps warrior, Alchemy probably makes the most sense. You can save a bunch of money, and also buy arcane crystals and do your own transmutes.
---
It's moreso tanks that get forced into blacksmithing for BoPs. And if you're a PvPer, you'll probably want Engineering.
---
that is interesting, if you go Human, you have a little room for error, it will be about 4k less rep.
---
i am not too worried about hitting every single quest because i can also do the ferelas quests which are also darn rep. on the point about over XP, i dont think that is an issue in WoW classic because even with guides, a lot of them will have you grind out a full level. unless you kill everything in your path, i dont think it will be an issue. as a rogue, i will not be killing everything in my path so its not an issue for me personally.
---
If you get banned for VPN use it is because Blizzard assumes you are account sharing.
---
However you can easily prove with your VPN connection details that this is not the case and you would get unbanned.

You can't skin timbermaw furbolgs. They're classed as humanoids.

Going pretty deep with this one. I first thought July would be the release month but as time has passed, I am have started leaning more towards August/September.
---
I replayed Indiana jones and the infernal machines this years. The controls are clunky, but god damn do the game make me like an explorer. The sense of exploration and discoveries. I like that.
---
Lol   /golfclap
---
My local lan cafe (also danish ;o) had a bunch of people in the same raid guild as well. Not me though, those scumbags were on the wrong faction ;)
---
I wish I could say the same but I know if they announce a special edition of Persona 5 The Royal i'm going to slam down all of my money so...
---
The fact that a very small subset of the community saw raiding as a "competitive" activity is partly why wow went wrong over the years.
---
Not sunken temple?
---
Friends and family.
---
You may need to redo this survey, it seems like you've gone out of your way to make people think that 0 = do not want.

On my workdays, I only have about an hour but on my days off I get about 5-6 so it’s not too bad.
---
Finding the first grey shoulder or helm.... and then zooming in on the character to see hoe awesome i look.
---
We know that this is a retro copy of an existing game that was tested time and again when first developed &amp; is going through an in house alpha. This isn't some brand new game that needs to be rigorously scrutinized.
---
It literally depends on the API calls they break, we won't know until they pick the ones to break

Yeah.. by the time I'd log in the next week I'd forget where I was.

---
lowbies were precious things to be protected.
---
Whats your plan for not being able to track both at once?
---
While I don't think you're wrong, Blizzard hasn't quite released a game like this before.  
---
If you look at what we saw in the demo, the vast majority of stuff worked as intended. There were a few details that were off, but does anyone really want them to delay the game because the lamp post lights aren't the correct colour?  
---
They'll have QA testers running quests and trying to break them, QA testers that are probably used to the architecture so know what to look for etc.  
---
There may well be a beta, but it will be a marketing thing rather than a functional one, I would imagine.
---
The only moneymaking from Alchemy is if you get your hands on flask recipes early. Otherwise herbalism is sufficient for making cash and have your guildies make the pots you need for raids/world pvp.
---
Get engineering.
---
Damn the economy on my server was quite different! (Plus I had my pocket mage and therefore never paid for this
---
Smart advice. Thanks.
---
I would normally give all my gold away om my main when I "stopped" playing wow back in cata,  which meant a random player would just get 5-10k gold (And I would never save more gold up than 10k because of this)
---
Same here 😀
---
Put the pc outside.
---
It is worse when one of your friends openly admits he hated vanilla. Like excuse me sir we can't be friends any more lol.
---
Thank you very much for this response. I’m very pumped for release; i hope to be level 60 within a month, but since I’m new that may not happen. I’ll probably find a casual guild as well. Thanks.
---
There is no need at all to go BS.
---
Sounds good I’ll do that. Thanks.
---
Search “field guide” on this sub and they should come up.

&gt; Just like your infinite uptime 100% activity situation on infinite hp mob.

Where was this even said?
---
It would appear to be directly conflicting with other posters found from ~2005-2007.

While this does support the argument it does, some poster claiming to WTFPWN other people while also claiming a game mechanic may not be the most reliable source.

Where do you take the 4k room for error numbers from? :)
---
But yes, you make good points.
---
I just started on a PS to see what it will possibly be like. And there are some cave quests in Teldrassil where you either have to kill a lot of mobs on the way that's not actually necessary for the quest. Or you could stealth/run and die and ress and kill only one guy and die and ress and die and ress and die and ress etc etc.
---
I'm thinking in those cases it's probably better to just either:
---
1. Skip the cave quests, or
---
2. If overlevel isn't going to be a real issue, then kill unnecessary mobs in the cave quests for some QoL
---
It took me 29 calendar days to hit 60 on my first toon. I probably played 40 hours a week. I also remember going from halfway through 56 to 60 in one 24 hour sitting.
---
You might want to consider alchemy / herb while levelling, being able to make some healing potions early on can be very useful. Although it can be hard to keep up on levels, I enjoy the breaks from questing to level some professions. 
---
But honestly do what you want, although people can seem a little obsessed with the whole min max shenanigans it really isn't all that necessary.
---
They were. If you think about it, we literally just got an expansion which has Kul'Tiras as a continent and the Kul'Tiran humans which are allied to the Alliance. That's part of the lore.
---
So in places like that area in Durotar or Tiragarde Keep in Blasted Lands,  those Humans are in fact green and healable by other Alliance players.
---
Hello, thank you for the feedback. I do plan on having other characters where ill take my time leveling to explore, do professions, run lower level dungeons etc. But I would also like to be able to work on getting a healer, preferably a paladin, capped quickly since the content at 60 has me intrigued.
---
I’ll make sure to level as retribution but keep an offset for healing gear for those times I will run dungeons. Is it still viable to be able to heal as retribution for the later levels or would I definitely need to switch over to Holy at that point?
---
Looking forward to the free mount at 40, should definitely cut down on gold costs. I’ll also make sure to be extra nice to the mages I meet
---
Once again, thank you very much for your feedback.
---
The WC3 map making comminity is still active and if you have a bro who also has WC3 try out the multiplayer campaign and run through the story with a friend.

You could save darkmoon faire turn ins.  Certain items come from beasts so you could also skin.

---
no problem, just make sure you bloody enjoy it!  a lot of us like doing the theorycrafting and aiming at specific things because we're familiar with the game and that is the stuff that's left for us to discover and conquer - but if you're not an old veteran then there's no reason you can't take it a little slower and discover more :D
---
You can probably go get some fire resist when AQ40 opens hahahah
---
a Video of why you should play HORDE!

Haha, he should play a pala so that he has time between mobs to take them to kindergarten or feed them or something.

To further on this is like you "Abandon" the pet and you have to tame a new one.
---
Hello, thank you for your feedback.
---
So, just for some quick clarification, I should eyeball FoL ranks based on current gear + damage output. And for gear I’m going for crit, int and then healing?

Many thanks

With the phasing, you will only see about 4 people.

Thanks for the feedback.

Power leveling was a poor choice of wording, my bad. I mean leveling quickly on my own or with PuGs, without completely midmaxing leveling.
---
Much thanks
---
Ive been playing wow since Vanilla and dont plan on playing. I have like a life with a wife and kids now. I would literally lose my family. The game takes too much time to play! lol

itll still suck me in though.

I’ve joined, thanks for the link

And Reforged is more than a graphical update to WC3. They redid the whole Culling of Stratholm map to make it look like it did in WoW, the original WC3 Arthas voice was also replaced with the WoW one and I believe there were talks about reigning in other portions of WC3 to fix with current WoW.
---
Of course you can enjoy it. It all depends on what you want from the game. If you have fun logging in and getting a few quests done or jumping around SW that’s perfectly fine. Obviously raiding and hardcore PvP will be difficult if not outright impossible with that time-investment, but that doesn’t mean the game can’t be enjoyable. People have different priorities :)

This video is awesome

Completely irrelevant to Classic.
---
Be aware that lots of advice and facts are: true, but often require a lot more than is actually often said. Like a lot of the min-maxing in what gear to get and levelling speed and goldfarming and hybrid viability. Its often because x and y needs to also be known /accounted for (hitcapping, farmplace not taken, shitload of specialized consumables) and such. So take everything with the assumption that you need to know even more, and also that things can be slow :)

The score system needs a rework cause it can be misunderstood if low or high value is conservative

There was the initial data which was corrected as soon as it was noticed. None of the numbers in the article have been wrong since before most of these comments were added. People are simply downvoting without actually reading it.

I'll play a warlock so me neither. Gonna be great to have a mount and extra gold when my friends are mountless and trying to save for a mount.

Engineering is not only for PVP, its bis for PVE also, those Goblin Sappers are way to strong.
---
I love the grid add on as a healer. Great video, healer POV is always welcome
---
I'm super looking forward to classic! A bunch of my friends were playing it when I was trying my damndest to graduate so I missed it! I only got to dip my toes in a tiny bit on friend's accounts in BC, a little in Wrath, and finally had time to make my own account in the back end of Cata.
---
I'm super excited to play 2 handed shaman.  Didn't play shaman until the end of wrath, early cats, so all I know is dual weild.
---
for some info [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney\_Park\_Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_Park_Chapel)
---
i know this all too well.  im still in contact with a bunch of my old wow friends, but only one is coming back for classic :c
---
Would you say it is more likely to be remade or more likely not to be remade? I could just use a pen and paper not having the addon wont break my plan. BTW Mobinfo records the data from my kills not a foreign database.
---
That was me back then, I made 20g begging one afternoon, I'm not proud of it and I'd never do it again but it was a nice chunk of change.
---
Taking what you have said to heart, I have a dev branch where I successfully build my own tooltip images. I believe that the formatting is all there and it does what you described. The only issue is that when there are large tooltips, like "dreadnaught guantlets" the image gets scaled and it becomes difficult to read. But clear once you open the image. So besides that, I think that its all implemented and I just need to clean up my code and make things more efficient.
---
Staysafe has a new video with fury warrior, in the description is a link to a google sheets with BIS accounting for 1.12 stats/itemization.
---
To you and the poster above, thank you for paving the way, I'm right behind you guys.
---
I wonder if #nochanges extends to not changing bugs or glitches we find, but did exist in Vanilla. What about new bugs/glitches...
---
Eh...there is a need. Healing it at 18 is rough without some decent gear if your group is also all lvl 18.
---
If the mods feel like anything remotely political shouldn't be on this sub then it's their call. It doesn't change that this image is utterly harmless in my eyes. 
---
If props from your political party were components of an image on this sub would you contest it too? I wonder
---
Blizzard will most likely (if they haven't already, I haven't checked) make a Classic edition available for purchase on their website when we get closer to launch. Don't worry about it.
---
Hi, /u/quadpvp
---
Sadly, none of my friends play anymore. I still play retail although I must admit , it's lost the touch it used to have for me because I don't know anyone. I'm in a guild, but they don't really talk to me and when people are online for the most part it's just guild chat. I don't know if I'm gonna play classic, it just won't be the same playing by myself
---
They did?   Damn, I was going to brag about soloing hogger :(
---
Thanks it is very nice! I have a couple other healer POVs on my channel if interested.
---
Man, i was like „warrior, only warrior“ but you reminded how cool hunter and their pets were in classic...
---
You'll most likely only need a subscription.
---
There is no real benefit in vanilla from +15 herbalism
---
God I hope I can convince a guild to let me do if. I even WANT to heal, I just want to do it in plate.
---
Just. Type. It. Out.
---
Meh. The min maxing is overrated. Roll nelf female for  flipzz
---
Yeah, I think the initial spike will be massive and then lost over 50% of that in no time. There has not been a grindy challenging game from the START released in what feels like ages. My friends and I are all putzing around on Rift. We just started... Running OOM is physically not possible at the moment and dying takes some effort.
---
Can't wait for a challenge again!
---
You can say that over and over again, hell you could make it the ONLY thing thats displayed on retail-website, people still would ignore it and go on ranting about how bad sharding is. I already gave up.
---
Having played and watched / participated in this kind of PVP on the original AV, and again in the 'wild' on Nostralius, I firmly believe that this is what the developers of WoW envisioned for world PVP.  However, the servers just couldn't handle 100 versus 100 people at one time.  It was like a molasses of, keep pressing keys and hope you're alive if/when the monitor releases.  At 60, we even tried having "pvp nights" out in Mulgore, but still couldn't handle the lag / stress.
---
So for that, I'm looking forward to a young, PVP server where we can 'raid' Red Ridge, take and hold Duskwood (FER THE HORDE!) for a few hours; and hopefully the Alliance will have enough cajones to come back at us.
---
Yeah, let that faction talk begin!
---
Thanks all for the input! I've decided what I'll do because of the help I received.

&gt; Blizzard hasn't quite released a game like this before
---
All the more reason to have a beta.
---
/shrug
---
Hunter has the highest skill ceiling by far. Realky fun class. You can 1v1 anyone if you re good enough. A godtier hunter can 1v2-3 with the proper tools
---
This one really hit me in the feels.
---
They drop both those and jowls, can be skinned, and the bugs in the same room have pretty high rate of dropping level 50+ greens that you can disenchant on a level 5 alt. And you can weave in a first boss kill to avoid lockout every 5 runs or so. The handy thing is that if you have the key you can just walk to the Athenaeum to vendor everything in the instance. It *is* pretty much a mage only thing though if you want to do it efficiently.
---
More like Holy Shit. Literally one of the worst 31-pointers in the game, even with 1.12 talents.
---
Yes,  some names and some sites could violate copyright. My point was just that Blizzard’s terms appear to go beyond what is proscribed by law, which is unsurprising. They of course want to exert as much control as they can.
---
And everyones capable of basic reading skills would realise that it's only for a few weeks and selected zones. But what would a day without ranting be huh?

---
Honestly, the changes on retail to spell effects can be gorgeous sometimes. Changing shaman to use water as healing is great.
---
Contact blizzard. I've seen many cases where the assist gou getting your old account back.
---
If you were to count the pre-tbc-patch (2.0.1) as end of Vanilla - then yes. People were able to farm Netherweave Cloth in front of Karazhan for example.
---
But I think most people would agree that anything after 1.12.1 - so, anything 2.x and beyond - wasn't vanilla anymore.
---
no? lfd was in wotlk, cross-realm zones were in cata, sharding AFAIK was in... legion? wod? one of those. i do agree with you tho that it lost color/that the leveling experience became awful
---
i've always had a special fascination with it because i joined in cata and only got to do the armory (i think? the one with the hounds) once before they changed it in mists, so that's basically all i know. did it on a pserver a while back and shit was lit
---
Is a great way to ignore everything I said and quote one part out of context. :p
---
Fair enough, still a bit of a stretch to compare the two. I'm hoping Reforged will still feel very similar to the original, whereas we know for a fact BfA at this point is just WoW by name and basically a completely different game than vanilla.
---
What stats should I be prioritizing as a hunter while level? It seems pretty straight forward to get agility, but I'm wondering how I should be budgeting spirit for regen.
---
Yeah.  3 hours once per week with my 5-man crew.
---
What happened to the weather - why would they take it away?
---
Exactly this ^.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1  &lt;--- Patch info
---
If you listen to the class designer, the early iterations of holy were way off what they wanted. They intended for paladins to be in the melee using their plate armor while healing. Not this wear plate but stand 30 yards back bullshit.
---
Yea... but has your brother done everything WoW Classic has to offer AGAIN?
---
30 yards is 27.43 meters
---
They've already confirmed that you will only need a subscription. No game purchase necessary.
---
This is why I WISH Blizzard would release the dungeons and raids not on 1.12, but on how it was done during the real Vanilla.  Give us 1.03 MC, give us 1.04 Strath and Scholo, and for God's sake, give us the original LBRS that taught groups that they had to complete the dungeon using teamwork.  That goes for my beloved BRD as well.
---
I'm fearful that if the content is cleared too quickly, if the "classic" bosses are exactly the same as the "vanilla" bosses that it will be a race to the finish -- and then many people will leave as they are bored.  They race to level, they race to be server first -- and it's too damn easy now with more than just "level 60 raiders" knowing the strategies, the add-ons that tell them when to move out of fire, etc.
---
Let's do this again, no add-ons that tell you what bosses are going to do, no damage meters, etc.
---
Let's go hard-core on Classic.
---
I think you should pick up Mining/Engineering. If Blizzard truly brings an authentic vanilla experience, engineering would be super useful, especially if you're a PvPer. Resistance trinkets, bombs, MC hat, you name it. 
---
Even if you're not PvPer, however, it's still mindblowingly good. You can craft yourself mechanical dragonlings to aid you leveling. The dragonling's level is your engineering level devided by 5, meaning at level 35 you can have 300 Engi skill and a lvl 60 dragonling to help you in both killing beasts and gankers.
---
Also, if you pick up Gnomish engineering, you can craft a trinket that transports you to Gadgetzan (Goblin engineering has a similar trinket that ports you to Everlook).
---
The heads you can craft with engineering are cloth, so you can equip them as a clothie. Take this item for an example:  [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12622](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12622) I once got a +36 shadow spells bonus and another one gave me +25 nature resistance which I sold on the AH for 60 gold.
---
More useful items I can recite from memory: Gnomish Death Ray, Repair Bot, Net-o-matic, Goblin Jumper Cables (though you won't need jumper cables as a priest).
---
And last but not least, if you're not a tailor, you can still equip tailored items -- that your wife would probably be able to craft anyway. But only engineers can equip and use engineered items.
---
Do what I’m going to do and play after they go to sleep! I have a young son and my wife goes to sleep fairly early so I plan to play from like 9-12. Maybe an hour or two more on weekends (or not at all if busy). 15-20 hours a week ain’t bad.
---
this is all just actually so dumb. Shit information, shit assumptions and graphs that just don't really show anything valuable.  
---
The game will take you a long time to max level if you are braindead. there's the one sentence you needed to write for this.
---
Netherweave Cloth was indeed added in patch 2.0.1 over a month before TBC release, and were dropped by the lvl 69-70 Unliving Residents outside of Kara.
---
Winterfell? LOL
---
We can finally tell our children to level in ST while we wait to gank them on our rogues.
---
Warrior or Druid
---
Jup, I can relate. There will also be entire weeks I won‘t be able to play.. but normally I should be able to spend around 10 - 15h a week or so.
---
To be fair that was probably the off target while we focused something else, but I definitely put up 2 dots and a curse pretty much every fight lol...I'm sure debuffs got overwritten frequently.
---
Unless Blizzard has changed their plans since last Blizzcon you'll only need a subscription.     
---
If you decide one day that you want to give BfA a try you'd need to buy the expansion.
---
They changed how the game has to be purchsed during Legion IIRC, so that one only has to buy the most recent expansion - all older ones and the base game became free.
---
Actually ZG and AQ20 reset every 3 days and Onyxia resets every 5 days.
---
Or just save people in the open world. I used to love finding other classes in the open world struggling due to a gank or a bad pull and rescuing them with well placed heals or shields.
---
Actually my first ever character was i hunter. I remember him never getting out of ashenvale.
---
The thing was my buddies were on another server so i switched and rerolled as a shaman. Loved it, but hated the fact i'm a healbot in raids.
---
So i rerolled a warrior and god ... i fell in love. I hated it getting destroyed by mages but as soon as i got a few lucky seconds... i still see those multiple 1.5k+ crits in just one second before my eyes... that was pure beauty!
---
Time will come, maybe i'll play hunter but i guess nothing beats the memories i have doing battleground over battleground with my sword specced arms warrior...
---
To piggy back off this, the pre instance before the actual instance portal. Always a good time
---
Yeah I don’t care about early class design. I’m talking the class we’ve played for 15 years hasn’t changed much.
---
It’s funny because I knew I’d get downvoted for saying it, and then people would come up with useless counter arguments like this one lol. 
---
This sub is so heavy on its downvotes. Really is oddly bitchy in here lol
---
That's because ony is the first dungeon that goes obsolete.
---
You only need to create an account online with an email adress, then log in to attach a credit card to pay for a monthly sub at like 14.99 a month and that's it. You download the "launcher" from their website, and that in turn will download classic when it's released automatically. If your subscription is current you can log in and play. No buying any games required. It's just like paying for netflix
---
I wouldn't mind the extra hairstyles that came with the introduction of barbershops, but I kind of like the idea that the creation of your character is a huge moment. I bet there will be thousands of people spending an hour or two just at the character selection screen because there will be no going back on it except for rerolling.
---
It just underlines the spirit of vanilla: your decisions matter.
---
Dailies were the start of the end of the game.    They use to provide a game that we WANTED to log on and play everyday, not that we felt we had to.
---
I literally did it 2 days ago with 0 issues
---
Eric's face perfectly captures the urgency of needing to get back into the instance because a rank 13 Mage is trying to kill you.
---
And even if it would drop, you had no use for it except selling it to vendors
---
I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but not having the option of using updated graphics would be a deal breaker for me.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Vanilla WoW.  The last WoW expansion I played was Mists.  Vanilla came out when I was in high school and it was a formative game for me as it was for a lot of people.  The nostalgia, though, extends to the sense of community, the slower progression, old school raids, etc.  It definitely doesn't extend to the graphics though.  Yea, for that day and age, the graphics were great, but that was 15 years ago.  Part of the excitement for me is to experience classic WoW gameplay with updated graphics.  To me, it's as much a quality of life change as integrating smarter itemization from 1.12.  I lived through the days of having useless stats on endgame raid gear.  I'm excited not just to replay a more enjoyable version of the game I loved but to see it in a new light with updated graphics.
---
Pandas?
---
&gt; RIP hunters on pve servers
---
How come?
---
I had the same thing for a rogue meme, then the next day literally the same meme was top post on the reddit.
---
Oh bollocks.  Can I claim a long day and too much game of thrones
---
Winterspring...
---
I'll add in senility soon, if that will help
---
Love the downvoting, but it’s true.  It’s ridiculous how you claim to be more experienced from watching you tube videos.  Go roll a in a P-server and try for yourself.  
---
Also letting the popularity of the class ruin it for your own enjoyment, seriously? 
---
Not surprising considering the huge concern with standing out.  You should probably aim to have fun because people who have been playing classic for years already are going to steam roll you regardless of what class you pick.
---
Keep hold of your leather if you want to make bags.
---
it's so strange to me how just being forced to travel on foot can make a zone seem so much bigger. westfall used to feel so tiny and cramped to me; not so much now. and old barrens, i love it...
---
nah, 1 hour a week you wont last, the game isnt designed for that level of casual
---
I wouldn't even play if I had less than 10 a week
---
You can definitely solo as a priest. Leveling with a wand is insane early. You’ll spec into shadow as you level and can still heal 5mans. 
---
Later when you respec holy for healing (if that’s the plan), you can still solo but it’ll be nice to level in like BRD to start getting endgame gear. Once you hit 60 and get gear you can still solo and AOE farm although it obviously won’t be quite as fruitful as a true dps. 
---
Depends what you want to do... if you want to heal you’re obviously not going lock.
---
I am too 99% of the time, but this is just a reskin of a game I didn't own, but 100% want to own. I would be amazed if they found a way to fuck it up. So far it seems like they're keeping the old game mechanics as is and just making t prettier.
---
Flash of light doesn't have poor +healing scaling it's 1 to 1 even on lower ranks. The pserver scene is split on it at that moment the top NA players still stack +heal while the top international player favor crit %. 
---
The reason they don't have overlap is because priests will wear 8 piece tier 2. There is also a good bit of leather/mail healing gear that priests simply can't wear. Neck/rings/trinkets they still mostly share though and with cloak there is no competition because the best in game is a crafted piece.
---
This.
---
There is no rush. So unless world/server first is the only thing that tickles your pickle in Classic, then you can play as much as you have time for.
---
I plan to rush my first char. Then just do casual raiding / leveling alts for the rest of my Classic career.
---
Just juice that rested xp and it won't be terrible. Always log in inns.
---
I am really looking forward to gear being way more important, and being excited about getting one upgrade from a green to a blue.
---
Also I look forward to chasing specific gear, as opposed to just item level.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Buying beer from Stomper Kreeg when Dire Maul rolls out.
---
*sigh*
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Ooh that's a good idea thanks!
---
Sorry but this isn't a good excuse. I've moderated several subreddits with similar open ended rules and we frequently discuss these topics, particularly when they come up in modmail. It's also good practice to check removed posts and reevaluate other peoples removals to check that there is a **consistent** moderation policy.
---
Given the lack of modmail responses I'm guessing there's little communication or care about consistency.
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
I plan on needing on whatever dungeon set piece that drops from Drak that my friend needs and when I win I will tell him that it is payback 15 years in the making from when he as a mage rolled need on my Devout chest piece that I only ever saw drop once thus never able to get a complete set DESPITE healing for that fucking dungeon every day for weeks. He apologized and said he thought I had it already, I shall tell him the same when I equipt his chest piece.
---
iirc it had something to do with an engine change in cata that they just never reverted. some of the new expansion zones have heavy rain but its nowhere near vanilla levels, really sad :/
---
Never knew about the snare penalty! Definitely makes sense though.
---
Oooh that's exactly the info I wanted you're the best!
---
And in some sense, it is more efficient leveling per hour played since you are tapping into that rested XP constantly.
---
Exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much!
---
Do the games work on newer PCs? Have they made any improvements to them? I know reforged is the overhaul but have they done any QoL to the old version?
---
\&gt;Implying speed running is the benchmark for being good at the game.
---
Sorry for the spam I'm not used to posting on reddit I thought you guys sent me inboxes... Haha
---
I suppose everyone is a guy on the Internet. Here I am trying to be progressive in 2019.
---
If my eardrums are 30 where were they the other 14 years?
---
No because that's pointless and not fun, there's plenty of ways to make leveling more challenging or interesting
---
Yes I miss the days of herds of Tauren running in circles to keep their plainsrunning active.  Bring this back for our entertainment Blizzard.  PLEASE!
---
Get the Black war tiger mount and show it in stormwind. And my level 19 twink rogue being full Defias set.
---
One of my friends is a wotlk baby. He thinks people are going to hate the flaws in classic. I told him it’s not about the flaws it’s the community, effort, and reward in social reputation that attract me. I want to matter in an mmo be an integral part of a group in modern wow players are disposable and that’s a bad design for an mmo.
---
I for one feel this is a high effort meme. Pls spare him mod overlords
---
Oh gotcha, got it backwards in my head.
---
They are towards the end with a bunch of pvp alts leveling engineering.
---
People will downvote out of anger, but this comment is the most accurate in this thread. I'll be damned if Classic launches in 2019.
---
Yeah the bottomless fucks, they literally need to eat high level food every minute until their loyalty ranks. I still remember when my first pet up and booked it I hadn't noticed and was trying to take on two mobs at once, that shit was not a happy day. Fairly certain they just become hostile again, right? I think one time it happened in town and the guards fucking stomped it, could be misremembering though.
---
If you keep the CD box you bought the authentication key will immediately get your acc back. I did that after 12 years :)
---
NEWS FLASH: We cleared BWL and AQ40 with people's mothers and girlfriends in our guild, on shitty DSL connections with overheating Walmart PCs and maybe 4-5 guys understanding how to Min-Max. 
---
Everyone wants to gatekeep 15 year old content or create "wow classic content" that is 6x the length it needs to be to give their insight based on the most cancer of cancer Pserver autistics, saying you will never get a raid slot etc.. I can't wait to see these goobers fill 40man raids full of spergs and their 15 2h Fury warriors can fight over loot.
---
Paladins are an absolute cake walk in my recent experience. They are beast aoe farmers in dire maul and they use the least amount of consumes in raid due to their crazy mana efficiency. They also have a relatively easy gearing path all throughout the game since they can wear cloth-plate. 
---
Healers in general are the most in demand you shouldn't ever have a problem finding a guild. They also use the least amount of consumes though priests and shamans especially will be more reliant on mana pots than pallys but those are usually pretty cheap.
---
Tanks and melee dps are usually the most competitive and use a ton of consumes. Hunters are an enigma, sometime there are too many of them and other times you can't find one if you try. Casters  are usually less played than melee and their consumable usage depends entirely on whether or not your in a guild where people regularly flask or not.
---
A horde without blood elves,
---
If someone wants to play as a generic waifu ,pick alliance
---
Same but my wife gets mad anything over 4 nights a week lol
---
I.e. you prefer Paladns.
---
The limit doesn't really fix the problem, if anything it make it worse. It basically dictates your play style to "You must play for 45 minutes per night." or whatever some psychologists have determined is the optimal time to form a gaming habit without you rage quitting. Vanilla free-form system is so much better. Feel like binging for a weekend then taking the week off, go for it. Feel like taking a vacation? No big deal, you can make up for it any time.
---
As a hunter I can do a 2-3k burst on a mage. You oneshot them even harder!
---
Enjoy your addiction lol
---
Vee - PEE - ANN , is the correct
---
dont think its bannable , but why do you want to use an VPN ?
---
(After re-reading myself it appears that it can look like I'm bragging but it's not the case, I'm a noob in most game but the average skill of the current vanilla wow playerbase is just awfully low)
---
Retail and Vanilla are two different games, I couldn't agree more on that.
---
Vanilla is, as you said, slow paced, and thus people playing on this version of the game since a long time are used to this slow pace and adopted it.
---
I myself experienced it as I played Vanilla for a few years then switched to a MoP server to climb the pvp ladder and oh was I surprised by the difference of skill between these two games.
---
I then played a bit of more fast paced game like CSGO and LOL and came back two years ago to the vanilla Pserver scene.
---
I don't see the game as I did before, everything seems very slow, PvP is a joke against 95% of the current vanilla playerbase and PvE is just way too easy as long as you're able to follow (very) simple instructions.
---
The slow pace in dungeon is only imposed by the vanilla-only player that think they're are the best because they play the same game since 2004, I convinced some friends to try vanilla (they never played wow before but are pretty good at gaming) and we rushed dungeon like I never did before, chaining packs of mobs without down-time because they understood resource management &amp; placement as well as game mechanic (CC, kiting, threat,...) way better than the majority of those who play this game for 10+ years.
---
Raid is effectively a bit more complex but only due to the fact that it requires 40 peoples to be coordinated.
---
I never stood a foot in any raid other than ZG for nearly 10 years then after having played newer xpac and more fast paced games I got recruited in one of the top guild of my former server (LH) to raid AQ40 as I wasn't even in full pre-bis and only logged-in for raid, no consumables, no profession.
---
Retail players are more able to adapt to change and imo the average retail player will be way better than the average (current) vanilla player.
---
The only think that I see that could make a difference is the time investment.
---
People tends to play multiple games now and won't have the time to play as much as those playing only vanilla.
---
Hope I didn't make too much english error :)

I bet we see 60's just over a week in classic.   People have routes engraved in their heads from all the pservers.
---
I'm going to try and poopsock as much as possible for a week(if we get a friggin launch date so I can take PTO) and hopefully get to 40/45 in a week.
---

Just FYI, enchanting will very likely cost you more gold then it will make you. The only way to make money from it is to be one of the very first to obtain the best formulas and then be very diligent about hawking your services.
---
The brewmaster always felt like a joke to me. Not game play wise, but just the fact that we was a drunk fire breathing panda. It fit wc3's sense of humour well. But that's just it, there was only one of him, and he felt like a joke. Then they came out with MoP... people defending it saying pandas were in wc3 was like hearing people defending a Diablo game based just on the secret cow levels.
---
As far as I know, they're the exact game as they were at the time they had been released. I am not 100% sure on that though, as my memory is foggy and I haven't even finished the original games during their time.
---
They work perfectly fine on my PC though, so that shouldn't be a problem.
---
You underestimate how much time the average player wastes standing around in the auction house and aimlessly exploring..  
---
20 days will be very close to the average, for sure.
---
No that would be a Rogue that steals it.
---
&gt;"I have no counterargument so I'm just going to accuse you of not reading"
---
okay
---
good for you then, I definitely wouldn't raid MC as a fire spec mage whilst progressing
---
Spirit and Stam should still take weight over shadow damage
---
They have a hard time since threath build is not great, and they only have 1 taunt on a very long cooldown. And dps that are used to warriors tanking will nuke accordingly and a paladin can never compete on that front.
---
The fact that dungeons weren't dungeons, they were Instances. Group zones that had more difficult content and unique stories and loot, not a place that just had bosses to kill just cuz. 
---
This meant some were actually interesting and large, not just a room for bosses
---
Its not corporation stuff ... ffs.
---
It is because most people have only three anwers: sure, nope, don't care and trying to make them use some  point scale is pointless and confusing.
---
I wish for classic release date.
---
There are 5 rules.
---
*A night elf priest would like to know your location*
---
Lol, bad advice, at least in the context of classic wow. Mounts are a very important factor in your survival and you definitely don't want to be walking everywhere. You don't need to spend gold on useless spells like dampen or detect magic etc. Gear is important, but it can be managed through quest rewards.

https://discord.gg/x8z7tgT
---
I AM WITH YOU!
---
I think it's fine as long as you have realistic goals. If you expect to be raiding and farming a legendary and rank 14 in pvp... then you won't have a good time.
---
If you just want to run around and play in a big, immersive world again where community means something... I think you can have fun.
---
My worry is that the last 14 years have conditioned people to play WoW a certain way and classic just shouldn't be played that way. I just hope the server populations are healthy enough for us stragglers. Can't wait to do Wailing Caverns and Zul'Farrak and Sunken Temple!
---
While I would LIKE to be able to compete in world pvp... I know I probably will be gankfodder. /shrug
---
At the end of the day, I think 5 hours a week on classic will be more fun than 5 hours a week on retail. I guess time will tell!
---
oooooof...so I've been talking to this girl for awhile.....she wants to be official but in my head I'm like "I cant have a girlfriend for Classic launch"...I'm a terrible person.
---
I didn’t downvote you. Also, if you’re going to go around calling any response to your opinion “useless”, then you deserve those downvotes. It may be bitchy in here, but it’s because we got assholes like you to deal with.
---
\+ AV wolf at exalted
---
I'm pretty sure priests can solo things just fine, it's just not going to be as easy as a warlock with a literal tank pet. I've seen some videos of priests farming lashers for money with holy nova, so I'm sure you'll be able to handle most things despite not having it as easy.
---
You're being a sperg about this, chill out.
---
Well sucks for you they already confirmed the new mouse over fishing thing is gonna be used
---
Memes &gt; mods
---
As have I, I wish we could get a confirmation on this as I'm leveling a warrior myself.
---
Equal to or greater than fun? Wow must be a good spec
---
Amazon. Like 5 bucks each
---
By interfere I mean having to double check things that were already correctly blizzlike because testers keep pointing out differences where there are none. Seems like the constant false-alarms would just be an inefficient use of dev's time.
---
Or less
---
What about simply not being able to link achievments?
---
Same here. I am hoping for more than 1, but its a crap shoot. I'd like to get a bunch of us who have similiar time constraints and make a guild.
---
30 days of actually playing seems right, I leveled at a normal pace while having a gf and a job and it took me about 30 days spending most of my free time playing
---
I’ll be in a similar boat. Thank god for rested xp
---
Class quests. And I only think this answers your question from Blizz's perspective. They're the only ones that seem to think class quests are insignificant
---
I was thinking the same thing, but I decided I wanted to play the campaign before classic wow, and it's looking like reforged is coming our after classic. It's also kinda nice seeing the game in its original graphics, again it sets the tone for classic wow well.
---
They are QOL, not affecting gameplay.
---
Only real post in this entire thread.

You thought of that?

Not that I'm aware? I'm using [this blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/demon-summoning/116855)  as a source so it's possible that my knowledge is out of date.

Full story of Illidan gong ringing:
---
Leading up to the opening of AQ there were two people horde-side who were fed the carapace fragments.
---
Piccolo &lt;Team Ice&gt;
---
Zxtreme &lt;Blood Legion&gt;
---
To set the stage, TI and BL were the top 2 horde guilds and while we were friendly with each other we were also competitive with raid kills
---
Other guilds on the server joined the effort and farmed fragments to supply one of those two players, basically creating a separation on the horde of two sides funneling resources to TI or BL.
---
Rombus, the guild leader of TI made an agreement with BL to let Zxtreme ring the gong after people were able to get home from work around 5-6pm so everyone could experience the event.
---
This decision did not sit well with many TI members, myself being one of them.  We were the dominant horde guild on the server, why were we letting BL ring the gong?
---
When the server came up after maintenance around 2pm people gathered in Silithus.
---
If you know Illidan...it was one of the most heavily populated servers at that time, and continues to be today.  With that many people gathered in one spot, the server was continuously disconnecting people and Silithus was in an eternal state of massive lag with people running in place, etc.  Totally unplayable.
---
We were able to field about 35 people for a raid group at 2pm, but absent of Rombus who was still at work.
---
So picture the situation.
---
You have a bunch of us in Ventrilo, ready to get into the new raid and get bosses down for that sweet loot and server 1sts.
---
People swarming the gong in Silithus making the server unstable and unplayable and people who so desperately want to play the new content can't even stay in game.
---
The solution?  Open AQ so people can get into the instances and stop the lag.
---
Piccolo is a very nice, quiet guy.  Definitely would not have rang it had it not been for the peer pressure, a lot of it from me echoing in vent "Only you can save us Piccolo, end the suffering and ring the gong!".
---
Eventually he gave in and rang it.
---
Much drama followed on our aptly named realm forums illidrama[.]com.
---
--------------
---
&lt;Permafrost&gt; [H] ended up getting the server first AQ boss kill on Prophet Skeram.
---
&lt;Saga&gt; [A] got the rest of the server firsts except Viscidus which we got, and Ouro which &lt;Warpath&gt; [A] got.
---
This Illidan history lesson brought to you by,
---
Top &lt;Team Ice&gt;
---
&gt; Getting tools that are both weird AND situationally useful. For example, I hear there's this staff that let's you breath underwater. That'll be useful for exploration and questing.
---
It's called Hydrocane and it's from Gnomeregan (Viscous Fallout). I actually have had this in my bags on my Warrior since vanilla, just on the offchance I end up fighting someone under water and I might be able to win by making them drown if I switch to that weapon. It hasn't happened yet...

For me I'll have to neglect sleep. Wife goes to bed around 10 most nights. Kids wake up at 7. So my playtime is mostly contingent on how much sleep I can go without.
---
I never really saw the "difference in absurdity" between pandaren and tauren, even worgen. They are all just humanoid versions of animals.
---
And the pandaren were written better than all of them: they actually had a recorded history that went far back.. orc history was basically "they warred a lot lol"
---
Autists do tend to shout at people like that
---
Most of my friends stuck with Dark Age of Camelot and only joined WoW in WotLK or later. Now those who didn't play Vanilla WoW are really hyped for Classic, and those who **did** play it are really skeptical because they remember all the bad things as well.
---
Good idea ;)

Spirit only works out of combat so is generally worthless since you want to be constantly pulling. Just get Agi and Stam, Int a distant third, your pet and auto shots do most of the work when grinding.
---
I wonder how many actually remember how grindy it was. I mean I was 13-14 when i started playing, I got the BC battle chest a few months after it released and I don’t think I hit max level till like the end of WotLK. Granted I barely knew what I was doing throughout all of BC and only started seriously playing when WotLK came out.
---
Don't fret. 2-3 years from now, the vast majority of players will be singing the same tune.
---
I provided you with several counter arguments that you deliberately ignored, and instead decided to quote one part out of context and reply to that.
---
If you're going to try and be clever, at least be convincing.
---
The long and tedious walk back to town when your armor gets damaged while questing.
---
So you don’t think that Brack has to get approval for WoW projects?  Because I’m sure he does.  Nowhere in your quote does it say “he makes all decisions for World of Warcraft and requires no approval from his superiors for new projects that will cost millions of dollars as well as other company resources.”
---
Maybe you already knew that, if so then please disregard.
---
I guess my main issue was that they didn't really get their story fleshed out in wc3. It felt more like it was made up afterward so they could release mop. That said, you're right, tauren are silly. Worgen less so simply because werewolves are apart of a lot of existing fantasy. I guess I like the tauren because you meet them in wc3, and they play an integral role in the formation of the early horde. If you had gone to pandaria in wc3 maybe ide have different feelings.
---
Why wait until phase 2? The level 30-40 players won't yield honor to a 60 anyway. Just start in Phase 1
---
Isn’t Illidan the same server where the funeral drama happened?
---
Sad, but true.
---
Preparing for realm first tailoring/first aid/enchanting
---
All i can say is i tested the sitting for crits in PvP myself for Reckoning charges and it 100% didnt work for that. For PvE, i heard people say it still worked. As for if Warriors were different I cant say.
---
I played TBC and raided up to Sunwell and I never did any dailies, maybe a handful. They really weren't a requirement at all. I don't know how it is in current WoW, but back then it was just a little bonus for some extra gold.
---
They’rs optional
---
so we are at the "what happens after naxx"-thingy again :D
---
its a  vicious circle

Lol broadband existed in 2005, as did PCs that are capable of running WoW. I've never played on private servers, maybe this will help: https://imgur.com/a/XsT1Ici

Thats why you force your family to play and make a guild with them
---
Few quick things: spirit stacking reduces downtime more than the +damage reduces mob kill time in the scheme of things
---
Obtaining +damage gear on launch will be cost prohibitive and inefficient for anyone wanting to level quickly. You can't guarantee that the drops come, that you can afford them, or that someone else won't beat you to buying it. Game planning to level with spell power is planning to sit on your hands while the world levels.
---
You gain more net kills per hour from getting your Mana back quicker (less downtime) than ending fights by saving 1 Frostbolt cast.
---
Additionally, spirit is readily available via tailoring items, whereas the pool of Frost and +dmg items from tailoring is not terribly deep. Around 80-100) damage might be expected for a mid level (40-50) mage, where the grind really picks up.
---
Spirit also scales with itself the more you have, whereas +damage is linear and literally only gives value when you accumulate enough to save an extra cast or two, which are massive breakpoints to try to push, and which all points between are useless.
---
1. In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
---
2. Whisk in milk, eggs, and melted butter just until combined.
---
3. Preheat a flat griddle over medium-high heat.
---
4. Scoop 1/4 cup of **pancake** batter onto griddle. ...
---
5. Cook other side until golden brown.
---
Actually that is incorrect I believe. The +15 affects at what level you can start getting the next herb but not at what level the previous herb stops giving skill-ups. Being a Tauren then makes leveling herbalism a lot easier as you can access higher level herbs when the last tier is all green.
---
Who the heck are all these people that think modern mythic raiders are more than .5% of the player base? You guys are delusional. The modern LFR player is really bad compared to a vanilla pserver player and that’s just flat out true. I know this because if you aren’t good on a pserver you don’t get to do anything because the elitists kick you from the group.
---
If you do it 99% of the time, you are already fighting the good fight.
---
only certain mobs were.
---
The problem is a majority of these players wouldn't know whether or not things like this are supposed to happen because they are going off of memory from 14 years ago. Most players won't have even played much at that time too if they do a random beta invite.
---
I am on the same page as this guy... does anyone know where i can get a good deal on some tube socks?
---
HEY WHAT'S UP GUYS
---
Priest can solo farm lashers in DM:E with enough mana and holy nova.
---
You should really check out the lore regarding the centaurs. They are a brutal abomination species between an earth elemental and a son of cenarious. When they were birthed they killed their father and began a rampant campaign of breeding and killing. They brutally fought and killed many Tauren and if it wasnt for Orc intervention could have very likely wiped them out entirely. The horde HATES the centaur clans as a whole and has really only partially allied with only 1 clan in desolace. 
---
Skinning and displaying their corpses seems natural considering the beastial, abomination nature of the centaurs and how much the Horde despises them.
---
Out of all my vanilla friends I think only one of them is actually planning on playing Classic. I would've thought it would be more.
---
Farming reputation in vanilla classic by killing minions.
---
Good stuff, low carb and high fat.
---
&gt;"haha let's not fix things because most players won't care anyway"
---
Glad you're not working for Blizzard.
---
As they announced you will just need a subscription to wow. Which will give you access to classic when it’s released and retail up to the expansion behind current content I.e legion.
---
Yea i guess i did not read everything and just wanted to point out an easy to get mount that everyone can use
---
World pvp is won by the people who are looking for fights. If your primary goal is to level, you will be at a disadvantage. In my experience, the player who engages is the player who wins, almost every single time. If you'll be looking for fights, go for it. If you want to level and leave people alone, go PvE. 
---
This only applies to the middle of the pack, as people ahead of the curve usually get there by prioritising leveling over pvping. If you play casually, you won't have a choice.
---
You got that right! It's even beyond having fun!
---
It does not work like that. It's a flat timer. X hours offline, gives X amout rested. Up tp max 1,5 lvls (?). So beeing 2 hours offline gives you doubble the amout rested XP as being 1 hour offline. 
---
(Or am i wrong? That's what i always have thought?)
---
Trying to convince my girlfriend how fun it would be to sit side by side and play together.  
---
She's not buying it so far
---
Can you not play while your wife is awake?
---
If you're in the middle of the launch zerg, every spot is a hotspot.
---
Why would you doing anything of those things? You just listed some of the most irresponsible and stupid things to do when trying to stay up for long periods of time. Anybody trying to go hard on launch week, and that has a bit of brain power will then do the opposite.
---
1. Leave your lights on, trick your body as much as possible that it is still day time.
---
2. Stretching on flight paths or when running long distances. Taking 5 minute breaks for this.
---
3. Meal prep, its not a new concept and it allows you to NOT eat like shit when you know you don't have time to cook.
---
There definetely were friendly mobs that were healable and buffable, but which ones were and werent were inconsistent. I think Nost got it wrong on the Durotar mobs, but i cant remember specific cases.
---
This. Priests are not great solo grinders if they have to go holy (aka 90% of priests) but they can AoE farm decently. Lasher farm is a little gear heavy (in my experience 6k mana or higher) but definitely not a problem if it's your main.
---
There is so much information saying 8-10 days is the average. You are just claiming something without proof. I would cite the pservers but you will just respond with "those are hardcore xDDDDD"
---
Well they are fundamentally a bear, just with a white-black color scheme. You can even change the color so you're pretty much just a bear man. It's close to a wolf-man.
---
I don't think it's fair to take points off of Mop because they didn't set up for it in wc3. They finished the Arthas storyline, did the cataclysm nonsense, so needed something fresh, and new area with a blank template.
---
It turned out a lot better than the timeline shit they pulled afterwards.
---
Im fucking lucky my dude, I met my gf while playing wow and she's pumped to play classic together. Unfortunately we're also renovating a house right now so idk how much time we'll have to play between that and work
---
Or convince her to play classic with you
---
You can’t really “leave” DM without running past Cookie, so you have to do him.  
---
Also, if run you run back out you hit a lot of pats
---
Classic launch isn't for a few months, go out with her and if she can't let you play for like a week or two during launch, well you'll see then
---
Mathil from PoE is one of the only streamers that I'll watch because of this.
---
Spell crit is rare early on and you don't really need it till you get 5/5 Illumination, so go +healing early on and stick with the lowest rank FoL that gets the job done, and use higher ranks (or HL) as your big heal for when you know you're gonna get extra large hits and then go back to the small FoL for the smaller stuff.
---
once you have illumination, you can start considering Int and Spell Crit as well. Though +healing remains a strong contender, especially for shorter fights where longevity isn't much an issue.
---
However for raids, paladin efficiency is what really separates them from the other healers and that's when you want to really start stacking spell crit, and finding a balance between amount healed and critting frequently enough that you can finish the fight.
---
if you don't have a +healing option to choose from, go for Int.
---
(It's the beards)
---
Pig tails have always been bis for alliance priest
---
Eh, I think classic represents enjoying the game all the way through (vs retail which is just an endgame bottleneck). Furthermore if you want to burn through retail, it's easy. Burning through classic will be much slower, and tougher..... which leads to fewer people trying to power through it and more people just...... enjoying it.
---
It's sort of like if you could walk across the street to pick up a check for $100,000. You'd run, not look at much and let every thing pass you by.
---
Now, imagine you have to get a check for $100,000, but its in rural China, and you live in rural Montana. Are you going to rush the entire 80 hour trip? All the driving and flying and buses and running around? No, its too much to ignore. You'd have a goal and you know you'll get there, but it's going to be a while, so you may as well enjoy the journey.

---
Oh personally I have been a raid leader for Mc/ bwl raids, I would t have an issue helping people.
---
It has to or it will flounder. Purists don't like to hear it but there's a reason MMOs update. If ret paladins remain laughable, warriors are the only tanks, and rogues and mages are the only DPS five years down the line I sure as fuck won't be subscribed.
---
Yes. &lt;Serenity Now&gt; [A]
---
IIRC Wendigos were classed as humanoids but were skinnable. I don't know if the same applies to furbolgs though.
---
My idea was to sit in IF or Stormwind and broadcast portal and enchanting services. I also figured being an enchanter would be more valuable as a guild service too.
---
I like how you subtley frame this in the most neckbeardy manner, keep it up you zoomer

Being part of the Viscidus and Ouro kills were a lot of fun.

---

---
I have a wife and kid now, and my wife is the one who makes me re-sub every new expansion, so I have a feeling I'll not a have a choice.
---
And yet people do it...all the time
---
Well yeah, of course. Having less time doesn't impede that, though. I played on a private vanilla server for a few months and I remember my first few deadmines runs. It took like..... 2 hours to get the group together (which i did while questing elsewhere), took another 15 minutes to get in the zone and get to moonbrook, then we fought our way in (another 15 minutes), then the dungeon itself took 2ish hours.
---
So, in a single saturday night, I played for about 5ish hours and did a bunch of quests in redridge, got together with a party, and ran deadmines. I don't have time like I used to, I don't typically play on week days.
---
But let me tell you, I enjoyed that deadmines run more than the 15 meaningless dungeons with faceless people in retail. We don't have to get as much done as we used to, we just need to enjoy what we are doing.
---
I feel like asking what comes after naxx and what class do I play are funny memes and all. But they are so overused right now I rather see all these posts getting deleted.
---
Hello me.
---
I'm reading that there aren't GBs with ranged attacks. I'm also under the impression a ranged attack cannot be dodged. If that's the case, reducing the dodge and GB values in the 'two-hand' table to 0% would be the situation you're working in as a hunter.
---
Yeah, I think I'll play it safe this time around. As a kid my favourite car was a Lancer Evolution, so my main and alts all had some variation of 'EvoIV' 'EvoV' and so on... turns out I was never able to purchase one.
---
There were also these mobs inside UBRS in an "unreachable" place that dropped the higher level cloth and greens. Needless to say people got in and farmed them.
---
I try to get small/short names, because they are easier to remember and pronounce for other players. Also because the short ones will be taken quickly.
---
Might try to see if Blizzard can find it for you. I opened a ticket last night and they found my account from a long time ago with my original Shaman on it. Had been hacked. Used to be a Tauren but he was level 85 female gob =(.
---
No changes makes a dead game.
---
Some people in other comments did the opposite. I agree with what you are saying but anyone with survey experience should know that people do all sorts of insane things. It takes a lot of prep to make a survey that will get any resemblance of accurate results. Unfortunately it is not as easy as you would think. Also it could be interpreted that 10 is "absolutely must have" vs "I really want it" vs "I would be totally fine with it".
---
If you find a tank buddy you can farm strat live tho
---
High five to whomever thought of that. No idea which game that started in.
---
It's classic so you gotta be like Sephiroth or Seph'roth or something.
---
Not until late 20's when you're horde!
---
By which that time the zerg will dilute out.
---
World first KT here, name's Kungen.
---
Mine too!! In astronomical terms.
---
Have fun trying to get all that
---
Thanks. 
---
Out of curiosity, why are they so bad? I just see people say never do them. I tried doing this on a pserver but it was just so awkward. Do you bind A, S, and D to action skills?
---
Impressive
---
I remember when i was like 11 or 12yo people from my guild. They were pretty much all already adults and so kind to me. I'd love to know what they're doing now because without them i don't know where i'd be today to be honest. I still remember some of their names or what they were like even 10 years later. I don't think i'll ever forget them and hopefully i'll find some people like that this summer as well :) !
---
Yes that is a worst case scenario
---
dude, you could have wished for classic!
---
don't go gnome you'll regret looking ugly af, leveled a gnome mage on a pserver to 60 and regretted it at 60
---
I wouldnt mind seeing those stats though, as people keep citing them but never actually linking their sources.  
---
I vividly remember my one friend having over 20 days played at level 40 back in the day. 8 days is not a realistic average. 12 days is getting there, but honestly anything below 15 days average is optimistic.
---
Show me a source and perhaps you can change my mind.
---
The internal alpha CDN stuff
---
30 days real time is about right if you're playing ~3 hours per day.
---
Being a no-life NEET and playing like 5-6 hours a day, I go 1-60 in about 3 weeks, and that's with dicking around leveling professions and doing dungeons.
---
Wow, I thought Cata was shite.

I have a handful of names that I've been using in MMOs for years so it's not much of a problem for me. But a strategy I use is to look up various name generators on the internet (they're all a bit different) and generate stuff for inspiration. Make a list of names that are at least ok to you, and then try adjusting some letters, or combining parts of different names together. There's obviously a lot of personal preference involved; for me I tend to prefer Lovecraftian name generators but you might prefer other types of generators like LOTR names.
---
why vendor?
---
Problem, except if we are a guild of 500 hundreds, the guild will always be empty.
---
The Quiver, and that it is visible with melee weapons and bow all at the same time. Glorious!
---
How about Alchemy on a mage? I’m debating between that and Engineering. I don’t PvP seriously. Want to break into semi serious raiding.
---
I dont like to stress the fact that the warlock rocks, but he jus does,So, for all you staff users out there, feel free to come in and post, my staff is a good one, but here is how it goes
---
1. post message in the room
---
2. LOOK IT OVER
---
3. dont report anything, i might get in trouble :)
---
and 4. Have fun!!!
---
Why do you feel the need to mention you don’t like California? You realize they produce a large portion of the food we consume in the US and prices for food would be much higher if they didn’t exist? Also they contribute a significant amount of money to the federal budget? California and 13 other states ship more tax money to Washington than they get back in federal spending.
---
Guess I'm the only one who maintains a healing and a DPS gear set while leveling... never had any issues.
---
*raises hand
---
I’m not ashamed to say that I was addicted to vanilla wow, playing extensively from 2pm-3 or 4am every night.
---
I’m older, have a wife, kids, a job... and will only be able to squeeze out a few hours a week.
---
I’ll absolutely love those few hours I’ll play, but it’ll feel a bit weird going from realm firsts, scarab lord, etc... and now MAYBE getting the blue dungeon set months down the line.
---
Here’s to a good time though!
---
Burning Crusade had you killing people who basically zero reason and Shattrath all over the lore. Resilience ruined pvp by forcing you into arenas. Flying, enough said.
---
personally i bind them to abilities because theyre so close to q w e. some people unbind w too lol and just move with double mouse click
---
Honestly this is kind of me. I'm really only going to be playing classic because I feel like I have to. After playing for years on private classic servers I feel like I've got a warm and fuzzy on classic. Essentially, for me, it becomes a constant consumable grind and it quickly reaches reaches the point where I'm raid logging to play other games (which is fine). I'm currently playing a TBC server and it's so refreshing and enjoyable. I really hope Blizz does TBC and WotLK.
---
I don't know what you're talking about.  If you randomly drop the fact you're playing classic into any conversation, people have a tendency to start giving you trophies and money and free cars and a house and also chicks are into that shit.
---
So i’ve been trying to figure this out, i’m planning on maining a shaman and am figuring out how to save on gold for 60.
---
Would it be worth skimping out on a 40 mount and using my wolf form instead or should I just buy the 40 mount?
---
Mists’s greatest strength in a narrative sense was how it was able to invent entirely new lore, *and* do it well. Not only with the pandaren, but their old mogu overlords; their mantid enemies; the mythical sha, and so much more.
---
This may be considered blasphemy, but MoP was in some way a return to Vanilla. The first three expansions served to wrap up stories introduced in WC3 or Vanilla itself. MoP was a whole new land to explore and learn about, and by God there was so much to find.
---
Ironically, WoD was a narrative failure for the opposite reason. The initial setup was ridiculous enough, but a lot of people (myself included) got over it soon enough since the leveling zones were solid on their own. However, the expansion’s “third act” so to speak was a complete and utter disaster. Archimonde is retconned back to life (it’s debatable whether it was a true retcon or not, but either way it was entirely abrupt), only to serve as a boss. He had no stage presence, unlike Gul’dan or Grommash. Grommash gets a rushed redemption arc, the new Draenei character Yrel gets rushed out the door, and all we were left with was a sour taste in our mouths.
---
So, what I’m getting at here is that inventing new lore isn’t a bad thing, and banking on old lore can be much worse. It’s all situational of course, but these were definitely examples of how that can be true.
---
We had arena in the final days of Vanilla.

---
There are some BiS crafted BS items, but there are plenty of Alch pots that are really good. You could get an alt and have it farm mats and use Alch and Eng. Eng is useful in PvE as well. Little extra damage from bombs and stuff can help hold agro or stun stuff.
---
That makes sense, but I'm kinda curious that if your just getting off for an hour or two is it worth it to get to an inn or is it really only worth it to do it while you sleep?
---
Amazing
---
You can still play but you won't be 60 by the time AQ opens.
---
Being the only troll female warrior on the server sounds super appealing to me. Go for it dude, trolls are awesome.
---
It really started with TBC and protection paladins.
---
This isn't even a joke.  My non-rent monthly expenses were $650/mo when I played wow.  Now my non-rent expenses are closer to $3.3k  :(
---
You want to heal or dps?
---
I've been keeping a running list for months. Generally have it narrowed down, but always on the lookout for upgrades.
---
Rip bag space
---
joining your mom´s basement too ?
---
High warlord kungen**
---
You’re going to get extra bonus Hanks for being a priest- no two ways about it. But they can solo kill stuff no problem even as holy because of SP. PvP servers it’s always better to group up for farming at 60. Leveling is just leveling so it’s worth the grind if you like it...but you are the easiest class to gank just behind warrior.
---
Lots of people trash BS/LW on this sub. They don't realize how satisfying it is to create your own gear. These are the same people who say how much more meaningful gear was in vanilla.
---
It's pretty evident that X-server BGs will be a thing in Classic.
---
I had fun for a month in Cata doing the heroic dungeons before they nerfed it.
---
It kind of comes down to supply and demand, weapon chains, Spurs, and maybe some shield spikes are all things that you could repeatedly sell. However, they’re not big cash items. Your rare patterns (arcanite reaper, Lionheart Helm) will sell for a pretty penny but are super expensive to craft and only a handful of people will have the cash to buy them.
---
Engineering is really the “go-to” profession for melee as there is a lot of utility in vanilla that you can’t get anywhere else
---
Alliance is better in pvp because Paladins are so strong in pvp.
---
Remember back then, the naysayers and normies saying that 'your internet friends are not real friends' or some such variation heh.
---
Now we got things like the Skyrim grandma on youtube.
---
Why vendor the skins?  Up until thick leather they wont go for much on the AH for a couple reasons.  No one will have gold to buy them and the amount of skins will be enormous.  I wouldnt be surprised if people that dojt know any better put skins on the AH for less than vendor price.
---
youre some semigod for pre nerf cthun HAIL hippoofdoom
---
If you can manage an hour a day thats a lot in a week
---
Yea but that alt is now 13 years older. Don’t you think he’s feeling a little left out? You know the saying... “a vanilla man’s alt, is a classic man’s savior.”
---
Just be first and steal all the cool names like Bob.
---
trade off is playing the most boring class in the game 😴
---
As someone who’s only been playing WoW since the end of WoD, I don’t have much experience with pre-cata lore - or landmarks for that matter. Stayed away from private servers for the most part too.
---
What zones are an absolute must for lore and overall seeing things in a pre-cata world. What storyline’s did/do you guys enjoy that isn’t in live, and what now destroyed areas need to be seen.
---
They are talking about 20 days played not real life time most players will take 2-5 months to hit cap.
---
No, I would rush to get that 100k check in rural China, this is a terrible analogy.
---
Vanilla ended in 1.12.1. It never happened in Vanilla.
---
It did however happen at the very beginning of TBC, before people could officially enter outland.
---
Since there is no high level trash outside of Kara in Vanilla. It's a bunch of level 58-60 ghosts.
---
The closest thing you'll get to something TBC-ish in Vanilla is the Of Sorcery items the Wind-stone mobs can drop. 
---
Which are pretty much identical stat-wise to the Of Sorcery items in TBC. Except they only drop that specific sub-set of enemies, where TBC made sorcery a regular loot suffix for 57+ outland gear.
---
As someone who played a fresh private server with a decent (not great) guild I can assure you this won’t be the case. Most raiders in my guild were half pre-bis or more going into MC and it wasn’t difficult to kill any boss persay but by the time you have enough raiders hit 60 to be able to run MC weekly, most of your raid will be pre-bis geared minus a few of the harder pieces to obtain. I didn’t play a ton and have two kids and a wife and was mostly pre-bis going into MC for our first raid.
---
&gt;water for the healer
---
and AI
---
My holy priest raids mythic twice a week. Neck 49 so no point in rushing to 50. Geared up. No alts at 120 because I get bored too quick. 
---
So naturally I’m playing another priest on a faraway realm and having way more fun in the Barrens. 
---
BfA is practically designed to be raid logged.
---
I took a close up pic of this the other day lmao
---
As someone maining Druid, I’ve accepted that I’ll just have at LEAST one bag full of my secondary set (feral) and pvp items.
---
Another bit of hybrid tax :p
---
This is a good one i made sure my name will be easily pronounced as i want to group up heavily as no one i've met has been able to pronounce Knetka first time ive met them (K is silent)
---
i'd like to try get some silly simple ones for my alts like
---
FirstAid (ill be a hunter who doesn't have first aid)
---
I always try and use variations on different fantasy names ie Warhammer. Lord of the rings and so on
---
That’s not true at all. MC is a cake walk with a few technical challenges here and there. ZG is much easier to wipe and requires the most coordination of the two raids for a couple of the boss fights. If you’re talking about ZG once most the raid is BWL/AQ geared then yes, it’s easier. But at that point you’re so far ahead of progression that MC could be done with 25 people or less
---
okay legolas, but in orgrimar it's DM
---
Is it true that horde get a green fishing rod that alliance cant get?
---
Because that's what I don't like. Just like someone will never touch a tank class. Preferences. 
---
Everyone has their preferences.
---
Not having to see stupid pandas everywhere.
---
Says the guy posting a bitchy comment lol
---
You should buy a mount. That extra movement speed will save you a lot of time between levels 40-60
---
From my experience it’s harder to get people to offtank than it is to get them to be a full time fury dps
---
Jokes on you, 'cause it was a 419 phishing scam, so at least the guy above you got a cool world-wide vacation out of the deal.  You just got travel expenses, jet lag, and disappointment.
---
me too
---
Where the fuk did you get that quote from lol?
---
The link Minkelz provided in another comment was actually very handy. Check that out for the real data!
---
I hope your friend tries it out.  I think people like your friend will be pleasantly surprised how rewarding the social rewards are in Classic.  Doing a good job in a pug and having them call you out and tossing a friend invite feels great.
---
Re-read the title mate, he's saying an 1-3 hours a **week** so like 20 minutes a day if he is including weekends too. I assumed he meant 1-3 hours a day as well but I honestly cannot see him gaining anything from this.
---
And once you go endgame and just spam raids/dungeons are a pure healer without the ability to go cat or bear, you will put all that gear in the bank and fill your bag with consumables instead.
---
Mana potions, a few healing ones to be sure, fire(mc bwl)-shadow(bwl)-arcane(mc)-nature(aq) protection potions, limited invulnerability, mageblood, mana oil, mage water, dew/mana biscuit as backup, spirit booze from ogres, bandages (for those times you need to regen mana), sagefish/nightfish delight/soup
---
WoW I think...
---
In the beta, it was originally going to be a detriment as well if your character wasn't rested.
---
And the Scotts, aka the dwarves, are far north from this.
---
Go herbalism/alchemy and farm gold by gathering.
---
They are still a sentient humanoid species. Still fucked up to display their skinned bodies like that. Basically equivalent to displaying a skinned human.
---
I can, but neglecting the wife to play video games every night is a good way to get an unhappy wife, and I kinda like her so I'll try to avoid that. So I'll likely have to pick and choose instead of every night. I'm sure I'll have a talk with her that the first week or so I'll be playing every night, but after the initial excitement I'll cut back a bit.
---
I prefer meme's to people on youtube reading a blue post that I already read myself back to me. Opps hit the 10 minute mark better cut the video there!
---
Yes, it's true. The quest is available at level 44.
---
He’s level 35 actually, this isn’t a screenshot from vanilla
---
I like medium names with a good 2-4 letter short version, personally.
---
Plus as its pre VE nerf shadow healing is pretty powerful as it happens.
---
Summer 2019
---
There were very few mobs like this iirc.  Only thing that comes to mind are the Guards and other pvp flagged npcs.
---
That being said, these NPCs are in an area I never really spent much time in, but I think there are several of these 'pseudo towns'.  The mobs being quest mobs seems like this would be a 'pserver bug' though, as I don't ever recall any quest mobs being pvp-forced.
---
Just wait for another 15 years for wow classic classic.
---
Spellpower/nature damage rogue was a thing in tbc as a meme spec
---
Name checks out.
---
Yeah, a lot of people will be going to it after having played years of facerolling. Hard 5 man Dungeons haven't really existed for a long time.
---
I believe the pet classes were your best bet. Warlocks could fear as well, but that could cause you to aggro other mobs. I think hunters with their pets and traps are probably the best of the bunch.
---
Pretty much the entire zone outside of ICC was fucking phased.
---
Timmy
---
Everyone I know plans on coming back and I want too but at the same time I dont want to support Activiblizzard. Hell im like 90% sure ill be coming back for it even if I have to support the company to do so.
---
I forgot about that.
---
Of course, so did the mage in my last run...
---
Ah those were the days!
---
Yeah, and more power to everyone who does, but I imagine there will be plenty of the less friendly sort.
---
One strategy is to name all your toons with the same prefix but different suffix, so everyone calls you by the same shortened nickname. 
---
PATrick
---
PATricia
---
PATrol
---
PATton
---
PATches
---
PATek
---
PATomic
---
This is what I'm doing; obviously with a different prefix. 
---
And don't take naming your toons so seriously. They don't have to be super cool, RP maxed, hint at your class/spec names, like Alliefrostmage or some crap.
---
Well this is the horde we're talking about here. As an Alliance player I agree that the horde is a bunch of savage mongrels =P
---
Yep this will be me. I'll get 3-4 hours max/week. Thats just how it is now, I just want to re-experience it :).
---
neckbeards, would disagree.
---
I know the name I want, but I'm likely not going to be able to log on right at launch so I'm going to try and get my buddy to reserve it for me. We'll see. 
---
For the most part I pick names from books I've read, usually with modified spelling. So that might be a good place to start.
---
Daily quests were actually what killed WoW for me.  Having to log in, every day, to complete some trivial bullshit made it feel like a job.  In Vanilla, I'd log in and do whatever seemed fun at the time...
---
That's easy for us to say because we live in a world with a grand total of one sentient humanoid species.
---
Also 21st century and all that.  I'm sure you could find plenty of examples in human history of displaying bodies of your enemies.
---
Significantly worse if you’re main tanking in a halfway serious guild. Threat can be a real problem in raids for progression especially in fights like Vael
---
And normal people tendo to play bad?
---
I’m debating on mage vs priest and I can’t decide mostly because of priest unknowns. I wouldn’t care to heal dungeons and raids but how difficult is it to swap to shadow when I want to pvp? Is shadow terrible in pvp if I had holy gear? I have a good idea of how mage plays out but I don’t know much about priests. If shadow is garbage without proper stats in pvp I probably would go mage.
---
Without private servers, this subreddit wouldn't exist nor would WoW Classic.
---
I'm all for playing casual but seriously i don't see where the fun would be by playing wow classic for that little. A quest alone can take 1 hour, you can't even do a dungeon with this. The community aspect of the game is what makes the game stand out but you won't be able to make any bound, everyone will outlevel you so much and you'll just never make it to lv 60... I donno, i don't see the point of playing a game like classic if you're gonna miss out on everything that's fun about the game.
---
in orginal wow dident they swap the price of mount and ride skill mid game? Will they do that now too?
---
Actually typing "plz"?
---
From what I remember it was more like...
---
 Noob: gib fud
---
To be clear, the alpha "leaks" are connecting to what is essentially a private server. Them riding around on it means only that the mounts exist in the database, as should all vanilla items, whether they are available or not.
---
Ahh yea in vanilla it's totally useless.
---
sorry, i forgot to mention the 4k would be because you need about 39k rep to get exalted and as a human you get 10% more rep with diplomacy the racial passive. 10% off 39k is 3.9k (4k).
---
i dont think you should skip the cave quests, i think it would be fine to kill the mobs in there anyway, the quests will give you rep until they are green, just avoid doing too many non darnassus quests. i actually think doing just those quests will actually have you being under leveled. I recently leveled to 60 on a PS and i got there whilst doing as many quests as i could but i still had to grind full levels at times like 43-44 or 48-49. i dont think it will be too big an issue. i hope we both end up with Nelf mounts by 40 :D
---
Just found when I used to raid back in the day, some people would create drama if they didn't like what they heard...and then that would cause shit. 
---
But Edgelord is a great guild name...might have to reconsider.
---
This sequence is the most well known, and likely most used, form of stance dancing. I didn't tank in vanilla, but I remember this was pretty big in TBC. Nightbane comes to mind.
---
Oh thats tough, though a lot of the fun is in levling
---
&gt; I think the problem is that there ARE people who will try to force you to speedrun
---
Bo one can force you on anything. What happens is you join a guild and then you follow that guild's mindset/rules.
---
Instant pyros are going to bring back so many good memories of pvp'ing with the lads.
---
Plus don't forget, levelling in classic wow was hard partly because drop rates were poor, and mob density was never high enough. The power levels will move past your zone before you so you have fewer competitors to contend with :).
---
If you have a bank alt that you keep in SW/ORG to send stuff to so he can sell on AH, level him to 5 so he can get enchanting and he can DE any level item with just lvl 1 enchanting
---
I'm not happy with the mods here i shared a yt playlist of all cheesy leveling montage music and even though it had positive comments it was removed because it 'had nothing to do with classic wow'
---
Its so anal
---
As a warrior this is important. I never had any problems leveling like many other warriors, because I always had close to bis gear
---
Yup. Warlock can easily kill equal level elites with enough room. You can kill the Devilsaurs in Ungoro, even if you are a few levels under. Just dot and fear spam. Hunters also have a fear for Beast only.
---
Y I K E S
---
If a girl is not your personal healer for Classic launch, you must get rid of her.
---
I'm soo excited for classic but also idk if I want to put time in it or not. I play ffxiv and I just cant play 2 mmos at the same time so one of them would have to go. Of course the new exp for ffxiv comes out in July and excited to play it but knowing WoW is right around the corner I know I'll quit it but also in the long run idk how long classic will he supported since well what are they gonna do after classic? Are they releasing tbc? Or are they gonna go a different route because it can only go so far until it hits back to the dungeon finders and all the cross realm stuff.
---
Mage are quiet good when it come to melee, elite or not.
---
For solo elite melee or caster warlock is king, hunter is just behind.
---
Melee such as war, rogue, enh,... have the hardest time especially against melee elite.
---
class that can heal/kite like druid, ele, priest can solo elite but it's not the easiest.
---
Lmao fuck this guy. Druids are one of the best dungeon tanks, While feral can pop off on the dps and make top 5 if you have all the right consumes and crowd pummlers. While also having a skill based engaging rotation, which cant really be said for any other class. Dont let people like him bring you down.
---
Wait wait. I remember this. What was the case exactly with too many instances?
---
&gt;[Developers have scoured through **vendor lists** and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105316-itemization-in-wow-classic/)
---
I think we may have overlooked this, but the last blue post does explicitly mention going through and restoring patch-by-patch vendor data. Mounts are just normal vendor items. If what they say is true, then we should get the original epic mounts.
---
Hunter and Warlock generally. if it can be fear kited, a warlock can kill it. If there's sufficient room to run and it can't out-range/speed him, a hunter can kill it.
---
Some of the weaker elites they can just pet-tank to kill it.
---
Druids can sometimes face-tank weaker elites OR if can be rooted, wear it down via dots, if it's too dangerous to melee.
---
2 man elites a lot of classes can potentially solo depending on their exact mechanics, though warriors may need consumables or their big CDs to do so.
---
3 man elites tend be MUCH harder and generally you need someone who can kite or root, or a pet tank, if possible.
---
4 and 5 man depend entirely on their immunities and abilities.
---
Some can be kited pretty easily. Others can't.
---
You should tell that to the Gnolls....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/20wx7s/this_is_actually_pretty_morbid/
---
It will feel like a lot in pvp due the prevalence of humans.
---
This
---
Really? I love being OT. Of course, I’d love to be MT, but that hasn’t happened for me yet. But it’s a thoroughly engaging job (but you have to be ready to die more than the entire rest of the raid).
---
Yup, this is why i quit retail. Had 2 friends playing it and they lasted a month when it came out. Sadly, blizzard seems to have lost touch with their core fanbase. The raids are top notch but that's about all I'll give them.
---
Imagine someone who has not been closely following Classic and therefore has no reason to expect sharding, that person logging in and having one of the first experiences be a sharding incident would be really bad.
---
Rofl imagine believing that.
---
Amen.
---
Assuming you start from scrach, you don't need to buy anything to play classic, just pay the monthly subscription.
---
But if you remember anything from your account (like an old email) you should try to contact blizzard. Maybe you'll be able to recover it.
---
Boo to rested xp, MMOs should be a painful experience, you should need to group up till kill single mobs, death should come with an xp penalty and it should ideally all be done through a tiny view port on an already small monitor.
---
/em shakes fist at young people these days.
---
Retadin huh. Might as well go 0/0/0
---
I got mine back that I hadnt logged into since 2007. My account email showed non existent.
---
&gt;Then I played a popular private server that launched with the fixed exp rates. I played the same race/class and I had much better knowledge of the game. This time it took me about 11 days played, and I was semi-rushing to 60 at the time. I was skipping dungeons, PvP, etc.
---
Should be noted that this server you are talking about launched without a bunch of really good quest hubs which got added later during Vanilla. Classic will have all these quest hubs in from the start.
---
This is me, for once I'm maiming something that isn't a warrior. A tryhard retardin!! Good news is I already have a group of 5 to dungeon with so I can get away with it
---
Yes please. Having a post removed because "rogues are in current wow" to then see the exact same meme at the top of the subreddit the next day is something of a piss take.
---
Worth considering if you're going PvP/PvE. As a shadowpriest there isn't much you can't solo to be honest but as a holy priest you're pretty much no1 target.
---
The thing is that pacing a dungeon correctly in vanilla really comes down to experience. Some packs you can chain pull, some will straight up murder you or at least increase your downtime by a lot. On top of that some mobs have unique mechanics you just have to know.
---
The average WoW player is obvisouly not good or even tries to be. You always need to be aware of that. I doubt it is very different with retail players. The top retail players apparently have good mechanics so they will adapt easily.
---
I also come from a competitive gaming background. SC2, CS:GO, DotA, OW to name a few. But the skills you learn in competitive games don't translate to vanilla, except for PvP. Vanilla is all about efficiency, ressource management etc. For example I recently started tanking and I first had to learn to gauge the general skill level of my group. Are they using CC reactively? Do they use LoS? Where and how do they move when in trouble? How do they manage their ressources?
---
If you can quickly learn what your group is about then you'll be a "good" PvE player in vanilla. Some competitive team games are also about that, but there you often have player ratings so you know what to expect. This is why experienced vanilla players are cautious and always start slow. They know that the group might consist of vastly different types of players.
---
Good one!
---
I wish classic came out already so i could play it instead of watching memes
---
yeah...but we don't know if that was a thing in vanilla OR a unexpected result of when they messed with how Rogue poisons worked in mid-TBC to make them more useful, due to complaints that damn near every raid mod was immune to poison.
---
&gt;But people still do this mistake in a lot of aspects of the game. One of those things is consumables. For speedrun guilds it absolutely makes sense to run raids in full consumables. But in terms of overall efficiency it doesn't seem right to farm that much stuff.
---
I disagree with this. Consumables can be farmed solo on your time time. Meanwhile the time you have available after making 40 people sync up their schedules to raid is infinitely more valuable, and using consumables to shorten the time you spend in the raid means the chance of running out of time to clear the raid gets drastically reduced.
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
It's okay, you can be a baddie and still find a group with like minded individuals
---
Good point
---
Combine with hand of Edward the odd for fun times.
---
Problems though, at melee range you only need to be 1.1x tank threat to pull agro, at range you have a larger buffer since you need 1.3x tank to pull.
---
Also you've now put yourself into range of a large quantity of AoE effects, and increased the chance you'll need to move during an important cast and thus lose it. 
---
It could be a situational thing like you say though, and you can do a build with it that gets all the good balance support stuff at the cost of not being able to afford points for the damaging spell talents.
---
Yeah that's worth mentioning and I wasn't thinking about it when I made my post. It's not a ton of extra quests, but I did struggle a bit in the 40s where those Searing Gorge and Hinterlands quests would have filled in the gap a bit.
---
Jokes on you, I never had any social skills to begin with!
---
You definitely can't skin furbolgs. I remember that clearly.
---
Because almost all of the paladins arent retri that have saved int gear from quests and shit in their bank...
---
I assume you're talking about the screenshots from people ingame on that client? its a sandbox and any creature model can be mounted using a command so it doesn't confirm anything unfortunately, I could mount a gnoll if I wanted to.
---
Truth be told, the Alliance has it coming.
---
And even moreso, the Horde has it coming.
---
But especially the gnomes.
---
Anyone who posts videos for views on YouTube is suspect u suppose
---
So you never buying a mount?
---
Lol, not a chance. They aren't treating it like a front-line release, and I doubt they'd wait that long.
---
Huckleberrydruid
---
Yeah those levels were hard. Which is probably why they added in the extra quests in the first place hehe. I spent 43-45 grinding Nagas south of Feathermoon Stronghold, and then 47-50 grinding beasts in northern Feralas.
---
Does shaman have some additional stun resist or something
---
Haha no I never did but I was trying to be cheeky as in this is what i would compare it to.  I mean.. Cmon the whole thread here is sarcastic is it not?
---

---
You are greatly underestimating their commitment to classic.
---
I thought cata was good up until Dragon Soul
---
Damn that sucks, so alliance can only get a better fishing rod through the STV event which is harder than completing naxx :(
---
Yeah well that’s just 2019 gaming culture. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
yes I have read his post about speed running a paladin, hence my comment ;-)
---
I would kind of like to become less interested for a few months. It just isn’t happening.
---
Ignoring that this won’t happen, I also don’t remember Blizzard doing E3 at all in recent years.  Am I wrong?  I’m pretty sure they stick to Blizzcon.
---
That depends if you count the 2.0 pre TBC patch as vanilla.
---
I personally don't.
---
I'm not saying they aren't committed. But I am referring to last quarter's earnings report where Classic was not even referred to in their 2019 outlook.
---
Oh nice find! I think that’ll work just fine for all of the 1.12 stuff.
---
Still better than the “Holy Shock” you got when that priest took you into the back room for some 1-on-1 “counseling”
---
Thunderfury scaled with spellpower for a while. There was a rogue on my server with it, covered in spellpower gear. The proc damage was insane.
---
I mean the video alone displays that no? Retail you will 1 shot something where as on classic you need to plan out pop all CD's use ranged spam gouge and gain distance etc etc. 
---
Sure its not "difficult" on the level of say comparing rag to mythic argus but it has its own level of challenge and this is a level of challenge that every player can experiance so most will say its harder. 
---
I mean I slept through the first couple months of BFA yet was still downing a few mythic bosses yet it still feels harder (also more fun but hey ho) to take a single mob as a warrior and having to pop all CD's or hamstring, Rend, Kite the mob than it did doing mythic Uldir.
---
If they didn't announce it as a major release to their investors I doubt they view it as one.
---
-The AH is only for selling things while leveling not buying, you'll want that gold for mounts/spells
---
-If you pick a class with healing spells understand you'll be pigeon holed into healing most of the time in pve group content, so if you primarily want to tank or dps do not role a druid/pally/shaman/priest
---
Correct, they don't really do E3 since they have their own convention that's pretty huge.
---
And by the way you don't want to that to do that either
---
start charging for those services and you wont be running
---
Shadow isn't *terrible* in PvP with holy gear due to some of its talents, but without the +dmg/healing gear which you may not get through PvE you'll struggle. The only true shadowpriest set won't be available until AQ - there is plenty of gear available but the actual dps classes will probably get first dibs on it, unless you join a really enlightened guild and you're the main/solo raiding SP. 
---
If you're thinking of respeccing for raiding, just be aware its prohibitively expensive. You need to rebuy spell ranks as well. There are no dailies, no super lucrative quests. What you farm you sell and thats it. Or you get lucky with a profession.

Link a source saying otherwise?

Agreed that you shouldn't neglect your wife but she also shouldn't neglect your hobbies. It's all about balance and communication.
---
I have a feeling that there's a hidden message in here
---
"I kinda like her" - finally someone being open and honest about how men actually feel about women, including the closest ones to us.
---
&gt;It doesn't change that this image is utterly harmless in my eyes.
---
Your opinion is completely irrelevant.  
---
This may have gotten lost in the age of facebook, shitstorms and people confusing tweeting with "doing something useful", but just because you have an opinion, doesn't mean it matters, or that anyone should care.
---
The mods of this /r decided that this picture violates the rules...therefore, it violated the rules. End of story. If you have a different opinion: **Who cares.**
---
This is how reddit works. This is how every science works. This is how law works. Facts &gt; Opinions, and Opinions != Facts.
---
Well, summer isn't based on your personal life.
---
I just use a fantasy name generator. [Some of them](https://dicelog.com/yafnag) are quite good.
---
One more thing, this trinket http://classicdb.ch/?item=1404
---
This trinket is incredible for world pvp, drops off a rare mob and  also I don’t think it’s even a 100% drop.
---
he has a huge lead in decisions and has already proven he gives zero fucks towards classic wow and aims for mass profit, all in videos and interviews
---
https://i.imgur.com/9mBWmSh.png  ;)
---
Hey man, if she doesn't understand the need for classic she's not the one.
---
I would be up for a randomized server. Things like quest giver locations, mob spawns, recipe mats, loot drops, possibly even boss mechanics. The goal would be to provide a new experience that's pretty much classic.
---
old west fall too! &lt;3
---
If this is real then smh.
---
They didn’t tell you that you are not part of the 5, they just gonna talk to you on discord while they do dungeon
---
There isn't a problem with someone being ret but it's when they insist on being dps for the group when the group needs a healer that's annoying as hell
---
If the aggressor doesn’t hit the mob it doesn’t get aggrod
---
This is how I remember it.  Also I want to say the BC paladin 20% mount speed arua was in Category 3, but that is just off memory.
---
Yeah, but unfortunately not at/around launch.
---
Nah, Shaman are just prone to getting stun locked to death because they have no hard CC or pocket mobility like Blink
---
Nop.  
---
They don't announce anything at E3, since they have their own convention.
---
Well we all know each other in real life and I tend to coordinate the group. Someone else wanted to try prot warrior this time and my buddy always heals. I'm safe 🤣
---
They fixed this at some point.  Then the next solution was to DoT all the mobs and have the high level char leave group and zone out of the instance so the DoTs would kill the mobs.  The Stockades was a prime place for this.
---
That's honestly a pretty sweet addon and I think that would get made. But I imagine it would have problems accurately calculating stuff like AH items and materials, and just use vendor prices?
---
I really don't understand why this ever got removed. Taking care of your pet was like the main draw to roll a hunter for a lot of people. 
---
Now we just have really realistic robots that serve you tirelessly.
---
Go skinning/leatherworking. Create green items to DE with all the leather you skin. She can create more green items with tailoring. Between the two her enchanting should stay current.
---
Don't rush too much. Seriously. Leveling in Classic is much harder and takes commitment. Trying to rush leveling too much is likely to end up with a burn out. Taking breaks in between to work on professions or earn some gold can break the monotony up.
---
My absolute favorite genie joke is:
---
**Genie:**  You have released me from the lamp!  I can now grant you one wish.
---
**Man:**  I wish for peace in the Middle East.
---
**Genie:**  Oh boy, that's a tough one.  There's been constant wars in that region for millennia.  Why don't we try something else.
---
**Man:**  Ok.  I wish I understood women.
---
**Genie:**  Peace in the Middle East, you say?  Your wish is my command.
---
You are right about the tanking but a feral with full consumes and crowd pummellers will not make top 10 dps assuming the other dps are of roughly equal skill and gear.
---
They do plenty of dps but won’t compete with the Rogues, warriors and Mage’s at the top.
---
Play Paladin so you can play it in addition to watching memes.
---
WC3 is the most influential video game of all time imo
---
I'm gonna say what no one else will, even though its hard to tell when this sub is serious..
---
If you think there is any chance in hell of falling in love with this girl, you would be an idiot to not prioritize her over Classic WoW. Classic will be there. Form good memories with her. That doesn't mean you can't play WoW. But if you're seriously in a place where you're hesitant about her due to wanting to poopsock Classic WoW, if there is any chance you could fall in love with her, you'd be a damn idiot to not priotize her.
---
Smart man.   Luckily classic is awhile away.  I've been single for 3 years...by choice.  It's all about not settling.  We shall see. Thanks for the unexpected advice my dude!
---
It's not really night shift, more evening, not worth shaking up your whole sleep routine over.
---
The point is you can't rush a trip like that. You have to wait for certain things, you can zip across the world the way you can zip across the street. The flight overseas alone would be like 20 something hours. What would you do during that flight? Would you really not enjoy yourself at all? 
---
Would you really go to China and just.... ignore everything everywhere? Even if you didn't go out of your way, you wouldn't take in the sights? It's not a terrible analogy, you just sound like you aren't thinking it through.
---
You can be antsy and intolerant about something that passes quickly, but its much harder to be impatient and anxious about something that takes days. 
---
Notice how everyone is getting more anxious about release as we draw closer?
---
Not too great but it's just 4 days, people fuck up their bodies way more on the regular in a long weekend in Vegas. I think Rank 14 grind is something that would take you a long time to get over from, though
---
Having to be aware of your player interaction because you were stuck on that server.
---
At the 1-3 hours of play a week, no. But I know I am HOPING for significantly more than that, and it would be nice to get folks in that hour a night or so time frame together.
---
Go waste money on it and you’ll see that a google search is better even in 2004. It’s a fancy decoration.
---
Priests are insanely good at low-level dungeons with Holy Nova.
---
*Hands shinHardOre a lit torch*
---
"Perhaps this will help you burn your straw man argument"
---
Shadow is OP regardless of gear. Obviously it does way better with gear tho. That being said the main issue with shadow isn't gearing, but respec costs. Those are less of a factor for mage.
---
Frost mage is underrated for this. Keep them slow, keep your distance and you can take the out pretty well.
---
Bat eyes and scorpid blood weren't available at launch?
---
I agree I’m not going to push them to play they should make that decision themselves. My cousin whom i started my wow journey with is playing so we will be set with a tank healer combo.
---
I don't really mind, mained a back back in vanilla/TBC which is why I was thinking of being a clothy again but wanted something a bit different. If I roll priest I'd be happy to heal, not expecting to raid as shadow dps. But I wasn't sure if that meant I'd be overly reliant on other people to do anything outside of raids.
---
This article is using XP to calculate time to 60, so while you might be right about a lot of players, it's useless for this conversation about how long it would take someone with a goal of leveling. Nowhere does it say how much time is spent not gaining XP. It's just terrible math in the article is all
---
My bad thought you meant cards, am dumb
---
Anything with the word "Arse" is prohibited under Blizzards rules.
---
Lol. Is that a cata audio line? I remember vanilla rag sounding different
---
How would mods feel superior if they can't arbitrarily remove posts on a whim?
---
I want to PvE as I never got to raid in vanilla (only got 60 around the time TBC was coming out because I was a dumb kid with hundreds of alts). Although I do like PvP so would probably re-spec to shadow every now and then for some casual PvP/BGs
---
No judgement here, I wasn't 100% sure myself hah
---
but muh "pLay WhAt yoU waNT Bro" amirite?
---
Running up and down roads to get to quests while reading quest text. It's going to be a blast!
---
As someone who played FFXI during WoW"s primetime, I'm excited to go back to vanilla WoW and hopefully capture what FFXI did for me.
---
Aww...you guys already full? =(
---
I know where you are comming from, but how much slower is for example a BWL clear if you pop one less DPS consumable across the raid?
---
Lets take an extreme example. DPS casters fully flasked vs. no flasks. In the early stages that is about 1/4 of their +spell damage or so (rough estimation). You have 6 Mages and 4 Warlocks. Each flask costs your casters 1-3 hours of farming depending on the server economy. Let's say 2h. Is it worth to pop those on a farm raid that is going to be cleared no matter what? How much faster will the raid be cleared? What is the DPS increase on average for a pre-BiS Mage/Warlock when using the flask?
---
The thing is I honestly don't know. What I *do* know is that you can clear the raids with consumables "on demand", if you pop them when they are needed. I also know that people didn't really do the tests and calculations to figure out how much faster or slower a raid goes depending on consumable usage.
---
My guess is that people just do it because they have time and want to push higher values. People don't want to slack on the meters. The explanation you use sounds very reasonable and I heard it several times, but I suspect that nobody actually tested their assumptions properly and just say it after the fact. No offense.
---
I, as well, have never used a Hearthstone.
---
Striving for specific well known gear was so much incentive to keep playing, especially after seeing someone who had the piece you wanted. This is probably what I'm most excited for too. 
---
It's true too, I didn't remember anythings names after burning crusade. Soon after the reskins came in for all the types of raid versions etc. And transmogs took that away too
---
I don't see how undermanning wouldn't be an interesting way to push yourselves. Personally I think the speedruns are way less interesting, but maybe it's just preference.
---
I hear http://classicdb.ch/?item=13965 is better for tanking.
---
There is an easier way!  Just be level 20.
---
Ahh Everquest... Those were the days
---
So you have definitive proof that 1.4 BRE stacked with Sunder + FF + CoR?
---
What boss swing timer does your PS's Ragnaros have?
---
Does your favorite pserver even have boss parry haste?
---
I have seen enough wrong things on these recreations to know better than to assume they have it correct.  It seems everyday there is someone talking about their 1H SP melee build...
---
Blizzard has 3 options for Classic's launch.
---
1) Have horrible lag/queues/congestion at launch.
---
2) Adding a bunch of extra servers to spread players out. Then having a bunch of low pop servers in a few weeks.
---
3) Shard the early zones.
---
Every one of the options will lead to people being upset. I am totally for sharding as long as it goes away once the initial rush fades.
---
One neat tip is watch what food types your pet eats. If it eats bread, congratulations! Find a Mage and you're pretty much set!
---
The more you can play around with your abilities and mob AI, the better.  If you're just face-tanking, then I'd say a Paladin, Druid, or Hunter is probably the best.  However...
---
* If it is susceptible to fears, Warlocks are absolutely amazing.  
---
* If it is susceptible to snares, then Shamans are actually the best (just continuously frost shock).  Hunters can be amazing here as well, so long as the mob doesn't have ranged attacks and the hunter doesn't run out of ammo.  Mages are quite good here as well.
---
* If it is susceptible to roots, that's where druids come in.  It will take a while, but its doable.
---
* As long as you have ranged damage, if there is a pathing issue for the mob that you can use to your advantage, go for it.  Mobs scale hills really well, but don't like to go up and down ledges.  So if you find a low wall that you can jump on from the ground, you can get the mob to run all the way around the wall.  You just keep dancing on and off the wall and the mob is toast.
---
Now, the last point only really adds Priests to the mix, because all other ranged DPS were already covered.
---
I think the answer is that as long as you're not on a warrior or rogue, killing elites is doable.
---
Just be undead so you don’t look stupid
---
So you think they'll just casually announce it in a blog post?
---
Every hybrid should carry a healing set.
---
How many rogues would it take to 100% stunlock a mob that doesn't have diminishing returns?  Or is it even possible?
---
Troll female, next
---
gotta wait for av wolf then, your first chance on anything other than a kodo.
---
First point is especially true for a warlock as all pet abilities are bought as tomes separately, one rank at a time just like other abilities. Kind of Shamans as well due to totems, but I don't think it's as bad as Warlock.
---
Second point is true but you can level up in whatever spec you want and just keep some caster/healer gear in your bags and heal in whatever spec you want, it's not going to make much difference until DM/BRD and above. So if you want to level that Enhancement Shaman, go for it, just keep a few healer items to swap out with when you run dungeons.
---
Play orc they are way better for both pve and PvP. 25% stun resistance is god tier. Who cares about the fear break because if you are good you will stunlock a lock to death same with a prieat before they can even cast fear on you. Plus you get a bonus 25% base AP buff you can pop in stealth before you ambush a sitting clothie aka orcs are bae.
---
Nope got all my character names picked for my main account and bank alr account.
---
If you think a 12 months old can do that you’re very wrong
---
Gottem!
---
You have your preference of states? What don’t you like about California?
---
Really depends on the helm and cloak in question for me.
---
It will take a month or two of leveling (via multiple methods) to hit 60.  The plurality of people hit 60 between 10 and 15 days played.
---
The penny dropped like a piano off a building.
---
Played vanilla and pservers for years doing all content.
---
Spent 15 years wondering why 'threat gain' on KTM was more than the tanks aggro but just went with it.
---
Je suis un retarde.
---
Play Jason Hayes - Elwynn Forest.mp3
---
I feel like they make the best rogues, visually. I'm going to have trouble deciding on lore vs. numbers.
---
Dual spec and barber shops are the only thing I wouldnt mind. Dont want to spend 50 gold every week or so :(
---
Shard of the Fallen Star comes to mind but I'm fairly sure it was nerfed in 1.11 or 1.12.
---
You can do pretty much anything in a 5 man.
---
Just keep your shadow gear for farming. There's not really THAT much difference between them. 
---
And you play pretty much the same, you just don't have shadow form or mindflay. 
---
Though you'll also potentially have access to more generic +damage by then as well, so your holy spells won't be complete crap.
---
At the end of the day you're still just SWP, a few DD spells, wanding, repeat. And you'll have so much Spirit it'll feel almost like you have permanent spirit tap. (+shadow gear generally has poor spirit so spirit tap is really just raising your spirit to levels someone with more priest-oriented gear would have by default).
---
Probably. I couldn't be bothered looking around for the proper one.
---
Well, good job. Now we will have transmog and sharding! xD
---
There's a variety of good melee trinkets for threat gearing, there's nothing that touches Mark for when you want to gear for survival.
---
Those numbers sounds great for PvP situations, honestly. You make a good point about possibly not needing WotF at all... I have much to think about.
---
Yes
---
Similar but ending with roll or class my main will have tank at the end alts will be determined on a case by case basis. Thinking ports for the end of my mage and summon for warlock alts.
---
I never check the numbers, it’s not that important. Liking your characters look and vibe is very important for long term enjoyment.
---
That's a hard question to answer because there were so so many areas with a lot of rich lore connected to their instances and raids.
---
My top picks would be Burning Steppes, Felwood, WPL/EPL, and Blasted Lands.
---
But the lower levels areas like Westfall, Barrens, Stranglethorn, Badlands, and Ashenvale are all great too.
---
If I have to give one point to retail, is that they made snow look real nice as of late.
---
30 days?! Get the hell out of here. Who wrote this? 4-5 great player. 6-8 good player. 9-11 average player.
---
Thanks! Gif seems to be broken but I now see a hyperlink in the class icons as well!
---
And briefly move them into the caster/healer group to drop Mana Tide.
---
Currently play with like 6 guys that can never agree on a damn game, so we’re always playing solo or in separate groups. This will be the first time in a long time that we all will be playing the same game together. I’m mostly pumped for that.
---
Also, we will be adding like 10 of my old Vanilla buddies to play with us. People keep saying the nostalgia isn’t going to let and the game will be dead in a month, but they’re forgetting that if tons of people return, these gaming groups that have been dead for a decade will be reunited. You’ll be playing with friends that you haven’t talked to in years.
---
I usually delete mine 🤫
---
See, this is the real problem here. I say keep the difficulty of classic, but make the rewards more like retail. That way, the items aren't spoonfed because the rare monster is rare and really hard to kill.
---
I liked in WoD that there were "rare", named monsters that dropped cool stuff. I felt it needed to be tuned down considerably, but the concept was good.
---
Rares in classic are just the right amount of rare, but their loot tables are garbage. Not that loot should be the only reason to kill rares, but its a classic staple of RPGs. Generally the loot is comparable to the challenge.
---
we will see about that. I've been able to do it on pservers (lol i know) we will see about classic.
---
good point tbh
---
yes!!!
---
that's what i was thinking too lol, like that's the worst example of phasing between the two i can think of
---
Thanks a lot bro! I will use this for sure
---
Yes, for pallies and druids you will want to start banking healing gear in your 50s.
---
I’ll do it for you. Stop making stupid people famous. The stupid takes it as admiration, they take it to mean this person is worth voting for. They are not. Orange muppet is concentrated asinine stupidity and the fact that such filth was even considered for presidency is staggering levels of absurd. 
---
America never was the oh so great country they led themselves to believe it was. The propaganda they’ve endured since they were at the tit did it’s job to be sure, leading to a culture of self aggrandising egos. They can be in mortal danger, yet not call for an ambulance because of its cost (not that it actually costs half of what they are made to pay). If they want to leave the circle of stupidity, their reward is years and years of student debt. Meanwhile countries exist where having cancer does not cost a dime, and people are paid for studying. The single most unbelievably obvious example of this culture of faults is that the leading policy that got the orangutan elected was “make America great again”. That itself is fitting enough, but here’s the kicker: America just needs a wall. Like it’s some medieval castle - slap a wall around it, here in 2019, and America is great again. Never mind health care or study support, just build a wall. Land of bigotry, stupidity and asinine culture. I have a number of American friends I’ve made while travelling, and I pity each of them.
---
Can't they just... Blink past you to get in?
---
Unless you get a dedicated 5-man group, you're not going to keep a Mage locked out for long.
---
Yea you can do it for all healers if you want (and probably still heal 5mans during the process)
---
This is why I’m rolling mage first despite ultimately wanting to raid as a holy priest. Gotta get that bread
---
I think this is what most ppl do. Level as shadow priest, feral Druid, or prot/ret paladin then switch to healing at 58-60 depending on if you want to heal instances pre 60.
---
Bruh pay attention to the context here. He's breaking his balls trying to kill this thing, we really don't know if he's going to even live or not, and he's clearly very excited and into it.
---
I'm not one for fake personalities via streaming (as they're often transparent and just..... pathetic imo) but this kid made me laugh because his struggle is relatable. 
---
I respect your opinion but do you realize you didn't even comment on the content, you only commented here to complain/remark on the way he acted?
---
Ignore what irks you, remark on what makes you smile.
---
I'm guessing they will announce it via text message since we all have phones!
---
&gt;40 hours a week taking 3 months to hit 60  
---
There's just no way this is right.  I think your 20 days is wildly overestimated.  Remember, we managed to hit 60 in a reasonable amount of time as stupid 10 year olds.  With our skill and knowledge now, it'll be 3 times as fast.
---
Same boat, but told the girl about classic. She’s all cool with it, but what she doesn’t understand is that I will need something like a straight fucking week from launch - at that point she didn’t even take me seriously. You bet I’m serious.
---
Couldn’t get it to load. But if it’s like I remember just press your bind for beserker stance, hit beserker rage, change back to defensive.
---
This, exactly this!
---
Pretty sure monkeys are sentient
---
As an alt? For pvp yes it’s awesome if you funnel gold and items
---
Quality meme take my upvote
---
You'll get a lot of answers, but the reality is, it depends on how you play. I'll try to give some context, but there are people out there who have more experience on this then me.
---
If you're plan is to level solo, you'll probably have to have a DPS spec. However, DPS specs can heal as long as you guys take it slow. You just have to have the gear for it. So keep those int items in storage in case you have to heal and keep the gear up. This is gold intensive so it might not be optimal.
---
If you level as a healing spec, you're going to be waiting to go with someone so you can quest with them, and then be waiting for dungeon groups. Shouldn't be that much of an issue as dungeon grinding is a viaible way to hit max level. However, it wouldn't be optimal from a speed standpoint.
---
Healing specs CAN kill questing content, but it's going to take a significant amount of time. 
---
So depending on your goals, you could do it, and it's optimal from a speed standpoint unless you're doing Duo leveling with someone.
---
I'm excited to play but i'm also a single father with a 4yo. My play time will be a few hours a week when he is still in pre-k and i'm just at home. It's going to be a slow process. Very...very...slow.
---
You are greatly overestimating the value Blizzard places on E3. 
---
They invest most of their time and effort into announcements at Blizzcon. 
---
There will be no announcement at E3 for a Classic release date.
---
Agreed. Orc are better for pve as well as PvP. Because one of the main problems you have as a rogue is another rogue.
---
Alright, I think Blizzard got the message now
---
Aparently automod will remove it. Just look up the most played pserver's site. It is on the front page.
---
If it's just an hour or two it depends on a few factors:  do you have a mount and how far are you from an inn?
---
If you don't have a mount and an inn is a 5+ min trek/flight away, then no, it isn't worth it.  Thinking like blasted lands at level 40ish.
---
If you're in a zone with a very central inn like Ashenvale(alliance) and you're near it most of the time you're in the zone then just go to it because it's a little free exp.
---
Spending 1 hour a night on a hobby is not neglecting them. However it’s not even enough to get a group and run thru WC.
---
hey that's a hunter weapon
---
Well in Classic with Improved Hamstring and the like, you can basically become a shark in STV or the water-part of Desolace.
---
Wait for someone to dive-down and kill stuff then lock em in place until they drown!
---
Also useful in PvP, but I think for raids humans are preferred for the Spirit.
---
when you have no date and just your 1 handed to get you through
---
I agree, as a Rogue you want WotF far less than you want stun resist in BGs. Rogues aren't good at zerging, so your primary role in BGs is not to go on offense or contest the frontline, where the priests, warlocks, warriors are (those who can fear you), but you want to be on the sidelines, defending flags, backcaping, hunting down respawns etc. So your main enemies are: Hunters, Druids, other Rogues. They can all stun, not fear you.
---
What I'am saying is that WotF is really nice for the situations where you need it, but those situations \*should\* be much rarer than the situations where stun resist is needed. That said: Don't pick a race you don't like. UD and Troll can work just as fine as Orc.
---
warlock! lets go
---
I was going to reply to a couple of comments but I thought I would combine those replies into one general comment.
---
The thought process was "Spriest spells are so expensive, how do we get more value out of them?" Which led to the idea that you wouldn't play shadow as a DPS but as a healer. You would deal your damage strategically to heal your group, not to dps. This introduced the problem of being essentially dead weight, again xD, because you really need to heal 4 people to gain value (the odds are entirely against you to have 4 random party members that are damaged). 
---
So the next thought was "Warlocks? -&gt; They convert health into mana right?" Thus we dropped further down the rabbit hole... Each step seemed geared towards a shadow priest: you synergize with warlocks, you gain lots of value by healing 4 people, you theoretically are a good AoE healer, warlocks have a higher chance of needing healing, Imp Life Tap adds even more value onto your healing, each extra shadow bolt adds value to the raid.
---
For the idea to theoretically work I would have to prove: 1) That bringing a spriest provides more shadow bolts than bringing another warlock, 2) That the debuff loss would be worth it, or that the DoT-less build was viable, 3) That the spriest was better at providing those shadow bolts than another healer, 4) etc. #1 &amp; #2 are hard for me to answer without an actual raid environment, and I attempted to answer #3 with the comparison chart.
---
From an outside perspective, it seemed to alleviate problems (classic researcher bias right here lol) that spriest faced. Your job was providing more shadow bolts, not DPSing. In my head, the theoretical damage meter, on long fights, had spriest doing less damage than they usually do. But your 4 warlocks doing much more damage than usual because of the gained value from Vampiric Embrace healing. On short fights you would shift your playstyle back from a support priest to a DPS spriest because they bring good damage on short encounters.
---
Again thanks for reading and all the comments. It's been fun trying to theorycraft new builds in Classic (Holy Fire Priest next lol?)
---
Flying wasn't an issue in TBC IMO, as it was reserved for rich players and only usable in Outland. It became an issue in WotLK when everyone suddenly had it. Shoul've kept it in Outland.
---
I think that was still an Uncommon item in Classic.
---
I believe the item you may be referring to is the Shining Silver Breastplate.
---
Do you know if Mark of Tyranny is considered an essential tanking trinket for classes other than Druid?
---
I'll give you chimps over monkeys.  However I think most of the population doesn't believe that or is ignorant of all research on the subject.  It's a hard subject to be objective about.
---
Personally I just dont find speedrunning in wow interesting at all. Outgearing content by several tiers and going back and stomping it is like seeing how hard a pro baseball team can crush preschoolers at Tball. Id be much more interested in seeing who could do more with less. The fewest numbers possible to clear each raid, the lowest possible gear to clear each raid etc. Can you clear AQ without any epics at all? With only 30 in raid? Far more interesting than watching someone take a gun to a knife fight. By the way I bet in retail I can 1 man speed clear bwl in less than 20 minutes, do I win the speed run competition?
---
I remember making the Silvered Bronze set and having so much Spirit I stopped buying food for a while.
---
World record is around 5 days /played. Fast is about 1.5-2x that. The absolute slowest a vet will level is like 2-3x the WR or about 15 days played, and a newbie may take a full 20.
---
I feel you. But I also believe in supporting them if they make good decisions and Classic was a good decision.
---
I mean if they want to stay ret when you need a healer that's fine. I think the problem only comes up if they complain after they get replaced.
---
I actually kinda disagree.  Out of the last 3 years i spent just over 1 with 'my dream girl' (on paper) and a little less than that doing stuff with friends irl as well as playing in a raiding guild with some top lads.  I had wayyy more fun with the lads
---
I'd choose the latter every time.  Love is a chemical reaction that helps us breed... Friendship is what counts and unless the girl is going to be your best fuckin friend by a mile (or you are really set on having children) then you're basically choosing her for the sex
---
In my experience, girlfriends just really aren't that fun or interesting most of the time
---
I’m going Priest for the first time. How well could you farm it? What moves would you use? It’s because they’re undead right?
---
Hunter Ammunition, I loved the flavor of having to pay attention to my bullet or arrow count. And you had to have the right ammo for your weapon. Luckily you can get huge ammo bags :)
---
I honestly don’t see a huge drop. You gotta remember that we all have less time, but exponentially more money. I’m totally okay keeping that WoW sub going even though I play 2-4 hours a week.
---
Yeah, hardcore players may drop, but subs will have a small drop and plateau because we can actually afford the sub now.
---
Is 10min required for revenue or something? I see so many videos where I think "this could have been done 9 minutes ago."
---
Nope, it's pretty exclusively druid because of their AC multiplier and reliance on high AC due to lack of other forms of avoidance. I don't think I'd even take it as a prot warrior since you can replace it with vigilance charm nearly 1:1.
---
New wow player here. I know what a twink is, but what is the point of them?
---
Care to link it here? I'm curious to see it!
---
Frost is more mana efficient than Fire and gives you better control of mobs. Frost is also better for keeping mobs slowed while you damage them for AoE grinding. With those 2 things combined almost no one levels as Fire.
---
Yeah, gear for DPS warriors is very expensive/hard to get. I would play a warrior only as my main.
---
You're projecting your hype onto Blizzard. It's silly.
---
Ah, classic WoW – classic memes
---
You certainly can heal dungeons all the way up to Sunken Temple in whatever spec you want.  Just keep a relatively current set of int gear with you so you have enough Mana to last the fights. ST and beyond the difficulty ramps up quite a bit but is still doable.
---
Man I remember my friend letting me play his 50ish paladin in WPL. Despite never having played the class, pressing combinations between seal of command and seal of righteousness was not that hard. Then I realized he turned on scary movie 2, so I just used SoC and afk'd.
---
Thank you friend.
---
It wasn't, because he didn't stop there. He goes on to ask if you remember how awful it was sitting around looking for a tank, he's basically defending LFD. It's not about rose tinted glasses, the way he expanded on the statement demonstrated he had no clue what actually makes a good MMO: the need to actually socialize to get anything done.
---
FFXI player here. While XI is WAY grindier and slower paced, vanilla is nowhere near compared to retail. I looked at some math on leveling and playing 40 hours a week with optimum exp gains will take 42 days to hit level cap.
---
In FFXI, with a static group partying 8 hours a day, you can totally hit 75 (assuming limit breaks are done) in 42 days.
---
You're in the Classic WoW subreddit, everyone is going to tell you to wait for Classic and play that.
---
But yes, it's worth it, come join us.
---
So you kept a grudge that your friend accidentally took an item he thought you already had by playing again with him, needing EVERY SINGLE ITEM, and say its payback for an event he probably either forgotten or is laughing about as an old joke.
---
Oof. That's... a little nuts.
---
Ex-friend*
---
He’ll probably come over when he sees it explode.
---
Whoooosh
---
Yes, but blizzcon announcement is not an option, because classic is supposed to be out by that time.
---
They took it away, but they've brought it back years ago. This gets repeated a lot, but retail definitely has weather.
---
However, it isn't as extreme as in Classic
---
Papa tanking is fine, I would say, below level 40.  Once you get to 40, you can get by if you are deep prot with good tank gear.  I would think a Blackrock Depths would be possible with very good CC as a prot pally.  But the emperor may be really hard.
---
I would have liked the expansion far better if pandas had played a lesser role and had not been made a playable race. You are right, they did make a decent world of it, good writing etc, but there’s a reason pandas is easily one of the least played races: it doesn’t fit the wow aesthetic. No amount of artfully writing it into the story will validate them as characters in a world such as Warcraft. Might as well have made them cannon in dark souls. It was what it was: an attempt to cater to the Chinese market. Same as the latest do you not have phones mobile game that the corpse of blizzard will be releasing soon.
---
If you wanna stick out, troll, considering most horde rogues will be undead with a few orcs.
---
I honestly don't think a weekend drinking bender is any worse for you than playing a video game for 120 hours in a week.
---
Good advice thank you!
---
That was SO immersive.
---
Yeah, that's fine, some of us have mental problems, it's fine.
---
Nah. It's just a date. We hype this magical date up because we're all so eager for it, 90% of the people watching E3 don't give a shit about WoW Classic.
---
Noggenfogger or savory deviates if you like human animations
---
They're completely different games.
---
Modern wow is about playing the main character in a story that you wouldn't completely understand. It'd be like reading the 7th Harry Potter book without any of the others.
---
Classic wow, if done correctly, will be about being a minor character in a story line that's nowhere near as involved. (Having played WC 3 helps with immersion, though.)
---
As far as trying to learn the game, I'd say playing modern wow would likely make your introduction to modern wow more difficult, as retail wow is about as hard as a mobile game.
---
Sentient means capable of feeling things.
---
as retri pala i keep getting these retard groups that are like "so ur heal or tank right" even tho ive messaged that IM DPS to theyr LFM ZF NEED ALL messages. every single time.
---
They've complicated things to no end now. Yes, try classic.
---
cool video man
---

---
Okay so I found it. A little over 11 days is average on one of the most recent pservers, obviously populated by a community more familiar with vanilla/classic than the average player, also with dynamic spawns and possibly higher droprates etc.  
---
And you say 8-12 days? You dont think the average was slower back in the day, or when classic releases? Also it would be more accurate to say 9-13 days, if you think 11 days is average.
---
Sure you predicted it, but ill say it nonetheless: The community playing over at that server is a concentrated pool of dedicated classic fans. They will have more knowledge than the average joe, and they are like you said, more hardcore.
---
Right, so they just aren't going to announce it at a convention...
---
Oy! feck you ya spooky midget
---
Why not, just give it a try :)

I have the perfect, max character limit name for my banker which I always use. But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
---
I did the same thing but back in the n64 era. Jammed to my new found glory CD on repeat while mowing them lawns. Made so much money back then being one of the few kids on my street. Felt food earning my console and games on my own.
---
WoW did in Beta.
---
They realized that people were addicted to the game and playing for insane hours. To combat this they hindered players by reducing their XP gain by 50%. They were met with a HUGE backlash and chose to switch it to giving players rested XP.
---
Such a sad outlook.
---
A partner is just that, a partner. It takes two people for a relationship to thrive. My lady isn't what I think I would have ever described as my dream woman (because you don't know what you need until you get it). She's stubborn and spicy and passionate and caring. But the thing is, she's my partner and we have committed to one another and our relationship. I genuinely care about her happiness and her ambitions, and support her in her pursuit of those. She does the same for me. We are a team, and neither has a desire for children.
---
I appreciate her for who she is, not what she can offer me. If you haven't had a truly fulfilling relationship then you've simply not found the right person yet.
---
Wow, you found a really good hunter weapon on pic 10
---
classic and modern wow are so different they shouldnt count as 1 game. Look up some videos of both, look how much time you can play and then if you actually like the slow playstyle of classic
---
Pretend that you need to min-max everything and play only OP classes and you can be the meme.  Why not take it even further?
---
Hi, /u/Antihermes
---
Here is my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7zzng/looking_for_group_monday_april_01_2019/ejxlx8l/
---
We aim to be a tight-knit group who progress through content together. I'm sure there will be dropouts and not everyone can come to all raids always. However I'd want everyone who want to come to be able to come. Currently we have 57 members.
---
If you are still interested, PM me.
---
5 per hour I believe
---
You should def. Play Classic, for perspective, we were all newbies at one point and love it to this day.
---
I wouldn't reccomend buying retail and playing that if you are on the fence, also classic is literally a different game from retail it wouldnt do to play modern and expect a similar experience. 
---
If anything Id suggest playing the older Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 games. They are Obviously rts games and not MMOs, but they actually lay a good Foundation to what Classic is/will be about. 
---
Hope this helped!
---
My ex got Scarab Lord by ringing the gong for our sever and I got the only Atiesh on the Alliance side before TBC. We had split raid and guild leading duties since the third month of MC. 
---
On one hand, I never want to see a bug in Silithus again, and on the other I was exceptionally lucky to experience the two rarest raiding achievements of vanilla in their entirety. Though "lucky" might not be the correct word, considering that it was entirely earned by the amount of effort we put into being a progression group.
---
I thought by definition that the war effort ended before the gong was eligible to be hit -- was that added later for underpopulated servers?
---
Usually easier, as few can wear the armor you can as pally (or druid).
---
Paladin for example can pick up unwanted cloth (not likely), leather int gear (much more likely), mail int gear (getting way more likely with no shaman), and then your dedicated plate gear.... you'll look a bit weird but you'll have a solid set of gear for dungeons.
---
\*Laughs in Horde\*
---
But yea, it was VC for Deadmines, DM for Dire Maul.
---
Pretty sure that TBC was the expansion where they made pets not run away when they were low on loyalty, and Wrath basically removed the whole loyalty system
---
Yeah, my wife and friend from high school will be playing with me as a trio.   
---
She already decided priest, he already decided warrior, so I'm going shaman when they're both online (and mage main solo when they're not).   
---
With warrior/priest/shaman, both priest and shaman can resurrect one another if one dies. Shaman will even get Reincarnation, so even if all three of us are ganked or wipe to quest MoBs or a dungeon, I can pop up and begin bringing us back. I will offer totems for us and even water walking if traversing water will save us time while leveling. Warrior has two healing sources with both shaman and priest, and either the priest can go shadow at 40 or the shaman can be elemental in order to have some semblance of the tank/D.p.S./heal trio. With priest as cloth, shaman as leather/mail, and warrior as mail/plate, there's less of a gear overlap between the three, save for certain rings/amulets between shaman/priest and some mail armor circa level 40 between shaman/warrior.
---
Actually using crafted gear.
---
I can't remember the last time I actually used something crafted that couldn't immediately be upgraded without facerolling dungeons.
---
Typically you'll level a DPS spec but still keep a healing set around for dungeon runs and heal using that set. Healing gear matters a lot more than spec before 60.
---
Love is cool and all, but, speaking from experience, if you're missing raid tiers because you're out chasing love with someone that doesn't share you common interests and hobbies, you're going to regret it. I know I did.
---
It took me about ten years to find my player two, but I'm looking to head back into classic with a duo partner this time around, and it was so worth the wait
---
Hey if those people don't exist how am I supposed to get MY mount at 40?!
---
Can’t really heal if you don’t have int gear, you’ll break the bank on drinks and will have to drink after pretty much every trash pack
---
Wall walking already removed :( no more going over ironforge to get to wetlands.
---
Would be good to include time to level with rested xp. Assuming people logged off in an inn, even the most hardcore player represented (8hr/day) would theoretically get 2 bars of double xp per day (1 bar per 8 hours logged off in an inn). People playing 4hrs/wk would be getting \~20.5 bars of rest xp per week assuming they logged off in an inn as well. I'm sure that would somewhat drastically speed up both the time to 60 and the actual /played if they played optimally when they were online.
---
Any class that can kite and pallys.   Generally when soloing an elite with a hunter or warlock, you don't use your pet to tank, rather you use the pet as extra DPS while you kite the mob around.
---
Playing as a Feral DPS and surprising people how well it actually is.
---
A mish mash of arnor types is pretty standard for pally healers
---
that's great, you are one of the lucky ones.  you've just described a best friend (who you presumably have sex with) which i would say is an ideal relationship
---
i think my outlook is the mature way lol.  a relationship should either be what you described, or it should be for raising children (or both, if possible)
---
however the majority of relationships people enter are not like this at all, many are toxic and destructive.  many are passionless and simply escaping loneliness.  I've simply decided that i'm not going to let dating be that big of a factor in my life unless it seems worthwhile to me - and i've not met many girls in the last year since i decided this that were interesting enough to warrant dating.  unfortunately the one that was super interesting had to leave the country!
---
i think that way too many people are still caught up in the romantic misconception that there's someone for everyone and that everyone needs a partner and that marriage is for love (imo should be for children only) and i think this ends up damaging a lot of people unnecessarily
---
i see friends date or even just bang people because they have some hole inside that they're trying to fill, and it's clearly not going to be fixed by getting someone to love them.  I see friends putting up with boredom or abuse just to avoid being alone.
---
meanwhile i choose to distance myself from it and i'm living the life i actually want to live with full independence - but any time you tell people you're not investing in the game they seem to get weirdly offended by it.  why should that be?
---
You're forgetting rule #1. Everything is a hunter weapon.
---
SM is in the top 5 for me for sure. And there being an actual economy again would be nice
---
Numbers aren't always accurate on private servers.
---
For sure! Like; Patport, or Patsummon, or even Patshield? That's a good twist. I like it.
---
In my experience trying all classes at aoe farming lashers in DME priest using holy nova was by far the easiest. No rng, no kiting, no worry of missing part of the pack. Easiest and safest by far. Holy nova has a terrible spell power coeficient so just stack int stam gear and you will be fine.
---
Healers rarely overaggro tanks once the tanks managed to get a few hits in.
---
It's balanced though, horde get deviate fishes in a low level zone while the alliance gets... well... gnomes.
---
Hence the term used - useful, not mandatory. Basically, fights where substantial fire damage can/will occur. A few pieces of FR will be ideal for more casual guilds for fights like Vael although the UBRS buff alone should be enough.
---
i thought it might come across like that while i was writing it, but there was no way to avoid it
---
i assure you i'm not an employee of blizzard or activision or whoever, i'm just a regular reddit pleb who needs a release date like a crack addict needs some of your change
---
How is it useless?  It's pink.
---
You’re safe until all five of you realize you’re worse than dead weight.
---
Thanks for the kind reply.
---
I don't where you got the idea that I think ferals are not viable though. I am (was) actually a feral. But the post above said off-spec(feral) which made me believe he is resto.
---
Even tho retail isnt what pleasures me and what i want to play it could be possible that you like it and thats okay. I falled in love with classic and bc. For me everything changed when they put new classes in the game. Wotlk was kinda ok but i had already the feeling that it went bad. Some other people think maybee wotlk was dope others hate bc because it "killed world pvp". Every expansion got some fans and some who dont like it. If i was in your position i would like to play classic. It was magical lvling the first time and exploring everything. It didnt feel like the endgame starts at lvl 60 and that everything in between 1 to 60 is meaningless. But also, games have changed and i dont know if i really would play wow classic for the first time, it would feel the same because it was my first mmo and maybee if i would have played others like eso or warhammer or lotr online , wow would not feel that special.
---
I suggest just try classic, you will have a fast learning curve if you meet some nice people wich you will do if you behave like a normal person. Also you can ask everytime what to do or where to go because there will be always someone to help you. Now you have to choose faction and class. Good luck with that
---
Presenting this outside the WoW Community doesnt really give any effect. A blue post is more than enough.

Are you talking about Patchwerk-style encounters? Save yourself the emotional letdown and go check out some recent parses.

Dire maul won’t even be out in phase 1 and that’s where most of the instanced pulls I’ve seen are, although they’re slower than some of the spots in the plaugelands anyway they’re just uncontested.

Undead for appearance.
---
Orcs for min-maxing.
---
Meh they said the same thing about survival hunters in vanilla and bc. Still carried my weight. I'm a try hard.
---
A ret pally is just a might buff that steals all your plate when you are a warrior tank.
---
OP isn’t *suggesting* Flying and LFR. It’s a gauge to see where the survey takers opinions lie. If 10% of people put 10 on flying, you know that there’s a 10% margin of error to account for either trolls or idiots.

Do you see a sign on my lawn that says "Dead Retadin Storage"?
---
Because storing dead retadins ain't my fucking business.
---
one day you'll realize, young one.
---
It was a striking example of how far they went, and it was an early sign of the end.
---
I remember trying to help multiple people kill mobs, farm or quest in that zone, and it was a jarring experience of invisible people, invisible walls, and way much shit that should never have been just to tell the story.
---
What makes you assume that the warriors/rogues were tryharding and/or skilled at all?
---
One of my favorite things to do in Vanilla and TBC when I mained my gnome warrior 😊😊😊
---
same way I do on retail, have a name in mind, try different vowel combinations or special characters if need be to get what I want if the original letter combination I had in mind is taken. as long as it is pronounced the same in my mind, it's all good.
---
also, I play strictly on RP servers. so its gonna be an actual first name for the character, not a username-type name like "xXpWnNoObS420Xx"
---
Can confirm centaurs are actually trash people. Annoying aggro sounds, cyclone spells, healing spells, rock creature adds, etc.
---
Still you don't want that shit laying around on your hut. We're talking way low budget hut interior decoration here. They would do well to replace it with a rat skin carpet.
---
I've been saying August since someone posted the lag times summary for all the expansions.

Personally mid-September would be fantastic.  I want to #nolife like the rest of you, but there is just too much fun outdoors stuff to do in the summer.

Amen brother!
---
don't patronise me, i'm 28 and i've been around well enough to know my own opinions.  why don't you tell me where you disagree with me?
---
It's actually very common to level a Mage first before other classes because Mage is very good at farming gold. This will of course help you level your Warrior faster and also help get gear for your Warrior.
---
WoW is cheaper.
---
There's surprisingly few greens from quests, compared to what we're used to. 
---
You're better off taking another gathering profession and having an enchanting alt.
---
- Leveling/grinding. It’s therapeutic for me.
---
- Friends I haven’t talked to in a decade returning.
---
- Official servers being wiped/brand new. Everyone is starting off at level 1.
---
- Crafting. Vanilla WoW was the best crafting time.
---
Same here man. I've got old friends who look down on me for never even so much as dating, let alone marrying, since high school, like it's some sort of sad existence. But then they bemoan the fact that they're not "allowed" to play video games anymore, don't have time, etc. And I just say well yea, there's no disallowing me to play wow or do whatever the hell I want. If I want to come home and play video games, read a book, or kick back in the recliner and watch youtube for the whole evening, there's absolutely nobody stopping me from doing that. So.... who's got it better again?
---
be nice

at first you might have to compete with mages for gear unless you rank up in pvp

And what exactly would be a more reliable source? We're not dealing with peer-reviewed scientific journals here. It's a computer game.
---
That's about where I'm at, I've been trying to balance my time and still be able to work out and play with the wife and son. Luckily I've got a gym in the garage, and my wife used to raid with me from licking till warlords, so she understands. I think I've almost got it nailed down where I can fit everything in, just need to get meal prep and family meals down.
---
If you're wanting to play the best race, Orc is the way to go. I'd say Undead is a strong second for PVP sake because of WOTF.
---
What guild did you play in lol
---
Why not include the information about 10 days played being the average? It's also in the article:
---
&gt;if you play 40 hours per week it will take you 1.4 months to reach level 60
---
WoW doesn’t have AIDS
---
Going to have a main and alt going at the same time so one always has rested xp.
---
I've been thinking about it alot and most of my good feelings for Classic WoW are structured around the fun times I had in raids in with my Guild.
---
Honestly, there were a lot of shitty things about Classic Wow.  By patch 1.12 many of the worst aspects of the old game were fixed, but there also is the fact that by patch 1.12, I had been level 60 for more than a year, been running MC/BWL/AQ/NAX for a while, had full epics, lots of cash, and could just enjoy the game and the challenge.  
---
Do I want to spend 2 years getting to that point again?  Will it be as fun with new people?  I dunno.  Most of my old WoW buddies don't play anymore.  Maybe like 2 or 3 out of the 50+ who regularly showed up for raids, probably aren't getting alot of them back.  They have families, and kids, and full time jobs which preclude raiding 3 nights a week for 6 hours at a time.
---
Wow never judges you and makes you feel unwanted
---
There are items that are only available to certain professions, but nothing as organized as in TBC.
---
My wife goes to sleep before I’ll play. Win/win.
---
As a priest healing I’m always happy to have a try hard retadin in 5 mans. Blessings and auras usually allow me to do something other than healing.
---
Rolling shaman for whirlwind and to play a class that’s not popular. Goal is to stand out.
---
You can find a GF in WoW. Just give her 500 gold and boost her to level 60. Can't really be a dude behind the character if it's a female. (Especially Night Elf.)
---
enjoy the water totem quest
---
Probably, yes. They aren't treating this like they're releasing a new game or anything. They aren't marketing it or attempting to gain much fainfare for it outside of the WoW community. 
---
And it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't. If they were to hype this and market it like a new game it would basically be them signalling that they don't have much confidence in the current iteration of WoW. If they do that and then classic is not a success, they have basically destroyed their own game. Instead they're treating it like a fun little thing they are giving their community. If it's a huge success then they can pump more resources into it, if it fails then they haven't destroyed confidence in their current product and can fall back on "See, classic love is mostly nostalgia, but that type of game isn't want the main playerbase wants anymore."
---
I would say it's highly likely our release date just comes in a blue post and it's rolled out like it was just another big patch for WoW.
---
If your gf doesn't understand the importances and magnitude of WoW Classic, she ain't your gf.
---
Nothing says he can't hang onto some healing gear as a backup when ret doesn't work out. :)
---
WoW only costs $15 a month. Pant will drop after a few hours of grinding.
---
In my opinion, the modern game will spoil the adventure and excitement Classic will bring. The 1-60 process is so stupidly easy that you’ll rush through the entire old game, in a shell of its old state.
---
If you do end up playing modern WoW and like it, I’m glad. But I’d 100% say to avoid it until you’ve played Classic.
---
This should literally never happen if the group leader invited the pally knowingly as dps. It's much more annoying being invited as ret then the first thing you read before even a Hi is "can you heal?"
---
There are 7 billion people on the planet. There’s only 1 classic wow. Numbers don’t check out.
---
I can hear this image.
---
Honestly it's the power trip and anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit. Basically with the best possible gear at that level and high level enchants you just CRUSH anyone who isnt a twink. We're talking 1 or 2 shotting people at times
---
&gt; chicks are into that shit.
---
I mean, some of us are.
---
And being willing to off heal if needed seems to make people happy to take a ret if they already have a normal healer. This reddit is the only place I've seen people who refuse to take certain specs. I've always been cool with any spec as long as the person is willing to play there role.
---
What you're asking is way too general and will be hard for us to answer in a single comment. I recommend checking out the various guides and resources that the vanilla community has created. Melderon and Kargoz on Youtube come to mind for shaman in particular. There's also "official" Discord servers for every class that you can join. Most of them are frequented by helpful and knowledgeable players that would be happy to help you out.
---
Oh that’s good
---
My wife gave me an ultimatum 11 years ago about WoW. Now we're seriously on the rocks and I'd be lying if going home to classic isn't a shiny silver lining on the whole ordeal.
---
What young people are you talking about lol
---
Hell yeah my man, Druids represent!
---
The math isn't shit, people are cherry picking things to complain about. There was an initial issue with data and it was corrected immediately before 95% of the people even posted.
---
The math is simple:
---
* 10 days played to 60 = 240 hours
---
   * If you play 40 hours per week it would take 6 weeks or about a month and a half
---
* 20 days played to 60 = 480 hours
---
   * If you play 40 hours per week it would take 12 weeks or about 3 months
---
And those posh seeking elves hang around the coffee shops in London.
---
It takes around 7 days played and I don't need a math formula to know this.
---
kthxbye
---
This is a good plan 👌🏻
---
You back up but it's way too late!
---
Lucky man! You win at life sir
---
xD
---
Shaman and Paladins are pretty damn popular, least played are warlocks and druids.
---
Alexa, play Elwynn Forest ambience.
---
I'm sorry, I couldn't find Elf and Everest.
---
I will also only have about 4 hours a week to play. Not including a few 12 hour days every couple of months when I can get a whole day off to myself. I plan to play slowly and experience a lot that I may have kissed out on when I first played. I estimate that I will get to 60 in about 12-14 days played time. At about 4 hours a week I'm looking at over 75 weeks till I reach 60. Hopefully that phases come real slow lol
---
OPs wife is also a warlock, so she could loan 50g or so, so he doesn’t slow her down.
---
Sorry to hear things aren’t working out - but I’m glad WoW can be there for ya! Hang in there man, it’s only gonna get better!
---
Perhaps the unkillable servant in Blasted Lands is still there this time around as well.
---
Thats the biggest mage leveling problem, you get a shit-ton of gold and utility spells, but be ready to get completely fucked in your leveling experience.
---
You don't have to change spec to heal non lvl 60 dungeons. Just save a int/spirit/mp5 set of gear and you'll be good to go.
---
I'm going to go to westfall as my horde and kill the defies traitor over and over while I watch Netflix.
---
Not a thing anyone will be able to do about it because I'll be on an RP/pve server. By the time someone resets the quest and gets him back to moon brook I'll be unflagged waiting for him
---
Detect magic. This is a big one for me. The difference between just knowing what buffs an enemy has vs having to use a spell to find out what’s buffs something has is subtle yet effective. 
---
There are probably many examples like this.
---
He wasn't asking about tips for race.
---
My wife actually games with me. Nothing like a priest and mage leveling together all the time.
---
For PvP the orc stun resist beats them all, but orcs look so bad I couldn't bring myself to play one.
---
I played undead rogue in retail vanilla, will be playing gnome rogue in classic!
---
I think sapient is a better word to use here.
---
yeah it's so much fun and cool having that diversity
---
I have a feeling classic wow will go in a similar direction as /r/2007scape with the community and updates over time.
---
This is something I've also seen in the smash community with people telling melee players they should move on and just play the newest game.
---
I understand if they don't want to play the old games but why do they not want other people to as well?
---
This is why everyone should roll human too.
---
Accomplishing goals in WoW take time and effort and leave you with a sense of satisfaction you cant get elsewhere and you can build on them without losing unlike your s/o
---
My son is 15 months old so he can’t QUITE play yet. I’ll give it time and he’ll join me!
---
That's Bar Refaeli, the most beautiful woman ever, though.
---
Haha, my last long term character was a bear druid so I guess guilty as charged? Lol.
---
It increases the feeing of accomplishment and reward. Spamming the same dungeon 4 times per hour in the dungeon finder in retail is NOT at all rewarding, largely in part to the fact that by the time you actually get the drop you wanted you’re too high level to use it. And you don’t even feel any more powerful since the mobs all scale to your level. 
---
That is why people enjoy the arduous journeys to get “basic” stuff done. There is a feeling of actual reward and improvement.
---
There isn't a problem when someone wants to be DPs but it's when they want to be DPs when we want them to be something else.
---
Some just suck more, like the Warrior.
---
First of all, Ele Shammies are criminally underrated in PvP. They're a bit of a dark horse. So you've made a good choice.  
---
You can get away with some cloth bits thanks to using a shield, if you can get them, but you will struggle to gear up from raids.  
---
The PvP gear is extremely good, and the bonus is that you'll always be wanted in pre-mades as a healer so you can rank as a healer and switch to Ele later.  
---
ZG/AQ20 will provide you with a bunch of useful gear and weapons.
---
You will struggle to get spellpower stuff from Mages/Locks in raids though, particularly rings and trinkets. Don't count on it.
---
My brother and I will be rolling horde and looking for a guide that will be going to a server without streamers, cant stress that enough. We were in hardcore raiding guilds in and he was MT/raid leader back in Naxx days and I was shaman healer. We are more casual now and looking for a guild that will raid but will have a casual pace to the game. No classes chosen yet so if a guild needs specific roles filled we are open to the suggestions for your needs. (Leaning towards double shaman (maybe one of us enhance with nightfall) Message me if you think your guild will be a good fit, and we can talk and go from there.
---
agree
---
Guess you need to find a good guild and be a good member, then it really shouldnt matter what spec/class you are. Finding 40 good players to go raiding with is more important. 
---
Once in a guild, you'll have as much chance at gear as anyone else. 
---
Also, getting to Rank 10 shouldnt be too difficult if you are heavily into PVP. You can get the following gear as you rank up:-
---
Rank 3, Sergeant / Sergeant - Superior-quality cloak, 
---
Rank 4, Master Sergeant / Senior Sergeant - Superior-quality necklace
---
Rank 5, Sergeant Major / First Sergeant - Superior-quality bracers
---
Rank 7, Knight-Lieutenant / Blood Guard - Superior-quality boots and gloves
---
Rank 8, Knight-Captain / Legionnaire - Superior-quality chest armor and leggings
---
Rank 10, Lieutenant Commander / Champion - Superior-quality helm and shoulder armor
---
The best gift a parent can give a child :)
---
It's almost entirely T2 that nobody wants and quest / rep items, and farmable dungeon items.
---
I had a Tauren Druid named Steve for a while...
---
All yours if you can get it :)
---
GF and I were looking for a game to play that we can both enjoy, progress, and play as a team.  As a gamer who started in BC, she's excited to play original content similar to how it was at the beginning.  I'm a vanilla boi and can't wait to experience the nostalgia of running through dungeons, raiding and world pvp from days of old.
---
Its not that bad, just a bit boring
---
God, I genuinely loved farming lashers to get my epic mount. Doesn't seem like something that would be fun, but it's great when you have something on the other screen.
---
I disagree. With the amount of folk who'll all be starting out in Classic, I think mining and Herb will be tough. You'll have so many folk heading for nodes as they spawn. I guess I dont want to be chasing nodes and herbs down, and can just focus on leveling. 
---
Skinning, you are on top of your mob once it dies, so easy to get your own kills and maybe some others if folk around are not skinners.
---
I dont see anything wrong with it.
---
Sure, it's a bit coarse, but the two side make for a versatile floor rug both in summer and winter.
---
Yep, you're right, I just looked at the wrong row.
---
27,600 is still not 123,600. :P
---
Can confirm, most female nelfs are men catfishing.
---
False
---
and i got free 8% riding speed on top of that free mount :D
---
They can make friends with people who have a similar schedule.
---
difficult, lol
---
They will, the average player will be slightly worse. But to add 9 days to the average and then make calculations onto it is insane. That is all I was really saying. I think the average for Blizzard Classic will be 13~ days.
---
Hold on to your Luffa ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=19141](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19141)) afthe you complete [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7727](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7727). Unless you're a dwarf, then you won't need it.
---
Not a major mistake, but I regretted tossing mine back in Vanilla. It has its uses.
---
To the other guys point if I'm good enough, I won't need to use WotF :)
---
Collecting a set of mail armor and enough for riding and mount before hitting 40 on future hunter.
---
Obvious choices are hunter and warlock.
---
Frost mage has technically unlimited potential. I use to solo multiple elites at same time with slow kiting. It's just way harder than hunter/lock.
---
lmao mine doesn't but I end up feeling guilty.
---
you say bear-man, but compare panda models to druid bear models - pandas are cartoonish with nothing dangerous or serious about them. I’d say worgens fit much better in wow
---
Yeah similar for me tbh. My son is only 7 months old and hes in bed by 8, I'll spend 2 hours with my wife and then past that it depends on how miserable I'm willing to be at work the next day. midnight is usually my limit lol
---
That's why I'd take skinning and one other gathering profession.  You might not get every node, but you'll earn more than from disenchanting the few greens you earn that aren't tradeable.
---
On the last fresh private server, the first 60 was in 5 days after launch. It's going to be really fast. The guy played like 16-18 hours straight every one of those days.
---
In TBC, I leveled a Paladin through AoE grinding.  I had all the tanky gear, shield spike, the whole shebang.  I was fighting 6 or so mobs in STV, and the oven timer went off.  I went upstairs, took the stuff out of the oven and turned off the timer, and came back down.  Found out I'd killed 1 mob and aggroed 3 more.  Topped myself off and finished the pack.
---
I always say midnight is my limit then look at the clock and it's 1:30. Fuck.
---
Don’t be fooled by these vanilla charlatans. It’s only a matter of time before you come home and find your wow character in bed with a Chinese gold farmer. “Got hacked”..yea right.
---
No macros to play the game for you...
---
It was essentially to prevent people from botting for gold in an environment with zero competition.
---
I actually really like it after you get the shatter perk
---
Didn't it cost money to respec though?    
---
I'm fine with respecing and healing if the group would give me the money for it
---
I’m the opposite I palm my mouse so front 6 are my main buttons but I can use all 12 I just put less frequently used stuff on the bottom 6.
---
Correcting myself - all casters had different animations than 1.0. Not just mages.
---
It’s reduced to this for 0.01% of the population. The rest of us normal people will still be wiping in MC and struggling to field 40 raiders.
---
In dungeons? Ret is not dead weight. If you have a priest or druid healer and a warrior tank, how else are you going to get the Paladin buffs?
---
I'm in that boat, currently have an infant daughter and only play an hour here or there in the evenings when most of my friends are already asleep.  
---
Not sure if I'm going to get Classic right away or if I will continue to try and scratch the itch on pservers until I can devote a lil more time.  VERY curious to see what happens on the various pservers that have current active (500-1000+ concurrent users) populations as they have said they're "open to character transfer" but who knows how that may or may not come to fruition.
---
You are greatly overestimating how much they care about your hype
---
Yep. My moniker is eazy for all of mine. My bank alts will be fun eazyore, eazyherb, eazybanks1-5 LoL. But at least if you see my alts you should know it’s me.
---
Oh really? I didn't realize.
---
Maybe look up some leveling guides and see which spells you can skip buying. I'd still get the mount, movement speed is king when leveling, you'll be 60 quicker and therefore farming gold quicker.
---
It's not a copy. It's on a completely different client version. They announced it 2 years ago and who knows how long it was being developed before. The demo was far from Classic in terms of class mechanics like much faster energy regen, hunters getting in combat the moment pets start running towards the target, shamans being able to use 2h without 2h talent and more. 
---
That many things were wrong after 1,5(ish) years of development. It's either new client having massive issues accepting changes of that kind or these 2 years weren't used as much as they should've been.
---
Doesn't matter the spec as long as you have the gear. My warrior tanked all of vanilla as fury and did just fine. I had a shadow priest buddy heal just fine. During BC was when they really started focusing required specs even for dungeons.
---
Don't forget that if we're talking elite demons the warlock can utilize enslave and banish, giving them a huge edge.
---
Warrior with barman shanker?  That's a rogue weapon!
---
It would be a different play style, for sure - you would be less concerned with positioning &amp; movement because your focus would become proccing Omen which is too big of a sacrifice, imo. You would risk getting cleaved or something, and also risk people dying because you are too busy worrying about the Omen proc.
---
Just my $.02
---
But, to each his own. If you enjoy living on the edge, then go for it.
---
What makes you think they weren't?
---
Shamans only have one totem button, and it drops all totems simultaneously.
---
And there's always someone in party who will suck.
---
Well yea, since there should be at least 10 warriors before anyone else.
---
We had a female dwarf who would heal for aids. I can still taste those delicious hair spins from the essence of mind. Delicious.
---
I set 11 as my limit then stay up to 12 lmao
---
Problem is it gets more expensive each time you respec until it's 50 gold everytime you want to do it
---
fair duels 24/7 outside citys. dunno whats going on in wow today but pvp talents dont work in duels. or sometimes they do. gear doesnt count and sometimes it does.  all classes have selfhealing and some oneshot in duels because abilitys change in and out of combat. what an utter fuckfest
---
Might as well throw them at a target and add some damage to that spell
---
You're going to need sharding for starter zones for at least a couple weeks.
---
What's gonna make more people quit, sharding or not being able to level.
---
I suggest you go play a private server at launch to see what I mean.
---
I'll wait for classic and give it a try thanks
---
I agree they are good questions. But if you do a surgery with a grey area you won’t get an accurate representation of the data. For example, a survey on pizza, just pizza, wouldn’t work. Toppings? Cheese? Crust? Vegan? Gluten? Just “pizza” can’t be used.
---
&gt; the bear models aren't cartoony
---
lol ok
---
B b but muh karma
---
You just reminded me how I'd have 3 different sets for my druid.  Healing, tanking and dps.
---
You level as dps but keep any gear as you go for your off spec.  Keep it in your bank.
---
thank you for your insight. I'll try classic first
---
This is applicable for like 0.01% of the WoW population. My guild will still be wiping in MC and barely fielding 40 people for a raid.
---
Go get your server firsts and blaze though content, I’ll be enjoying myself and the game.
---
If you're going to make a rogue, don't forget to add "rouge" to the name.
---
I'm a show helm hide cloak kinda guy.
---
Anyone can gank!  Just hide in popular spots (common quest mobs, travel path from one hub to another, border between zones, wait til you see someone in trouble fighting mobs, and BOOM.  Gank central. 
---
If you want to be literally the devil incarnate, sit at a GY and wait to find people spirit res =P
---
Also Counterspell can and should be used to put enemy warriors in combat before they get close enough to charge you. Same deal with unstealthed rogues, CS and start casting frostbolt, they may vanish but you should be ready with that r1 blizzard.
---
Go into it blind, it will be more fun. Retail isn’t really worth your time.
---
Might as well throw them at the target and add some damage to that spell too lol
---
very helpful thank you

today pets are just dots but the old animations are still there
---
Mind controlling.
---
That fix was way past vanilla.
---
Read above poster, who found a user that created a table of what movement speeds do stack (albeit with just druids) rather than just an ancedotal comment from a user claiming to pwn noobs with.
---
My point is that some user comments are not reliable.
---
You get to discuss ANAL in WoW.
---
survival hunters were still at their base a dps class....
---
The PvP ranked rewards will be available in phase 2, so with some WPvP we could get the PvP trinkets and other rewards during that phase. Is this correct?
---
I hope you enjoy it! It’s probably my favorite game of all time (2004-2009 era wow) and I’m still flabbergasted that we’re getting it ha k at all.
---
Looks fun but I'm guessing private server and not actual vanilla considering you have a team member named after Megan Fox. Nobody knew who she was in 2005.
---
For five mans the buffs they bring aren't critical at all.
---
since mining in the world revolves pretty much around just hitting rich thorium, you can easily memorize the dozen or so spawns in a zone and just flip to track mining when you are close to one that isn't in plain view
---
As you're clearly aware that there's two "R"s in retadin, I see no problem here.
---
As someone who's recently rolled this on a private server, let me tell you some stuff:
---
Your ideal stats are melee crit, melee hit, spellpower, intelligence, spellhit and mp5. These things do not exist properly balanced on gear, which sucks. Also, warriors will begin to find you annoying after doing dungeons with you for a while. Crit is very very important for you though, so get that when in doubt; it activates your +15% damage buff, and crit keeps being good until you have near 100% uptime.
---
Things that proc are twice as good for you as for anyone else. So get those. HoJ and the Elementals Deck turn in are your two best trinkets, and cooking can create dragonbreath chili. Alchemy can make shadow oil, which is really great. There's lots of endgame two-handers with procs, and warriors usually think they're trash, so that bit shouldn't be hard. Given two equal options, get the faster one, if nothing else because Shadow Oil has a flat 15% chance to proc and isn't weapon speed adjusted. Lifestealing is probably your best enchant. All of these things should scale with spellpower.
---
Agi and Crit pot is your best pot, but get the rest as well, it'll help your damage being less mediocre. Bring Dark or Demon Runes, and loads of mana pots.
---
The way your rotation works, you basically can't take advantage of the 5second rule at all, so don't worry too much about that. Cleanse in your open gcds.
---
Shackle was the big thing because i could pull without having to take two at once.
---
It was a pretty easy experience and I would just need a friend to help me get in. (Past the human mobs)
---
I might even jump on the band wagon
---
Maybe for classic people should start asking for Spec rather than class, and if they can even heal in the first place.
---
When a group is looking for a shaman or paladin, its usually assumed they are looking for a healer, not an enhance / ret looking to dps.
---
Our guild is going to have a Druid tank as well as 2 Warrior tanks.
---
You can clear the content and Bear Druids can tank Patchwerk, so whatever.  It might be a tiny bit harder on healers, but that’s alright.
---
Except most whispers are "plz portal me" or "can I have food" and they are never intending to pay.
---
Well, around level 30 or so with a shield spike all of a sudden it's much more efficient to level by collecting 4-5 mobs at a time and letting them beat themselves to death on your shield block.
---
Yes, but ret paladins don't find that fun so they don't.
---
Darkspear US has always been up with the culture
---
Why would blizzard ban you for using a VPN?
---
You don't need to respec to heal dungeons.
---
Not having to and still being high on the meters
---
You don't need to respec for dungeons, so that's a non issue.
---
Whatever you enjoy 
---
Just know that in classic if you have a healing spell
---
Everyone assumes you will heal at 60
---
Enh shaman is a great leveling class and also a big threat in wpvp.  
---
In general there are some great youtube guides but quick and dirty advice
---
Maintain an 'intellect' set of gear for healing.  While leveling you will basically only ever see gear with +int or +spi that would help you with healing.  As the healer in a 5-man you basically are never doing damage, so you want as much int/spi as possible to help your sustain. 
---
More than leveling, your weapon will control how much damage you do.  Occasionally you'll get a new ability that will be really nice, but to stay strong while leveling you want to maintain the best weapon you can.  There are good 2h upgrades available in basically every instance you do.  1H weapons can work as well, but you lose about 20% DPS and gain about 10% damage reduction by wearing a shield, so it's a decent trade-off. 
---
Questing/grinding are both similar, it really depends on the player.  If you can really kind of 'theorycraft' what is an optimal grinding rotation and stick to it I feel that grinding is a better xp/hour with a few efficient quests thrown in.  This is especially true if you get alch/herbalism with cooking and are able to buff yourself at a relatively cheap cost as this will really help you tear through the mobs.  That being said, if you don't have rested XP, grinding is WAY worse!
---
Meanwhile I keep my 8 years old sister away from playing WoW, because I dont want her exposed to The Barrens chat.
---
That's easy at max level but leveling both up would be a royal pain in the ass.
---
Credit where credit is due, this is from Platinum Wow's VANILLA FLAVORS 🍦 Warrior Vanilla WoW Class Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J6bl0TZ6Kk&amp;t=495s
---
The fact that tryhard warriors, rogues, and mages with equivalent gear have more in their dps toolbox.
---
You presented both 10 and 20 but implied 20 was the real average at the start, and then used it in the summary in the end.
---
There exists a refer a friend program currently in Retail, and considering we're using the same accounts and subscription, it will still exist for Classic. Looking at it right now most of the current benefits will likely only apply to Retail, except perhaps for the free sub month you get if your friend subscribes for 2 months.
---
There is always something better to bring than a ret paladin. And even if they’re the only thing available, you still don’t bring them in a warrior-tank group because they take warrior gear. But by all means take the rets in your group!
---
Stance dancing wasn't even hard though, there were no GCD's on stances.
---
Join a guild as resto( ask if 30-0-21 is okay) and heal with them. Tell the loot officers (probably gonna be loot council) that you pref PvP orientended items. The gear you want will be something like:
---
MC: Aurastone mace, The rag shield, random tier pieces, the 40 nature sp shoulder(it's a meme pvp item anyway so it's free taking). Pass on things like wild growth shoulders and domo healing ring.
---
For BWL you want even more tier pieces, Nef mace (it's a healing prio mace anyway), vael shield and the shaman trinket. Pass on the big healing items like chrom legs and the healing trinket. 
---
And that's really it honestly. In ZG try get a tank to pass on the enchant item so you can get ZG chest(it's amazing), and just gear up regularly.  In AQ ask for t2.5 as soon as possible.
---
You will have lots of spellpower with that setup, and add any pvp items you get from ranking and you are gucci.
---
The hardest part of PVE is herding 40 cats, mechanically the fights (threat included) are easy.
---
You never play an old game?
---
Let me know what server you roll Alliance on, friend. I'll make sure to fully display my savage mongrel self all over your face.
---
I think that a lot of people fail to realize that in Classic you are much less a 'spec' and much more a 'class'. Priests are healers. Holy is a bit better at it, shadow a bit worse. But a shadow priest is still a priest, and a priest is a healer.
---
you can heal as enh, just make sure to collect int+spirit gear and have it in your backpack. its more about having the gear for healing, than a spec, that lets you heal. you can heal all dungeons even at 60, just have the good gear. 
---
at leveling stack spirit and abuse 5 second mana regen rule (in case you don't know, you start regening in combat after 5 seconds of not casting, so you need to look at ticks of mana and use abilities in tact right after the tick, shaman leveling is all about mana management and minimizing your downtime). pieces with +spirit +strength on it  is ideal for a shammy leveling.
---
as for quests, do totem quests.  thats a class quest chains you get from your trainer.
---
rather than that, i do Wailing Caverns quest chain and get your blue staff its very good and will serve for a long time while leveling. I can't really remeber any specific (non class) quests that you NEED to do.
---
don't stress about the mount at 40, you have your wolf form so its not that crucial comapre to most other classes.
---
questing is &gt; grinding. but grinding abit here and there if you found some mobs which are easy and fast to kill, it will give you a nice bump in xp, which is nice, but generally you just questing. 
---
since you are melee don't go for higher level mbos, even 2 levels higher isnt effiecineте to kill. Since in classic, you start to miss and ahve reduced damage (glancing blow hits) if you hit mbs a higher level. So keep that in mind, its usually better to hold back and progress steadily than trying to force some higher level quests.
---
you mostly use 2h + rockbiter (thats a spell that you apply to the weapon, its the most effiecient, and better than wf). but have 1h+shield in your backpack and swap when its needed (some hard mobs, or multiple mobs). you don't even need macroses, just put 1h and shiel don your action bars and bind them. you gonna be swapping quite a bit.
---
Imaupsdriver the Druid sounds good to me

D-:
---
You mean hunter weapon
---
Raided us west from China for years. Use a tunneling service NOT a vpn. Some days I'd be as low as 75 ping.
---
Not every private server is the same and we really don't even know for sure which ones are the most accurate as far as class DPS goes.
---
Thanks a bunch. I remember an xp bonus of refered accounts so didn't know if that portion was coming to classic but it's all answered now.
---
This is wrong. Spirit DOES work in combat, for mana regen. 5 seconds after your last spell/ability-cast, your mana starts to regen. So you can regan mana just by letting your pet attack and just auto-shot. 
---
To OP - More int gives you longer burst. Spirit gives you more sustain. Stam gives you more survability. Pick whatever playstyle you like :)
---
We need another thread for all these troublesome children people keep having.

Skip it until 60 there's no need for water based totems at any time from 1-60.

It is not just viable it's absolutely recommended if not mandatory.

&gt;I wish **you**'d **practice** what **you preach** .
---
How many subs are on retail right now? Isn't the height of WoW subs 12 million? 6 for classic seems very high, though the sub for classic is just the retail sub, so I don't think we are gonna get many numbers on classic only players.
---
Username checks out
---
Don’t ask me why but when I quit BFA I had recently bought a wow token and decided to get a bunch of blood elves in a strip/dance off and basically payed them to be my hoes for the night.
---
Drastic ip changes can trigger an auto ban. Easily overturned but ask for a note on your account stating you're using one. 
---
Also make sure you are using tunneling services and not a vpn for ping lowering.  They aren't the same thing.  My favorite is battleping.
---
Sure, the buffs aren't critical but they're sure as hell great to have, just like Shaman buffs.
---
Viable? It's the optimal way
---
Yep, only 0.02 light seconds from me as well!
---
There will always be the guy who has no life and will play 20 hours a day and get there in 5 days but I'd say most people will make in in two to three weeks that play hard and everyone else will slowly get there after that.
---
Do people not become best friends with the person you love? I can't imagine being in love and not having that person be one of my best friends.
---
The point isnt that you have to give up video games for love. It's that he is seriously considering blowing off this girl because he wants to play WoW. That's.. Bad if you think this could be more than a fling.
---
To be fair this is a rather lame sub-thread.
---
...would be much better if it had a meme, applied to boyfriends, girlfriends, wives, husbands, or any other type of SO, then got stickied for easy reference. 
---
I’m too busy hanging out with my gf pre-release, so someone else should make that happen! :-D
---
it's 2019, it's ok to like nelfs now
---
I imagine Blizzard might be a bit more proactiving on shutting down private servers if they are direct competition.
---
Hunter. /Thread
---
Uh no everyone wants dwarf for fearward.
---
Ever seen a feral druid good at powershifting? It does some nasty things.
---
Results?
---
As I said to the other guy, ever seen a feral druid good at powershifting?
---
Honestly mate just grind the bats in EPL that's the solution for you.
---
Private servers mate
---
Someone posted a chart the other days with an estimate of 2 million current subs.  This is of course and estimate and no one knows for sure, but that would indicate a collapse of the WoW user base. 
---
I think a bounce back to 6 million would be a good start after 3 months.  Hopefully it will continue to climb from there.
---
I didn't say you have to give up playing WoW though is the whole point.
---
He is considering just passing on the girl because he is afraid of losing WoW time.
---
Again, I know this subreddit memes a lot, but I honestly cant believe if you think this chick could be Ted Mosby's "The One" that you're willing to pass that up so you can play a game you likely already played.
---
Being in love like I currently am, I can't even fathom wanting to back down from my relationship due to World of Warcraft. I played Vanilla when I was single and at times I blew people off I was friends with IRL just because I wanted to game and not even lose a couple hours of playtime. I've been on both sides.
---
I'd be surprised if it lasted that long. You really only need to get people out of the initial 1-6 areas IMO. After that people will start to spread out.
---
I am coming over from a WOTLK private server and happy to pay for Classic. The customer support on private servers is terrible and bugs literally never get fixed.
---
I feel like a lot of P servers will eventually shut themselves down after the majority of the playerbase migrates over to the official servers.
---
Same thing as a rogue pickpocketing and picking grave moss from rfd. All that sweet cash
---
There weren't any add-ons for quests back then and most quests weren't online unless they were specifically hard and someone was so frustrated they detailed how to do it usually.  Eventually websites came out posting quest guides and whatnot, so yeah leveling this time around even for someone new to MMO's will be 10x easier than before.
---
Warlock and Hunter can easily take on quests and elite mobs a few levels above and kite for ever if played well.
---
Does it matter? We won't find out anyway. Blizzard won't give us the number unless there will be successful retail expansion so people might think it's not just Classic pushing the numbers.
---
Yeah, but minmaxers, skilled players, fully prepared raiders, tryhards or combinations of those are vast minority of gamers so you can't for example assume that all warriors were at 100% efficiency for sake of an argument.
---
Sure it does, you just never played with someone on retail from Ragnaros.
---
I think expecting sub numbers to triple is exceedingly optimistic and informed by this sub's hype more than real world expectations.
---
The world record is outdated as hell. Even the holder admits it. 5-6 played is completely normal for an experienced player for any class.
---
Blizzard stopped reporting numbers after Warlords of Draenor, so no one actually knows.
---
Prestiging society.
---
I see. Yeah I'm at lvl 10 now and at lvl 12 quests, so it does seem that overlevel with not be of any issue like you say. But the fear of making a Darna rep quest turn grey just lurks in the back of my mind so I'd rather play it safe. But yeah I guess I could relax a little bit with the cave quests indeed.
---
I'm scared of raiding already as a horde warlock
---
The game was like that just before TBC release. Don't confuse private server mechanics for vanilla mechanics. Private servers have been wrong on so many different variables.
---
in your opinion maybe. once you have a mount, it isn't really all that much work to level up a gathering profession. mining specifically is a huge waste of time if you try to bother leveling it before you get to a higher level. if you really cared that much, you could just slowly level herbalism while leveling and then catch mining up in an evening once you hit 60
---
I mean there are some xp bonuses but I highly doubt it's coming to Classic. They haven't made any official updates but I don't think they'd let those bonuses move over to Classic servers.
---
i completely agree. it always bugged me when i wanted to meet up with a friend before we ran icc but we never could, somehow, even if we had all done (or not done) the same quests
---
agreed! it's so atmospheric
---
I am more scared about empty realms than overpacked realms
---
I literally am in a discord where about 60 people plan to raid MC by day 7.
---
That is beyond my power.
---
Ok? You seem to be assuming that this guy was a top tier feral druid who for some reason was raiding with mediocre warriors, rogues, and mages.
---
ok
---
Booooo
---
&gt;also with dynamic spawns and possibly higher droprates etc.
---
And higher population and possibly lower droprate.
---
Why the fuck does everyone assume that because pservers aren't 100% accurate that it automatically means it's easier?
---
You sound like a blizzard employee lol, but by the community reaction to its upcoming release I def don’t share that fear lol
---
Smashmouth: Disconnect the dots.
---
I've been preparing my GF for months now. Telling her Classic is coming this summer over and over again. I'll miss her.
---
Well I'm also talking about the whisper conversation between leader and potential party member. If you have 4 people for 30+ minutes but looking for a healer which happens often in Classic, and someone is saying LFG in General, you shift-click their name and see it's a paladin, start talking to them and explain you need a healer but they stubbornly would only dps, it's annoying as hell. We all need the quests, we all need the gear, it's just annoying when we all (the ret pally included) have to waste a lot more of our time finding group members just because someone has a thing against casting healing spells.
---
Yes even worse if your feral Druid with 3 sets.   
---
Tank items, healing set, dps set.  (You switch out a few if your tanking).   
---
And at 60 I had 4 sets 
---
Cat,bear, caster, healer  add in the FR and NR and FrR sets to raid you start to fill up.
---
You aren't a terrible person, that's a good plan
---
Does your wife not have any hobbies herself? You basically have to either be working, taking care of the kids or just doing something with her all the time? That sounds unhealthy.
---
What? You can see energy regen is wrong by comparing demo footage to retail Vanilla footage. Same for every example I gave you so far.
---
Their plan is to implement sharding for the launch likely for a limited time period and in limited zones. They haven't clarified what those limits will be and probably won't because it will depend on how launch is playing out.
---
Mages are the best class to pick from.  They can farm, aoe, conjure water/portals.
---
In you opinion as well from you explanation.  Either way, piss poor plan.
---
Yes just save some healing gear on your way leveling
---
I don’t disagree with you at all. Mainly sub 20 zones are where I expect sharding.
---
i didnt know that a friend sent me this and i just wanted to share with the community :) thanks for sharing!
---
Meanwhile lets rely on our memory of a game from 15 years ago.
---
That'll surely be more accurate!!11
---
Ok cool thanks! Hope they don’t apply it to proff nodes by accident lol
---
I think if classic brings back another 2 million subs then blizzard should definitely start advertising a resurgence and get more people to join.
---
Yeah that doesn’t make it right
---
I was on when he hit it, and it was like really early into day 5 too iirc.
---
whats annoying is you assuming they should change their entire character for you and your group, if they were invited as being dps, then let him be dps, if you need a healer, dont invite him, it isnt that hard.
---
fuck blizzard
---
blizzarse\*
---
Yeah mages are great but I played one back in vanilla and TBC, so want to try something else.
---
I’l give it a little more thought, but like the idea of enchanting as I level.
---
I wouldnt agree you can one shot everything as whole world is scaled with you Ilvl.  
---
But sure, i get what you're saying and to some degree i agree.  
---
However when saying that minor content like killings mobs was more difficult in Vanilla is okay, it doesnt mean it requires skill. It just requires basic knowledge of game mechanics.  
---
&gt; I mean I slept through the first couple months of BFA yet was still downing a few mythic bosses and it still feels harder (also more fun but hey ho) to take a single mob as a warrior and having to pop all CD's or hamstring, Rend, Kite the mob than it did doing mythic Uldir. 
---
That doesnt really make any sense, but whatever.  
---
As far i cant wait for Classic, i feel many people are disingenuous about their hate for retail.  
---
Things like rng, flying, lfr, theme-parks etc. deserve criticism, but going after raids and dungeons seems pretty random for me. I've never seen meaningful arguments against them. Design of them and challenge they bring is amazing.
---
I need a launch date so that I can put in my 2 weeks notice and quit my shit job to no life WoW Classic for a month before getting another shit job.
---
I'm confused... Ret was a DPS class right?    
---
Or were they able to heal as well?
---
I agree and disagree.  Yes, it still puts a ton of pressure, but it's not like it was in tbc or later where you had to run all over the world to hit dailies in each zone for rep etc. which took much more time to be optimal.
---
Hey, I think I am in the same discord, and plan on assisting in it.
---
If im offline more thatn one hour, i often Heartstone too an inn. My HS will then get off cooldown when im logging back. 
---
And you get rested XP while not beeing in an inn too, but just in half (?) the speed.
---
I mean this forum has 77k members and I dont know how many people are interested in classic that aren't on this forum. If theres only 100k players scattered across 10 realms that would be 10k players and not everyone would be online at the same time. Idk I shouldn't have any expectations I should just enjoy leveling and playing in the immersive world that is world of warcraft.
---
Yea I mean that's why I don't want that in classic. I mean if it's in I'll be referring a new account just for bonus xp. If not.. it makes sense
---
Or on the other hand, people saying that you can't heal unless you're holy/resto spec.
---
/facepalm
---
tfw you make a weekly stickied thread for all the complaints so everyone else can pretend the game is still good
---
I thought the same exact thing at 28. I'm 34 now. I'm definitely a "don't get into a relationship just for the sake of it" type of person, and I'm super independent. That was a struggle for her to deal with initially, but we've both made compromises for the happiness of the other. That's what a realistic should be. Don't get me wrong, we fight like anyone else, we get mad at each other and it's not always healthy, but at the end of the day I care more about her than I do taking the easy way out and walking away.
---
That said they're is absolutely nothing wrong with being happy alone. I loved my me time, and as a creative introvert, I keep myself busy regardless.
---
Not one person would consider this thanks to the success of Bfa or next expansion which would turn everyone away from retail because it's clearly worse then retail if Classic would grow much faster. That would be final nail in the coffin. That's never going to happen unless there will be well received patch or expansion.

The post on the main sub about classic did very well apparently which is so good news too

Good luck....no buying it from GMs like on PServers.

When I played in Retail Vanilla (2006), I only ever saw 1 Thunderfury on my server.

On the PServers, everyone and their hunter are running around Org with a TF on their back...it's stupid.

Ret Paladin and moonkin Druid combo
---
Rich players? It was literally required to access certain dungeons. By 70 anyone could afford a regular flying mount from quest gold alone.
---
Yeah, things like warlock ports, frequent consumables usage, and the like could easily push things towards 4 days imo. I feel like realistically you'd need support for it, though.
---
&gt; Jumping on the great lift.
---
Oh man, I forgot how great that moment was the first time. I was new to the game in early 2006 thanks to my college roommate (I had played the stress test/open beta or something like that). We both made Feral Druids to quest together, and heading to 1K and getting on that lift was when the game really started to take off. Not just the awe-inspiring scale of the game really coming into play, but also when the talents and spells are making feel much more powerful than when you started.
---
I can't wait to relive that. Getting so hyped!
---
I only said it's annoying as hell... They can be dps if they want but when you're looking for a healer for 30+ mins to complete your group and someone stubbornly won't heal as a healing class and we all (them included) have to spend a lot more time finding group members when we all need the gear and quests from the dungeon, it's really annoying.
---
I disagree with the second part of your statement, too. It's not about what your spec is, it's about what the group needs at the moment. It's known that you can heal or tank in a dps spec in leveling dungeons. On my priest I was shadow even through pre-raid BiS, but I always offered to heal first, but often there was a shaman or druid or other priest, in which case I would offer to dps (I preferred healing in groups - I just was shadow for PvP and farming), MC, shackle, whatever. I've recently shaman tanked (just RFC and WC, but regardless) where the group was fine with the warrior stepping aside to allow me to tank, but ready to have the warrior tank if I failed. As a warrior I've stepped aside for druids that wanted to tank. What you're saying is a big generalization.
---
how is it piss poor? you spend one or two evenings leveling it at the cost of time spent farming, but increase the gold produced when farming in the future. its just another form of long term investment that will pay itself off if you prefer to farm in the open world and do it in a way that benefits from having both professions
---
Mining/Engineering. It's simply too good.
---
Paladin tend to lack on the dps front, and those bombs you can make make a huge difference. It also gives you a ranged pull vs non-undead. As well as some extra interupts/disorients to heal during.
---
Will Classic support modern day add-ons? Will we see weak auras and DBM??
---
I remember farming so much scarlet monestary as a rogue to get fadeleaf and lockpick chests.
---
Lol in tbc yes. In vanilla no. 
---
I had a good add on in tbc that put a big red marker on screen when I should powershift. But by then I was tanking almost all encounters. (Druids was op in start of tbc). 
---
I would rate my self a mediocre feral Druid at best, at the same time I did earn my slots.  I never cared for meters.  The only measure I use is did we make it or did we not make the encounter.  
---
I mean the funniest raids is when shit hit fan and somehow you make it by sheer luck or skill. 
---
Same goes for dungeons a perfect run have its charm but comparing to a guildrun with horrific failures. Laughter and beer. I would pick the later over a clean stratholm any day.
---
Deadmines is definitely VC.
---
Vanilla has been so long that I forgot most of the things.    
---
Can you explain why I don't need to respec for dungeons? Were ret pallys able to heal too?
---
Yeah Im going to "try" I think I could manage if I take some time off work but idk lol
---
Vanilla Barrens are legendary for a reason
---
What you're missing is that they're not changing their entire character. You can heal for an hour and potentially have some social interaction or you can sit around and spend a good part of that hour still looking for a group.
---
I'm going to speed level so that I can gank casuals and tourists!
---
To be fair, it really doesn't have anything to do with classic WoW, except for you. I could say that the movie Titanic is what helped me grind levels, but posting a link to the movie here wouldn't be relevant for anyone else.
---
I tank and dps never had a problem leveling either.
---
You spent so much time on this and it was so wrong fundamentally. Jesus did you double check any of this math?
---
Okay so I’ve only played WoW my entire childhood but was not able to hop on W3
---
I just pre ordered to play it to help my craving, but do you recommend starting w3: reign of chaos or w3: frozen throne? I would like to be caught up lore wise but I’m not to sure which to start with or if they’re essentially the same thing
---
I always thought it meant self-aware.
---
Lol I think most people are pretty reasonable about it but posts like these just bring out the jokes in us and then some who actually agree
---
I was actually thinking the same but a friend proved me wrong recently. There's no official announcement sharding will happen. It's just an option on the table. People got really mad (for a good reason) after they saw sharding in the demo and that's it. Just clarifying here. Sharding is not the plan. We don't know the plan. Devs might not know the plan.
---
I believe in Vanilla 1.12 wow (at least on PSs, difficult to say what will happen in Classic) all names will be with the first letter capital and the rest not. So in your last example it would be "Xxpwnnoobsxx" also numbers are not allowed I believe. But Xxpwnnoobsxx is dope tho, I might take it
---
Yeah, people only really figured out powershifting once TBC was out but it still applies to vanilla and has become a thing on vanilla private servers among feral druids that are willing to put in the time and effort to get good at it.
---
oddly wholesome comment
---
I'm not a competitive raider but was there any reason the competitive raid guilds were a bad impact on WoW? How did such raid guilds pushing for realm firsts impact other players?
---
It's a dps spec but for dungeons it's more important that you wear the right gear.
---
good call
---
Not if she plays a female Dwarf.
---
Oh really? I must have been one broke motherfucker.
---
There are plenty of people who may be interested in a topic but are unaware or simply aren’t on Reddit. Using this sub’s member count as a basis for estimating the interest in Classic is a bad comparison to make.
---
Also, on some askreddit threads about ‘what old computer game do you miss?’ (or some variation), I have seen responses of ‘original WoW’ and yet, when asked, they’ve never heard of Classic WoW, much less joined the sub. I suppose if they played vanilla and maybe a couple of expansions further, then got busy with another game or something else entirely and so aren’t paying attention to WoW news, a person will have no idea. I don’t think Blizzard has marketed Classic at all, just made a couple of announcements at BlizzCon and on their official forums.
---
Yeah - pet classes are always the best but I had the most fun soloing as a paladin. Took a lot longer but I didnt die that often. I was able to solo farm the ZG tiger boss for awhile.
---
Blizzard has already stated that Sharding will Be used early on in the starting zones to prevent this bottleneck issue. 
---
However sharding will break aspects of vanilla if used long term. So I expect it to be a thing for a week or 2 and then they will get rid of it. 
---
Again BLIZZARD HAS CONFIRMED SHARDING FOR LAUNCH, and that sharding WILL BE REMOVED AFTER LAUNCH
---
i'm confused, are enh shamans supposed to be stacking strength or agility?
---
so as long as you have healing gear on, you could heal dungeons even as a Ret?
---
&gt; They never even tried to fix faction balance from my experience.
---
Oh, they tried alright. By adding freaking *elves* to the Horde.
---
I've no idea whether or to what extent that may have resolved the issue, but I do know the gorram pointy ears suddenly outnumbered every other Horde race virtually 2:1 almost overnight on my server.
---
It wasn't until years later, with the benefit of hindsight, that I realized why most of the changes made in TBC were bad for the game, but I hated the blood elves joining the Horde from Day One.
---
I'm saying if classic brings back a lot of subd they should start marketing it.
---
With good gear, paladin
---
I always waste it on crap that looks better, even if it has worse stats. "Omg, this cape is so ugly! I gotta spend 3g to replace it with this Long Silken Cloak." :(
---
Lmao
---
Repost.
---
No not a bad comparison at all it’s indicative of there being interest.
---
No flying
---
Although, that could just be referencing what it was like in 2004/2005.
---
I think mining/engineering would be the best if you didn’t care about gold too much, and you planned on pvping quite a bit at 60. 
---
I’m leveling Ret, then Prot at 41, and switching to holy at 60 when I get gear. I will be picking up skinning and herbalism while leveling for gold making, then will drop skinning for alchemy at 60. 
---
My alt will eventually have mining/engineering though.
---
People are going to be a lot angrier killing boars at lvl will take 30 min
---
I wonder if it’s similar to the psychology behind other types of “loyalty”, like those who shit on anybody using anything but Windows or old codgers bickering about which truck company is best.
---
I’m actually going to be making the ugliest Female Dwarf possible, and NEVER show my helmet. It will be rage inducing for the opposite faction in PvP, as well as my own faction who has to look at me.
---
I honestly can’t wait. It’s going to be hilarious.
---
They should pay for asvertising soon. There's a lot of us who gave up on mmorpgs after WoW went to shit and every other alternative was trash. I don't even know how I found out about classic WoW was the last thing on my mind. Sure tons of old players are the same way
---
Where is this confirmation, another comment said this might not be true?
---
Repost but still relatable af
---
Nonsense. Only a few people switch to their healing spec before getting to ~58-60. 
---
I know I never did and I never had more than one or two healing equips. Healing anything below the level 55+ dungeons is *easy*.
---
Depends? This is mainly true assuming &lt; lvl 45 or so and that the group is well constructed/played
---
95% of people that think they care about the numbers only think they care because of the 5% of people that talk about it non-stop. No one cares, including you. Pick undead.
---
That's good to know I was under the assumption you had to be at an inn to get the rested xp.
---
He's way past age to play WoW
---
Is this an original meme template?  If so its dank AF
---
You're in a very lucky spot having never played vanilla WoW, that means you won't be as jaded as some one who's played retail for years and hate what it's become.
---
The very best part about Vanilla/Classic wow will be communities. Find a guild, make friends and have fun being lost in a massive world.
---
Sorry i recently found this sub and just saw the meme on twitter :D Didn't knew it was reposted
---
"Is there a sign on my house that reads Dead Dwarf Storage?"
---
It really brings the place together.
---
Trying to get my wife to play with me but I used up my shot on retail wow during BFA launch before classic announced I think.
---
I don't think she trusts me it will be better this time lol. Ahh oh well, at least she doesn't mind me playing it a lot
---
&gt;take my upvote.
---
I don't get that reasoning either. An expansion pre-patch is still part of that expansion. I'd liken it to a teaser. Test a talent revamp, different class mechanics, things like that.
---
Shit, one of the best dungeon healers I knew back in Vanilla mained shadow spec and even healed as shadow half the time.
---
U don't have to heal dungeons as an enhancer. If you gear for dmg you will top dps meters in 5mans up to 60, if you know what you're doing. But be careful about getting aggro as a good wf proc can get you killed quite quickly.
---
If you want to heal for dungeons you will have to have a second set of heal gear ready because any other way you're oom after a few heals as you normally would go for str agi gear more than anything.
---
While lvling look at the weapons dps more than anything else, yes, even if its a staff and not a fancy 2h axe.
---
I'll probably try the permadeath challenge in a year or two, but without the silly restrictions. I think talents and gear with pots will be plenty interesting on its own.
---
I've seen feral druids be pretty good at being powerbottoms.
---
Strength, though youll be hard pressed to actually find decent strength gear as a Shaman.
---
Your article assumes a lot of things and doesn't even take into account rested experience. If you think playing 40 hours per week for 12 weeks is how long it takes the "average player" to get to 60, you are incredibly wrong.
---
As far as we know you only need a world of warcraft subscription to play classic. I don't know if classic will be a separate client, in which case you probably wouldn't even need retail installed at all, or if it'll be a server option within the current client, in which case you will probably just have to let it update but won't have to buy anything on top of it.
---
Either way, it's exceedingly unlikely you will have to pay for anything above and beyond a world of warcraft subscription.
---
but you get to do ANAL in gf
---
It's just any single raid. You can use consumables to shorten the time each raid takes, and allow the guild to do every raid in a single evening instead of having multiple raid nights.
---
That is HUGE when you are organizing 40 people.
---
20 days is unbelievably slow.  I'm not sure how it would take anyone 20 days /played to get to 60.  You could level up both primary professions, all secondary professions, and take time it run all dungeons on the way to 60 and still do it in less than 20 days /played without even trying to hurry.
---
My first character, which I started November '04, hit 60 in about half that time - and I definitely wasn't rushing.  I had no idea what I was doing in fact.  My alts were typically hitting 60 around 6 days /played - and although I was definitely making a concerted effort to level quickly, I still did plenty of meandering and did not take the most efficient route at all.
---
oh cool! Never knew that!     
---
Thanks!!!
---
As stated, the game is running off of the very last patch pre TBC. These mechanics were changed time and again throughout the vanilla lifespan. Content will be time gated on Classic WoW but stats/talents are set to the last patch from the start.
---
This information is outdated and incomplete. For example, you left out how much baking soda is needed.
---
A source stating that it takes less than 20 days played on average to get to 60? 
---
Can you give me a source the sky is blue?
---
Anything that works on Macs?

I still think they didn't mention Classic in the report so they can keep it kinda a passion project and don't have to add ingame shop and such bullcrap.
---
I’ll share one thing that video games really influenced me on that I feel is rather unique since I’ve run into very few who have had a similar experience. 
---
Growing up I was extremely into sports (I still enjoy them today (mostly baseball)). I played baseball, basketball, golf, tennis, volleyball all competitively and others semi-competitively. I was good... like if I would’ve pursued baseball I could’ve MAYBE played I college. I was also too competitive and slightly arrogant at that age. 
---
When I was about 13/14, I started getting into more computer games (always played snes, n64, etc... but computer games were new). I spent a lot of time playing WoW, Diablo II, WC3, etc... and I loved/love them. 
---
What I noticed is that I started to “care” about sports less (mostly the competitive side). I still enjoyed them and played them in passing, but I didn’t care about the competition or being the best anymore. I didn’t push myself to excel at those sports nor try to make a team that I otherwise would have. 
---
I look back on it now and am happy. I don’t have much of that arrogance in me anymore and I rarely play sports (still diehard Brewers fan) other than occasional casual get-togethers. Part of me wonders what could’ve been if I would’ve stuck with them and I slightly regret not pursuing a sport at that time, but I’m grateful for the new experiences I learned and was able to have with games like WoW because of my interest shift. To this day, some of my greatest memories are playing WoW with my best friends and wouldn’t trade that for the world. 
---
Can’t wait for Classic.
---
I mean that's fine, people in this sub are losing their mind anyway, memes are the only thing keeping me sane honestly. And it's still funny ;)
---
When I leveled my shaman I didn't do either of these things but, use earth bind totem to weave in and out of combat with the npc you are killing. Only trading one hit at a time. Make sure you use the slowest two hander you can.
---
Also I am told that ele is faster leveling after 40. That being said I will admit I have no idea how that could be the case. Just way better leveling shammies then me say it is.
---
I healed as Ret for years. Your specc hardly mattered in Classic when you're doing a 40 man raid.
---
Knetka is a cool name
---
That too. I hope it stays that way.
---
It's missing the Chad bulge.
---
&gt; 20 days will be very close to the average, for sure.
---
It's not dude.  Even us first timers that dinged 60 in early '05 without any idea what we were doing were still hitting 60 well before 20 days.    Honestly, I don't even know how someone could possibly take 20 days played to hit 60.  It seems impossible.
---
The thing is that with dwindling server sizes, cross-realm BGs is a solution to fix the issue. However, if hope blizzard comes up with an idea to keep this from happening.
---
Maybe server merges or battle grouping could be a solution.
---
Battle-grouping: Every server has a battle group of 3 different servers. When you queue, you can only ever be placed with players from those servers. So, essentially you are sacrificing some locality for no longer it only being your server, but your preserving it some by not queuing with all of WoW.
---
He has a lot of funny stuff like this scattered throughout his vids.  :)
---
http://i.imgur.com/7XQeZhp.jpg
---
It’s not that easy, many dungeons it’s easy to overpull and you’ll have two or three party members getting aggro and needing heals.
---
Innervate helps a lot, but still. Even in low level dungeons such as Deadmines or Stockade it’s so easy to pull a couple mobs too many.
---
Nonsense, make him roll a hunter.
---
&gt; I vividly remember my one friend having over 20 days played at level 40 back in the day. 
---
Your vivid memory is wrong.  It has to be.  Unless one was setting out as a goof to somehow have a ridiculously long play time, it's impossible to only hit level 40 after 20 days /played.
---
Physical.
---
Slowest 2H you can find. There's a blue in LBRS with 4.0 attack speed.
---
It's going to be ok. You are not going to roflstomp everything around you and neither does a windfury shaman, no matter what the videos show.
---
&gt; Questing is &gt; grinding. but grinding abit here and there if you've found some mobs which are easy and fast to kill and there is no competition, it will give you a nice bump in xp, which is nice, but generally you are just questing. stop and grind abit here and there when you feel its convinient. 
---
Also grind as you walk places it is one of the most time efficient ways to grind.
---
Priests are ok at solo even in holy spec, as long as you get some decent spell power gear.  
---
The more effective you want to be soloing the more sacrifice you make for raid healing, obviously.  And priests can't do some of the stuff that warlocks can (cc multiple mobs at once).
---
But priests are pretty versatile.  Farming one mob at a time you can have really high efficiency with high spirit and spirit tap.  You can sometimes farm lots of AOE mobs with holy nova. Etc.  
---
I think 21/25/5 is a pretty good "I can heal but also sustain myself solo really well" spec.
---
I mean if it wasn't for their walking animation, I'd have rolled dwarf every single time. But man does it look goofy... Shame
---
Unlike some classes where one spec is far and away the best for leveling, Shaman has options for leveling. You can use an elemental spec, for example, using more spells and 1h/flametongue, which is better at killing mobs but has more down time than the 2h/rockbiter enhance spec. You can even level as resto if you get a few big points in enhance/ele first to speed things up. There are quite a few videos and written guides about how to play shaman, and they're quite good.
---
Having gone through the process of cross referencing a million guides myself, my biggest advice for you is to try a private server (accelerated xp rates if you cba with practicing leveling itself) and figure out which spec feels best to you, and learn a bit about how the game feels in vanilla. If you're interesting in mostly playing PvE or PvP, I'd check out some videos of resto shaman raiders or ele (or enhance but seriously, ele is better) PvPers. These will help you get a sense of the cadence of the game, how your bars should be set up, what your toolkit includes, etc..
---
For as old as this format is I don't think I've ever seen it combined with pulp fiction
---
ding
---
There were mobs hostile to one faction but friendly to the other, but I think they were mostly restricted to NPCs in faction-specific quest hubs (like Crossroads NPCs). I don't remember if the NPC mobs in Durotar were flagged that way though.
---
I hope they do market it, really. I know they said they’d keep the game going regardless of population, but I want it to thrive. Marketing would help with that.
---
I have been tempted to sub to retail to re-explore some of the old regions (what hasn’t been changed, anyway), maybe poke at some of the professions that haven’t been altered too much. But I want my sub to count among those old, returning accounts once Classic is about to go live.
---
Hi, /u/Vaelen-
---
i haven't played classic since classic. but how are locks at end game?  I am not expecting to top the charts or anything i just want to be able to find a guild and have a purpose.
---
Are we still talking about my examples? All 3 of them never changed in Vanilla. There's no doubt in my mind about that. You won't find retail Vanilla footage that proves me wrong. 
---
Also, it's not time gating. It's content release schedule. Every big patch in the game would be time gating according to your definition.
---
I dont assume, I have played both. Private servers are not easier in every regard but nostalrius had increased exp gains, higher droprates for several quests and more. Dynamic spawning is often faster than if you were alone in a zone.  
---
Im not saying its easier overall, im pointing out it has been easier in these specific areas.
---
Night elf mohawk
---
Relevance? People post videos from private servers all the time.
---
I will go for herb/enchanting, sins paladin don't need 90 gold for 40 mount I can de all greens/blues on my way to 60. You can save mats from enhancement until you hit 60 or make lesser and greater wands at low level. And at 60 you can get agility on weapons from grinding in winterspring or try for crusader to make you some mony. Will dropp herb as soon as I get an alt and get engineering. But I'm levelling as a duo paly/warr
---
Thats not his problem though, you need a healer and hes a dps. Its annoying when others insist on telling you what you should play. If its a massive problem for you trying to find a healer, then why dont you play one yourself, boom problem fixed.
---
&gt; you should be done in 8-12 days /played.
---
And this is without even rushing.  Just normal play.
---
Fush you, mang.
---
Sure, but the difference between healing and DPS spec at level... 30 is negligible, and no amount of specialised level 30 heal equipment (or more realistically, level 15-25 heal equipment) will counter an overly eager puller.
---
Eh.
---
You seem confused about how classes work in Vanilla. There are three skill trees, but the only interaction with them is putting in the points you get for leveling up. You don't just choose one and that's it, and apart from 0-2 abilities per tree that require a talent most things you can do are not restricted by the spec.
---
Helps to have a bigger mana pool tho.
---
Those cauldron quests, baby.
---
That was my point.
---
these should be opposite
---
You would've already been dead
---
Fully geared two handed Warrior with a Shaman dropping wind fury....unstoppable.
---
It's actually named [Slow Fall](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=130).
---
Nice! This is actually something I’m going to do this time around. I never cared for Fishing or Cooking in Classic.
---
Healing in instance ? Have a better mana regen during leveling ?
---
Nah.  Sparkly ball tho.
---
As others said, sudden IP changes can trigger account locks. This used to happen to me a looooooot, and it gets old quick having to reset your password every day.
---
It isn't in and of itself bannable, but if your IP changes around you're in for headaches.
---
Disregard females acquire gold
---
They didn't call them poverty pigeons for nothing...
---
Even then, it wasn't taking anyone 30 days /played to hit 60.
---
I was an MMORPG noob, playing with a couple other friends that were MMORPG noobs, and we would waste so much time exploring the world and picking random PvP fights, etc., and we were all hitting 60 well before 12 days /played.
---
You can heal easily with dps specs with just basic int/spirit gear all the way to 60. You'll need to drink a ton but you really should be hitting up a mage to get drinks while in town or in the dungeon if one is in the party.
---
[Too slow!](https://imgur.com/a/eLnz2sM)
---
Ok, Thanks! 
---
So what i hear from that is "Ret/Rek" for PvP and not "Holy/Rek" ... or rahter: Giving up the holy immortal nature of a PvP Pally for even more burst is a good idea xD
---
There are more options than just sharding. Also, your argument could work for sharding the whole world. Will people get angry because they fight over 1 mithril ore, 1 devilsaur skin, 1 grave moss, 1 quest mob in stv for 30 min? No problem bruv, just slap a shard.
---
Yes and healing shamans don't want alot of there tier sets until T3 you'll probably find it easy to gear towards pvp
---
How do? 77k is just an abstract number with no relevance, nothing to compare to, nothing to say what it means. You don’t know how many redditors haven’t heard of Classic WoW because they don’t otherwise pay attention to gaming/Blizzard news. You don’t know how many that are planning to play but aren’t on reddit at all. 
---
Fun game. I am the only redditor in my circle of friends/family that game. Guess how many are returning to Classic. The number itself is irrelevant, I will only say that I am not a badass Bear Islander and count as much as 10. The point is I am one of 77k on here yet represent several others not on Reddit, not in that 77k. And I know I am not unique.
---
That's what I'll be doing, too. I have friends I'm going to play with that want to take their time and enjoy the adventure. They want to play Horde, so I'll make a Horde character to play with them.
---
I also want to give a Paladin a go, so when my friends are around I'll play my Horde character, and when they aren't I'll jump to my Paladin.
---
You might be right my friend Dale ran the numbers from the server and to the guys up North the numbers seemed accurate to us.  Who knows anymore though they could be wildly inaccurate, it’s been too dam long since vanilla!
---
Im not going to go through a raid teir list as that is going to much in depth for what I have, and I don't pvp is classic often. 
---
* Tanks: Warrior, Paladin, Bear, Shaman, Hunter pet/Warlock Voidwalker
---
* Healers: Priest, Shaman, Druid, (Not sure where pally fits here, I play horde)
---
* DPS: Diversify group by armour class 
---
1. Cloth: Mage, Warlock, Preist, 
---
2. PreMail - Leather: Rogue, Hunter, Druid
---
3. PrePlatemail - Mail: Warrior, Paladin
---
4. PostPlatemail - Mail: Hunter, Shaman
---
5. Plate: Warrior, Paladin
---
Of course it does, did you not see 'make love not warcraft'?  The leveling montage in it features a song in the playlist.
---
It's basically a classic-related meme that someone might (and did, going by comments thay were on it before it was removed) get enjoyment out of
---
You might get flagged for review if you use your VPN and your logins are showing up from multiple IPs all over the place. But if you use a single geographic location you should be fine.
---
Could you give me a breakdown of your "if you are good you will stunlock"-rotation?
---
I don't wanna call the post dumb, because the guy put real earnest effort into preparing it.  It's just that he took all his data from one guy's website, and unfortunately that data is completely incorrect - so all of his resultant conclusions are completely wrong too.
---
sorry it's been so long since playing Vanilla and play retail on and off has made me confused with a lot of stuff.   
---
Thanks for clearing it up!
---
I should have specified instead of also useful for pvp, as mostly useful for pvp.  No one wants fear ward in a raid, that's true.  But it's pretty good for a pvp holy priest.
---
No Way, you’re not doomhandel are you ? 😦
---
let me guess - you put anal thunderfury through a hash function, then you post the function whenever someone asks you what it is?
---
Nope.  Thats intelligent life.  Often intermingled when talking about looking for aliens.  "The search for sentient life"
---
Tanks and healers are desired for 5 mans of course and people aren't picky. You can have a druid healing a prot pally just fine. Tanks are less desired in raids because there are relatively less than them in the raid overall, healers are obviously in demand for raids but druids less than others. As for DPS you cant go wrong with mage or rogue, warlock and fury warrior are strong too. Any other spec and you can find groups for 5 mans but you may not be taken to raids unless there's no one else. 
---
If you want to be needed throughout the entire game roll a holy priest lol.
---
I can enjoy it on the way back.
---
Or to remove the metaphor and go back to Classic, I will be slow-leveling a character with friends and fast(er) leveling a character when they aren't around. I work from home and some days when I'm not busy I have a few hours I can kill during the day (like today, for example).
---
Didn't it drop down 5g each week you didn't use it, too?
---
&gt; it’s indicative of there being interest. 
---
Please... im just saying there is interest, sorry you need it quantified exactly, I cannot do that and I don't have to as it was not part of my argument.
---
I had extensive pvp experience as an undead rogue in vanilla. My buddies all want to go alliance in classic and I wish to play rogue again but can't imagine hitting the bgs without wotf. Fear gives certain classes such an upperhand to put range on you.
---
Has anyone else made this transition, how was it?
---
While sitting in the dentists chair this morning I had an odd thought, immagine if the success of classic was so great they remade expansions with surveys from the players. If the players voted they would re release BC and then WOTLK and then never release WoD and release a new expansion. They would have a chance to redo expansions people didnt like. I know this would never happen but it seemed nice if you dont account for all the money they would spend making a replacement expansion.
---
The raid attunements for onyxia alliance faction, mc and bwl
---
So help me god it is called DM unless you are in stormwind. Calling DM, VC, is punishable by endless waves of gnomish combat till death!
---
And you're a giant douche. Well played.
---
Sit down, drink it in, explore, interact, play what you like and how you like it, go at your own pace, and enjoy the ride.
---
Sounds about right. I did similar on a private server. AoE grinding on a prot pally was absolutely nuts.
---
That's just cringe.
---
If she judges you and makes you feel **unwanted**, then grow up and dump her.
---
Lucky for you, leaving a group while in an instance has the same effect. No hearthstone required!
---
Or stay holy/ret and heal saving up your charges for unexpected burst. This is defenetly better in premades sins it is easier to find a spot as a healer then dps as paladin

The entire defias brotherhood quest in westfall is amazing
---
I think it’s kind of a “you can’t reason somebody out of an opinion they didn’t reason themselves Into” situation. Those people wanted to think 2.0 was Vanilla, because the class design and updates were what they wanted out of Vanilla.
---
Honestly, aside from a few crucial changes (thunder clap in def stance for example) I think 2.0.1 expanded beautifully on Vanilla. BC has the best mix of class identity and viability. 
---
Still, I’d never vouch for those changes to go over to Vanilla. But I think they just preferred it so much they force themselves to call it Vanilla, even though it has a 2. In front of it and lasted 2 weeks.
---
he’s playing with his friends so they’re not going to just replace him with another random person because of his spec. it’s not always about the best performance it’s about enjoying the game.
---
Idk, I don't think he'd be questioning it if she was the one. Being the one means sharing common interests and goals, which it doesn't sound like she does. 
---
Also, I play with my friends so generally we all agree on a night in. I guess it's hard for me to fathom trying to compromise my passions for social interaction when my passions are social.
---
Oh id easily add 9 days. I know how first timers play the game. One of my friends played on Nostalrius with me, as a first timer in WoW, and while he loved every minute he only got to level 38 I believe, in about 10 days played. Meanwhile another friend of mine, a veteran, knowing every quest inside and out spend 15 days to 60.  
---
I see some people here suggesting Veteran players easily make it by the 6th day when trying to rush.. ehh, no. You need to realise theres a difference between the hardcore classic community thats played all of these zones countless times, and retail veterans. They have not played vanilla, or even vanilla style wow for a decade.. minimum.   
---
We'll just have to agree to disagree, and wait and see how it all pans out.
---
Time gated and content release schedule mean the same thing so I'm not sure what you're on about with that. The devs explicitly said that only item drops, dungeon/raid access, and pvp will be released in phases. The stats of gear and our characters as well as their talent tree will all be based off the final vanilla patch.
---
Energy regen was being tested in the beta but was reverted to the old system to maintain the vanilla feel. Shamans were able to 2h without the talent for reduced dps back in vanilla. As for the hunter pet, please show a video of Naxx where the hunter is not pulled in combat with his pet.
---
Really depends what the group is for. These lists are just from my own experience on pservers.
---
Dungeon content, easiest to hardest:
---
- warrior (tank)
---
- priest/sham/Pala/druid (healer)
---
- mage
---
- warlock
---
- hunter
---
- rogue
---
Raid content, easiest to hardest: 
---
- warrior*
---
* I put warrior last on raids because there's really only 2 or 3 tanks needed, vs ~30 dps
---
Got a new laptop so I can sit on the couch with her and play while she watches the voice.

MAGE WATR PLAZ
---
I know it sounds like a great idea, but a poop sock requires too much attention to accuracy, and if you miss you'll lose all that extra time on cleanup.
---
Real pros stick with a bucket/lid combo. You slide back your chair (or cut a hole in it) and there's the bucket, nice and wide opening so easier aiming, and then just pop a lid on it (or don't, your choice), and you can keep playing during all of it. Sock requires you to take your hands off the keys.
---
Well if going to logical extremes yes, but the whole where do we draw the line fallacy isnt something that reall works. We are talking about the first quest...

I've had two minor issues running it on Windows 10:
---
* The cinematics at the end of missions sometimes cycle through cuts really quickly and I have to go back and rewatch them.  I tend to have better luck with this if I don't switch focus to other windows while the game is running.
---
* Swapping audio outputs (e.g. headphones to speakers) while the game is running tends to lose audio and requires restarting the game.
---
Imagine being a mage. Imagine the biggest complaint you have for your favorite class. Is that other people want to share in your overtuned kit. Imagine being a druid and seeing that complaint lol.
---
Troll for PVE, UD for pvp. Orc if you're 10. Orc racial doesn't scale PVE, UD are better pvp. Stun resist is good, with talents.
---
Never thought about it like that. When I played back in vanilla and was forming groups, it was easy for 5 mans. Tank/Healer &amp; DSP. 
---
When I played my resto shammy, It honestly didn’t matter what they were as long as it was 3 DPS &amp; a tank. When on my hunter main, the only except I make was no other hunters, so I wasn’t fighting for other ranged weapons.
---
For UBRS, I’d just try to get a good group and again as long as 2 healers, 2 tanks and 6 DPS, it was doable. 
---
If was always really up to the lead player who was making the run. 😀
---
No kids, GF lets me play all the games I want while she chills in the same room watching Netflix and shops online. No complaints from her as long as I feed her, give her some attention and maybe buy her an article of clothing once in a while. Which is a welcomed bribe I am willing to pay 10x over.  Maybe it sounds too good to be true but thats been going on for a while, I’m sure classic will be a real stress test on that formula and it might need to be adjusted. Communication is key to getting what you want while being fair to all parties involved, so discuss &amp; negotiate!
---
Monster level, which can be seen in the bottom right of the targeting frame, is a good indication of how tough it is. ?? Level means it is 10 or more levels above you and you should stay far away. Also monsters with silver dragons around the portrait are rare monsters that are really tough but drop special loot. Monsters with a gold dragon are a boss level threat, and usually require a group.
---
There is interest. I was replying to someone who thought the servers would be empty from lack of interest, citing 77k members here as a low number. I was only trying to say that 77k is an abstract number.
---
I am more inclined to believe that, at least initially on launch, we will have overpacked servers and difficulty with quest item/mob availability, than empty servers.
---
I really don’t know what the feeling will be 6 or 12 months post launch.
---
I mean the source used by the op suggests 30 days played lol. I played Vanilla. I played on several pservers. The average back then was probably around 20 days.
---
ill keep dreaming
---
Technically yes but tailoring and blacksmithing I believe each had pre raid bis or bis til aq40 bind on pickup crafted items. So only the crafter has access to them.
---
Depending on what class/spec you go, there are a precious few quest reward items (blues and greens) that are pre-raid BIS to keep an eye out for.  I’m not sure what your definition of spoiler-free is in this context, but there’s some lists/videos of pre-raid BIS for virtually every class/spec out there, so it may be worth a look just to identify them and their associated quest ahead of time.  The Mark of Fordring neckpiece would be an example of this, although probably the most well known of all.
---
That's why I got married.
---
Hunters can literally solo dungeon bosses like Princess from Mara and the last boss of Dire Maul (tribute run).

---
You cannot dual wield. Youll have to learn to use 2hand weap if you want to lvl as enha or use a fast dagger so u can imbue it with fw
---
wow can't leave
---
I’m role playing myself, I don’t expect my character to look good or have any sense of fashion at any point.
---
No... where did I say that? I said playing this game every single day instead of hanging out with her would make her upset and I'd have to pick and choose my days. Meaning some days I'd play, some days I'd do stuff with her. It's a pretty common thing with couples. Some days you hang out, some days you do your own thing..
---
I levelled my shammy as enhancement, it was quick and fun.
---
Just have healing gear in your bags too and you can heal any 5 man leveling up. Would get tougher 48-50 level.
---
Yeah how would immersion guy get those? No one lets guys like that into a raid over and over
---
orc is the best pvp race espcially for rogues because you have bloodfury to open up with. your pvp trinket gets rid of fear and you wont be stunned as much by other rogues/warrs/pallies which can win you the fight
---
Impossible? Haha, thats funny. Countless battlegrounds. Tons of time farming the same dungeon for a specific gear piece. Learning and unlearning professions. A whole lot of time spent at the AH selling random greens and buying minor upgrades. Several hours just wandering around, exploring.   
---
You must realise the majority of players back then did not use guides? They did not know the quests, or the zones. They had no idea what they were doing.   
---
You know one of my closest friends and later gladiator mage.. you know how he started out? He got to level 30 without doing a single quest. He didnt understand quests, so he only killed mobs. Probably didnt know why they suddenly stopped giving him XP. Eventually around level 30 he learned about quests.  
---
That was normal back then. A huge % of the playerbase mindlessly walked around knowing fuck all about what to do. Comparing that to pservers today when everyone knows how to look up a guide, download an addon and probably know every quest by heart? lol
---
Acti Blizz isnt considering it a major release. According them them, 2019 has no major releases. Classic uses the same sub for current players and prob wont attract that many new ones, most who will prob drop a few months in. I can see where they are coming from.
---
Post about classic armour, uses a picture w/ outland armour
---
Either gives more money passed the 10 minute mark or plays better with youtubes algrothem.
---
For 5-15 man tank, then healer, then rouge/mage, then any other dps. If you have a warrior tank he might want to gear towards dps and prefer not having a plate user in group. For raid you pretty much need everything, druids and hunters are probably the least needed class, tanks the least needed roll shamans are really needed sins totems are only group buffs. For pvp it depends on what bg you are running and you are more fulfilling a role then playing a certain class in my experience. This all might be wrong tho I have not played on private servers and things might have changed sins vanilla.
---
You know only 10% of the playerbase even got to level 60 before TBC launched, right?
---
Commiefornia probably
---
Playing with people.
---
lol you talk about orcs looking bad and you pick gnome. wtf. orcs look the best in all gear theyre monsters
---
&gt; 8% rp, 2% rp-pvp
---
According to a [survey] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) done several months ago [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/) it's the reverse.
---
Granted, a survey on r/classicwow ain't exactly hard numbers, but it's the best we have to work with right now.
---
&gt; Maximum concurrent players per server is 2.5k
---
As I understand it, 2.5k server caps is more of an educated guess than anything. It might have been as high as 4k; Blizzard's never given us real numbers either way. None of which takes away from your point, of course.
---
Ultimately, I simply disagree with your (and Ion's) estimation of how popular RPvP will be. I might well be wrong about that. Wouldn't be the first time, won't be the last. I'm not just going to trust Blizzard has the numbers and take it on faith, though, not least because it's never been an option right out the gate.
---
One server at launch gives us such a chance. If it succeeds, we might finally lose the red-headed stepchild status. If it fails, we have hard numbers backing up the niche community claim. Either way, we know the fact of the matter for certain and can finally put this thing to bed.
---
Having the gear I’m wearing mean something to people
---
Basically a warriors life, good luck trying to do a dungeon as fury while leveling up. "Your tank right?"
---
Warrior and mage, followed by rogue and warlock. Don’t @ me
---
1) When I was a kid, my absolute favourite was WoW (maybe you'll find a bias toward WoW for this question given the nature of this subreddit) because my dad was really into it. When he ended his subscription I got into a lot of games, namely Runescape and 4Story (a free WoW knockoff). Then there was Wizard101, which I played with my friend all the time.
---
2) When I was about 9, I used tobplay WoW whenever I could. All day during the summer. During the school year I would play right when I got home. I even played when I was at my grandparents' house. I also played mmo's at my friends' house (not WoW because his parents were cheap).
---
3) They were not comparable. Most were older than me (they did not know that) because not many kids played the game like I did. I was always trying to get my school friends into the game because I was yired of playing with random teens and adults. My dad was the ultimate WoW friend though. Azeroth was OUR world.
---
4) No, I wasn't that kind of kid. I think I was aware that not many girls my age played the game anyway lol.
---
5) As a kid who didn't know what he was doing I had a lot of "mentors" (mainly my dad) who helped me out, gave me stuff, told me where to go and helped me complete hard quests. When I got older, the tables turned and I started enjoying doing that for new players. I would hang around low level zones and see if people needed any help or any items. I wanted people to experience the game like I did.
---
6) I do! I recently stopped playing The Elder Scrolls Online because it's really not like it used to be. It's not much of an mmo anymore. I still play WoW and soon I'll be playing WoW Classic.
---
7) Absolutely! The mentorship I mentioned  in question 5. That's not a thing anyomore, expecially in WoW. Most people in the game now have been playing the game for years. It's actually nearly impossible to distinguish between absolutely new players and players who have just started their twentieth character. It makes it really hard to find fellow newbies to experience the game with. This is true of most mmo's. In Elder Scrolls Online, there's a champion point system that essentially just accelerates your leveling if you have already gotten to maximum level on another character. It puts new players at a huge disadvantage. WoW is HARD for new players. That's why I'm excited for WoW Classic. There's also the community that has changed in mmo's. If you have played mmo's back then and now, you'll know what I mean. People are not as polite anymore.
---
8) I've tried, but most don't exist anymore or have changed. Of course I still play WoW but it's not the same. Runescape has their equivalent to WoW Classic, but I haven't gotten around to playing it. If there is a classic mid-2000s mmo I would love to play it.
---
Just wait till someone breaks in and pees on it while you are just trying to enjoy a nice bath.
---
That's both tbc
---
Poison cleansing and mana spring are bad you heard it here first folks
---
I mean especially when you upload a bunch of pictures of yourself with your cat on twitter, show your face when you stream on twitch etc.
---
Yep. Contrary to popular opinion, vanilla was actually more approachable and newb friendly than retail currently is.
---
I think Classic is going to be bigger than Blizz exoects, but I still wouldn't call it their biggest release since OW. BfA sold over 3 million on the first day.
---
I was in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSSiHh9ShU) one :)
---
Yeah, don't worry I figured the lvl 1 thing. I don't see it as extreme becuase it's going to happen. That will be the reality for quite some time after launch. Maybe mithril ore could take less but devilsaus, grave moss and stv will be hell and it's fine in my mind (including piggies).
---
My point is this shit is complex problem and no one can tell what's the best option without testing different methods like sharding, respawn changes, nothing or mix of everything. I really hope we will see stress tests with different options.
---
Neither are vanilla wow armor. This meme is bad and you should feel bad
---
I wouldn't mind playing some games with my wife but honestly, I'd have to agree. Gaming is something I do to relax and unwind on my own and escape the monotony of every day life. I have a rather stressful job, and after I've come home, made food and spent some time with my wife and son, it's game time. She watches TV and I sit next to her with my laptop. We dont have to be talking all the time, we're both happy to just sit in silence after a long day.
---
Enough of these allready
---
All of these people trying to call out your wife and marriage for no reason...
---
classiс warrior gear looks very cool for the most part even blues, wtf are ppl applying these TBC memes to vanilla...
---
&gt; Spirit also scales with itself the more you have
---
What? 
---
Mana regen is proportional to spirit. What are you talking about?
---
Killing faction leaders would be fun if it weren't for the inevitable dishonorable kills that ensue. Anyone that cares about their ranking won't ever bother participating in a city raid.
---
Kinda like the plethora of quests that have you collect and return a severed head lol?
---
Yeah, the suits over at YouTube offices basically told content producers that they should create videos that are right around 10 minutes long because according to their metrics the ideal length is around that long.
---
Considering Rogan's podcast gets well over 100 million downloads per episode across all platforms, and it regularly runs for 3 hours, it seems like they might be slightly off on that bit.
---
That’s because healing is usually pretty baby status as priest. It’s way more whack a mole than retail is. You just need like 2-3 mp5 pieces and you’re good to go. Maybe steal a KB if you have that one talent to regen mana
---
Thats absolutely not blizzlike.
---
Plus it's a repost.
---
What I'm saying is that out of 100% of the people that voted around ~7% are going to be paladins or shamans. In this version of the video game you can choose a faction that has one of those classes, not the other. 
---
So think about this logically. You have two factions. If the split between those factions is 50/50 (it is very close for math's sake, that's what we're assuming) then you can take half of the number of people who want to play warrior and put them in the red pool, then half of them in the blue pool. Do it again for warlocks, priests, mages, rogues, hunters, druids. But don't do it for Shamans or Paladins. Because those people voted for their factions, the other classes did not. 
---
If 20,000 people voted to go warrior, 10,000 are going horde
---
If 12,000 people voted to go mage, 6,00 are going horde
---
If 7,500 people voted to go shaman, 7,500 are going to be horde
---
Make sense?
---
To be fair, it means deviate fish sell for more as Alliance.
---
knetka like that molchat doma song?
---
Your guild did not run 6 dps warriors and 2 tanks? Forcing a dps to oftank from time to time?
---
is this RP?
---
I know they tried to address this in MOP and limited the number you could do per day. Can’t remember if it was based on valor point cap per day or actual daily quests per day, but obviously didn’t work very well...
---
Glorious
---
Well shamans/druids/pallys/priest dps is utter garbage around 60, not much else to really expect. I look at it like this, I am not going to bring a low dps person wasting my time clearing the dungeon/raid when I can easily pick one of the people who play a dps spec.
---
My girlfriend is my right hand...which i allready cheated on... with my left hand
---
Lmao, this is horseshit.  That's not true.
---
RoC then TFT
---
Oh, I always appreciate advice on my marriage from people who's only exposure to it is a single comment I made in a video game thread.
---
I got a temp ban for using a VPN service with locations in several places, and experimenting with finding the best one for the lowest ping time. So it appeared to Blizzard that multiple people were logging in in different locations.
---
But, if you use a VPN and stick to the same server all the time you should be ok.
---
Okay so i run sub for world PvP. I will start with sap. Follow it with a cheap shot into 2 hemos. Followed by a kidney shot.
---
Unfortunately for most people having a gf/wife that doesn't game or hates it when their man games is actually quite normal. Out of the dozens of bros I've had maybe two or three of them had girlfriends that either didn't mind or gamed with them. The rest were all under the opinion that their man needed to stop playing games and hanging out with their friends. Its honestly quite baffling but eitherway I've made it my mission to only date girls with the same hobbies that I have, gaming/anime/cosplay.
---
Yes, and I went through all of that when I bought the game and started playing in November 2004.
---
It didn't take me anywhere close to 20 days played.
---
You're going to be an hero.
---
Repost... again
---
Cannot upvote this enough times
---
It’s more of a meme spec tbh
---
Underrated post
---
Dude, youre in for such a treat.  Try Classic!
---
I... highly doubt Blizzard will have people scouring Normal and PvP servers looking for isolated pockets of RP in order to determine how popular an interest it may be.
---
Besides which, better an ounce of prevention than a pound of cure. Why wait until Classic launches and try to hunt down scattered prey across the available servers after the fact when we're here right now telling them what we want before that becomes necessary?
---
\^ And other healers
---
Now get the priest some ink.  He's out.
---
Except half of the player base makes you feel that way. :(
---
It did seem like Blizzard was dragging the games direction away from World PvP and towards instanced PvP. Death timers are one of the stupidest things in the game and should be removed for a healthy world PvP experience imo. Who wants to wait 5 minutes to rez after you've died 5 times to the enemy in STV?
---
So many good memes getting removed because mods dont understand em:(
---
1. My favorite MMORPG from age 11-16 was definitely World of Warcraft. I played when it first came out and the only other MMORPG I played before that was called Helbreath. WoW was so fun to me because everything about it was so new. The experiences, the people I met, the replay ability of the game in general all had me glued to my PC for the next 2 years. I think a very important factor of why it was so fun was because I had a lot of real life friends playing with me to share those experiences. LAN parties were huge to us back then and we were pretty much doing it every weekend.
---
2. I played video games pretty much every day when WoW came out. The only thing holding me back was if my parents were sick of me spending too much time on my computer so I would just go outside for a couple hours then come back and start playing again. Now a days I still game but not nearly as much. I think it’s because I can’t find a game that keeps me interested long enough. That and I’m almost 30 and have a full time job. I do expect to play video games a lot more when Classic comes out. Back in the day I would go to Lan centers and play some games there which was a lot of fun. LAN parties at friends house was also a big thing. Now a days I just game in my man cave by myself.
---
3. I guess the main difference would be the things we had in common. Everyone I met online all enjoyed playing WoW and other games in general. All they talked about was WoW and that’s all I was doing at the time so I guess it just felt right.
---
4. No. I never knew anyone that had either.
---
5.  I’m a little confused by this question , but I guess since I had played MMORPGs I felt more confident in my abilities to play other online games. The confidence helps but also learning the terminology behind certain games will sometimes carry over to other games.
---
6. I still play online games today just not as much as I used to. I definitely jump around to different games a lot more then I used to as well. I think, it’s because I can’t find a game that interest me like vanilla wow used to. I played retail wow recently and was only hooked for like a month or so. It just felt super dull. I’ll be playing a lot more video games when classic come out. I’ve hit a road block recently and usually just play some CSGO to pass the time or maybe I’ll hop on Arma 3 for a little bit. 
---
7. The biggest thing I miss about MMORPGs, especially WoW, was the gameplay. WoW, back in the day, used to take time and effort to get to a certain point in the game, and when you did it felt very rewarding. Modern WoW, in my opinion, sincerely lacks this crucial quality. I realize that a lot of people can’t spend that much time playing a video game so Blizzard tries to cater to this group of people. However, by doing that I think the game no longer feels like an MMORPG but rather an action clicking RPG. In modern WoW (Battle for Azeroth) I spent most my time in a city just queuing up for various things. There was an entire map out there I wasn’t seeing because of how easy things had become. I realize I’m using WoW as an example and not all MMORPGs are like this. It’s just an easy example for me to use because of the experience I had playing it.
---
8. I’m not sure if this answer breaks the rules here so I’ll message this one to you.
---
I'm planning to play when I can, I'm not in any rush to get to 60, gonna be playing alts and figuring out my favorite one to get to 60 and just enjoy my time
---
If you want to play a different game yes, If you want to see if you will like classic based on the game now, it wont give you a good idea imo.
---
&gt;Hard to get to, equivalent to Thunderbluff but on the upside literally no one here, I honestly can't remember how long it took to find Tyrande but when we did it was game on…
---
She's not a faction boss.  The ArchDruid is.
---
As a warlock I wont even feel bad about it 😎
---
I don't even get how things work around here. The same exact meme might get posted twice in a day, the first post gets deleted by the mods before people even have time to vote on it - then the repost hits the new queue and I see it on the frontpage an hour later.
---
Selectively deleting people's posts like that makes it seem an awful lot like people are getting sniped out of the new queue by the mods when the same exact content is allowed on the frontpage the very same day, often within the hour.
---
Just my shitty 2 cents on that one.
---
DKs were the worst thing added to Vanilla wow.  I'd love to see a hardcore PvP server with no DKs and no safe zones for lowbies.
---
You have all your healing spells regardless of spec, they’re just less effective because you don’t have any of the healing talents. It’s minor enough not to affect dungeons.
---
I think this assumes a good tank though, and Ive seen some real god aweful tanks
---
It's a cruel trick. She got good food and some wine... who's in charge now?
---
I like the message, play what you like regardless of min max. Sometimes those overlap a bit though, winning feels good. Despite that, I'm decided on leveling as a pyro mage even though it's way worse. It's the difference of whether you want to play as an insane pyromanic sorcerer or you want to play as a lame Jaina ripoff.
---
when classic comes out, you will be playing tbc private servers ?
---
&gt;Things like rng, flying, lfr, theme-parks etc. deserve criticism, but going after raids and dungeons seems pretty random for me. I've never seen meaningful arguments against them. Design of them and challenge they bring is amazing.
---
Iv never seen anyone going after raids and dungeons though, Like literally never, Not even in the comments I was replying too. The reason people find classic harder is the world not the dungeons or raids. 
---
Like I said compare MC bosses to current bosses its no question, I was about to say current wow requires more execution too but looking back at it whilst the tactics are to do X,Y and Z rather than just X you are not punished if you ignore X,Y and Z in live wow outside of mythic+10 dungeons. They have the difficulty level almost where it needs to be, The tactics are hard now its just time they make the tactics do damage. I struggle more in Deadmines than I do in any live dungeon.
---
roof is the wrong color, but still neat!
---
Wand spec as priest first though
---
### An amusing fail by the trollbaiters.
---
The armor, weapon and even tabard in the picture are from TBC. As is every single piece of armor, the axe and the shield the orc below is wearing.
---
YEAH OR FUCKING NO
---
IF SHE DONT PLAY, THERE IS NO LOVE
---
Yep, at low levels your spec doesnt help so much as just having good gear does. Playing druid i leveled as feral but kept a set of healer gear in my bags for dungeons.
---
You probably have no friends
---
Whats fw?
---
My post there wasn't referring to any particular type of server, just pointing out server merges are a valid solution to population woes.
---
Not an ideal one, to be sure, nor popular; just that it's an option no matter how much some may swear it shouldn't be.
---
Sounds fake. Fake story is very fake with all of the fake parts being especially fake.
---
When you post something and it gets instantly deleted, then someone else submits the same thing and it turns out the sub actually loved it. Makes you wonder if it's not about moderating the subreddit but about policing specific people sometimes.
---
Warcraft 3 wasn't isometric jsyk. It was a 3D engine.
---
Orcs look bad when you make them, but with all their gear later they tend to look really freaking dope.
---
ummm, UD female has the Marge Simpson hair.  
---
drops mic
---
We'll see, we'll see. Maybe I should give her food and wine in payments and not before Classic Launches.
---
ahh ty, that's what i thought but wasn't sure. i used to play shaman a fair bit on retail and know they use agility, but based on the descriptions strength seems like it's more valuable here. will keep in mind!
---
Joana's speedrun took 4 1/2 days played and records on private servers are faster. Average power leveling in BFA takes around the same amount of time, ranging from 50 to 150 hours depending on heirlooms and potions.
---
Its windfury weapon my bad xD
---
My druid on a pservers was basically specced like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zjVIo0sZZxgcoxq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zjVIo0sZZxgcoxq)  I found that I rarely ever used wrath so those points are mostly useless, the improved range might be nice in pvp but it doesn't really matter that much otherwise imo.  
---
**Putting points in Omen basically doesn't lose you anything, so if you want to, go for it. #VanillaTalentTreesAreSometimesCool**
---
Though I sometimes melee bosses/trash in MC/ZG, the omen proc rate isn't that high and my weapon speed was too slow (jin'do's hexxer has a 2.4 weapon speed) and in almost none of those situations did mana actually matter, in more intense healing fights it makes more sense to just downrank healing touch more and spam it instead of trying to get auto attacks in.   
---
That said, the reason I liked Omen was because the proc is really good when you are farming herbs and need to kill a mob or two, the proc rate does make a difference, I am not going to wrath a normal lvl 58 mob to death, but putting on some feral gear and going kitty will be good enough, omen gives a nice little bump to the kitty dps. It is also nice when using bear form to tank an elite or something without any rage reducing/generating talents, that extra proc can be the difference in holding agro.
---
Encouraging use of private servers is against our rules. Please don't do that again. This is an official warning.
---
Using "lol" more than once in a sentence, seriously lowers ones credibility.
---
Erm...They are?
---
It hasn't been explicitly confirmed, but they're almost certainly going to shard starting zones on launch.
---
(Source)[https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w]
---
I think what they will do for black lotus/ Devilsaurs will be to ban people who partake in the upcomming mafias who control those spots, which i wouldnt agree with btw
---
Hm, did the Arch Druid have Starfall? Could be misremembering the person, someone had it and I thought it was Tyrande but if not you're saying I got roflstomped by someone who wasn't even their leader? gg.
---
I started in 05 when I was around 8. Played guild wars for a short while before that but my family picked up WoW and i wanted in on the action. Ever since, the original WoW trilogy is my favorite game of all time. 
---
My family was pretty heavy into the nerdy side of things, so we gamed alot. I remember nights with the family playing Crash Bash with a multitap into the PS1. D&amp;D with my dad and brothers. Being the youngin of the bunch though, I mostly watched my brothers play games, and that really didn't change much when I was playing WoW :/
---
The friends I would make in WoW were obviously different from school, because I didn't know anything about the person, and were probably living an *entirely* different life than me. Meanwhile, I did know a few people who played WoW at school, but they got bullied relentlessly for it, so I really only talked about it as little as possible.
---
Nope, No romantic relationships from WoW... but, I am hoping to get my girlfriend hooked when it comes out this Summer.
---
Every MMORPG has a different community. In Guild Wars, it almost felt business transactional in nature. I give you 300g, you run me to the next town, for example. You could swap servers at any moment, so meaningful connections seemed harder to make, outside of guildmates. However, despite the fact that I was probably a little shit, like any kid, old WoW did teach me a lot about being dependable, cooperative, communicative, and even at times it taught me to keep my emotions in check, as a young brat...because if I did have any sort of outburst, I had to apologize to the raid team, who was obviously understanding of me being a kid. Im just glad they let me keep tanking for them! (this was back in BC)
---
I play on a "voldemort" server, one which shall not be named. I'm not going hard in the paint or anything, but I'm enjoying playing some lower level toons at the moment. I'll take a break when the release is a month or two away. Other than that, the only other games I enjoy, period really, are some oldschool platformers, the occasional Forza racing game, and Dark Souls.
---
It's not necessarily 2000s MMOS I miss, but just old WoW. Runescape was what all the kool kids played, but it felt too drab. Guild Wars was too nonsocial and uninviting, as much fun as I had with it. I just miss the old world of WoW, the dungeons and raids it had, and the people i *had* to befriend and cooperate with to make it happen.
---
It's been great revisiting Vanilla WoW. Some say it's just nostalgia, and it might be a little bit of nostalgia... but Vanilla WoW was a game that a bunch of nerds put time and effort into, to create a beautiful roleplaying game with a massive community of other people. Compared to the current game, which is made by a handful of people trying to direct the game solely into a profit based scheme. Before, the profit was 90% in the subscriptions, and now its 90% in the mount/pet store and money tokens (citation needed). Can't wait to go back!

Btw, if it helps for your feature, im 22 now.

'Shabadoo' - From a Simpsons quote. Hunter called 'Twoflower' with a pet named 'Luggage'-From a Pratchett novel. Im gonna try to snag 'Carstein' if I can with an undead on my server.
---
You can draw your names from personal experiences as well, 'Dubldown' comes from an Xcom soldier with a randomly generated name my friend created while we were hanging out. 
---
Sometimes translating words into other languages and fiddling with the letters can work too (latin,greek, gaelic are good)
---
I do, not as often as i like, but i want to try even moreso. We all should. Far too much negativity here.
---
Encouragement and giving information are different, I mearly explained a possible option. If I would have said “you should” that would have been encouraging. But I will keep the actual rule in mind, thank you.
---
&gt;but if sharding is a thing in Classic the game won't last and many players including myself won't even bother with it.
---
Sharding will be a thing, so please, by all means, stay away from classic. One trollbaiter less.
---
Haha yep, lot of EPL as well. Got Sarah's Guide from the Borelgore quest that day.
---
At the moment i took the survey, noone had actually picked hunter on PvE server yet. But hardly anyone picked PvE server at that moment anyways. It just looked funny
---
Weird place to ask. Ask on his public discord if you care.
---
What if they’ll heal but they want to roll on dps gear? What then friend? WHAT THEN?
---
Oh you think that’s fine because you need caster gear anyway, but the warrior doesn’t find it fine! 
---
So the warrior leaves before you can tell him that you’ll kick the pally before you kick him. You try to whisper but you’re already ignored.
---
Now we have to find another tank. The mage says he’s been waiting too long “sorry guys cya.” Then the rogue leaves without saying anything.
---
Now it’s just you and the ret pally. You hate him, and his stupid face. He says “I guess I can only roll on heal gear if that makes it easier.”

We should care about some nobody because...?
---
Anyone who doesn't remember when [this](https://imgur.com/a/zn4HM10) was peak performance is a young person!!
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I would advise weekly installments even during Classic. Neglect the payments and say goodbye to the kitty kat.
---
It’ll work until level 20
---
I'm busting my ass with yard work this spring so that it's all done before Classic launches.
---
What point needed credibility there?
---
I’m in the same boat... except mine is pregnant... in which she can’t consume alcohol and she’s allergic to shell fish...
---
I have a much trickier situation going on in my home.
---
I remember how immensely pleased I was with myself levitating off the top of the lift.
---
What would you use as a Pally in PvP? Full Holy? Full Ret?!
---
Is there a link? Im really interested.
---
Yep bassicly making an OP character to crush at the top end of a leveling bracket. They are a fun outlet for some people I had one at lvl 19 but I Maine’s a healer so it made up for feeling under powered in most of the game.
---
You say if you neglect your wife at night for WoW every night she would get upset.
---
Does she not have hobbies that let you play WoW in the afternoon or late afternoon? You make it sound like your only freetime will be night time, but I don't get how that's the case if she has hobbies and works too.
---
If her hobby time is in the afternoon, why can't yours be in the afternoon?
---
I doubt that many people are best friends with the person they love to be honest.  I think a lot kid themselves because they enjoy the validation, the sex/intimacy and having someone around
---
Imagine going on holiday.  If you go with your girlfriend there's always some argument or whatever because she has stupidly high expectations and inevitably something doesn't meet them.  If you want to do X and she wants to do Y it becomes an issue.  If you want to wander off on your own you have to carefully navigate the situation.
---
If you go with an ordinary best friend you can say whatever you want, you can tell them to bugger off for a day
---
I enjoyed my time with my various exes, but in general I couldn't wait for them to leave so I could do my own thing or hang out with guy friends because it's just so much simpler and easier
---
If i met a girl i could be myself around without her getting upset over stupid things and then bringing me down... Then i might be interested
---
That sounds like some Dennis Reynolds type shit. Like what he'd call himself if he were interested in classic WoW despite having never played WoW ever.
---
Too much squeezing the hog and ricardo flipping. Too hot to handle.
---
Hi, /u/Hezra_
---
nagrand is my favorite world of warcraft (2004) zone
---
Luckily my wife is looking forward too it more than i am.
---
Got banned for spreading ret pally propaganda.
---
At least I can be successful at WoW, not so much with women
---
Alboin King of the Lombards decapitated a rival king, forcibly married his daughter, made her dad's skull into his new favorite drinking cup, and forced his new wife to drink out of it when he got drunk. Needless to say she conspired with a lover to assassinate him and succeeded.
---
He's not the only one to use his enemy's skull as a chalice, but it's my favorite instance of it.
---
No one represents classic. Everyone actually hates the streamers here. That's why they hide, in order to avoid being gank
---
Consider your advice taken. The payments don't bother me too much. There is always Uber eats or doordash.
---
Also I don't have time to play with the kat.. CLASSIC WILL BE UPON US!
---
&gt; For all it's faults it's hard to step back from how Retail makes you feel like a badass with a thundering 14 inch cock right out the gate
---
This is exactly why I couldn't go back when my wife and I tried retail about a year ago before classic was announced. But I'm from the old days of RPGs where you started the game as a piece of tissue paper and ended it as a legendary hero 100 hours later. You gotta earn that cock, plus a lot of the fun of starting a new character is how long you actually spend questing and grinding for your first halfway decent armor set. Making level 1-20 too easy kind of ruins the fun of a lot of the games professions imo
---
Yardwork is never done.  Its an eternal battle against an ever encroaching enemy
---
I found that around the late 30s (RFD, SM), healing got more mana intensive. RFD especially was really tough, the later 4+ mob trash pulls had me burning through my whole mana bar every pull. But the tank might have just been awful or something.
---
But yeah, just stack as much int as you can, bring some mana potions, and you'll be fine.
---
74 followers? Lol where are you getting this info from?
---
Alright, I spent 2 minutes on youtube, checking who that guy was.
---
Verdict: An annoying joke of a streamer, who could, apparently, not even be bothered to get a half-decent camera. Shouldve gotten a real job.
---
Yeah, that one made me believe sharding in 1-10's is 100% a thing but I was wrong. Until there will be a blue post about sharding certainty I don't want to spread the misinformation. That's all.
---
Wow keeps you guys inside all day and out of the public so i dont have to interact with you.
---
twitch statistics
---
They're really obnoxious about private servers around here.  It's kind of ridiculous.  I'm not sure what their deal is with it.  Some sort of elitist self-righteous nonsense, I'm sure.
---
Making hoax in groups. 5 man dungeons are so funny. Farming is the other thing i like.
---
This is the main reason I’m looking forward to classic... classic endgame will be a new experience!
---
Yes I believe so actually
---
Spreading misinformation that ret paladins are even relevant, let alone viable, let alone good.
---
This old guide goes into pretty thorough detail on Shaman leveling, should contain just about everything you need to know:
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZflPukolqhqBTJ3Wsz7aRCYj4H2VE2fYOCoRbfFQUw/edit
---
I don’t mind following the rules, just don’t like when the interpretation of those rules don’t align with the actual rule. If they don’t what the p word should even be said block it in the sub.
---
Which funny enough might be a way to stop windfury bleed crits
---
I thought it was super interesting aspect, since I love to watch AGDQ on Twitch.
---
Big true
---
With that many people you could try to attain r14 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, except nothing compares to windfury totem
---
plenty of people will
---
we still need to get the beta
---
dualboxing is a lot easier in retail than it was in vanilla 
---
i think its only really frowned upon if you play like 20+ characters and pvp which i have no plan on doing .
---
also unlike private servers that would cost $300 us a month or more lol.
---
So yeah ill decide when the beta is out from how easy or hard it will be
---
Isn't that the guy who is really Ron Jeremy?  I bet I know what got him banned  ;-)
---
What is the cap on your data plan?  I think the original Vanilla WoW was like 7GBs?  But we are using the updated game client/engine and possibly the new models.  That will increase the size of the install significantly.
---
Retail I think is above 40GBs.
---
I think he's talking about EsfandTV, many more followers on twich and Twitter, but I did not see any info about him being banned.
---
It'll likely be several gigs. Not as big as AAA modern-graphics games, but know that if your hotspot is limited to say, 10 gigs, you might be in trouble.
---
Reckoning procs don't scale with spell power but Seal of Righteousness does (SoR procs 100% with each swing so You have 5 SoR procs per Reck bomb). Shadow/frost oil and trinket procs also scale with spell power and they have a chance to proc with each reckoning swing. 
---
So, with the right gear, holy reckoning can work very well.
---
I think you may have looked up another dude. His channel was 'esfandtv' and had north of 120k followers.     
---
         
---
Not that that necessarily means anything or changes how we should feel about this, just to clarify.
---
What classes are you thinking of playing?  Double caster?  Melee with a pocket healer?
---
At least you plan to support them for making a good decision to bring back an old version of wow. I am a huge BC fan and I hope if classic is successful we see at least BC, WotlK done in the same manner.
---
It would probably be best if you download from a different connection and play on your hotspot. The worry I'd have for you is your monthly data cap on the hotspot.
---
Read some guides on Totem Quests... They are confusing the first time around. Also some of the paths up the mountains are hide to find. (if you don't do a guide you will get a sense of accomplishment though).....
---
I will be leveling enhance as well but I will be doing it with Intel and Stam/Spr Gear... Agi and Str gear are over rated for hybrids pre level 60. The biggest thing you can get to help your DPS in melee is "item of attack power" even then those are rare... Some of the best quest rewards for melee dps are going to be 2H staffs anyway with caster stats. 
---
I have played every vanilla class 40+ back in 04-06. Shaman was my absolute favorite. I was 60 on that toon and completed MC and ZG. I had fun on the others as well, they are all pretty unique. A farcry from what they are on Retail now.
---
You’re a pleasant human
---
You must have found the wrong channel.  Esfand regularly has 10k viewers
---
My server had a massive alliance of like 13 guilds.
---
This one time a ton of us formed like 20 raid groups and hit Org, TB, and UC all at once, as well as a few raids hitting the Crossroads, Brill, and TM. We called it "EMD" (Everything Must Die.) I think the other groups ended up killing Thrall and Cairne, but my group unfortunately ended up killing the server before we got to Sylvanas.
---
Not even Blizzard could withstand the might of the alliance that day!
---
[Article](https://www.wired.com/2006/12/paa-pwns-dark-i/)
---
I did not see the commercial during the superbowl...
---
Hahahaab
---
You can’t tell me what I know.
---
Hes pretty successful, actually
---
They said even if only one person was playing they’d keep the servers on. I think logically is let classic go through it’s content phases and possibly have a year after final phase. Then they launch fresh servers and announce classic Burning crusades.
---
Sure.
---
Since 2011.
---
Probably warrior or a priest. Cant decide :(
---
&gt; Also I don't have time to play with the kat
---
A 37 second break never hurt anyone...
---
A long time ago my friend.
---
Ive been disappointed and unsubbed for 8 years...
---
We are talking about average players here. The fastest speedrunners will do it in about a week real time, but thats hardly relevant
---
has mommy been mean to you today lol
---
go back to retail child
---
The games still fun. I get not being on board for a long grind but it’s still a lot of fun and you can meet new friends.
---
It's been 6 years. Take me home. I want to be useless to the society again.
---
How is it that people are even asking shit like this?  seriously???
---
Yes. And the updated rare gear, which will be very good at the time.
---
On a shaman it took me roughly 2 weeks 10 hours a day. I was off of work and hadn't played classic in 13 years. I took my time leveling herb and alch while stalling at 39 for pvp rank 3 discount on mount as well as some scarlet monastery farming for mail set.
---
Touche
---
Haven’t been subbed since cataclysm. Tried legion and BFA with the free months that come with the xpac
---
Just start dating her and when it comes out. Make sure she knows how big a deal it is. Then ask her to help you level. If she picks a hunter 50-50 chance in 3 months she's more addicted then you. Thats the trick. Don't pressure them to play. Ask them for help and let wow seduce them on it's own.
---
you can tank perfectly fine as fury while leveling though
---
Orc master race
---
Lol....all of us?
---
dont druids also have a sleep for beasts?
---
The great thing about 5 man dungeons in Classic is that any combo of 5 can do all of them just fine. More important than what classes you bring was that everyone knew what they were doing. They only exception is that you should probably bring a priest to the undead dungeons for CC.
---
Find a GF/BF that also likes WoW.  Problem solved.
---
Also unsubbed shortly after Dragon Soul (and LFR) dropped. Got a free month in MoP, leveled from 85 to 86 and haven't touched retail since.
---
I never played classic WoW and I adored playing on the Nostalrius classic server so yes, do try.
---
I’ve never gotten so much as a slap on the wrist for endlessly ganking with 40 characters 🤷‍♀️
---
In my experience, the difference is minimal. You'll increase your speed by 1/7 while mounted, and it has a longer cast time.
---
nope
---
The Music in alliance Inn
---
I remember them giving out ilvl 373 gear like it was nothing after the raid dropped in cats, and I was like “fuck this”
---
I can't decide between _divorce immediately_ or _marry immediately_, send help.
---
Gimme that Barrens chat fam.
---
Are you only dual boxing for the sake of having 2 60s without having to level twice?
---
Good luck with it all. My wife will flat out say no and I am ok with that. I will find some time.
---
I do not have a catch-all link but just pulled the general consensus from my own and other's experiences from forums. 
---
An outlier I found of the fastest time was done by a guy that's leveling 42 Warriors to cap and his absolute fastest time was 23 hours 17 minutes 20 seconds.
---
Haha
---
I’m not missing anything.  Your comment implies that he’s already in the group, which if it’s the case, I assume he said he would be DPS as any logical player would tell their role, having him in the group and then forcing him to heal or be kicked out is a dickhead move.
---
If he’s not in the group, then your original comment is poorly written, in which case, just don’t invite unless he says he will heal instead.
---
The only thing that isn't allowed with dual boxing is anything automated. I don't dual box myself, I know that there are supplemental programs that make it much easier, and a lot of these will still be allowed. I think I've heard somewhere that it'll be 1 keypress = 1 action.
---
Personally I'd be tempted to do priest + hunter. That gives you 2 ranged DPS, a tank, and a healer; it would be zero downtime grinding/questing. PWS the pet, aimed shot/mind blast the target, drop 2 DoTs, auto shot/wand/pet till dead. Very easy with 2 ranged people you don't need to position.
---
I bounced just about a month after Panda people got involved.
---
Tauren is awesome pre-raid and PvP for War Stomp while the extra health is essentially useless. For horde I'd recommend troll. That 10% attack speed as the fight starts can be excellent for getting extra threat.
---
Also to expand on that, the "right gear" (in the context of a paladin) usually just means some gear with intellect, since as a ret paladin you're probably grabbing gear with stam and strength. Even without a lot of +int gear you can still heal dungeons, but you will probably need extra time to drink after encounters. 
---
Only at level 60 where you start doing more difficult 5mans and raids will you need to actually spec as a healer to be able to keep up.
---
That is a stupid argument.
---
Me! Not played since I quit when Cata came out. 
---
Planning on buying a good gaming laptop and getting back into it! 😀👍
---
That's because nobody had a clue what they were doing back then, where as now every man and their dog logs their raids and is going to notice you far down on the meters.
---
I agree it hardly matters for most encounters unless you're going full min/max but I doubt most people will see it that way.
---
A +25 fishing rod just like that with a single quest. Alliance has to use +5 forever until they do a tiresome grind for a +20.
---
Can't block and dodge from behind iirc
---
We're going home, buddy. We're going home. 😌
---
Also, if the tank seems to be taking too much dmg, ask for any CC you might have in the group. Mages with poly is ofc the best, but anything else works fine aswell. Even a careful fear is excellent. As long as that one CC last as long as it takes to kill a single mob, the dmg reduction is insane on tank. Then hope for a tank that knows how to mark targets \^\^
---
Haven't subbed since like January 2010.
---
I love this idea! Retailban addon
---
its fine under blizz tos it is a little shitty to use that much pay power in pvp though , not to mention i believe they do shit on retail to intentionally lag people and shit which is pretty shitty
---
in pvp as a paladin you want to be either full holy or holy/prot. ret is too easy to kill. reckoning will let you gib someone every now and then but it does not work the same on classic as it does on pservers so it will be less reliably awesome. 
---
dont listen to people who call it a meme spec as if thats a bad thing... if you play it right you will either win every fight or the person trying to kill you will give up and pick on someone else.
---
Hibernate, beast and dragonkin. Thing is, any damage breaks it instantly. Not the case for fear, just a chance for it to break.
---
Was diddling kids probably
---
Blinding powder, crafted from fadeleaf.
---
Since Firelands
---
That is basically the thought.  Back in vanilla I have most classes at 60, but I don't think nostalgia will take me that far this time.  Just trying to be efficient with my time.
---
Chipping in since I’m a 29-year old man with a wife and 4-year old daughter. I am at work basically 6a-5p, typically exercise/dinner until maybe 6 or 7p. After that I play video games whenever I want. My wife loves WoW so we play together while hanging out with our daughter. She has played around on a trial account but she likes Mario and Diablo better. Point is, your little one will likely be into whatever you are and kids shouldn’t get in the way too much. For me it’s work/life/sleep that limits game play. Weekends we can play for many hours if we choose. I’m probably lucky to have a wife that plays. Eventually my daughter may be more into it too.
---
I will grind for gold. No idea about rep grind.
---
If you want make gold at level 45 and above making gold is no problem.
---
I will grind Dustwallow Marsh for lvl 40 mount.
---
With 46 i grind and quest to level 50 in the hinterlands. After this i go unguro to lvl 53 grind. then i will see which zone is cool
---
&gt;or will it suck up all of my data immediatley?
---
​Best we can do is speculate the file size, but without knowing how much data you get we can't even do that.
---
You won't be far down the meters bro. I had this argument MANY times in my raid back in the day. 
---
Besides, any raid leader that pays attention to healing meters when the raid is actually going well is fucking stupid and that's a fact. Healing meters are not the same as Damage Meters, when the raid is geared and people are playing well, EVERY healer is doing less healing.
---
Also, for many of the early fights, the Paladin's main job is to cleanse, not to heal. You can't judge a player for  being down in the healing meters when they are cleansing.
---
Plus, Ret brings Kings. You want Kings, you gotta bring at least one Ret. (at least with the old talent tree)
---
It might vary a bit depending on region and stuff, but the number was between 10% and 20%, yes. Why does that surprise you?
---
Ill bite, but i think while i was leveling i always preferred mana totem any other totem, just for its consistency. Also increases dps in instances
---
Not a bad idea.  Pet won't need much micro when just leveling.  Might try this out on a pserver to get my macros.  Thanks for the idea.
---
I was talking about the 5 million other players too, not just you.
---
Please don’t take this the wrong way anyone as I know we all need to have our own hobbies and space and time to do our own things, etc... (doesn’t apply if your wife also plays). 
---
Why would you want to ignore your wife for a long period of time? I love Classic just like everyone else, but it is just a game. If you’re married and you’re playing this while actively neglecting your family (IMPORTANT: for long periods of time consistently), then there is a problem. 
---
There should be somewhat of a balance, otherwise... why are you married?
---
I played a gnome tank and it was the worst experience ever. You're so freaking tiny you can never see your character. Giant model enemies constantly give you hitbox issues. Also your gear is hard to see.
---
That being said, gnome for life
---
That's raiding.
---
No druid would have more than two sets while levelling. Ferals have tank and dps (mostly the same while levelling), balance have DPS and healing sets (also mostly the same.)
---
The real bag space losers while levelling are Enh Shamans and Ret Paladins, who need two complete sets without any overlap whatever as they cannot fill the tank spot.
---
Okay well, truth be told I've filled the tank spot plenty of times as enhancement shaman while levelling, but that was always as a result of losing a tank for some reason or not finding one in the first place and everyone being like "sure whatever".   
---
It works surprisingly well as you can kite mobs endlessly with Earthbind and Earth Shock etc, but you have *zero* stops to pull once shit goes sideways or there's a demand for damage soaking (bosses hit HARD in classic.)
---
I don't think he was banned recently.    
---
Are you asking because of the video he did for Method and Wowhead yesterday?     
---
Because in that video he just recalls his story again - and part of that is that he was banned in the past for streaming private server footage. Since then he reconciled with Blizzard and was even invited to officially stream from last year’s Blizzcon.
---
Girls are xp waste
---
You must not have kids.
---
If you have young kids and they are awake, then you have no free time. They require attention 100% of the time.
---
&lt;3
---
Love you guys!
---
Same way they did for every new server in retail. Flat spawn rate increases for the first few weeks after the server launches. It was an integral part of Vanilla.
---
Because it's wrong.  I could believe 10-20% of *characters*, but there's no possible way it's 10-20% of *players.*
---
Until you show me a source, you're full of crap.
---
It’s not about it being “hard” its more about doing it proactively. Being smart about when you stance dance, whether it be in PvP or PvE.
---
I’ll see you there, and I’ll keep the heat on for yah
---
I am definitely wary of pulling wife aggro! She can resist Feign Death and sap isn’t an option! Would consider sheeping her but she might be in Trouble living in Scotland!
---
No no, my plan for less wife aggro and stress free leveling is a good gaming laptop, so I can play on the sofa and at least pretend to listen to her stories and pretend to be interested in the tv she puts on. 😂👍
---
Yes no kidding sweet cheeks.  I played the game back then.  It wasn't taking any meaningful amount of the players 20+ days to get to 60.
---
If you believe otherwise, show your work.  If you have no source, then stfu.
---
Lets not question why, lets just be thankful
---
i cant decide till i get my hands on the beta
---
some combination of caster and a healer 
---
if it works the same as retail and there is software to make it super easy i may do like warrior , paladin and 3 casters and just dungeon level quite a bit of it because i really hate questing
---
if it works more  like vanilla melee is out
---
That great man had terrible advice
---
I think the more interesting question would be who *is* subscribed within this sub. I haven't been subscribed for a long, long time, myself.
---
Been unsubscribes since mist of pandaria
---
I've been unsubbed since the beginning of legion.
---
I'm stuck between a Hunter and a Shaman. I would ask you to convince me why I should or should not play which class. I am not going to be doing hardcore raiding, though I wouldn't mind getting in on some pug MC runs. I will definitely be leveling with friends fairly often. What are y'alls opinion?
---
But most of all, remember to have fun! If questing and grinding gets boring, join a BG or look for a group. Dont look at the experience bar too much, wont do you much good (unless youre 5 bars from 40, then grind your fookin ass off).
---
Balance will be how it was in 1.12. They’re not rebalancing bosses.
---
Naaa. The issue with the horde is that the Orcs are overly entitled idiots. Think about them and their cause.
---
Orc: We were fooled by some bad people and because we are just idiots, we destroyed our world and started an unprovoked war in an attempt to take over your world and enslave you. But we lost and therefore you have to share your world with us.
---
Now how in the world, given their back story can you actually justify their activities? Do they have a good justification for us sharing Azeroth with them? Only if we're feeling charitable. They done fucked up and without our charity, will go extinct. Perhaps we might classify them as an endangered species and make a reservation for them. But then we'll need to manage their population to insure that they don't over breed past their available resources. Hmm. Sounds like too much trouble. Let the idiots go extinct. After all, they're not a native species to Azeroth.
---
May your stealth be broken and your Kidney Shots kept short your dirty mohawked monster.
---
Its 2019 and ppl still dont realize others are looking at you for your class. If your class can heal and a group needs a healer, tf do you think they're expecting from you? Alongside this, they're not asking you to respec - they're essentially saying "hey instead of doing shit dps with a 2h because you and your spec are asscheeks, can you use those heals you have in your spellbook anyway to heal us?"
---
There’s nothing meme about reckoning in any form
---
What kind of wrathbabby doesn´t own the original Reign of Chaos?
---
I wish I still had my cds :(
---
You are not alone. It caught many people off guard. Obviously some got the reference instantly. I dont mind. Thats the point where a new journey began and i loved it.
---
Tyrande's technically not the leader of the night elves in Vanilla; that's Fendral Staghelm. He sits up in a tree somewhere. Because of course he does.
---
The others are Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind (Anduin's regent) and King Magni Bronzebeard in Ironforge.
---
That said, I totally consider Tyrande part of the leadership suite.
---
One of my goals in Classic is to take out all the faction leaders, hopefully in one afternoon, even those not tagged as such. It'll likely never happen, but, y'know; gotta' have aspirations.
---
In Stormwind you obviously have Bolvar in the throne room flanking the child king Anduin. On the other side of the little squirt is Lady Katrana Prestor. She's not really a leader, but she *is* a cleverly-disguised Onyxia, which explains your getting reamed by a dragon when one of you unwittingly attacked her.
---
In Ironforge you have King Magni in the throne room and High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque in, appropriately enough, Tinker Town.
---
And last and certainly least, Dranassus is home to Fendral Staghelm, whom nobody likes, and Tyrande Whisperwind in the Temple of Elune, whom everyone looks to as leader even though Staghelm's technically the current Archdruid. Because screw that guy.
---
The Horde side is much simpler. Orgrimmar is the only capitol playing home to two faction leaders: Thrall and Vol'jin. Thunder Bluff only has Cairne and Undercity only has Sylvannas. Also with the back doors into each, as you mentioned.

I will be running hotkeynet for software.  Seems to be still used in retail as well.  But not sure I want to invest in 5 toons.  Would be interesting though.

MoP was a great xpac
---
They're tied together though. Nobody wants to do challenging content for no reward in a MMO, loot is a huge part of the game. Medium difficulty, poor reward content might as well not exist, and that was my experience with normal/heroic raids. Most just do Mythic+, which is not nearly enough to sustain the expansion.
---
I’d be shocked if current subs outnumbered unsubbed here.
---
I already have 0 social skills irl. Socially awkward level 100.
---
 I have a laptop that ill play on while I sit on the couch with her during this 3-4 weeks as well, but she gets annoyed that im not paying attention to the tv show sometimes haha.
---
Yea I agree I liked mop even though a lot of people didn’t
---
Sorry to hear what your going through but i fucking LOL'D
---
Both of those are anecdotal. They're created by users. And that table confirms exactly what I linked in my post. So why are you commenting?
---
You don't effectively lock into any spec at all. You simply take talents from their trees and add it to your class. You are playing a class. Paladins have heals so therefore they can heal regardless of what spec they run.
---
Obviously you need to actually spec into heals if you're trying to push a boundary of some kind and need the extra healing ( like raiding ) but for the most part ret can heal any 5man.
---
You can heal any instance up to about level 50, just by having some healing gear in your bag, even when not specced for healing.
---
Level as DPS and you’ll do it quicker, then you can respec to full healer at 55-60 and instance your way to 60.
---
If I remember right, a tauren warrior was the only toon that could best a good sub rogue in the day.
---
Reminds me of my level 39 twink paladin healer in late classic.  mostly prot specced, all the heal gear and enchants money could buy and shield spike.  Melee would literally kill themselves on me, 2 or 3 at a time while i kept healing myself and my team mates.
---
You and I will stand together against the horde
---
But seriously, the whole flavor of pandas was pretty cool
---
I am considering it, never did it before but I would like to level 2 classes at a time. Saves me time and can make my son a character to play around on.

Hunters can kite elites too. Never had an issue killing or doing elite quests as a hunter.
---
Oohhh nooo but what about the orc culture?! They are non-native-undocumented-migrants is all, you need to bend over and let them just live their lives! Who cares if that means letting them rape and pillage your culture, it's the decent thing to do!
---
nice corpsemaker bruh
---
I mean back in the day you had vent, irc, email and websites to keep in touch. Some people exchanged numbers, or even fb.
---
Now you have things like discord that make keeping in touch wayyyy easier. If those kind of things were available back then it would have been much easier to keep in touch without having to give out personal info.
---
What madman levels a Pala with holy? Even tanks will be in dps spec.
---
Totally get what your saying, but that's the right answer to the wrong question.  The poll was just what are you going to play.  So, there's more Horde Shamans than Horde Mages but there are more Mages than there are Shamans.
---
Wotf is undeniably powerful in pvp. The only comparable race is dwarf with stoneform. Being able to remove dots to allow for a re-stealth, and remove blinds too when no one else can will make 1v1 against rogues tilt in your favor too. Escape artist for gnomes is good, but in my experience you just get rooted again right away. Dwarf is your only option imo.

&gt; Again BLIZZARD HAS CONFIRMED SHARDING FOR LAUNCH, and that sharding WILL BE REMOVED AFTER LAUNCH
---
This is absolutely not true. The only word we have is Ion's answer in Q&amp;A at Blizzcon where he said that they are thinking about using sharding in a time limited way to solve the launch day problems and help server communities long term. We have no confirmation about anything regarding this so far.
---
No where does it state that an Alpha is 14 days.  Alpha testing comes before Beta testing.  That is all.

I was going to start my post... “if this is a joke I’m sorry.”

Apologies, It didn’t seem like a joke to me... since it is then obviously all power to you. I will be playing similar to what you state above. 9-12ish daily when wife/son go to sleep. 
---
Take care dude... enjoy Classic!
---
been there done that, it works. Gonna find more spots.
---
Do you mean play paladin so he has time to watch meme or is the  paladin the meme?
---
Dungeon leveling In classic isn’t really a thing. If you don’t have quests the exp rate is horrific
---
This is one of many minor things we don´t know yet.

---
Quit at the end of legion. Had played since vanilla, was excited to finally be wielding Frostmourne, then they dusted it after killing the main protagonist so I really haven't felt compelled to play since.
---
If you really want to dominate the AH, rush 60, don't worry about it until then. You'll be able to farm anything at that point and give the economy a bit of time to grow. Maybe save everything for a few weeks until the raids start up in earnest, then sell to the raiders. There are also things like shadow resist pots that aren't useful in raiding, but will have a larger demand when PVP ranking starts, so save and sell then.
---
If bouncy boobs is what you want, go undead. Those things flop like a elwynn rabbit.

Hey everyone ! Wasnt shure if i was gonna share this one but here it is. If you can get this spit uncontested you can easily make hundreds of gold. Check it out let me know what you think

Yeah he doesn't. He's lucky to get over 5k. Esfand's alright but he's no Asmongold lol
---
I subscribed last summer for end of legion till 8.1 after having leveled on a private server that died due to fresh server releases. I leveled fresh 1-110 then 110-120 and honestly I felt like modern wow was in worse condition than when I left at the end of WoTLK
---
I fully support the Orcs having their own culture.... On their home world.
---
Oh? It's destroyed?
---
Too fucking bad.
---
obviously dude
---
Played Vanilla, left in TBC, came back in Wrath, and  have subbed/unsubbed every few months since Cata.  BFA has been my longest period of absence.  It really ruined it for me.
---
Lol, yeah I'd never ACTUALLY neglect my family over a game. Spend Less time with them? For a short period of time, sure but never neglect them or my responsibilities =). 
---
You too dude. See ya in Azeroth!
---
yeah but the gear makes questing a lot easier im not talking all the way just like gear them every x levels
---
its mostly for fun too
---
#nochanges , It would change a lot of dynamics and the meta in a lot of scenarios so I highly doubt anyone would agree on a change like that. It would be like if I can bleed a mechanical mob as a warrior. Would add more damage output making it easier
---
On yhe contrary my dear sir, "lol fat chicks" is precisely why we roll them!
---
Overwatch made them over 1 billion in a year.  Classic @ 2 million subs over a year would make them 360 million.  I think 2 million new subs over a full year is a pretty generous number.  Its chump change for a multi-billion dollar company.  I am on the pessimistic side of the number of people who will actually be subbing for the long haul.  I could be very wrong but it seems they agree with me and don't give 2 poopoo about classic.
---
Its a long way but if enough gold is in circulation, all professions in use the economy will grow. same with items, after no need for self use people put it in ah.

well i dont think that software works properly with the vanilla client we need beta to be sure dual boxing will be just as viable as retail.
---
that software makes having a mixed group much easier , so im much more likley to run a mixed group with it and say just 2-3 ranged casters if it does not work
---
What even is a healing set? Switch spirit gear for int?
---
Yeah I'll def sub and stay subbed even if I stop playing much. Very appreciative of them for doing Classic.
---
Same dude same
---
it's an RPG, having a boss literally made entirely of fire immune to fire is a RP element of the game.
---
You want a slower weapon.
---
Nope, you're talking about balancing classes at this point again. Just nope...
---
I unsubbed when they announced the Kung Fu Panda Expac...
---
if you make your character right you can just build a gf. remember, you're stuck with this appearance the entire time, may as well make it good!

Yeah! It’s also super annoying when dps classes won’t play a healer class instead to heal! Geesh the nerve on these guys!

&gt; Resilience ruined pvp by forcing you into arenas.
---
I'm curious about this one, as I think the split between PvE and PvP gear was one of the few good changes TBC made. It never sat well with me that perhaps the most quintessentially PvE activity in the game (raiding) provided gear that allowed one to waltz into a BG and utterly destroy the enemy.
---
What's the argument against resilience/PvP gear in general, if you don't mind my asking? Was it just the fact everyone who wanted to PvP now had to maintain a separate set of gear? Or was there something else of which I'm unaware?
---
I find rts games are just mechanically more intense. You can argue wow or a moba is more difficult in some ways, but they don't require the intense apm that wc3 does.
---
Who is Asmongold?
---
So the difference there would be that you can still damage a mechanical mob, even if it messes up your rotation and lowers your dps. I think the problem to me is that it's so prevalent, almost every boss has fire immunity. It's not one boss, it's almost every single one.
---
I think my wish for wow would be that with spell penetration, a caster could lower a bosses resistance down from immune. Would that be fair?
---
I've never fought the Arch Druid, but people who did mention mass roots as a big issue.   
---
Tyrande should have been the faction leader.  It's always upset me that she wasn't. I loved her in warcraft3 and I didn't give a flying fuck about an archdruid. 
---
On my original server, the horde leaders were getting ROFLstomped by the alliance on regular basis and the horde finally killed her in a 3am raid and then posted on the server forums how bad ass they were.  The server forums mocked them for weeks for that they couldn't even target the correct faction leader and the horde even tried to photoshop a HK Work leader into one of the screen shot.  It was a total shitshow. 
---
Finally they summoned a bunch of people into the basement of the cathedral in SW and took out Bolivar and they got their proper bragging rights.
---
&gt;I'm fearful that if the content is cleared too quickly, if the "classic" bosses are exactly the same as the "vanilla" bosses that it will be a race to the finish -- and then many people will leave as they are bored.
---
Im sure thats what "you think you do, but you dont" means. Blizzard is a big company with loads of money, they know what theyre talking about. But ive wanted classic wow since around 2014, so its great for me. Im happy to play 15$/month for a subscribtion
---
#NoChanges
---
Yeah, you havent been watching.  Asmon gets 20k+ and eafand has been getting 10k the last few weeks.

Been unsubbed since 2016.  Quit after Cata, came back for Legion for two months and quit again.

So yeah... waiting for Classic to resub lol

You have never seen onyxia I take it

Hydraxian Waterlords rep while getting elemental drops
---
I'm wondering what this implies for Classic WoW. Gamescom is held from 21st to 24th of August.
---
IMO flying should have been kept for certain zones only. Have it been kept under 20-25% we might have had very different games.  Certain zones were great for the whole areal dimension, such as Ice Crown or Storm Peaks but most of them became ~~invincible~~ invisible because of it tbh. 
---
I don't get it to be honest. What did flying mounts bring to a place like Nagrand apart from excessive ganking and the elemental spots being zerged non stop? Outland had some good zones such as Zangarmarsh. I was genuinely in awe at the unique ambiance and all the pretty colors that zone had. But then Flying mounts happened and what was left of it? All you'd see was the top of those giant mushrooms... NGL it kinda killed the magic for me. 
---
Flying could have been kept for Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley and it would have been fine.
---
Or maybe it was poorly read. OP obviously implies that it's a full group waiting for a healer, why would they be invited as a dps? OP refers to when you invite a paladin without them clarifying they're retribution before joining. When you have 4 in a group missing a healer, don't you say LF1M healer? Anyway, it's not a dick move to kick the 5th member when you have 4 others who can't heal, and the one with actual healing spells isn't willing to heal. What is the group going to do? Run without heals?
---
Not a lot of problems? Alpha ends quickly.
---
Lot of problems? Alpha takes longer.
---
I hear ya!! I’ll need to occasionally join in the conversation! I work till about 6 and then have dinner and play with the kids for a while (7&amp; 5yrs). So won’t realistically get to play till 8pm-11pm(maybe 12am), so the laptop is the only way to go. Haha 😂
---
This is seriously top o' my list.
---
There's a lot more to said list than that, of course, but, y'know.
---
Priorities.
---
Or quel'thalas lmao
---
They aren't gettin' a dime from me until it drops! I think if their subs spike on release, it will send a message. So, I'm holding out until then.
---
Pretty much no one is going to be leveling as holy/resto/prot unless they have a group they stick with.
---
So yeah. You can heal dungeons as enhancement, and your warrior is probably going to be Arms or Fury.
---
Change that to 30 days and see what ya get.  Cherry picking stats, lmao
---
Tho they share some gear, they are vastly different classes.
---
What's your preffered playstyle? Mellee? Healer? Ranged? Caster?
---
Kiting? Support?
---
I like it.  I also like pets doing elemental damage like they used to.  It would also let them do interesting things with "new content", without power creep, by making them have the same amount of stats, but distributing them to different resistances and damage types.
---
The Emerald Dream could launch with gear not better than Nax, but have nature resists, or nature spell pen or something.  Daggers dropping that do elemental damage procs, or whatever.
---
More interesting would be if the content was all tweaked a bit like that; MC was for getting weapons that did fire type damage, Nax for shadow or cold, Dream for nature, something arcane ( Kara? ) somewhere, and a sort of rock paper scissors thing.
---
Or they could just make WoW2 with Vanilla's world and put it in there...
---
Most of the time I take hybrids over purebred classes, especially as DPS. I've mostly played healers (shaman and Priest) and having a Druid or a Paladin as a backup healer in case something goes wrong and I go OOM is a godsend. I'd gladly take that extra utility over the extra DPS of a Rogue or Arms Warrior.
---
Unsubbed from \~ April, 2011 - Aug, 2016; Dec, 2018-current
---
That's a poor comparison. A better one would be like a mage who refuses to Polymorph when the group needs CC.
---
no i use a name no search engine have entries.and will be fine for wow
---
Lets talk about the REAL issue that players are going to have to face during the launch hype, regardless of what zone they’re in.
---
Sharting.
---
People'll probably have to redo addons for classic.
---
How could they just destroy Azeroth like that? Man that was a sad day when it really sunk in what they did.
---
Well, yeah. But am trying to get the big projects done.
---
What YOU don't understand is that if you have one, you will have the other.
---
the campaign is pretty easy, even on insane.
---
Don't get me wrong, I adore classic. But I look at a class like a Warrior. Something I've leveled a ton of. You're always getting rage, your abilities are impactful, you charge around the battlefield causing carnage.
---
Compared to charging doesn't work in combat, never having enough rage, Heroic strike being an auto attack modifier. You eventually get built up to a stance dancing murder machine, but it's hard to walk back that far and endure a slow slog until you can do cool stuff again. A lot of Vanilla specs have that issue. It's a hard sell to anyone who isn't already super interested in classic.
---
He only topped 10k once last month and that was probably during Twitch con when he was leeching by having more popular streamers on his stream. Also you said he "regularly" gets 10k viewers. Sorry bud
---
I'm not so sure.  High crit% as well as the way Vengeance works make a faster weapon more viable.  With a slower weapon you might have 3 chances to proc vengeance within it's duration, versus a faster weap would have 4.  Thus if you get close to 25% crit you're almost guaranteed to have constant vengeance uptime, whereas if you have the slow weap you'd need 33% crit to have that basically guaranteed 100% uptime. 
---
SoC scales the same based on fast or slow, right?  It hits harder with a slow weap, but will proc more often with a faster one.
---
I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been an alpha. Let me as my wife’s bull
---
For leveling, sustain is way better than burst nad survability
---
Very true. It spawned the best mmo and the entire moba genre. 
---
It's funny how other games can be just as influential but not get the same recognition. For example, Arma 2 and 3 spawned dayz. After playing dayz, I think people realized they didn't care about the zombies and just wanted a huge map to loot and kill people. Thus the battle royal was born.
---
Fair is subjective. This is an mmoRPG. In D&amp;D, fire elementals are immune to fire. It makes sense. This is not retail. I think I'm fairly moderate in regards to the #nochanges crowd. I don't mind graphics updates and that kind of cosmetic thing. I don't mind sharding as long as it's only for a short time and only in starting zones. This is changing the core of Classic. No thanks.
---
He is not representative of the Classic community, nobody is, there is no hierarchy to be had.
---
If you want to fawn over e celebs, you are free to do so, do not bring this on the rest of us.  Its a game we love, the end.
---
Ret4Lyfe.. I believe!
---
*sprints away*
---
Yes, but I think Deylitha was asking about direct profession perks (like +crit if you are a skinner in cataclysm), not BoP items.
---
Even still, spec 21/0/30 if you want to be PVE ret and still be able to be a completely viable healer (at least for 5 mans) in healing gear.  Nothing in the bottom of the prot tree boosts PVE dps except the +hit (can get it from gear) and BOK, but there will almost definitely be other paladins that have bok.
---
This thread has been a wake up call as an ex-hordie planning on rolling an alliance warrior. 
---
Luckily I don't think I'll have to pug much.
---
The only friends I had in wow are the ones I made playing wow (they're not playing either).
---
Just did this on a private server for vanilla... all I can say is UGH. I will be getting the sepulcher and tarren mill flight path on live.
---
I think you are overestimating how many bosses are immune to fire. In Molten Core well over half the bosses can be damaged by fire. Lucifron, magmadar, gehennas, garr, shazrah, sulfuron, Domo. Maybe even golemagg, not sure on him. It's only geddon and ragnaros that are immune. Ony is immune and most of BWL is, but chromaggus and I believe Broodlord are not. 
---
The problem isn't that all the bosses are immune, it's that if even one is the spec is at a severe disadvantage. It would be very hard to argue from a role playing game perspective that Ragnaros should be damaged by fire, so even if it was just him you wouldn't play fire for MC.
---
Nothing?
---
It really seems like we're in minority here but I really agree. I'm in favor of some changes as long as they're true to the spirit of the game.
---
I mean it's very relative. For someone who plays online a lot and knows the builds, definitely. For me however who hasn't played in 10 years or someone who hasn't played wc3 at all, the later missions take a couple tries.
---
Double wrong
---
I unsubbed a month or two into Cata, but came back a few weeks before Legion. So there are some subs here. Though if I hadn't had a 6month sub which takes me close to classic release, I would have unsubbed a little while back when they announced the design changes to the neck piece. They were supposed to redo that whole system, but just added more pointless grind. The current exp is hopeless now to even get near Legion. 
---
Even then when I came back for Legion I found the 4 difficulties, 5man timed content, general loot pinata'nes, and gear randomness pretty poor. But Legion had some winning design choices to off balance it like class halls, mage tower, some good tier mog sets. BFA has no offset of me. I raid 4 hrs a week just to use the sub I already paid for, but it's rather uninspired play. :(
---
Yeah shaman tank can work but you need 5 people in the group.  4 man-group with a shaman tank is gonna take awhile.  Better have plenty of CC!
---
I'm pretty sure monkeys have emotion
---
Meeeee! I’m waiting for 8.2 and classic now.
---
Only 3 or 4 bosses are fire immune, the rest just have high resistance. Good thing you have 2 schools of spells to cast though.
---
Log on the server and check the clock
---
If we're talking about leveling dungeons then I definitely believe the pally should be able to roll on a 2-hander, even if they offered to heal in the first place. Everyone needs dps gear while leveling. Especially if they're ret and offered to heal, and if like the OP says, the group was looking for a healer for ages. If the warrior has a problem with it then I can't really control that, I can only put in my 2 cents and vote that the pally can roll on dps gear. If I'm the warrior, I'm probably fine with it, because it means I would be running the dungeon instead of sitting around (unless maybe I'm ONLY running the dungeon for a 2h drop, which I don't know what weapon I would say that for as Corpsemaker is replaced by WW axe).
---
Ooh, I remember getting Black Ice from the Nexus on my drood, though. That was a very pretty polearm (and as of Wrath weapon skills, not exclusively a hunter wep ;) )
---
Some really useful advise, thank you very much for that.
---
So do that with 10 servers until I find the right one?
---
I played lock in those days. Played until bfa. Always had alts but nothing came close to lock.
---
I think I ninja-edited away the agreement as you were replying.  I like bosses to be immune to things.  It sucked in D2 when you'd run into a triple immune guy, but it was still damn fun.
---
That's not what he asked
---
Back in my day if you wanted to know something about a quest you went to thottbot and read the comments. And the comments were always Hunter weapon memes!!!
---
Flaired this as "Humor" because I generally have an optimistic view about humanity.
---
Must hurt when your own source proves you wrong.  Mive along now.
---
I played a few months of legion after a long break from the game, but I could only stomach 3 weeks or BFA before unsubbing. Just felt like a complete retread of legion with more bad than good added.
---
Yeah, it would be fun, but impossible to happen
---
Lmao, I remember the hunter weapon memes everywhere, EVERYWHERE!
---
It clearly doesn't, but I guess you're too far up Esfand's butthole to see clearly.
---
Trolls for PvE, Orcs for PvP. See I can play the same game.
---
Video isn’t working on my end.
---
I agree in part. It makes sense in universe that some characters be immune to their element, the obvious example being Rag. It just really messes with the end game fantasy for me, and it honestly seems like just bad game design that at least warlock and mages would be completely locked out of specs to participate in so many raid teirs.
---
I unsubbed in TBC when i realized the game had become a skinner box with all the rep grinding.  didn't sub again until legion, played a few months then unsubbed, tried BFA for 2 months, the game feels so empty now...  the rise of "offline" social apps have ruined the mmo experience.
---
For over a year now. I think I resubbed once using a stored up wow token so I could sell one of my battle pets that jumped up in price crazy high. Then I used that money to buy like 5 more wow tokens and then unsubbed again. Played for like 2 days
---
Prot / holy for one reason. Blessing of kings.  People will bring you even if you suck, have bad gear, whatever.  they want that kings.
---
Sometimes I think about checking out how retail is doing but knowing classic is coming has squished that entirely.
---
But Blizzard confirmed that this isn't even a Beta, but an alpha client **for employees.** Sounds like you're absolutely certain that we're gonna get a player-tested beta for the game. What makes you so sure?
---
So you resort to lies and insults?  That's a good way to show you are out of legit arguments.  Thanks for confirming!
---
Really? Someone at blizzard had a sense of humour. Whose idea was it to put a patrolling lvl 35 elite into Duskwood? :D
---
lol exactly. they’re special ret players who go against the grain and are willing to be unique playing the game just as they like and we should all support them for it.
---
You'll be gimped but not by much. And since you'll have more PvP experience than the raiders, you'll be able to beat them most of the time.
---
Of course, it depends on your class.
---
Yes you CAN get better loot doing casual content but it's much less likley. You have a much better chance of getting better loot doing harder content. I used to run M10's and Heroic and that was just dandy for me. I wouldn't have been satisfied with the challenge or the rewards of lower M+ or normal/LFR raiding.
---
Basically the more challenging content you do the faster you'll get better gear.
---
Same here.  I need to pick up two, even though WoW will run on a toaster.  I've been watching the dell outlet for deals, and will probably pick them up a couple weeks before classic launches, or when they have a 30% off coupon - whichever comes first.
---
My GF (who eventually became and is now my wife) is going to be playing along with me.  We both quit in 2011, but will be re-subbing when classic launches.
---
Used to be repulsed by female dwarfs, but they're kind of growing on me. Imagine a female dwarf rogue named BildoScrotums
---
It’ll be out already!!!
---
I have not been subbed for a while, though I did at least try BFA. I will resub when they announce Classic.
---
I killed many T2 and even some T3 people back in my time. And I had only rank 10 pvp gear along with some offpieces from dungeon or trash mobs/reputation from raids.
---
If all you do is PvP, you become more skilled than the raiders at some point. Of course the gear will gimp you but not by much
---
FYI, since Classic isn't out yet, the idea of having posts focused entirely on a Classic content creator is kind of a grey area that we don't really have a lot of experience with. So, I'm not sure exactly what is appropriate to allow or remove (due to being potentially unrelated to Classic), but this post will be left open for discussion albeit with our standard rules (no witch-hunts, don't be a douchebag, etc) intact.

Yeah the only exception I would say is the first time when you're new to the game. I remember lots of people taking 15-20 days /played to reach 60 back in vanilla and for the rest of the game it was much lower.
---
They did add in a bunch of quests over the course of the game so that could be why. The first time around you ran out of quests a bunch of times.

This is how you do it, gentlemen.
---
I'd your looking for the best, troll is because berserking for threat generation. Axe spec on orcs are less important because almost non of the best tanking weapons are axes. The stamina from tauren is only off of your base stamina so it's pretty shit.
---
Lol! Yes, this was suppoed to be taken as a joke. While the conversations my wife and I had are true, I don't plan on neglecting my wife or kid for 3-4 weeks and she knows this. 
---
Its more of me going to play probably every day after my kiddo goes to bed and we've had ample family time instead of 3-4 days a week after my kid goes to bed =).
---
First of all, I'd say no because Classic is largely a preservation project IMO, and we shouldn't be approaching the gameplay with an intent to "fix" or modernise it.
---
Beyond that, I'm more interested in immersion and a world that feels believable and engaging, and would prioritise this over balance considerations. So, from my personal perspective, Ragnaros should 100% be Immune to fire. He's the freaking Elemental Lord of Fire. He is literally Fire incarnate. If anything, Fire damage should actually heal him.
---
Dragons are a bit different - they may be powerful, but they're still made of flesh and blood. I wouldn't have really cared if Dragons just had high Fire resistance instead of immunity back in the day, because the idea of burning a dragon to death does not feel instinctively wrong to me.
---
Also, from a balance/viability perspective, it doesn't really matter if the boss is Immune or has  90% (or even as little as 50%) resistance or whatever. Various character builds are called "non-viable" and refused entry to raids because they only do 70% as much damage as top tier builds. A Fire Mage doing half or 1/3rd damage or so would be weak enough that even with a full 51 talent points in Fire and full +Fire Damage gear, you'd probably still be better off spamming Frostbolt.
---
Not everyone is a pserver/vanilla elitist like you. They are just asking a question. If it doesn't interest you, move along...nothing to see.
---
as long as zero effort memes are consistently removed i’m happy.
---
As a druid in PvP you won't be using cat form all the time (actually you'll probably just pounce with it). Watch some good druid vanilla pvp videos and some rogue ones, and decide wich playstile is better for you.
---
About ease to gear for pvp, I'd say both of them are about equal, having some disadvantages in some areas and advantages in others.
---
They're still fucking hideous.
---
Let's move on.
---
I'm one of those weird people that want to hit 60 pretty quick, so I don't want to get my wife involed right off the bat.   
---
May hit 60 then go back when I can focus purely on her and her character and see if she'd have fun playing.
---
I don't care what anyone says. One of my fondest memories of the game was logging in and creating a Tauren and reading every quest text and doing every single quest in Mulgore. I loved it. I fucking loved it. Never forgetting about the wonderful feeling of seeing the kodos pack walk. 
---
Man...I love WoW
---
&gt;nostalrius had increased exp gains, higher droprates for several quests and more
---
Lower droprate for several quests too. But yes the good ol' "pservers has TBC exp stuff", that was fixed over a year ago.
---
Haven't been subbed since late Cata :D
---
The totem gives less mana than it costs to use at all ranks so the only use is to give mana to the group and that's only if you stay in the location long enough to get the full use. It's slightly useful at BEST, not worth spending time to get pre 60 dungeons.
---
Fairly certain my situation will be opposte as shes a housewife lol
---
I never noticed it til this vid but there is some asshole with a laser pointer in the screen
---
There aren't many private servers that allow dual boxing, though you could stand up your own for this.
---
Keep in mind the macro system will change dramatically from the old vanilla client to the classic client.
---
I watched my BIL play this expansion.  Never had I felt so validated for quitting wow after WotLK as when I watched him do a dungeon with rabbits barfing carrot juice over everything.  That is the moment when the game became a complete joke to me.
---
“When they insist on being dps for a group that needs heals”
---
So AGAIN FOR ANYONE THAT DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH:  if they don’t fill the role you need, don’t invite them, if they’re in the party and don’t want to change After being invited, that makes you the dick.  It’s very black and white, folks.
---
Fire should heal him.
---
&gt;I'm of the camp that thinks a lot of what made classic great was still in Wrath.
---
What do you mean exactly? You mean a lot of liked mechanics from vanilla were still in WotlK? 
---
WotlK was where I quit enjoying the game as much, personally. I remember having fun getting to 80 for the most part, but a little less than in TBC. My biggest complaint was yet another huge continent to take from Azeroths population.
---
For the raids part that's just what I've seen from pugs in world and lfg chat.
---
No changes
---
Mana spring totem gives less mana than it costs to use at any rank, the only use for it is for party mana regen, and at most you will have 2 other casters. Then you have to consider the whole staying at the same place for long enough to get the full duration. Taking the global and whatever regen from 5sec rule it's usually not worth it, and slightly good at best.
---
Posion cleasing totem is not really neccesary at all, you have an ability to remove posions, there's like literally zero fights in any dungeon from 1-60 that requires either group cleansing or spammy cleansing.
---
Having common sense doesn't make you an elitist.
---
Randomly ressing strangers' corpses and them getting up
---
I just remember back when Vanilla launched there was always someone who named their character after the bad guy from FF7
---
Shaman (ele or resto) and warrior
---
Warlock and priest
---
Mage and priest
---
Just my opinion.
---
Mana totem costs more to put down than you gain and you spend a global putting it down. Yes it can help caster heavy groups but it's not worth doing that long ass questchain for.

Left during TBC and never resubbed, every expansion looked like it ruined more and more of the original game while implementing unexciting new things.
---
I'm just here waiting for Blizzard to release something classic related so I can throw my money at them again. Let me preorder a collector's edition, come on Blizz, shut up and take my money
---
Exactly. This meme makes no actual sense.
---
They were designing the game for different people than the people playing MMOs today. Back then the majority of MMO players were still people that wanted to play dungeons and dragons on their computer and things that added flavor and RPG elements to the game were seen more positively than now. If they made the game today they wouldn't do it, as seem by how there are no immune bosses anymore, but today they make the game for people who play WoW and not for people who want DnD on a computer. Not that the new style really helps cause plenty of specs are still borderline useless at any given time, it's just because of numbers instead of RPG elements.
---
Wooosh
---
I'm always surprised at what things sell for on a fresh server. And since WoW Classic will have even more casual players than private servers, you might be able to make decent returns on greens as long as they have the right stats.
---
Some things are even more valuable at the beginning of a server than after a it's been out for awhile. Silver ore comes to mind. People are rushing to 60, but they also want to keep their mining leveled up so they don't miss out on stuff like mithril. Finding silver veins is a huge pain in the ass, but some people seem to be willing to spend exorbitant amounts on silver ore so they can smelt it for the skill ups.
---
Jumped ship right before the panda infestation.
---
Dnd isnt exactly perfect in that way either. If I had to make an explaination for it in universe, I think it would go like this.
---
A fire elemental has skin, just like a human does have skin. Human skin is virtually immune to water and is not damaged by it in part because we are so heavily made of water ourselves. In this same way, shooting a flame thrower at a fire elemental does not harm them any more than a water hose might hurt us, even less so.
---
But a this force has a kinetic power to it. If the fire hose was turned up to a degree, all of a sudden you have source of high kinetic force being aimed at you. The water dosnt hurt you, but the force of the water does.
---
In addition to this, if one were able to penetrate the skin of a human a hose would be much more damaging and it would disrupt the normal flow within the body. For a fire elemental it would be like pushing the fire in a way that it would not want, and away  from the parts that it considers more important. For example, pushing more energy away from Rag's arm, which requires a huge amount of power in order for him to continue to hold his hammer.
---
That was a bit of a tangent, but I'm kind of invested in this.
---
I don't think you actually have to purchase bfa to have a subscription
---
Are the new expansions really that bad? I was hardcore on vanilla and even played casually through wotlk but paid absolutely no attention to anything after it.
---
Healing is a skill though and can seem super overwhelming if you havent done it before. I understand the frustration though
---
Nice try, but no.
---
"Should Blizzard drastically change the game to suit something I want?"   
---
That's what your post reads like.
---
Very high chance that Classic is cancelled.
---
/s
---
As someone who tanked forever I loved having a hybrid dps in my group for those o crap moments. Everyone's diffrent and some people will probably only 5 man as warrior tank, mage,  rogue, rogue and healer 🤣
---
Cyka blyat
---
I love how in Vanilla WoW, you're just a small fish in a massive pond. So much of the world to see and even though most of the world just sits there and looks pretty, there is so much lore behind it. And it's so peaceful to enter a new zone like Silverpine Forest or Westfall and just left alone to indulge in the environment.
---
That was ruined in Cata as Dark Lady Sylvanis rushed you through Silverpine with cutscene after cutscene giving absolutely NO attention to the environment. Playing Vanilla WoW is reminiscent of my teenage years when I had no money and no direction in life - so I had to create my own adventure and appreciated the world around me. It is slow and chillaxed and the progress is what you make of it.
---
The biggest issue with Resilience was that it completely separated PvP and PvE style player bases. I agree that high end raiders shouldn’t be able to just queue PvP and roflstomp, but then make high end PvP gear competitive without introducing Resilience gear. Besides certain stats are simply more desirable for PvP than PvE like extra Stamina, less hit etc. so gear could have been delineated more creatively than by simply inventing a new stat, especially one that made bursting less viable. 
---
If you wanted to do high end raiding and PvP now you needed 2 sets of gear, way more play time etc. so lots of raiders in my guild just stopped doing BGs after raids and focused on Twinks if they wanted PvP, but that’s just my two cents
---
I thought this sub would be a better place than r/wow. People started talking about story in BFA, but I'd like to know what everyone thinks about small story changes throughout the expansions that may or may have sucked. There's many examples of my own in the post
---
Classic will be baked into your sub.  It doesn't matter what expansion you had purchased up to.  If OP wants to go buy Classic, he doesn't need to ask his Mom for a new expansion purchase.  If he has BFA at home, then he has Classic.
---
Dual Mage
---
It's probably an actual/technical Alpha, which means it lasts as long as it needs to.
---
In Development terms, an Alpha is a feature-complete version of the game, but not necessarily with finalised assets and such. Beta means the game is theoretically ready for release (feature complete, content complete, asset complete), but still needs more testing and feedback beforehand, and things still aren't set in stone.
---
I keep buying all the xpac's(exception was WoD, bullet dodged I guess). Every new expansion is great up until the level cap when you jump on the gear escalator and spam the LFG tool. New areas to explore and quests to do, always a treat. The expansion loses it novelty by the second month almost invariably since Cata.
---
Very nice guide! Thanks for sharing
---
The plot thickens
---
While as an American I also give no shits about politics, especially discussing it on WoW, your generalizations are pretty weak. I think it’s immature kids you’re upset at.
---
As long as I don’t have to play with Russians or Brazilians I think I’ll be happy.
---
Or allow him to redirect at your party since he commands it.
---
Probably the most popular duo farm method is DME jump runs.
---
For this you need a melee dps (preferably a fury warrior) and a healer(preferably a shaman or paladin), and you need mining+enchanting and preferably also herbalism. Rogues, priest and druid works fine too but requires a bit more gear to get going. Prebis is more than enough for a strong comp, but for something weak like druid+rogue you wanna wait until mc/bwl geared or get one more dps and split 3-way. 
---
Basically you jump down at the entrance and do the water+satyr boss, you can skip all the trash in DME except the 2 stealthed satyrs(they have good droprate on demonic rune and felcloth anyway). Then you go back and talk with the big ghost tree guy who will open the door to the last boss. Here you can optionally aoe some lashers and herb a bit, in order to get dungeonlocked you need to do faster than 12min runs, so you want to herb/kill enough so that your run takes a bit above 12min normally. Then you get to the last boss and jump down, you can LoS him from other mobs so they don't pull, and then at the end you get rewarded with 2 rich thorium veins. 
---
The gold from this can depend a lot on arcane crystal and large brilliant shard prices but on pservers it's commonly been 50-70gold per hour for each person. Pretty solid method for classes that can't do amazing solo farms.
---
I've never been a fan of "Achievements"
---
Even when the first xbox came out with the concept of Achievements I thought that crap was lame as hell. I mean, you're already playing the game. Why do you need participation trophies.
---
But achievements introduced in Wrath of the Lich King introduced awesome incentives to do certain things like get exalted with a bunch of factions and kill the world leaders. While most achievements are lame as heck, those were pretty badass. :D
---
I've been subbed pretty much constantly since the end of WoD. Was off and on before. Since the Legion pre-patch and on, I've been pretty much in love with the game. Been having a lot of fun. I don't plan on unsubbing any time soon. I'm sad that some people don't enjoy the game as much atm, but I'm still having a lot of fun in Azeroth with all the people that do.
---
They'll be busy leveling characters.  They don't have time to go out and do something useless like be at Gamescom.
---
&gt; Remember shamans are faction specific so you can essentially double the % number. Shamans will be top three most played classes in Vanilla Horde. Probably right behind warrior
---
My dude. This is the comment you originally replied to.
---
I’m in the minority here, but I’ve played every expansion and leveled one character to max on each faction to see the areas, storylines, and dungeons, and then quit again once I get into the end-game grind. 
---
I haven’t raided or participated in PvP since WotLK.
---
Can we all agree back in Classic we called Deadmine's "VC" and nothing else? Thank you.
---
&gt;the idea of burning a dragon to death does not feel instinctively wrong to me.
---
It does to me. If something can hold/produce fire/ice/poison/whatever inside themselves with a naturally occurring organ or whatever and then breathe it out without it damaging them, then some lesser source of the same element shouldn't hurt them at all either. It's part of their natural biology. You would have far less Black dragons building volcano lairs if it could kill them.
---
The game is a mere shadow of it's former self.
---
So short answer: Yes. The current game is unplayable.
---
Hmm I was initially thinking human in case I choose to do some raiding again - I am guilty as a min/maxer.. but I suppose the difference isn't that bad and if I focus on daggers that will help out any loot distribution / boost the pvp anyway.
---
It was a joke, it doesn't have to make 100% logical sense.
---
&gt; Unfortunately for most men having a gf/wife that doesn't game or hates it when their man games is actually quite normal.
---
What? Who said it wasn't? Just because you do a thing your girlfriend have no interest in, does not make you *unwanted*.
---
&gt;  Its honestly quite baffling but eitherway I've made it my mission to only date girls with the same hobbies that I have, *gaming/anime/cosplay.*
---
Well if all you bring to the table is dweeb interest, I'm not surprised.
---
I play games. I also tinker with cars. Go to the gym. Hike with friends. Does not make me unwanted. WoW does not make a person unwanted
---
this is the type of help i am looking for when prepping for vanilla..... bucket and lid.. game changer... the socks usually end up smelling this should help alot
---
Every rank of mana spring gives back 10% of the cost every 2 seconds, so you get the mana cost back in 20 seconds. The totem lasts 2 minutes, so you end up getting 5x the mana cost by the time the totem expires.
---
Lol using absolute statements about all Americans. There are shit for brains in every country.
---
Our education system is pretty flawed but cmon guy, put in a little effort will ya?
---
ugh, the fact that even the Horde thought Tyrande should have been leader should have tipped Blizzard off. I think most of us were working with warcraft3 knowledge and just assumed. I am honestly a bit peeved that my raid got their asses stomped by someone who wasn't even a leader.
---
&gt; It just really messes with the end game fantasy for me
---
This is nearly unwinnable but I wanted to acknowledge your position. Many other folks will say that fire damaging ragnaros specifically, or any fire elemental generically would ruin their fantasy. It doesn't make either of you "wrong", its just perspective, so its not simple to change.
---
&gt; and it honestly seems like just bad game design that at least warlock and mages would be completely locked out of specs to participate in so many raid teirs.
---
I think you are correct here in that it can be viewed as bad game design to invalidate entire specs, and if this was a NEW game, you'd have an argument. That said, this is classic, a preservation\restoration project. Its tough to accept what you say, and change mages (or warlocks), and not make the same argument for all the other specs that are "locked out". Fire mages have roughly the same chances of getting into MC as a prot paladin, arcane mage, balance druid, ret paladin, subtlety rogue, the list goes on. Lots of folks rolled hybrids 15 years ago, because they were sold a fantasy that proved to be unviable. Fast forward the meta 15 years, and those min-maxing thoughts have only intensified. I understand that from *YOUR* position, you view a fire mage as the most intense of these examples (No DPS versus bad\unviable dps), but its a slippery slope.
---
Trying to give you a better answer than #NoChanges and be respectful of your opinion, but your suggested change would have a lot of ripple effects that would infuriate several other players who want their specs made to be (more) viable too.
---
But we have skin and organs, and are not 100% water. Fire elementals do not have skin or organs, and are 100% fire.
---
Btw there is literally zero spell pen items in the game before patch 1.9 so good luck.
---
Mor'Ladim was formerly Morgan Ladimore, a great and noble knight. His objective in life was to fight for the innocent, poor and the afflicted. He was married to a young girl named Lys when he was eighteen.
---
When Morgan was thirty-two, war broke out in Lordaeron. He went to war fighting alongside Uther the Lightbringer, leaving his wife and three children at home. At the time of the war Morgan saw many horrific things, the disbanding of the Knights of the Silver Hand, the death of Uther and the spread of the plague caused by Kel'Thuzad and the demon lord Mal'Ganis.
---
At the end of the war Morgan returned home, only to find that the lands he once loved had changed. His house was among many destroyed, and so he went to Grand Hamlet, now known as Darkshire, asking about his family. When he was told that he may find the absent family he sought in the graveyard, he refused. Instead he headed towards Lakeshire. Despite his denial, something inside him compelled him go to Raven Hill Cemetery instead. There he looked for hours, finding the graves of many friends and companions, before he discovered the overgrown graves of his wife and two of his children; the third was absent, though he did not notice this in his grief.
---
Mourning became loathing as Ladimore, stripped of his sanity by grief, drew his blade and swung it at the gravestones. A group of cemetery attendants moved to intervene, and in his anger, Morgan viciously cut them down. When he returned to a more normal state, the knight found himself soaked in the blood of the innocent and, utterly despondent, he drew his knife from his waist and stabbed himself.
---
The next day, his corpse and those of the attendants were discovered. Perhaps seeking to avoid further darkness in the already-shattered community, the cemetery quickly and quietly buried Morgan in an obscure corner of the cemetery.
---
Some days later, his grave was disturbed and his body missing. As a result of his unending grief and the deaths of Innocents upon his hands, Ladimore ascended from the grave as a semi-sentient member of the undead, roaming the tracts of land he had once fought to defend and shedding the blood of citizens and many a poor and inexperienced adventurer dispatched to stop him.
---
A lot of people just saw “Kung-fu pandas, LOL!” and couldn’t get over it, even though pandarians were part of the lore from long before and Chinese/East Asian themes are awesome!
---
Same here
---
I find a lot of enjoyment in leveling alts, mount farming, etc...so i still am.
---
Probably wont be playing nearly as much for the next few months, though.  Im from WI and the weather is finally getting to be almost acceptable...need to enjoy it for the few months i get.
---
Warriors and rogues want a slower weapon because they have abilities that are effectively additional weapon swings, enhancement shamans want a slower weapon because of stormstrike and for pvp burst damage. 
---
Paladins have no equivalent, to my knowledge, given that the best builds use SoR instead of SoC, which is indeed based off of weapon damage, so you'd want a slow weapon if you used SoC, yes.
---
Faster weapon speed means more chance to crit which gives greater uptime on their 15% damage boost. At least Shadow Oil should not be normalized to weapon speed, and for each proc that works like that, fast weapons get a little bit better, with the exception of HoJ. And even then, a bigger absolute number of HoJ procs means a bigger absolute number of other procs, so there's an argument to be made there. It is also very possible that procs off of SoR hits function like procs from Sinister Strike/Overpower/Stormstrike, which would make fast weapon speed even better.
---
Given that he wants to be a tryhard retadin, he probably doesn't want to pvp because then he'd go prot for reckoning. For PVP you should get as slow a weapon as you can in all cases though, that's true.
---
I would be competely ok with only dealing 70% as much as others honestly. That would seem completely fair, attempting to use fire against the lord of fire for instance shouldnt be about min max, it's more a matter of pride and class identity. Any sane person would reccomend using water against a huge fire elemental rather than trying to shoot fireballs at it. 
---
I wouldnt want it to be particularly effective, or even easy. But I want it to at least be possible.
---
Oh yeah, I need to play Alliance at least one run through on a Paladin so I can understand the whole thing that was going on with Onyxia... And I suppose to actually attempt the real NE leader.
---
I like it.  They could do loads of cool stuff.  See, these are the things I'd like them to do.  Tiny tweaks to things that are fun, cool, interesting, that we don't expect.  Things that are clearly not bugs, but are little interesting twists on the game.
---
It's the same game... but it's not.  I know everyone wants the "same game" as before, but I always liked the idea of little new things to find.
---
I really wish reforged was coming out before Classic.  I played the original back in 2010 or so after i started playing WoW.  It'd be nice to play through it again before i play Classic, but i just dont feel like doing it with old graphics and everything.
---
I would argue that this is a minor change, rather than something drastic.
---
He was streaming retail ironman challenges, the fuck he got banned during that?
---
If they bring it back, moonwalking.  Literally unplayable without moonwalking across Elwynn to Westfall or across the Barrens.
---
Ok, that would be pretty cool to be honest.
---
&gt; Retail I think is above 40GBs.
---
...lol
---
My enitre wow folder is 70GB.  Just the data folder is 66.4.
---
I think 40 was like...Pandaland or WoD.
---
Ya then once u hit 40 respect to get shadowform. Or at least that’s what I was told.
---
I mean, going along with your water hose kinetic velocity power analogy. if you wrapped your fire powers in a metal skin to penetrate these fire elementals... than you'd be shooting bullets and playing a hunter at that point lol
---
And I'd argue that you're wrong.
---
Be social and make friends.  There is no LFG/LFR button and no cross realm grouping.  You may actually earn a reputation.  Make it a good one.
---
Is BoA that bad? I liked Legion.
---
This is where the classic wow community annoys me, when people think stance dancing is hard, i just facepalm.
---
&gt;did very well
---
If by that, you mean it is the top post of all time in /r/wow, then yeah, it did pretty well.
---
What places would they farm to peak? Inside some instance or a particular world area?
---
More like a hobby like gaming is something most women find undesirable and I don't know what the original guy who feels unwanted brings to the table or why he feels that way. Maybe he does other shit too, I'm just making the point that from my experience a lot of women do not like their guys gaming.
---
Is the rich thorium guaranteed?
---
i cant wait to unironically say this like 10x a day.

Where would be the spots?
---
I am
---
This is legit. I was just learning how some classes and do a variation of this solo. Think it's more efficient with the duo?
---
Try running your raid into Suarfang.  People complain about the backdoor to org making raiding Thrall too easy, but anyone trying to ride into Org generally ended up peon shit after Suarfang finishes with them.  I didn't even know who the fucker was that was shredding my raid group on our multiple frontdoor attempts at Org.
---
Of shadow wrath &gt;:|
---
Bro its bad... Everything is faceroll. You don't have to eat or drink almost ever because your natural regen is insane. You get all your end game spells (what they would have been in like wotlk) Like Ms for warriors or felguard for warlocks, you get those at level 10 or so when you unlock talent trees... Talent trees are 1 talent every 15 levels which is cookie cutter asf.  Deadly boss mods is built in, quest helper is right there built in so all you gotta do is look at your mini map... There is no challenge anymore in the game. Towns are empty as fuck because of looking for group and everyone has welfare epics... Theres no social aspect or community within each server. Its just another "shard".
---
Yeah because a wife will never go back on her word.  Actually Jebaited
---
Not great for locks.

You can produce methane inside yourself, but if you fill a room with it you'll die.

That said, dragons breathing fire is a staple of fantasy RPGs, and if they couldn't, they'd just be big lizards that may or may not be able to fly.

On live ive made a couple of female DI Dwarves now, and they actually look pretty awesome.

I made a normal dwarf female the other day, and while i like the model...the new faces just look a bit too child-like i think.
---
The ones you linked actually look quite nice.  My main will still be a male, but maybe ill make a female alt sometime for fun.
---
Some pvp vendor items have spell pen assuming they'll all be sold when those bgs launch and have 1.12 stats. I want to say mage T1 has a small amount of spell pen as well?
---
That’s so weird.. why don’t you just call her your wife?
---
Honestly, I had that comment mixed with
---
&gt;&gt;Since shamans are faction specific, does that mean we’re supposed to double the %? Or is that not how math works? 
---
If we double the percentage, they jump to being the most played class in the game. That can’t possibly be right 
---
So, my bad.  With your comment it does bring faction into the equation. With that other comment that I quoted, yeah, that's really what I was combating.
---
Wrong movie..? But looks similar. What movie is the one in the meme?
---
Oh lol &lt;3
---
You have superior racials and Teldrasil is literally empty always.  Stormwind and Ironforge are easy to double tap with the tram system.  Seems fair to me.
---
&gt;I think you may have looked up another dude.
---
No, I didn't. I looked up exactly tehe dude OP was talkigng about.
---
If OP is not capable of writing the name correctly, that's hardly my fault.
---
Undead Mage. Bald and beautiful. Who needs hair when glowing eyes and a menacing hood sends the message?
---
"Summer"
---
Considering Undead Warlock/Priest. I want a pet class and I dont want the hunters deadzone and melee abilities to dealt with. If I go dual box I will also create alt duos I can switch to when leveling is slowed down due to PvP or cramped quest sites. If they dont get to 60 they can be used for twinking in phase 3 (carried by those to get to 60 when searching for gear).
---
I did some dual boxing in Vanilla with a Rogue/Druid and just used the Numpad on a [DiNivo Media Desktop](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414V9TNJSZL.jpg) keyboard for the secondary computer/character. This method was actually good enough to both tank and heal with a Warrior/Druid in Wrath. Will use HotKeyNet in a similar way in the start and configure HotKeyNet to get better control of the secondary character as I go.
---
Duos i consider: Rouge/Shaman, Paladin/Hunter and Warrior/Druid.
---
Lastly the plan is to use the remaining class, Mage, to play with some friends, as I dont want to slow things down when questing (looting quest objects and speaking to NPCs was always slow when dual boxing, and I sometimes forgot something on the Slave and had to backtrack at times).
---
In addition to HotKeyNet I would recommend InputDirector to use one mouse/keyboard with both computers. You can configure a key to switch between computers or configure the second computer to just act like a second monitor so you can transition between systems by dragging your mouse over a screen edge.
---
That sucks to hear. I don't think I'd have any fun with that, but I have been overcome with joy ever since I heard about vanilla coming back, and i don't even have a PC to play it on at the moment...haha.
---
Did I ever say the droprate was only higher and not lower...? Chill dude, I played on pservers and like them lol, but they are still not 100% accurate.
---
Think it's pretty obvious that the story really started becoming a problem once they ran out of content to pull from wc2/3 and tried to elevate the players into heroes.  Imo that's one of the coolest things looking back is that they didn't try to force you into a role within the story.
---
I think a pyromancer / gun mage sounds pretty badass to be honest.
---
1. He doesn't.
---
2. That's (was) Esfand**TV**. OP write about an account spelled "Esfand".

---
Really just looking for a good group of folks to do PvP, dungeons, and possibly some weekend raiding with.  I'm looking to roll a Holy/Disc priest for max. level, and a 29 twink troll hunter.  
---
I was a long time vanilla player for one of the top raiding guilds, &lt;Bad Moo Rising&gt;, on Eldre'Thalas, and played as recently as Legion.  I'm not looking to hardcore raid, or spend 3 days to farm mats for 2-3 days of raiding.  I'm looking to have fun, and enjoy the game in some pre-made PvP matches to crush some Alliance scum (AV, WSG, AB), and maybe some light raiding.
---
Feel free to PM, and maybe see you guys in the Beta if they introduce one.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
&gt;You can produce methane inside yourself
---
By consuming something that produces it during digestion. We don't have a "methane sac" that allows us to breathe lethal levels of methane from our mouths.
---
What is it that makes classic any more of a pain than retail for multiboxers?
---
yeah, 2 guaranteed every run
---
Not that hard for dungeons regardless of class. You just need to be the pro-active one and form the group.
---
I haven't subbed since wrath.  I'll at least be another statistic that shows blizz exactly how valuable classic is.
---
Cherish those moments.Thats time of our life well spent!!
---
The raid encounters are infinitely better. the social aspect is more or less dead.
---
Spoiler free is basically avoiding guides as much as possible (they kind of steer YOU instead of you steering yourself) while acknowledging that there are SOME things that are necessary to know. Mark of Tyranny is offered alongside other tempting items and is not an obvious choice to an uninformed player but, a few months later, they'd wish they known. 
---
Do you consider Mark of Fordring a vital item for Rogues, Hunters, and possibly DPS warriors? And is it a better pick as quest reward than the other options from that quest? I don't have the knowledge of alternative options so I don't know if it belongs in the OP.
---
Alphas don't have set time frames. Idk who told you that but it is possible they meant if they follow the development methodologies of agile then a sprint is 2 weeks(14 days). The way this works is you set out goals of things you can get done in 14 days and then at the end of the 14 days, you set your next goals/objective. If they complete all of their objectives for the alpha in that 14 days then they would probably look to move to the next phase of development which is beta or release
---
NO TAKE GUINNESS!!
---
Imagine calling someone who started playing and recording/streaming vanilla private servers like a year and a half ago a representative. Lmao
---
Thanks for sticking it out and having a conversation instead of just downvoting and lashing out.  Boy that's refreshing. &lt;3
---
1.  He does.
---
2.  It was obvious to everyone except you who he was talking about.
---
The problem is EVERYONE goes into a few starting zones at level 1, and killing mobs/questing is all there is to do.
---
By the time youre 30 theres more zones (especially when you include people finishing off other zones that are a bit lower level), people will be spending time leveling professions, doing dungeons, maybe farming stuff in some obscure area, and any number of other things.  If things get too bad they might log on an alt, or go make supper and wait.
---
Things just end up spreading out as you level up, and perhaps the biggest reason is due to different amounts of playtime, different priorities (pure grinding xp vs doing professions and other things that slow you down), etc that just naturally spread out the playerbase.
---
That doesnt exist at level 1, especially on launch day.  Everyone logs on, and they all start in one of 6 zones.  Everyone gets the same opening quest that they have to complete.
---
Hope you get a pc up and running to enjoy it! And yea retail wow is quite boring. All we can do now is be patient for classic :)
---
&gt;a main and alt
---
Just 1 alt? :p
---
I don't think gamescom ever had any relevance to classic. It's far too late. They're probably just going to post a release date online one day and that will be that.
---
My older brother never got into WoW, he always played Ragnarok, Counterstrike, Dark Souls etc.
---
At Easter he surprised me by saying “hey so when Classic comes out, will you be playing?” Turns our he is interested in finally checking out the game his little brother fell in love with over a decade ago! I can’t wait!!
---
Why should fire hurt fire? #NoChanges
---
Might be best to visit a library with your PC.
---
I remember boars being the best leveling pet for charge.
---
tbh, this was me. I played Vanilla and BC for two years and never leveled past 45. I played with my buddy from highschool and we would just dick around like kids do, playing in the giant sandbox of Azeroth, griefing other players, finding what was over that hill, hiking to Arathi to do battleground, inefficiently questing.  
---
My goal wasn't to ding, it was to explore, feel adventure, take part in the world. Lots of people will take longer, lots of people will blaze through quickly.
---
There is some spell pen built into the mage talent tree as well. If I remember correctly it was the pvp cloak that has +15 spell pen, but it's a little hard to find more sources.
---
Are there any notable factors of fishing other than location? Like does weather, time of day play a factor?
---
Oh yes I’d have to agree. We shouldn’t  be on the same level as our faction leaders. Ruins the RPG element.
---
I felt that the first 2 expansions tried to sum up things from WC3 though, &amp; that’s probably another reason they were thought highly of. Vashj, KT, Illidonk, Arthas were all there. After that, things probably made sense in the story, but it was a stretch. Deathwing could’ve been done better, Chen Stormstout didn’t need his own continent...
---
Play a rogue if you want to mainly DPS. If you play a Shaman you will mainly heal if brought to raids.
---
Especially as a Warrior. When I reached 60, it was like fulfilling a long time goal. It felt like it took years. However, the game felt as if it was over when you reached 60. Not because it lacked end game content, on the contrary, it's probably the start of some of the most interesting content, but leveling constituted a major part of Vanilla compared to the game nowadays.
---
That weapon has priority for tanks before DPS. It's extremely expensive and time consuming to make.
---
I can produce acid.  How about that?
---
Just imagine having Blessing of Freedom in BGs and I think you'll forget about WOTF quickly
---
But my problem is that what is after tbc? Like I want new content but base around the mechanics of classic it can only go so far.
---
I was just thinking the same thing haha
---
Pull the hard-drive so you can copy and paste some of your games. Or copy your files to an external hard-drive.
---
I don't know much about fishing. But there are definitely some fish that can only be caught at certain times of year. And I'm 90% sure there are a few that are nocturnal as well.
---
Jose was just letting you know man, take it easy 😅
---
I quit after TBC. Came back because friends asked me to do it. I logged in, saw motorcycles and logged out.
---
Casting animations have to be finger guns with gun mouth noises! XD

To the place where we belong?

You’re not alone.

Viable does not = Optimal.
---
Correct Ret/Enhance/Feral are not OPTIMAL.
---
They are indeed viable.  In the right hands with the correct gear/engineering/potions.
---
Stop spreading misinformation that they aren't viable. =P
---
"Yeah the other player should just do me and the other 3 players a favor and play a playstyle they don't like or want to play for me! It's so annoying when people tell me they wont join my group as a healer and make me continue waiting!"
---
I involuntarily shook my head in dismay. Still hard to believe.
---
My understanding is that they are good but not amazing in early tiers (middle-ish of the pack. You can easily beat hybrids and frankenstein builds but may fall behind optimally spec’d rogues, mages, hunters, fury warriors). They scale very well however, so as gear progresses into aq40 and naxx they are capable of being near the top of the meters.
---
Of course, with debuff limit sometimes your place on charts/meters depends on your curse/debuff assignment and slot availability. 
---
Still very desired for all endgame activities due to moderate damage, banish/fear, summons, hearthstones, soulstones, and curses. Summon alone can get you into dungeons easier than most dps classes. 
---
Farming soulstones is a big time and bag space commitment so make sure you’re okay with that. Rotation can be a bit spammy too, which some people don’t like, but that depends on the person.
---
Yes, let's go to Business Insider and find the studies on wow players from 2005. If you're looking for sources on this other than empirical, you just look stupid for asking. Also, please find sources for people who like 29 chocolate chips in their cookies instead of 27.
---
Illidonk, the derp adopted brother?
---
You accrue rested XP anywhere you logout. It only generates at a 1/8th rate if you're outside of an Inn, though. 
---
So if you're only logging for a few hours, it might be more efficient to logout next to your questing area. If you're logging for the night, it's probably best to find an inn or city.
---
I had watched blizzcon over the years just for classic news alone.  I find most in my situation picked up on it right away as well.
---
I always went to petopia and picked the one I liked the look of the best, found where I could get it the earliest, and went there.
---
Any place with an abundance of melee npcs.  Spam arcane explosion until you both get blizzard/nova.
---
That was a great read, thanks. Is that actual canon or did you just write it right now?
---
So, I removed this post, but I'd like to explain why.
---
In general, we remove image/meme posts that only obviously relate to Classic due to the post's title. In this case, I think "LVL 1" and "LVL 59" are pretty ambiguous at best, and certainly aren't Classic-specific (even in the context of taking a long time aka the guy dying/turning into a skeleton). This rule is mentioned in Rule #7 "low-effort" posts.
---
However, I'm 100% sure you'll find examples of stuff that is upvoted highly that also doesn't fit this rule. Truth be told, we're casual scum mods that don't always catch stuff as quickly as we should... so, although it can be annoying for those that *are* caught, if a post gets by us (and isn't flagrantly awful, such as hate-speech), we'll let it stay assuming there is already significant discussion (e.g., a good number of comments) to avoid squelching a bunch of in-progress discussions/commentary.
---
Anyway, that's why your post was removed (the image didn't obviously relate to Classic without the title) and others that you've probably seen at the top of the sub haven't been removed. So, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope this at least is an explanation that is logical to you.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
Polymorph is one skill you press when it's needed and focus otherwise on doing your DPS. Healing is focusing on healing and making sure your tank is fine and doing DPS whenever everything is okay.
---
Yeah, I think they were smart in Vanilla to limit exposure to major characters.  In TBC they kind of went overboard there and brought too many characters into the picture which ruined some of their stories (or made little sense to begin with) - Illidan/KT/Vashj were all odd fits imo.  That set the trend going forward, which seems to be why they ran out of content/re-used so much...
---
funny question. probably 99% of this user sub has been for a while lol, some since wotlk or earlier
---
You wont be competitive, but you can find a raid spot.
---
Lucky you: it's not hard at all! The elemental gear happens to consist almost entirely of things you can obtain while raiding as resto, without having to be that guy who asks for DPS loot that other classes want. A lot of shaman PvE gear is excellent for elemental. I'm going to list endgame gear for the MC/BWL stage.
---
**--Head--**
---
[T2 head](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16947) from Onyxia. This is BiS until AQ40, assuming you don't want to wear cloth in PvP (don't do that except maybe bracers or belt). Pretty easy to get for any raider.
---
**--Neck--**
---
If you really need spell hit, there's [Star of Mystaria,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12103) but you get 3% from talents and that's the PvP cap. While wearing this neck would free up a talent point, there isn't anything terribly important to put it into.
---
MC has [Choker of Enlightenment](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17109) and [Choker of the Fire Lord.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18814) These are very highly contested and you might not get one, so you may have to settle for something like [this](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18289) until the Darkmoon Faire opens. When it does, [Orb of the Darkmoon](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19426) becomes the go-to neck. DMF is added in Phase 3, along with the opening of BWL.
---
**--Shoulders--**
---
Assuming we start with the level 60 version of the blue PvP gear, the [R10 shoulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23260) are really good. I generally recommend getting R10 if you're serious about PvP, because most of the items are at least adequate filler until you get epics.
---
[Deep Earth Spaulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18829) were added in 1.4 so I guess that means Phase 2. They're pretty much BiS for the entirety of vanilla, and since they can drop from four different bosses in MC, they aren't very hard to get. They aren't actually *that* much better than the PvP shoulders, but they are better.
---
**--Cloak--**
---
[Sapphiron Drape](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17078) from Onyxia is probably the best you can expect to get. It's very common so it shouldn't take too long before your guild's core mages and warlocks have it, and then you can start to weasel yourself into the competition. Odds are that you'll wear this forever, and it's fine.
---
Until you can get it, you might have to wear some random blue cloak. There's one from a quest in 1.5, one from DM, and even Sergeant's Cloak isn't the worst thing in the world.
---
**--Chest--**
---
There's nothing amazing here until ZG when you can get [this beauty,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19828) but that's a long way off. Until then, you basically choose between these three:
---
[Wildthorn Mail,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12624) the only real option for meaningful spell power. It's not a great item but the competition in this slot is weak.
---
[R8 PvP chest,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22876) if you're going for the 4-piece bonus. No useful stats on the item itself, the set bonus is alright.
---
[T1 chest](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16841) for the spell crit and high intellect. Probably the best, but it's not a high-impact item.
---
**--Wrists--**
---
There's [T1 wrists](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16840) which are clearly nothing special, but there's not much else at this stage. They have nice intellect, they're mail, and they'll help you reach the 3-piece bonus if you're interested in that.
---
When BGs are added, there's [Dryad's Wrist Bindings](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19595) at exalted. They're your best bet, but it takes a while before they become available. While you should wear mail in all the visible armor locations (because those have high armor), you can wear cloth wrists and be fine.
---
**--Hands--**
---
It's pretty much a toss-up between [R7 PvP gloves](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22867) and [T1 gloves.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16839) They're basically the same, and your choice depends on whether you're trying for one of the set bonuses. Both are easy to get and actually last until AQ40.
---
**--Belt--**
---
Limited choices for mail here. The [T2 belt](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16944) has spell crit on it, and the healing isn't *completely* useless. You can forget about Mana Igniting Cord or anything like that unless you're the guild leader or something. This belt is probably what you'll settle for.
---
When AB eventually opens, there's also [this belt at honored,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20195) but that's a long way off. It's basically as good as the T2 one, though. You can also wear a dungeon item, either [Barrage Girdle](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18721) (patch 1.4) or [Ban'thok Sash.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11662) Both are serviceable, but we shouldn't need the spell hit so...
---
**--Legs--**
---
[T2 legs](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16946) from Ragnaros are BiS for a really long time, certainly until AQ40, and there's no serious upgrade until Naxx. Easy to get and extremely good. Make this a priority, it'll be your best item for ages.
---
[R8 PvP legs](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22887) are also very good, though. They're really not much worse than T2, and you should grind to R8 at the very least just in case you happen to have bad luck with Ragnaros.
---
**--Feet--**
---
[T2 boots](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16949) will be your goal here. The selection in spell power mail boots is very slim throughout vanilla. There's also [these boots](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20629) from the world boss Lethon in patch 1.8, but don't count on ever getting them. World bosses will probably be a shitshow.
---
Now, if it turns out that we're getting the original level 58 version of the blue PvP set (some think both sets will be available), the [R7 boots](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16518) are actually great. The level 60 version is garabage so don't use those. Personally, I don't think the level 58 version will be available at any point.
---
In that case, there's [these from ZG](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20262) in case you just can't get your hands on T2. Not bad, not great. It's an impoverished item slot for mail.
---
**--Rings--**
---
This will be tricky for you. You have some decisions to make. The [WSG honored ring](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19518) isn't available until Phase 3 but will probably be one of your rings for a long time. You shouldn't expect to get any spell power rings from raids, the competition for them will be absurd with every mage and warlock wanting two.
---
Pre-raid there's [Eye of Orgrimmar](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12545) and the near-identical [Maiden's Circle.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13001) They're fine but I really wouldn't wear both. During early vanilla, you'll struggle to maintain high stamina and may in fact opt to wear [this quested ring.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17045) That's right. I consider that ring PvP BiS until Phase 3. It's an extreme amount of raw stats in that slot.
---
Meanwhile, if you can convince your guild to give you an Onyxia head, there's [this beautiful ring](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18403) as one of the quest rewards. This is your realistic BiS for probably all of vanilla. It's hard to get Onyxia's head as a healer because practically everybody in the raid wants it, but since Onyxia's reset time is 5 days, you should eventually get the opportunity if you're a core member of your guild.
---
**--Weapon--**
---
[Lok'amir](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19360) from Nefarian is your goal. This is pretty much the best you'll get in vanilla. Claw of Chromaggus is also good but there's no chance of getting a spell power dagger since mages and warlocks will want it. The mace is used only by shamans, balance druids and shadow priests, so the competition is surprisingly mild.
---
Prior to that, the best PvP weapon is probably [Hand of Ed.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2243) Awful stats, but that proc is just insane and the speed is good for sitting on casters. Once AB eventually comes out, there's the [exalted dagger](http://classicdb.ch/?item=20214) which is also excellent, but that's such a long way down the line.
---
Do not use a two-handed weapon under any circumstances. 
---
**--Shield--**
---
[Malistar's Defender](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17106) from Ragnaros is the best until late vanilla. Not hard to get since only shamans (and paladins) want it. There aren't any shields with spell power unless there's green ones of nature's wrath, and you shouldn't use those. The armor on an epic shield is actually a really big deal.
---
Until you get it, use [this quested shield.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16998) Just nice raw stats for PvP. When AV opens, there's also [the exalted shield](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19321) if you want a bit more armor at the expense of intellect, but I've never bothered to get it. It's just not a caster shield.
---
**--Trinkets--**
---
Here's quite a few options. 
---
The first two you'll be looking at are [Briarwood Reed](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12930) and [Eye of the Beast.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13968) Of these two, I think the Eye is the best, but they're very even. Bear in mind that the shaman PvP trinket is good and you would probably use that almost all the time in PvP, so you might not need to get two DPS trinkets. The Reed is very contested but you don't need to feel too bad if you can't get it.
---
Then there's the two burst trinkets from [MC](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18820) and [ZG.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19950) The latter shouldn't be impossible to get since Hakkar always drops a heart for the quest, but you'll probably have to wait in line behind at least the mages. These are great PvP trinkets, but I'm not sure I would try to rock both. Maybe if you want to make videos with huge crits.
---
Finally, BWL has [Natural Alignment Crystal.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19344) Very easy to get since, well, it's shaman only, and it's quite good. However, the mana toll is rough and the cooldown is prohibitively long, so I wouldn't obsess over it.
---
That's it.
---
In hardcore raiding guild? No
---
In other types? If you're willing to put way more effort and use most consumables and buffs to boost your performance, then yes.
---
My perspective is more based on them still being made of flesh. Sure, the fire-breathing parts are going to be immune to fire, but that doesn't mean the rest of it will be. I'd associate Fire as being more similar to Acid than Toxins. Our Stomach Acid is strong enough to dissolve our own flesh, the only reason we don't get eaten from the inside out is because our stomach lining regenerates fast enough to offset the damage from the acid (gross oversimplification, but the point stands.)
---
As for the volcano lairs and such... yeah, if you want the "Dragons bathing in fire and magma" aesthetic, you do kinda need the immunity there. But even with just some high heat tolerance to resist the passive air temperature in their lair, that's still enough to dissuade predators from threatening them in their sleep or whatever, so the volcano lair still works.
---
The real secret to Vanilla raiding is honestly getting 40 people to consistently show up. If you want to play an odd dmg spec but can back it up with a purposeful rotation and somewhat BiS gear you'll get a spot in any raid. It's only the top guilds with like 45man rosters that really care what your spec is
---
Near everything made from BS at 60 is too expensive to be worth crafting compared to just running into BRD or Scholo or MC and picking up a better piece of gear. 
---
Engineering is the profession you'll be missing, it's one of the few professions that you need to have trained to use its items.
---
Again, in your digestive system. A very weak acid. If you could regurgitate it, it wouldn't instantly liquefy someone like a green dragon's breath. We don't have a acid sac that allows us to breathe lethal doses of acid that can melt stone/metal/flesh with ease.
---
Shadow is fine for PvP, you can do great with middling pvp gear.  But, doing double duty as part time healer in raids and dps elsewhere is hard to say the very least because of the prohibitive respec cost.
---
But yes.
---
This might actually become a future dnd character for me, lol.
---
A pyromancer who almost exclusively uses a gun and tries to convince everyone that he's still a real mage. There could be cool charged up shots were you just pour all your gunpoweder into a musket and control the explosion in such a way that it's a massive blast that hopefully dosnt kill you.
---
Yeah, they also through Archimonde and Kil’Jaeden in there. Major character overload.
---
They could have prolonged the “need” to visit Outland by spacing some of the characters through different expansions, instead of all in one. Like... there’s no reason to visit Outland unless you’re leveling professions!

...there are 6 rules.
---
No one ever has the right to give you an ultimatum, especially if she 'loves' you. Should have left her right on the spot. Doesn't matter what the ultimatum is. That should be a hard no go. You'd be over her since at least 10 years by now.

Balance druid
---
I am talking it easy, you however ran out of arguments, that's why you have to accuse me of getting angry...classic deflection mechanism.
---
I just like calling him that haha. Another example is our good friend Donovan Mitchell, who I call “Donkovan”
---
If your going threw all that trouble, why not just play a warrior?
---
Booo hooo more. YOu lost.
---
Haha. I had some instances like this where I rejoined for about 10 mins and then realised I hated it.
---
Playing hide and seek in orgrimmar with friends and blinking inside the summoning stone for rfc to hide.
---
I tried boxing on a private server, and decided there's zero chance I'd do it on the live server. You think you're saving time but you're really not. Playing in a party that isn't full gives you an XP penalty. It's simply not practical. Much faster to just level them up separately and utilize rested XP bonuses.
---
Yup since one month after bfa launched. I thought they would hustle to get the release date for classic ASAP so they would get their subs back.
---
Am I the only one that is missing 12 skills by 40 just so I can afford it? No complaints here, I love choice.
---
Does anyone take you seriously?
---
Any of the tank class pets would probably be best for leveling. To save on mend pet. 
---

---
On the private server, did you Shift Click loot, because that does partially auto loot for you.
---
The game has become a glorified raid simulation, that's all that matters.
---
But the problem there too is nobody cares about your gear as there are ten trillion difficulties to one raid, with RNG loot (as in, oh my item dropped, and it got extra stats!")
---
Because the challenge is what is interesting. Also the class lore for a lot of people.
---
Esfand did it well before classic was announced and not even banking on it going to be a thing.
---
Ya that was good but an ape with thunder stomp lets you aoe pull better.
---
Just strait up doesnt work ? Hmm maybe its the format im uploading in
---
When we played wow, we weren't married yet and I screwed up the phrasing \*shrug\*.
---
This is true up to a point.  MC can be done by a lot of variety and lack of optimization with 40 people, but AQ changes that, and class optimization matters more.  In Naxx I think you would have a very hard time justifying sub par setups.
---
Night fin can only be caugt at certain times, and there are a few others that I can't think of.

---
Why though? At this point you are talking about negligible damage. All of this for class fantasy or RP?
---
I was dead set on hunter for so much time, and now i'm undecided between prot warrior, holy pala or rogue... kek
---
I'm the wife that's more excited, so no worries here (other than maybe him not seeing ME, though he has classic and FFXIV) but...
---
" She doesn't have a choice, but you have to make them think they're in charge..."
---
Oh you sweet summer child. No one should have to be in charge...unless you say this. Then you've already lost.
---
I wasn't saying I was a dragon.  Do you even understand what toxins are?  There things in nature, actual real things, that can produce toxins that will paralyze, kill, or even liquefy other creatures.  I'm saying in a **fantasy settings**, it isn't a huge stretch of the imagination to have a creature that can breath out gas, poison, or fire.  At the same time, I'm saying just because you *can* produce it, doesn't mean you can live in it.  But it doesn't matter, it's *fantasy*.
---
I have no idea what point you are even trying to argue.
---
For druid healers it's a god send. Takes off half the burden when you know someone can ressurect.
---
Well before? Classic was announced november 2017, esfand started playing private servers in January 2017. People gotta stop dick riding esfand.
---
Will be 2 boxing a priest/warrior, I Just use 2 computers and many macros on the priest, no software.
---
Is it really that hard to see what people enjoy about a game that doesn't revolve around hitting max level in a week and then spamming dungeon finder while sitting in a major city afk after that?
---
Classic WoW will never cheat on you, baby trap you, divorce rape you, be emotionnally abusive (although we could discuss this one)
---
Good post ty boss
---
looks like final fantasy
---
You have 3 standard options: Owl, cat, boar.
---
Boar: Worst of the three in terms of speed and reputation, best out of the three for ease and consistency. It is OK in pvp because it brings a (situational) hard stun with charge, it's great for pulling and positioning because of charge, and it is the tankiest of the three (arguably, see owl). It will also eat just about everything. However, it can't take claw, and has low damage. So it will not focus dump and has slower clear speeds than cat.
---
Cat: Most common. Can take claw/bite with high damage characteristic, making it one of the highest damage pets. They also have the highest attack speed (1.0 with brokentooth, 1.2 with regular cats, 1.4 with early game cats). Attack speed increases fury damage, and is better for pvp/casters because of spell pushback. However they are less tanky.
---
Owl: Some people hype the shit out of owl, I don't see it. They're OK, just a lot more niche than their proponents argue. The upsides are fairly high damage, claw, and screech. Screech is an AoE threat generator, which is admittedly pretty nice. It also debuffs attack power, making the owl effectively pretty tanky while having a positive damage characteristic. However they miss out on the damage of cat, are very picky eaters, and it's a pain to keep screech upgraded IMO. Also, I personally don't find the aoe threat gen *that* useful. It has its moments, but everything does. Flat damage is a little hard to beat.
---
Lastly there's wind serpent and the ZG bat, both of which are more end game pets for PvE/PvP respectively IMO. I haven't tried leveling with a wind serpent, someone let me know if they are actually decent.
---
No flying, slow leveling, no town squatting queues.
---
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
---
Yeah, it's interesting to look back beyond a lore perspective as there is just so much content in the game that became obsolete.  The fact that that much of that involves major lore characters, some of whom also have self-conflicts with more recent content (archimonde/KJ/Illidan) just makes it so much more awkward.
---
That's actually one of the prime reasons why I've never really played a Druid. Everyone's going to hate you when you cant rez after a near-wipe halfway through BRD.
---
I five-boxed for a bit in TBC. I had four slave DK's and a master druid. Was able to handle every dungeon with only a few hiccups.  I distinctly recall trash pulls being a joke, only boss mechanics were troublesome.  
---
In classic, I think I'll five-box eventually, but not for a bit. When I do, It will be 4 ranged slaves and a master tank. Not 100% sure on the classes though.
---
Reminder that it's \*\*free\*\* for retail players to play classic. It's really a great opportunity for Blizzard to keep subs. The content gets swept through in retail, go back to Classic, new content comes out in retail. Rinse &amp; repeat.
---
I see. I guess it makes sense. I was a kid like I’m sure a lot of us were back then. Maybe it’ll be different going through it as an adult lol.
---
I’ve played periodically for a month or 2 since wrath. Played about 4 months in legion actually. I have about 5 friends who haven’t played since wrath that will finally play again in classic.
---
2 guaranteed sometimes up to 4 I believe.
---
Yeah, the last expansions have been pretty good if you treat it like some single player hack&amp;slash game.
---
Soft, real soft. This meme had legs to it! I'll be honest, my post to this subreddit have been silenced. So many other memes getting visibility...
---
What are you on about?  Are you this upset you made a series of dumb comments?
---
It'll be ok, sally
---
3:40. goddamn. You can cut that by half without much work aside from routing and planning.
---
&gt;no interior maps of caves

He says as the minimap shows the map of the cave.
---
Wrong on mana spring. Poison cleansing for pvp.
---
It's obviously not a 1 to 1 comparison, and never claimed to be
---
In leveling dungeons, CC is often a bigger chore than healing, but it helps the group so much that you expect those classes to step up for the group. There's a lot of standing around as a healer in a leveling dungeon where healing is not typically that intense but you still want to conserve your mana for potential adds or to keep the clearing tempo up.
---
The point is, I was challenging the previous comment that seemed to state that dps classes are selfish and expect hybrids to take one for the team, when dps+CC is often as involved or more than healing is in leveling dungeons. And this is coming from a healer and tank player
---
I meant the role not the spec.
---
I love shaman because it's so versatile. You can cast lightning, slow people with totems and shocks, interrupt, heal, hit people with big axes or stab them with daggers and the list goes on. I usually level with dagger and shield, but keep a 2H at hand in case I want to change it up. It's easy to get a raid spot, and you can heal 5mans while leveling.
---
In a group with friends you can take on whatever role is needed, be it dps, healing or even tanking for some encounters.
---
Yeah, kind of. It's about immersion and wanting to have a cool mythos around the character you're playing. It's about getting into the spirit of a pyromancer and not being told that the specialization you're chosen is worthless just as you've hit the pinnacle of your strength.
---
They took the role from the original elitists that would shame people for being casual, and flipped it around somehow lmao
---
It's because the whole point of WoW Classic is to have it as close to original as possible. This boils down to no changes. So while these thought experiments can be "fun," it's as far as they should go.
---
According to this sub, the auction house will be filled with herbs &amp; skins that nobody will buy because everyone is trying to make money for their mounts. Sort of sarcasm.
---
It's the best MMORPG ever made to date and we haven't been able to play it for ~13 years. (pservers don't count)
---
Ok, thanks!
---
It's giving the impression that the admins here has no communication with each other whatsoever.
---
To be fair, it's pretty disingenuous to label them as needing to be spoonfed just because they're asking if certain information is already out there.  There's no point in doing extra work if someone else has already done it.  Work smarter, not harder.
---
Yeah have fun purging that Warrior that's tearing your face apart while being double dispelled from unkillable healers so your team can't peel them off. Oh and no one's gonna dispel the -50% healing mortal strike on you since there's no BoP on your faction.

Easy to learn hard to master
---
tbh, if you add something to it that makes it Classic-relevant (like LVL 1 in Classic" etc it'll be allowed. The general idea is that the image could be posted in say, a Discord, and be relevant without the need for the title.
---
Paladins only need 20 points in the healing tree. The guaranteed crit on a 2min CD isn't necessary with the appropriate gear, unless the raid DPS is so bad that healers are going OOM with consumables. Ergo, a great hybrid paladin build for healing and tanking (even in raids!) is 20/31/0, though you sacrifice a few threat talents that are absolutely necessary when tanking for geared DPS that don't wait for you to build threat.
---
Could tell how you were phrasing it, just a funny way is all hahah. Cheers though! Can’t wait to get back to it!
---
Idk if you read the post I linked, but I had a lot of specific things that bugged me. I was hoping everyone had some fun examples or ideas &amp; theories to just chat about. 
---
It's not the most popular opinion, but it is shared by others that this could become WoW 2. It would be interesting to see Blizzard themselves change up the story &amp; have some honest regrets about what they did in the first place. I'm sure it's extremely difficult to build an intriate story &amp; not run into issues later on you know?
---
Very spot-on. People that are interested in playing hardcore (generally) aren't interested in talking shit to you for being a casual or telling you how to play, they're interested in playing the game with other people who have similar goals.
---
Most of the people who will shit on people for playing sub-optimally in random dungeon groups/patch 1.10 Molten Core pugs are actually just shitters who want to be good for the associated clout, and not people who actually care about the game/community.
---
Modern WoW is a disaster. From what my still-active brother tells me, you can level 1 to max in a matter of an afternoon now.
---
Personally I get bored playing one character all the time, especially since you will usually end up doing the same rotation over and over. Two characters gives you the possibility to use more of your abilities and the synergy of playing two classes adds another level to WoW that I find very appealing. Personally I will take my time with Classic and just enjoy the adventure. I dont mind most of the population outleveling me as that would make questing easier :)
---
Why a laptop?
---
I believe there are diminishing returns in vanilla, however they are considerably less restrictive than what is in live. Also some mobs (specifically bosses) are immune to stuns of course. 
---
If there weren’t any diminishing returns it would depend on the mobs health. If the mob had high health (i.e. could live through the initial cycle of openers and re-openers) you would need about 4 rogues since kidney shot lasts 5 seconds on a 20 second cooldown. If dropping combat after ~5 seconds is possible like in some pvp scenarios you might could get by with only 3 rogues by dropping combat after each kidney and cycling in a cheapshot opener.
---
The sense of possibilities that Vanilla offered. You have to earn what you get and so it feels genuine. Anything you want in the game you can have IF you put in the effort but you get almost nothing if you put in no effort. So, like real life, it feels genuine.
---

I have been unsubbed since a week after BFA.  I tried really hard to like it.  I tried every single class and just couldn't get into it.
---
The last xpac I put any real time or stayed subbed for was Pandaria (PVP was fun but PVE was mindless).
---
Yea but then you're sacrificing the quality of leveling and destroying the experience with the tedious task of multi-boxing.
---
Vanilla was always quality over quantity.
---
And then there's this guy, going 20/31/0 as a healer because Holy Shield is my favorite spell in the game and i'm going to get "casual guild" raid spots just for being the Blessing of Sanctuary guy.
---
BoSanc is really good, doods.
---
Everyone does the group a favor, that's the nature of group content. If the mage doesn't polymorph, if the tank doesn't pull adds off healer, if the warlock keeps casting Curse of Agony on mobs that are dying in 8 seconds, if the rogue dpses the wrong mob and the group has to wait for them to get resurrected, we're not going to get anywhere. The same thing if no one volunteers to heal. It's the willingness to do favors for others that makes Classic the social game that it is. The mentality that you're being taken advantage of by adapting for the group's needs is the sort of thing that is reflected in dungeons in later expansions, where every class has self heals, AoEs, no CCs, everyone just does the thing they want to do and the dungeon goes smoothly; wam bam thank you ma'am.
---
Fair point. It's really about having an older version of the game available permanently. You can go back &amp; play the Zelda games in their original glory any time you want, but there isn't really a vanilla version of WoW anymore. Many people didn't get far, or missed that part of the game completely, &amp; others want to experience it using a different class or faction, some might even want to handicap themselves as a challenge.
---
Some people in this sub are hoping they release the other expansions with Classic aspects in mind, no QoL "improvements." This would allow you to play each expansion at your own pace. You'll essentially never run out of content, especially with the shared subscription as retail.
---
Does that make sense? I agree, it won't feel the same though.
---
Some of the raids in MoP were legit though, if you could do them in a real run instead of raidfinder.
---
Classic is a game that no later WoW expac has been able to recreate and all subsequent MMO's have failed to emulate as well.
---
Classic was really a community based game.  People had reputations on servers.  You made connections in games trying to get people together to do dungeons or join raid guilds.  
---
The world also mattered too.  It was no fast travel, no flying.  If you wanted to be somewhere it was a commitment and you ran through the world to get there.  It really made it feel like a world because you ran into so many other players despite the sheer size of everything.
---
In short it just felt so different even than TBC going forward.
---
They will also eat almost anything.
---
You really only *need* 20-21 points in holy anyway.
---
The Challenge. It is all about the challenge. In the last 10 years, I cannot name a role based mmorpg that was released that I would consider remotely challenging.  As another person mentioned, you can hit max level in most games in about a week.  
---
There is also a huge disconnect from community in all of these games because of their difficulty, or lack there of. In a challenging game, you need to find a group of players to game with or that are decent players, or work well together. Any old group of people cannot just snooze clear all of the content in classic. The game was HARD in comparison to games these days.  
---
To compare: My friends have all been prepping for Classic and we started playing Rift. We have been playing for a week and we are almost max level. You level so fast that you don't have to even pay attention or grind at all. There is not really anything to work towards. Just play and you accidentally level. Gear? Do we need to spend a ton of time to get good gear to really improve the gameplay? Nope. It is all too easy.  
---
Classic WoW, the gear was a real challenge to get, and it made a real difference. There was a sense of reward or accomplishment in it. Everyone had CHANCES at getting items. Not this "Everyone wins" crap that is taking over the world. When you rolled a 98 and some dick rolled a 99 or 100 in Classic Wow, it was hilarious hearing the banter around that. When you got the winning Role, it was exciting.   
---
PvP. Your Skill level played more of a role in pvp then gear in the initial world of PvP. I could outplay someone and KNOW I outplayed them. Most games these days, fights last about .025 seconds. Your face just melts. Everyone wanted bigger numbers, so games complied. They just forgot to make the health pools bigger. In Classic, there was only 1 maybe 2 one shot mechanics, and they were on super long cooldowns. So if you got one shot, you knew the next 3 or 4 fights, you would probably win.  
---
I can go on, but I will leave some room for others to pile on.
---
Although I never really enjoyed leveling I liked the feel of accomplishment Classic gave. Like...... getting item upgrades felt great.... get a purple item felt fucking amazing. And all of this was mostly since the game was 1. new 2. took longer to do shit. 
---
Although the grind can be long and painful sometimes I think games really need that grind to make you feel like you earned stuff. As a society we are all about instant gratification these days and I miss having the feeling of actually earning items and levels, etc. 
---
Like.... Diablo 3 was pretty shit upon release and I think the new version of the game is better. But every year Blizz buffs items and sets in game and makes it easier. The game already easy as fuck and I wish they would take it back to a time where everything wasn't just given. Its so easy to gear up and hit max content (granted there are technically infinite difficulties) within like.... a day of season start just feels terrible in my opinion. Same with classic WoW.... I tried playing new expansion and I got to level 112 and just quit. There was some story supposed to be going on but.... idk... I didn't give a shit about it. Doing random dungeons with people while my amulet leveled idk I just really hate the new feel WoW has. It feels like a lazier version of the same game that's been out for over a decade.
---
Epics will be EPIC agaun. You have to EARN what you get and not just run the same dungeon 50 times, turn in 50 tokens or something and be garunteed an epic.
---
They've just churned through too many characters at this point. Practically every named character, regardless of importance, from WC1-WC3 has been re-introduced and killed. Plus, it's just always weird to have a regular human/elf/etc character as a raid boss - they have to make them way more powerful than they ever seemed in the lore, not to mention 12 feet tall for raid visibility.
---
Right, at the same time, there's no point in just being a dick because people want to let their imaginations run wild with things they think are fun.  He's not actively lobbying to get it changed.  He's just making interesting conversation.
---
I'm tempted to play a hunter just to get a crab or something stupid
---
amen
---
Many people here will tell you that the game is shit. Which isnt true. It definitely has flaws - so did Vanilla. The real problem for many here is that the game no longer is a classical RPG played in a closed community but an action focused RPG with match making services. Stuff like travelling or leveling is triviliazed to a point where people complain that you need like 3 days played to reach max level, or need to fly 5 minutes to get to the edge of a continent that is from 3 expansions ago. The game is all about end content now, everything else is basically an annoyance to many.   
---
You can like that. But chances are someone that played Vanilla and loved it would rather be disenchanted. For people that only really care about doing high end content its miles better than vanilla.
---
Each zone having it's own community of players.
---
Some guy told a story that he found clam meat off a giraffe in the Barrens and the entire zone went on a giraffe murdering spree to see it for themselves.
---
Stuff like that doesn't happen in retail.
---
West Virg... I mean World of Warcraft!!
---
"Hey, i know you're a rogue, but we kinda need a healer. Can you go level a priest up real quick so we can do this 5 man?"
---
This is great, def gonna our this to use when I start to burnout in my 40s.
---
I still remember it in wrath. It was there. But they didn’t really run away, but I think that’s when we got multiple pet slots(?) so idk. Coulda been any expansion. Just I remember it as cata or panda(?)/wod getting rid of it, cause I stopped playing at cata, and started playing at end of panda onto wod.
---
He’s banned but I’m pretty sure still subbed
---
technically turning in tokens for an epic is still considered earned..
---
I mean, I think these characters need to resurface eventually (if they aren't already dead, I HATE resurrections...), but having several in one expansion is too much. 
---
How would you have introduced the raid bosses from TBC? This is the juicy stuff I like to hear.
---
And every warrior/druid/Pally Should carry a tanking set. But how many do?
---
Yeah, and then you can have god-tier farming capability too and even tank 5 mans =P
---
You could take it another level and get improved devo aura as well, though that can make it tougher to be an honest-to-goodness tank while also having enough raid PVE utility to be a useful healer
---
Throughout my tenure I mostly OT'd in raids and I did DK in Wrath. I absolutely love tanking but I'm not willing to put in the time commitment required, especially when I have irl friends who are interested in rolling Warrior. I love the idea of kiting and juggling required with the hunter, but on the other hand the Shaman is one of the most unique classes. I've never really played either, so that's part of why I'm interested in these two. I will be leveling + dungeons + mayybbbe minor raiding if I'm not burnt out.
---
Played around with Priest War last night on a private server. It feels really good up until about level 10 when I found it a bit difficult to not die / deal with more than 3 mobs at a time. Basically war can't hold threat while the Priest is DPsing so you either just healbot and only dmg with the war, or you slow down.
---
Used HotKeyNet and a simple setup took like 2 minutes. Most of my time is spent creating all the necessary /assist macros on the priest. A lot of the macros you find online do not work with 1.12 so you end up troubleshooting / simplifying a lot of them which is a pain.
---
I really want to play war end game, but the idea of solo leveling a war through vanilla sounds absolutely awful ( First time I leveled to 30 and gave up and rerolled lol).
---
I'm sure dual boxing 2 ranged would be much easier.
---
I'm kind of torn between just regular leveling a mage, or going all out with the priest war dual box on launch. Has anyone done priest war dual, and if so, do you recommend it?
---
I only wish I could write that well.

I don't think DR affected NPCs, because you could sheep indefinitely.

Either that or sheep wasn't on the mob DR and stun was.

Nearly May and no release date tho 🤔

Try signing out and signing back in, i dont know why this happens but every time i upload some people seem to have problems viewing my videos. Not shure if its on my end, reddit, or youtube hmm
---
Boy I have been unsubbed since Wrath.
---
I'm leveling as prot/holy, I'm going to be reeeaaaally popular with warriors.
---
Yeah i skimmed it, IMO given the recent trend of storytelling I don't trust them to right any of the previous wrongs.  If anything I just hope WoW 2 (whatever shape that takes) stops the whole single-player story aspect and progresses story at a far slower pace (more politics less fighting)
---
So you're telling me that in current retail that healers just level as healing the whole way instead of dps spec to level then switch to healing after?  Are retail players really that stupid?  I can't wait to gank and grief them then.  This question is a complete waste and the OP username says it all.
---
Dar'tols rod of transformation
---
Exactly.
---
I’m more of a Warcraft fan than a WoW fan, so the lore, characters, and areas are the main draw for me. The competitive/loot machine side of the game has never really appealed to me that much.
---
Most efficient and best buffs. Not best healer.
---
Leveling is a part of the game instead of an extremely long intro to the actual game.
---
There's a continuous world, instead of fractured and forgotten continents that don't matter.
---
Dungeons are actually difficult, and you need to find your own group, meaning people have to be *social* for once in an MMO
---
Classes aren't just re-skinned versions of each other, and are defined by their limitations and unique abilities; which creates an interesting meta while your character feels like it brings something unique to the table
---
Well structured and continuous story where you are just one of many instead of some great hero that has saved the world 100 times (yet people still want you to go get their cat out of a fucking tree)
---
No grinding daily quests/dungeons, you do everything on your own time.
---
No flying mounts, so people actually have to risk ganks and interactions with the world instead of flying over all of it.
---
40 man epic raids
---
Do I need to continue?
---
I've done it before and with the right addons for key management, as well as the right class combinations, it's actually a breeze. Sure, it will take longer then leveling a single character, but in the end, you will be much more efficient. For some people, the leveling experience is nothing new or a great fun factor. I plan on multiboxing 2 chars at launch and will continue to level up all classes to level 35 for crafting cd's once I find the time in between raiding.
---
Actually I am now happy that I don´t have a gf. Will be less depressed when classic launches. Hope soon^(tm) .
---
It was RFD, almost all the mobs at the end are undead, can't poly those.
---
The same reason anyone likes older games - they find them fun and often better than modern counterparts.
---
I leveled from 26-50 with a wind serpent it was great for mobs that run, but keeping it's skills upgraded was a massive pain in the ass.
---
However once I got an optimized cat at 51 I never went back until raiding.
---
Literally the only challenge left int he game is mythic raiding, where wow needs to almost be your actual job to clear.
---
Because Vanilla really was the peak of the first generation of MMOs before TBC and it's contemporaries took the genre in a very different direction.
---
Community matters, because it takes a long time to reach 60, you're pretty much stuck with the cohort you're leveling with, so you all need to learn to get along and help each other out.
---
Playing together is rewarded. Classes are limited, so you get a huge benefit out of joining up. Also, while almost all content is soloable, it is risky and slow. The mechanics of the game encourage you to group up.
---
Progress is slow and meaningful. When you get a new piece of gear, it may last you for months.
---
Far less top down structure. It's not about the epic narrative of the world, there's no big bad. No Illidan or Lich King or Deathwing. You're just some random adventurer out in the world where stuff is happening, you're not the freaking all powerful hero of the Horde along with everybody else you see.
---
More room for emergent game play. The world is just more full of random items with random skills that you can mix and match because it was early in its lifecycle and the devs just tossed in whatever came to mind without worrying about balance or boring things like that.

World consistency makes the whole thing far more immersive. There's LFD menu that just makes you and 4 other random assholes appear at the start of an instance. You head into town, seek out 4 fellow adventurers, then you travel to the far reaches of Azeroth in search of loot. There's no drop down menu that determines if this version of Onyxia is easy, hard, or super hard. Onyxia is Onyxia, the world is consistent. Naxx is Naxx, you're either capable of doing it, or you're not hardcore and you come to grips with your limitations.
---
So there's a few reasons why I'm hyped.
---
@EsfandTV, are you going to go STR+crit ret build or spellpower build now that some spellpower gear will be in the game due to Blizzard's itemization scheme?
---
Great point!
---
Bfa is pretty much a really watered down Legion.
---
Same could be made with shadows
---
Eh... we’ve got a pretty good idea considering we know what dungeons are coming out when and what items drop with them. We also know when they are going to add the catch up gear, so we can account for that also. I’d make one, but I don’t know how to use spread sheets well enough to do it.
---
I tend to re-sub for each expansion. WoD and Legion kept me hooked, but BFA isn't for me. Such a shame too because the art team did such an amazing job.
---
Of all the expansions, BFA kept me the shortest. I think I lasted around a month.
---
It won't be economically advantageous in the same way it is on retail (a driving force behind a lot of the activity is multi-loot herbs and mobs), but still could happen, probably for some pvp goofiness.
---
I usually come back like every 2 years and play for like 2-4 weeks then unsub again for like 2 years lol. I did buy new expansion since I was so excited about WoW classic lol. I played only a few hours and they give you a free boost (since didnt play last expansion) so was 110 then got like 2 levels with a couple hours or w/e. Quit.... its like.... 2 quests with some stupid story I give 0 fucks about. With like 4 abilities yata yata yata some stupid amulet bullshit. Idk.... not the game I miss playing at all.
---
It’s all good, shit happens.. what’s the written gist of the video? Some farming spot in winter spring is guessing that has a good vendor with rare recipe/formula?
---
How is it trying to DPS as a Shaman in 5-mans? I was Alliance scum and never had the honor of seeing shamans in anything PvE related.
---
ZF stairs event is a perfect example of a time you'd want the water totem.
---
Can't spell "barf" without B F A
---
Why a *good* laptop?
---
Honestly 30/0/21 is better IMO.
---
Natures swiftness opens up a lot more possibilities. i.e. quick panic heal, instant DPS to finish off a fleeing opponent.
---
I was expecting stupid click-bait "guide"... I was served a wholesome meme instead!
---
I need to be mobile. I work away regularly. Also my wife will be ok with my playing on a laptop on the sofa, where I can still be sociable. She’d soon get tired if I was in the bedroom on the desktop. 😂
---
When I play a video game, I like the feeling of accomplishment more than anything else. The feeling that I went up against something difficult and through preparation, skill, and tenacity, I overcame it. In Vanilla I felt that. Three regular mobs were enough to kill me. An elite mob was a dangerous threat. Entering a dungeon did not guarantee victory; we could easily wipe, get lost, or break apart.
---
All of that, all of what I enjoyed in wow, is gone from retail. I knew in my heart the game was never going to be what I wanted it to be when they downgraded half the elite mobs in the game to be regular mobs. I want to play a version of wow where they're back. I want classic. I want to fail, I want to die, and I want to have to get better in order to progress.
---
[Found this table](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Diminishing_returns)
---
Assuming it’s accurate you are correct about polymorph, however, kidneyshot has a pvp AND pve diminishing return unlike polymorph.
---
TBC introduced some very lazy writing and players (unfortunately) either were fine with it or even ate it up. The example I always point to are the Draenei...
---
Oh what's that you say? This cool, but ugly as sin race is being added to Alliance? Nice! Wait what? You mean they are pretty now? Why? Oh these guys aren't related to the ones we met in WC3? Oh that's disappointing, but OK. How did they end up joining the alliance anyway? Wait what the fuck? seriously a spaceship? In Warcraft? OK fine. Wait.... you are telling me they crashlanded on Azeroth by mistake and join the Alliance? Oh how *convenient* /eyeroll
---
I think you’re right, I don’t think they’d use the phrase “classic summer” of the release was at the very tail end of summer.  I expect to be playing by August.
---
You can have both.
---
They want this sub to have Blizzard's blessing and be a semi-official discussion space for Classic. Which means policing speech about pirate servers.
---
You can't browse for ten minutes without seeing someone bypassing the rule by talking about "rhymes with Schmorthfail" or whatever, and it seems pretty obvious that the bulk of the readers aren't reporting that kind of thing. So for better or for worse I think the policy is clearly not a reflection of the will of the user base. But that's reddit for you.
---
Nobody knows timeline, it's in alpha now and will release during the "Summer". Anything you see stating otherwise is hearsay until a blue post settles the matter.
---
People have successfully multiboxed on the Blizzcon client with Innerspace and Macros for Following and Assist.
---
Not downvoting, but this isn't some promised update on an early-access game or crowd-funding project. Blizzard is part of a huge corporation that has shareholders counting on them to increase their profit-margins. They gave us a summer 2019 release date back in 2017. Even if its buggy as shit and they have to fix a bunch of stuff with constant patching, it would be pretty shocking if they didn't at least get the game out by Sept 2019.
---
We were told:
---
1. Items will be in their final form. 
---
2. Catch up gear like Lionheart Helm (in addition to the entire DM) won’t drop until the phase equal to when everything else it was added with is added. Like around theNaxx phase for LHH.
---
So... I’d like to think I understood it fairly well.
---
Oh yeah, Plainsrunning. Totally forgot about that.
---
👍👍
---
I bought a 6 month subscription 2 months ago cuz I was really into retail but that interest died REALLY quick. Waste of money :(
---
Hypppeeee indeed!!!
---
Fair points
---
God damn, I even have played most expansions just to give them the ol' college try, but just hearing you describe it  is depressing. Holy shit classic hype is too strong.
---
My initial point in responding to /u/Lord_Sicarious was that burning a fire dragon feels instinctively wrong because they produce fire as a basic part of their anatomy and it doesn't hurt them.
---
You then tried to refute that by saying that we produce Methane but it can still kill us. 
---
And I conceded, yes, we can produce methane. But not as a basic part of our anatomy. Only as a byproduct of digestion of certain foods.
---
You then tried to refute that by pointing out that we produce acid naturally as part of our anatomy.
---
And I responded that it's an incredibly weak acid, that is only used for digestion, where as a Green Dragon (for the acid example specifically) has acid that it can, as part of its anatomy, breathe out as a weapon, and that melts basically anything that it touches. Even if we could shoot our stomach acid out, it wouldn't melt anything, they could just brush it off.
---
It's different. If our stomach acid could be used as a weapon by us exhaling it, and it could melt flesh/stone/metal with nearly equal ease, then I'd be more inclined to agree with your point. But we can't. And even then, I would assume from looking outside in that a being that could do that would probably be immune, or at least have a much reduced effect, from the exact same kind of acid.
---
My point was that just because our real world laws of nature/anatomy/biology work one way doesn't mean it will for a Dragon in a **fantasy setting** (??). 
---
&gt; it isn't a huge stretch of the imagination to have a creature that can breath out gas, poison, or fire 
---
No shit, I never once said this wasn't the case?
---
&gt; I'm saying just because you *can* produce it, doesn't mean you can live in it. 
---
And I was just saying that they are not normal humans on earth IRL. They are dragons in a **fantasy setting**. 
---
&gt;But it doesn't matter, it's *fantasy*. 
---
Right.
---
I haven't, but it's supposedly a good combo since Warrior has rage as resource and can just keep going while priest is healing. So not stopping. I assume you just reached a level were you have some issues that will be solved as you get more dmg abilities/talents and better gear. A priest is perhapsnot the perfect combo with Warrior, as shield will prevent getting rage from damage. A druid has more hot abilities and two dots. A shaman has Windfury in later levels, so I would at least consider other classes.
---
I always go Elemental Mastery on my Shamans because I level on PVP servers and EM Chain Lightning blows fools up and it's so satisfying.  Cast a LB and spam the EM CL macro as soon as it's done and they both hit at the same time.  Take most people down to almost dead.  It's delicious
---
"Immune"
---
Cos the game was never as good once tBC came out.
---
I’m looking forward to playing and leveling to 60! Raiding instances and gear progression that means something. I don’t want it handed to me on a plate. 
---
The vanilla quests and leveling told a great story, and the instances were epic!! BRD is one of the best instances, with something like 30 bosses and mini bosses. 
---
Can’t wait!
---
Misogyny is funny! Ha ha!
---
I wish I could add massive shoulder pads to the picture
---
The one feature I would want from retail multiboxing is being able to target your AoE on all toons at once. Without that, the classic 5box Shaman will rein supreme for me
---
Did snoop dog drop by winterspring?
---
lol even though after Vanilla I char transferred and have been horde since all this talk of classic and Horde verse Alliance has really pumped me up. I can't wait to kill horde scum once again!!!! :).
---
Idk why but... I just really liked alliance in Vanilla. Although.... having an Orc Rogue is hilarious to me and I loved mine. Giant green dude sneaking through bushes.... always found it funny.
---
I'm going to have a ton of raid utility though. Aura, bop, bof, di, cleanse... and Sanctuary gives raid wide damage reduction, plus an extra thorns for the tank to build more threat with.
---
I'm going to be all set with utility, what's going to hurt me in raids is i won't have an instant cast heal, and i won't have that 21 point holy talant. I'll absolutely be able to tank 5s though. Maybe even ubrs.
---
Honestly if the highest tier i reach is the dungeon 2 set, I'll still be happy with the character.
---
Essentially, make a level 1 alt when classic releases. Walk said alt down to everlook in winterspring and park hin by the mailbox. Proceed to level your main but send gold to alt to purchase limited availability items for as long as you can uncontested, or however much gold you feel like spending. You can push back your mount a few days but the ROI is absolutley massive.
---
Either learn said patterns and make bank off of marketing your profession, or whats much better is to wait until the server lifecycle starta to mature (2-3) months in. As demand begins to climb for these items so will the price. Getting there early gives you a solid foothold against any item mafias or strait up botters who will abuse the vendor and corner the market. So you spend some money up front for a massive return a few montha down the road.
---
I know classic will be different than PSERVS, but the same concept will still apply. You can make absolute bank doing this. Im gonna have more videos showcasing many of the different limited item vendors and which ones people should hunt for in their travels. Youd be surprised how much some of them sell for. Out of either pure laziness or just the unavailability of the item since they are limited stock.
---
Then i basically break down when and why to sell etc etc.
---
You likely will not be able to find a competitive guild that will allow that early on.
---
However once they have content on far or are running Alt runs you will definitely be able to or if you run with a non hardcore guild just getting 40 people is hard enough they really won't be able to be picky.
---
That being said if you are going to use a sub optimal spec you really need to show up ready to work hard.  You can very well damage a spec's reputation if you show up and do shit DPS and may well not be allowed to bring that spec again.
---
Just a FYI, I use BIS lists to come up with ideas for my own personalized list. Since LHH won’t be available until later, I’m looking for a replacement. 
---
Btw, It’s pretty presumptuous of you to assume I was looking for someone to “spoon feed” me.
---
Good gaming one! Don’t want lag at all in 40 man raids and epic AV’s. Would rather spend a few more £££ to get a good one 😀👍
---
Lol that part was definitely a joke. When my wife sames jump I says yes ma'am. :)
---
It's Alliance tradition to walk in to Stormwind Keep, just going about your business, 'bout to hand in some quest, and there's a GIANT BLOODY DRAGON SURROUNDED BY ELITE DRAGONS AND EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE.
---
First time I saw it, it's like "whoa, what's going on!".  After a few years it's more like "okay dude, I get you wanna kill Bolvar and all but I need to hand in this quest, 'kay?"
---
Well the difference is 1hander and shield for tanks versus bag full of gear for rets
---
There will always be those who are willing to pay a premium for convenience, but I don't think that camping these spots is going to be as profitable as you think.
---
The first example is the Recipe: Major Health Potion, which is on a 1 hour refresh (IIRC) and requires 275 alchemy to use, and the product requires level 55 to use. That means that the demand for the recipe will not rise until the masses begin to reach level 55 and the demand for the product goes up, and there is no reason for people to pay gouged prices before that point because they have a good chance of just picking it up from the vendor.
---
There are some who will get to 60 in 5 days played but the majority will be closer to 8-10 days played. If you consider an average player spending 22 hours a week in wow then you're looking at 2 months before you start seeing tons of 60s. At 1 hour refresh you're looking at a possible 1,440 copies of the recipe making it into circulation by the 2 month mark (probably a bit lower since only a few copies will sell on the first day).
---
If you're aiming to price gouge the hardcore raiders then you're in for a shock. The recipe costs 1.5g. How soon do you think you will be able to afford to spend 1.5g on an investment that won't pay out for weeks? However fast you think you'll be able to pull it off, a group of players pooling their money together can do it faster. Those hardcore groups have an alchemist and they already have a plan to obtain all of their desired recipes. And then what happens after you spend your first 1.5g on that recipe, it is going to refresh in an hour and you won't have enough to buy another one, so they start falling in the hands of other players that don't need to pay your exorbitant price.
---
The laughable part of the advice you've given is that it can be profitable "if you can get this spot uncontested". We're talking about a vendor in plain view, 25 feet from the flight path, in a popular quest hub. It's not a secret, it hasn't been  a secret for 15 years.
---
&gt;even though WoW will run on a toaster.
---
You need to have a gaming PC to be in large cities, to raid and do pvp according to this sub. Basically you can't play 50% of this game without a good PC
---
I might just choose to play it with the updated graphics!
---
Endgame PvE locks have the potential to definitely top the charts.
---
Your counterargument now has me thinking about it. I will be funding my brother's account so maybe when he's not playing, I can try dual boxing. But I don't mess with addons.
---
Well after Cataclysm I've just subscribed for 3 to 5 months of each expansion. Now I'm just looking for classic.
---
Probably not more difficult than a retail multiboxer. Not sure if they use different software or what but I could never do two legit rotations in retail today without any third party software
---
They also have their *own* convention. They barely care about E3, much less GamesCom.
---
My point was that things can and do produce things from their bodies that do hurt them.
---
Your argument is that because I am not a dragon, anything my body produces needs to be identical to a mythical dragon, because otherwise it's not a valid comparison.
---
Orc DPS warrior will be my focus. I’ll be raiding, but I’ll also be doing a fair bit of pvp. I might never clear naxx, and I may never hit high warlord, but I’m going to enjoy myself. (I do expect to clear aq40 at the least though.)
---
And a spammable cleave/extra debuff. People seriously sleep on troll priest...
---
RP-PvP?
---
My former best friend is the person who first got me to play back in 2005. He had been a long-time Warcraft fan even before WoW came out and as much as I loved the game, his passion for it was on an entirely different level. I'm sure he would roll on Classic with me if he were still alive today.
---
Nice. Any idea what the name of the video is?
---
XD I was teasing mostly, but you deserve a say, too!
---
Cat is the best IMO. Owls are okay, but overhyped. Cat will have best DPS, and fastest attack speed for more consistent threat and uptime on Frenzy. 
---
Upgrade your pet skills once the next level of claw/dash/prowl available. Claw being most important for leveling.
---
If that's a question and not a statement, Druid. I've been leveling one on pservers and it's a lot of fun.
---
okay, it just struck to me as a bigger concern over anything else. But I don't think anyones ever in depth analyzed the balance of bosses over time. the impact of boss strength vs items, bosses would honestly way waaay outweigh anything about items
---
They were corrupted by the fel, yeah, and then when the humans won they enslaved the orcs and brutally beat and tortured them
---
People who care about their ranking wouldn't participate in city raids because its not good honor per time spent anyway, after they are done ranking sure maybe
---
So if you want farm gold in dungeons at 60, won't this add far more possibilities if you dual box? I see Hunter typically does Maraudon runs, but I assume with a pocket healer you can do some runs that gives more hold hour, no?
---
Where tokens went wrong was when you could use tokens from a heroic to buy T6 quality loot. That's where the "earned" part goes to shit. I can't wait for the changes/no changes debate to start with TBC:Classic, but one thing I drastically wish they would do would be move to tiers of tokens, so you can only use tokens to buy loot from the tier they dropped in. Or get rid of the dedicated badge gear and let you buy loot off any bosses loot table with your badges...BUT ONLY loot that you had unlocked by killing the boss who drops it.
---
Ok, let's do one the other way:
---
A man walks into a bar.  He sees a horribly distraught man sitting at the counter, his chin buried in his arms.  On the counter, next to this slumped over heap of shame, sat a very tiny man playing a very tiny piano.
---
The man pulls up a stool, and asks the poor fellow what's wrong.
---
"I met a genie, and he gave me a wish."
---
"And this is what you wished for?"
---
"No, the genie was hard of hearing.  Why would I want a 12-inch pianist?"
---
Warlock flair, did not enjoy leveling: does not compute
---
My wife is going to be out of the country until late September, so as long as release is early enough that I can no life for a couple months before she gets back, things should be golden for me.  
---
She might be annoyed with me for gaining like 20 pounds while she's gone though.
---
Your not wrong, but i have literally done exactly this on fresh servers multiple times. Im not talking about cornering the market during early game that makes no sence. Essentially just get here before others do, since no one i know personally does this you have time to buy as many as youd like.
---
The price will 10000% increase a large margin by the time your ready to sell. Its a literal 1 hour investment of getting your character there, and possibly pushing your level 40 mount off a day or two if you even go that crazy with it. No its not a secret your right and the smaller population compared to Pservs may impact this more than i am anticipating. But with such a small time/ gold investment early game it seems like a winning scenario all around.
---
It looks like shit!
---
I plan on dual boxing warlock/pally combo
---
Stealing content
---
Some people are gonna no-life this release and get to 60 as quick as possible. Level gaps really suck and if you can’t convince your friends to play at your speed, you are likely screwed. Happened with a group of my friends who didn’t work or have families and they hit 60s and started doing BGs while I was stuck at 20 and had to meet random players along the way that were doing the same quests.
---
Enslaved? I don't think so. There is nothing what so ever in the lore that claims that the Alliance used Orc for forced labor.
---
Imprisoned? I'll agree with. But imprisonment in order to contain dangerous people is a well accepted practice. But imprisonment is not enslavement.
---
It honestly doesn’t really matter! 
---
Pick a pet you really like, it truly does become your companion.
---
I was a dwarf hunter and got Raptor early! Loved it! Had it all the way to 60, then I had brokentooth for pvp and a wolf for raiding. 
---
I also had a turtle for a while Cos of shield shell, but didn’t really like it too much. 
---
The gorilla was great too for grinding for aoe tanking!
---
Excellent information! Thank you for writing it out for me. I’ll keep an eye out for more content.
---
If that's the difference between a warrior's tanking gear and dps gear, he is either going to be a shit tank or a shit dps.
---
that makes sense! I’m just hoping my 4 yr old macbook pro I used for college will be able to run classic, I don’t think i’ll be doing any raiding.
---
Yep. Im calling my pserver time "pre season."
---
No one knows for sure how classic will perform, but I've been playing on a pserver using a non-gaming laptop with intel integrated video from 2013.  I can go to all the major cities stutter-free, with settings mostly set to the mid-range.
---
Druid tanks used it in the next expansion for a while if that adds any credit to how godly it was.
---
That's definitely an overexaggeration. It's roughly 30/45 mins per level 100-110 and 1h per level from 110-120.
---
Your cool mythos would mean your skills are useless against the lord of fire and you would be a liability to the lives and mythos of the 39 other people assembled to defeat this threat to the world.  I had a mage that was spec'd fire in MC, and lets just say that his dps was okay on mobs that were just resistant to fire if he was a lock in the blue set and not a mage with t1 and random +dmg blues add in all the fire elementals and the fire immune boss's and ya, wand spec priest dps overall.
---
My then GF, now wife, ...
---
This was a conscious decision by the original dev team.  This makes players have to consider their spells effects and composition when engaging and attempting to defeat various enemies.
---
Hell aside from the debuff slot limitations Warrior usually had to spec out of deep wounds because so many things are immune to bleed.
---
This made fire attacks less desirable for the first two raids but come ZG and beyond all of a sudden fire mages have a spot and geared fire mages could pull ridiculous damage.
---
As a side note fire is viable in pvp as soon as BWL gear.  However it really shines with the ZG stuff.
---
Yeah but private servers are not the same as classic WoW. Classic WoW will use the modern, retail WoW engine, so system requirements will most likely be the same as BfA. You can't raid in BfA with 25 men without a gaming PC, so you won't be able to do that with 40 people in Classic WoW.
---
It should be fine. The reason I need a new one is Cos I had a good gaming desk top back in 2007, when I quit playing in 2012, I gave it away.
---
Good Point. I had been Macroing the priest to shield when war charges which is totally rage starving me. Going to change to renew instead. Sham war sounds really great, just can't stand horde aesthetics lol.
---
A good chunk of the things you listed are things from the modern client that they won't bother to remove (like displaying vendor value, auto dismount toggle in settings, 12 items per mail).
---
A few others will never be recreated due to updated addon limitations. Vanilla decursive was intentionally broken starting in 2.0 and will never make a comeback. Depending on how much they modify the retail client, the default raid frames will highlight player frames with the debuff type your class can remove, but the 1-button spammable decursive is dead (good riddance).
---
Ohhh yeah ;)
---
It shouldn't be a huge problem though, warriors are often the toughest class to find for dungeons and you'd be taking their place as prot
---
That's what I was going for, but I'm not going to go back and edit it now.
---
Interested in your take on leveling. It sure would be nice to just have to worry about one set of gear. The int and spr would let you heal as well. I imagine you must just keep your weapon current for good enough dmg while questing and grinding?
---
Not when all the warriors wear of the tiger leather.
---
Since ... 2007?
---
Without addons it's a huge pain though.
---
You can’t level together, However you can still have a laugh and chat as you are going it. Can still help each other out with quests and elite mobs or the occasional run through an instance for the lowest level pal so they catch up a little.
---
Holla for quitting during tbc and never looking back.
---
the building and trees look ok, but that colloidal flora is turned up to 13 and I really want it at about a 5.
---
Battle for Azeroth and warlords or draenor were complete trash.
---
I’m looking forward to more permanence on gear and progress. On live, everything resets after a month or two and your character is worthless and outdated. You play the patch and nothing else; I hate that. You literally can’t step away from the game for a few weeks without everything being 100% reset.
---
In vanilla there are *almost* no catchup mechanics and hard resets. You earn gear and use it for months, if not years! It feels like playing an actual role playing game and not a “instanced season with an open world queue”.
---
All of those things you mentioned, tasks those classes have to do, are all important jobs that they are tasked with, yes. The difference is that a Rogue, regardless of dungeon or encounter should always be looking for a chance to kick (unless it's a specific encounter where he has to save kick for a specific spell) and mages should always look for times when poly is needed and tanks should always...well tank. 
---
But a Retribution Paladin does not "conserve mana specifically for healing and make sure I heal over any chances to DPS and change my entire playstyle as well as carry an extra set of gear in my limited bag space..."
---
If you don't want to invite a Ret to your group because he'll roll on plate gear and because you expect Rets to heal for you, then go for it. Don't invite him, no one (sane) is telling you that you have to invite him to a group. If you want to invite him and then after waiting 30 minutes you want to kick him and fill his slot with a different DPS, well that's fine. Bit a dick move to even invite him in the first place. But it is what it is. No one wants brainless dungeons where everyone can CC and heal themselves. Classes need identity. Paladin has class identity in their seals and blessings. Ret has it's own class identity. But you're essentially saying "Do us all a favor and heal even though that's not the playstyle you want to do." 
---
Why don't you just tell everyone in the "what class will you main" threads on reddit that we don't need another hunter or rogue main, that they should do you and the server and the community a favor and just roll a healer because that makes grouping go easier.
---
Nope, you're wrong about this. People don't owe you to join their groups if they don't want to.
---
The second we get a release date I will be looking for a PC 😆
---
Big concern for my friend group as well. The way it sits, I know 3 of us will hit it significantly harder then the others, so we have planned to have three characters that we level together, or as our pushers.  
---
We are also planning on rolling other toons with the more casual group. The game to me is more about community and enjoying the game. I am not on the competitive edge and I do not give a crap about world firsting and stuff like that. But I am fully aware people level at different paces and am going to make an effort to play with everyone as often as possible. Sure this might come back to haunt me if I fall behind on one of both, but as long as I am in Discord with people and socializing, it is way more fun then solo.
---
Get engineering and use the [Shadow Reflector](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18639)
---
I did participate in Horde faction leader kills in TBC, so I am not sure if anything changed, but:  
---
- Faction Leaders spawned groups of Guards every few minutes after being engaged, meaning you did need a couple of tanks.  
---
- Cairne: Massive Knockback but stands in front of a building you can pull him inside to fight without having to worry about getting punted off the bluffs. Size of the building does mean AoEs from players are a threat though.  
---
- Thrall and Vol’jin: Pulling Vol’jin resulted in Thrall being aggro’d as well. Vol’jin had a mass poly and Thrall had chain lighting. Otherwise I don’t remember anything too difficult beyond it being the main Horde capital so a ton of players would likely interfere unless done at a very slow time.  
---
- Sylvanas: I remember this fight being a major pain in the ass because of two factors: Varimathras and a teleport. Varimathras had an AoE Life drain that made killing him take a lot longer than you may expect while Sylvanas would vanish and reappear around the room causing you to lose target of her.

Yep, precisely keep your weapon at highest DPS... stats on it or effects are just additional benefit. The talents in enhance are going to be your biggest help. Auto attacks are better for mana conservation. So the 2 best ways to benefit your auto attacks are.. high weapon dps and talents that buff melee.
---
Outside of that its wiser to stack 1. int &amp; 2. stam/spr ... which is going to help your solo play and your dungeon play (in either dps or heal role.)
---
West fall roooooad
---
Just concentrate on leveling with gathering profs. Have a bank alt and post all cloth, greens, leather/herbs/ore to them. 
---
Only look to sell it round about level 40, for your mount. By then the economy will be growing and rush players will already be 60.
---
Last time I played retail was during Cataclysm. I realized I was just logging in pretty much everyday just to do dailies &amp; I wasn't enjoying them, so I stopped.
---
Jesus. Just play where you want.
---
Interesting that the article is capped off with a note on how great a representation of great PVP this was.... Except it was against npc characters. Epic PVP is PVE. Understood.
---
Show me an example of how the BiS list changes for Phase 1 both prior to the Itemization post and after. I'll even let you choose the class.
---
After clearing Naxxramas in Wotlk i unsubbed and i´ve been wanting to play classic since that day.
---
My first hunter has his first pet still; a crab.
---
It's because there's two types of people. WoW is an addictive, fun drug. Every level up, every new item, every quest completed and turned in, is a shot of dopamine straight to the head.
---
Some people acknowledge how addictive it is, and either mitigate play or avoid entirely.
---
Other people, me included, chase that dopamine high for as long as they can.
---
It sure is 😎😎😎 thanks for looking out for me bro!
---
I did, and even put in the comment section, "will not resub til classic launches because retail is trash."
---
Dwarf Priest, Bald because baldness increases Character age, Age increases Wisdom/Intellect, Increases Power.
---
Calling live WoW faceroll is a little disingenuous and kinda misses the problem of why it's broken.
---
WoW PvP and endgame raiding is more difficult than it ever was in the past, and it's dramatically more difficult than Vanilla. I'd argue even normal raiding is harder than anything in vanilla, up to maybe a few fights in AQ/Naxx (and I say this as someone that has raided in both Vanilla and BfA).
---
The problem is that everything *up to* that point is just so pointless and thin that it feels meaningless.
---
Over the years, WoW has become a better game for both casuals and the absolute cutting edge hardcore players -- and bad for everyone in the middle. If you're the kind of person that had a place during Vanilla/BC/WotLK doing the "casualcore" thing where you didn't dedicated your life to the game, but you wanted to improve, there basically isn't a place for you in current WoW.
---
I never claimed that people owe it to join a group that they don't want to.
---
*Laughs in FacePunch*
---
In my experience trying to level as a group is a very difficult thing, especially if you all have different leveling speeds. The faster players feel frustrated, the slower ones feel rushed, and everyone has a less enjoyable time.
---
Allow yourselves to level at your own pace. If you find yourselves online at the same time, doing the same quest or dungeon, group up! This will happen more often at lower levels. I wouldn't try to maintain synchronization though, it is usually more trouble than it is worth.
---
Can't unsub if you haven't had a sub for 12 years!
---
Right, it's not, because you are a real person with a real body and real biology/biochemistry. Dragons, like you pointed out previously, are fantasy creatures. It is not a valid comparison in any way. Dragons, in WoW lore, are damn near demigods, especially if they make it to older age. It's ridiculous to compare them to a real person. Even the Humans in WoW are super human by our standards.
---
If they reply to a LF1M healer, then yes, they'd be a dick. But someone who wants to come as dps to a dungeon would never reply to a LF1M Healer message in the first place, so you're spending all this time and energy being upset about hypothetical ret palas exhibiting a nonexistent behavior you don't like. It's dumb as fuck.
---
Classic wow will be sharing data with the 8.0 client, this means you will likely have to download the full thing. Best to download in advance if you can.
---
Lol
---
&gt; Teldrasil is literally empty always.
---
same thing with thunderbluff. 
---
Also the tram makes it easier for allaince players in both cities to defend one
---
That its an RPG and not an action looter.
---
God-tier PVP still, if you find a good 2h and a mix of some t2 gear!
---
if you have the desire and schedule capability to get into raids you'll definitely earn a spot.  Sanc does reduce a ton of damage raid-wide, or if you guys don't have enough Pal to fill out the typical blessings then that's even more reason to bring you. 
---
 Plus there's the relevant Vanilla-ism floating around that the toughest part of end-game raiding is to find 40 people willing to put in the work and pulling in the same direction.
---
Sounds great to me, but I'm not sure questing would be easier, just killing mobs to do quests. I would have done it if I could justify paying for 5 subscriptions, but I think 2 is my limit. Running 4 windowed WoWs on the second computer also has it disadvantages I feel.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Gaming laptops have come a long way in the past couple years too so you can get a pretty good experience for a reasonable price especially if you get one on sale.
---
&gt; There is nothing what so ever in the lore that claims that the Alliance used Orc for forced labor
---
Uh, are you into the lore that much? That's one of the hugest and main points behind thrall's rebellion is because his people were treated as inferiors and beaten while forced to do manual labor
---
Thank you
---
Who said anything about kicking someone for being ret after they're in group for 30 minutes? Look at the OP, clearly the conversation is happening after the invite where they have a full group waiting for a healer, and the rejection of the retadin happens immediately.
---
Your initial example is wrong by your own words.  A "lesser source" of fire than a dragon's gut, is NOT a volcano.
---
Literally everyone here
---
Guilty as my undead mohawk is a rogue
---
Don't forget the pre-instance part of dungeons! Often filled with elites and sometimes rife with unsolicited PvP
---
You shouldn't skip until 60 but I skip until 40. Once you get the mount you can do the quest pretty quickly if you've prepared the flightpaths ahead of time.
---
Either slow down your leveling (gather, craft, fish, low level quests for rep, etc) or make an alt.  I'm in somewhat of the same situation and will probably have 2 if not 3 characters.
---
Good luck surviving against a well geared Warrior with Windfury and a Chain Lightning. Since your faction doesn't have Capacitor totem, guess you just have to eat the Chain Lightning
---
&gt; Im not talking about cornering the market
---
My point was that the recipe is so readily available that there is little need to buy it from a flipper unless the market is cornered, which is going to be near impossible to do early on.
---
&gt;The price will 10000% increase a large margin by the time your ready to sell.
---
How soon do you expect people to be willing to pay 150g for this recipe?
---
Let it be known that Elemental shaman can destroy in PvP and enhancement is a little overrated.
---
That's essentially what I was in Vanilla, and if I do go in for Classic I'll be doing it again.  In time, my guild got enough trust in me to let me tank adds in raids as well.
---
Physical scales better damage-wise, but the thing about the spell power version is that you get to have a bunch of mana and decent +healing. If you go pure phys ret-reckoning, you have like 3k mana and your heals are limited mostly to when you bubble. Holy-reckoning gets like 5k mana and very decent heals while being not that far behind in terms of deadliness.
---
Real life should come first. 
---
Gaming should be a hobby, dont let it get in the way of your life.
---
That said: all work and no play... 
---
I guess a balanced approach is whats needed.
---
Classic is an RPG, there is a journey to be had through the world as you quest grow more powerful and take on more dangerous foes. The world is a harsh and unforgiving one that forces you to band together to succeed in your individual goals.
---
Retail WoW and modern MMOs lack any kind of difficulty that encourages you to work with other players, the challenge that does exist in higher end raiding and mythic plus is all individually focus, you need more gear, you need to do more dps, the team focus is almost entirely gone from the game outside of the very highest level of play. Added to that you can experience all of the content through dungeon finder or left, people aren’t encouraged to improve or to try to learn more about the game because to them they just beat the hardest boss, why bother putting in the hours to beat it on a higher difficulty? Better rewards? Maybe but you’ll replace them with quest epics from World Quests when the next patch drops.
---
All the RPG has fallen out of WoW in favor of convenience and while that might have been good for Blizzards bottoms line it drove a lot of us away from the game.
---
Exploration back in the day was a huge part of the experience, and one that is gone forever. I don't need it, don't miss it. If I want to experience something new and unexpected, I have plenty of games in my library for that (not retail wow, for the record). 
---
There are plenty of other reasons why people prefer vanilla. An intact sense of community, a thriving universe that exists in more than just the endgame, a steep investment curve that makes rewards feel substantial. For me it comes down to practicality: there simply aren't many MMOs on the market to day that actually feel like a breathing world in the way vanilla wow does. They are mostly all about bringing the action as fast as possible, and if I wanted that I would play an action game, not an MMO. At the end of the day, I just find vanilla to be an objectively better project than not only modern WoW, but most retail MMOs on the market today.
---
Yes it is. Lava is mundane hot rocks, Dragon Fire is magic by its nature. Just like the Dragon.
---
meh, ret palas are rare. Just create your own groups and don't invite them.
---
We might get lucky and get the old inspect functionality where you can't see talents.
---
Been telling the GF for over 6 months that Classic is coming. I've kept bugging her to try it and see why I enjoy the game. I've played Horde since day 1 (Zug-Zug!) and she says if she plays, she'd like to play Alliance. So now we've started a war over which faction to play.
---
The percentage wasnt made to be taken literally ! I meant you will make money from this guaranteed. 
---
I wouldnt sell these early on either. Like you said 2-3 months or potentially longer into the servers life cycle. Every server i have played on had bots spam buying every item in everlook that had a cooldown. It was near impossible to get them.
---
I dont know if that will be the case for classoc like i said the smaller population may put a damper on this. But you will without a doubt make money with this for a very small time investment during the first hour of the game you play give or take.
---
That's not necessarily so. Rank 1 MST costs 40 mana to cast, restores 4 mana every 2 sec for 60 seconds.
---
60 / 2 = 30. 30 ticks in a minute.  
---
4 * 30 = 120 mana restored, 80 after initial mana cost is deducted.  
---
Looking at MST's tooltip for each rank, the efficiency continues to improve with higher ranks.
---
You have a theoretical maximum of 40 GCDs to spend per minute. Assuming you frontload damage in order to enable mana regen during combat that means that the ideal time to cast MST is on the second pull. Let's say that the given time frame that we're working within on the initial pull is one minute and fifteen second, and that all subsequent pulls are treated as 60 second time intervals since the duration of MST is 60 seconds.
---
The factors that determine the value of placing MST are time spent in proximity to totem where a minimum of 20 seconds is mandatory, time to kill, travel time and total mana regen. If you stay below 99% mana MST can grant you a net increase to leveling, presuming you're able to utilize it for more than 20 seconds. Each second beyond that point becoming increasingly more valuable than the last.
---
Not sure because this only happend once. It just ran away and disappeared iirc
---
Damn, username checks out.
---
Shaman receive 15 mana per 1 intel and 59.5 intel = 1% spell crit
---
     So 7 int = 105 mana and a fraction of spell crit
---
Shaman receive 2 melee Attack Power per point of Strength. 
---
     So 7 Str = 14 AP = +1.0DPS
---
Shaman receive Critical Strike and Dodge Chance with Agility.
---
     So 20 AGI = +1% Dodge and 1% Melee Crit
---
So it takes alot of AGI or STR to have a great effect on your melee. Prior to BRD it is hard to stack these to a great effect.
---
Intel weighs better as a resource while leveling. Mana Pool is going to give you more survivability while the lack of str and agi isn't going to effect your dps to a large margin.

I always went and got The Rake at level 10 because he had 1.2 attack speed and was available at level 10.  I didn't bother with Brokentooth...personally I didn't like the way he looked, I preferred the lion and the 1.0 attack speed wasn't that big a deal  to me as I had 1.2 already.
---
I used the site Petopia (you can find an archive of it) to see when and where to upgrade my pets abilities and I would  pretty much upgrade them when I was able to tame those beasts that had the new skills.
---
Make your own groups. When I tank 5mans I avoid taking dps warriors and retadins.
---
Subbed from TBC -&gt; late Cata, then late MoP -&gt; Legion, unsubbed since halfway through Legion.
---
If only there was some kinda way for a Hunter to put a Mark on someone, some kinda Hunter's Mark maybe... but no, we gotta use Phantom Blade and hit those rogues a bit in melee. THANKS OBAMA.
---
Oh my sweet summer child...
---
Just bows
---
You consider 9 hours a week almost a job?
---
nahh...I always leveled with a Cat and never had any issues at all.
---
The original chopper from wrath was fine but God damn there are too many now.
---
I wrote a [Priest Leveling Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/) that should help.
---
No one would ever be "looking for a shaman or paladin." You look for a tank, dps or healer or *maybe* CC - this whole scenario is a bit dumb.
---
If you get an add with renew going the add will go straight for Priest. Perhaps the best is to dedicate separate keys for healing and try to limit healing for when Warrior has enought threath. Numpad for Priest is an option here as you just use your mouse hand when casting on the healer (assuming you are right handed). Enter could target Warrior, + could target Priest. Rest of the keys are used for macros and abilities. Attack abilities should be assist Warrior and cast spell macros. Healing abilties can just be bound to keys so you can use them to heal both characters.
---
I mean, it's called bow specialization for a reason.
---
You say hypothetical and nonexistent behavior when the post is clearly understood by enough people to have almost 1k upvotes. It happens and people have clearly had experiences with it. Not going to explain every possible situation where it could happen
---
ah yes for max lvl ofcourse full plate +def gear, my bad i was only thinking about the leveling part
---
Nope, it is exactly the right movie. Only the reference goes N-word instead of dwarf.
---
For mechanical keyboard I prefer Cherry MX Browns. They are similar to Blues but don't make the "click" sound when pressed. You still feel the "bump" when the switch gets activated. That is not to say that Browns are silent though, you still get a "clack" if you press hard quickly and the key bottoms out (this can be subdued by adding o-rings to the key caps).
---
I like the Razer Naga Hex more than the regular Naga. I find that it is more comfortable and easier to grip since it has the rubber thumb pad. The regular Naga you will find your thumb resting on the grid of buttons, and it is easy to accidentally hit a button or accidentally hit the wrong button. I also find that 8 thumb buttons is plenty, and 12 is unnecessary.
---
That said, I shelved my Naga Hex for G502 when it first came out and I have not looked back since.
---
Find significant other in WoW... problem solved
---
I recently tried bfa again. And you know what annoyed me the most? The leveling. I ran trough this beautiful world but nothing has a meaning. Everytime I passed by some herbs I thought: yeah this shit is useless until i get to the new content. Yeah killing everything with 1 or 2 shots as a mage is fun for some time but it‘s like cheat codes. It gets old really fast. The quests were fine and I even enjoyed some of the cata changes but whats the point about killing a dangerous boss when you need 2sec to down him? I‘m so hyped for classic when everything from 1-60 has some meaning.
---
Huh?
---
For me, I usually move onto a new game once I hit "the end". Fortunately, it takes a while to hit "the end" of vanilla.
---
Some people enjoy endgame, I prefer the journey.
---
Not to mention, community is basically non existent since they added the dungeon finder. I get it but at the same time I don't.
---
We're going to be using 1.12, so kings is prot tier 3.
---
Not saying you shouldn't get an MMO mouse, but just know that they aren't needed and you can make tons of binds using just a regular 5 button mouse and keyboard with a single modifier key.
---
Me:  Dad, can we buy this Blu Ray movie?  
---
Dad:  Why, we have that on VHS at home
---
Me:  ...
---
Then 100% agree, no questions asked.
---
I thought it stood for Butt Fuck Anal
---
Always hated when Thrall did this.
---
It seems like the current client adds ground clutter uniformly based on how much clutter was originally on the ground. This seems like a mistake. Dun Morough, for instance, should be a snowy landscape regardless of the clutter setting. OTOH, perhaps a grassy savannah like The Barrens should be covered in grass on the max setting.
---
I’m definitely getting a new mouse for classic. I also feel like 8 side buttons are plenty and I won’t need all 12.
---
I’m all for increased foliage as long as it’s in areas where it makes sense to have a lot of foliage. Which isn’t in the middle of a snow-covered outpost. :)
---
No, what happens is that people whisper ret paladins asking them to heal, and then the ret paladins say no. And then people get upset, and that's unreasonable as fuck.
---
Same reason your haven’t heard about progress with the ‘internal Alpha’ (which was started just before Easter break). Dey playin’.
---
Again, I don't deny that. What I'am saying is that nobody actually took the time to test how much of an influence consumables have on clearing speed. Let's say you are running full consumables on everyone. Now strike 1 DPS consumable on everyone. How much slower is your clearing time? Is it even noticeable? Is it huge?
---
I've had this discussion with many people and noone can really say a number here or even make an educated guess.
---
Here's to hoping the stellar art team makes the "updated graphics" bespoke to each zone, not just an algorithmic slider.
---
Then whats the basis for you being annoyed at them not wanting to join the group as a healer? Clearly you think they've done something wrong since you're annoyed at them, and the thing they've done is not healing, so it follows that you must think that they owe you to heal.
---
CC is not comparable to spec. You’re saying that a ret is selfish for not playing a style he doesn’t want to vs a mage being a bad mage. That doesn’t equal at all and is unfair to ret players. If you don’t like ret, fine, don’t take one in your group. But son’t be mad at them for not healing.
---
Do you intend to use pally as healbot or will you actually use him to do melee damage too?
---
LoL, this vid gets alot of hate.
---
&gt;Who said anything about kicking someone for being ret after they're in group for 30 minutes? 
---
a few people think this is the way to proceed. As seen through multiple instances in the thread. In the specific scenario, there's nothing wrong with denying him a slot because he only wants to DPS. 
---
Essentially. I agree with peoples right not to invite a dps only pally or warrior. I just don't think you should look your nose down at them or shit talk them because they aren't willing to heal/tank for you. I don't think you're wrong or a bad person for not bringing them on groups, just for acting like theyre bad, dumb, or playing wrong for not being a tank/healer.
---
It is worth trying if you have the gold to spare, if worse comes to worst then you can always just sell it for face value.
---
About 3-6 yards
---
To my knowledge it proca a certain amount per minute regardless of speed of weapon. That is why you want the bigger hits with it.
---
But bow is in crossbow
---
All that foliage looks really bad
---
You could try a library and use their wifi. Or ask a computer shop what they would charge.
---
Since Nvidia's pascal GPUs, mobile video cards have performed comparably to desktop cards, not to mention, a GTX1060 in a laptop performs WAY better than a GTX960 in a desktop (the "recommended" spec for BFA).
---
Laptop video cards have gotten a whole lot better in the recent past.
---
I intend to crash and burn
---
You mean September 2019 :(
---
Dwarf hunter here. Going for a cat all the way. Upgrading the new claw now and then according to one of those lists which shows what mob that have a particular ability and level.
---
I think most phones out now have enough processing  power to run classic lol
---
Yeah I’ve been unsubbed since mid MoP.
---
Summer ends like September 20th. Almost guaranteed that’s when blizz will release
---
My sub time went something like this...
---
Vanilla (2005 probably but can’t remember,) quit, resub for TBC, quit, resub sometime during Wotlk, quit, resub sometime during MoP, quit, resub during WoD, quit, resub during Legion, quit, waiting for Classic now.
---
So what? That doesn't mean they are the same thing.
---
Speaking as someone who always dragged around town clothes in vanilla, transmog was the one bit of retail I really loved over the free weekend. Everyone looked different from each other, and they had matching sets. It was very nice. To me it felt like a nice qol upgrade with virtually no cost. Guess I'll be a minority in that though.
---
Show us more of the new HD grass bröther
---
Welp. Once again I ain't got nothing to contribute but I am sitting down and enjoying a beer. Settin up shop. Ready to watch this unfold.
---
NO STOP THRALL NO
---
That doesn't change the fact that a toster could run WoW. We are still talking about high-end, modern laptops, not 2012-2013 ones
---
Thanks for the info. You gonna go enhance to 60 and then resto?
---
For somebody who didn't get the demo...what exactly changed?  What am I looking at?
---
I will add that bow skill *barely* affects your dps output. It's not like sword/axe skill on human/orc.
---
You should entertain the notion of making more friends who are your leveling speed so that you have additional people to play with
---
Exactly. Tons of different vendors you can do this with too. Def gonna make some more vids on it
---
I want to spend an entire sunday in BRD doing a full clear, with 4 other people who also want to take the time to enjoy and explore and get lost in it all again.  not jump through lava for the 50th time so some smug rogue and warrior can argue about who's going to get ironfoe.  we all know that thing is never going to drop, an epic in a 5 man better luck finding sasquatch riding a unicorn into the eastern setting sun.
---
I might switch to resto around 57 and grind out dungeons for BIS and work on attunements as a healer. Once I finish with the gear I want from raiding its 30/0/21 wPvP / BGs for me.
---
My friends don't level as fast and we are all on different schedules.
---
It's not a big deal if one dude gets far ahead so long as he's willing to help other. It slows the shit out of leveling but it's usually a good time.
---
I'll be pissed if it's a September release.
---
I can't get time off in September. July and August are way easier.
---
I am very interested in this. I plan on Alting an ele shaman but I don't expect to raid much on him until late BWL/Early Pre AQ.
---
Tempted to install bfa again just to teach my 6yo and 4yo to fish
---
I am, BfA just isn’t drawing me in anymore. I think i’m over the current WoW formula in general really.
---
I’m looking forward to classic though.
---
How desperate are you for karma jesus lol
---
What's the source of this?
---
No one intending to play 7 days straight for 20+ hours a day on launch week for a 15 year old game "has a brain". 
---
Ive been a no lifer, pushing for front page wowprogress rankings and such. Most of us at that level are unhealthy, work shitty jobs/dont work/go to school. There are very few people who have the means to play constantly, work an intellectually stimulating job, maintain physical fitness, and a vibrant social life outside of Discord--one of those other facets of your life is struggling if you think "5+ days of PTO on a videogame, and weeks/months of damage to my body? Ideal". The vast majority load up on energy drinks, doritos type snacks and sit in the dark with blackout curtains for 5 days straight. (that said, if it comes out on a Thursday, Id take Friday and Monday off--if a Tuesday, Ill probably take Thursday/Friday off.--but 5 working days to beat the game in one reset is a touch too much tism).
---
Ive even seen the fabled Blood Legion poop socking document where they had legit pre launch planning for no lifing at MOP launch. Ya know why they felt compelled to write that? Because so many guys were speaking  about doing it the super unhealthy way.
---
Underneath the general uproar lie specific reasons for each individual. No one person can hand you an explanation that will allow you to understand why each individual person is excited about this.
---
Fake news
---
Agree on expectations and identify the barriers to meeting them.  If all of you want to run dungeons together, that gives you an acceptable level range for everyone to bounce between.  If one of your friends has significantly less time to play than everyone else, consider setting a regular schedule for playing together and/or having your power-leveler(s) roll alts to split their time.
---
I'm in a similar boat--I'm planning to play with a few other friends, most of whom are brand new to WoW.  I'll be rolling two characters at launch, one of which I'll only be playing with my friends.
---
MoP was probably the last expack I genuinely enjoyed playing tbh.
---
Puke
---
I'm subbed for like 1 month at the start of each xpac
---
No point to sub any longer
---
Nothing wrong with the ole chopper
---
Massively incomplete post
---
What do you mean by "open to character transfer"? Transfer from where and to where?
---
Not necessarily, you can care about your honor and still not spend 100% of your time doing the most efficient honor grind. It's just DK are such a huge drop to your honor that even if you only casually care about Honor it's not worth taking such a huge drop just for fun. If there wasn't DK's you'd have a lot more PvP minded people wanting to raid cities. I'm one of them. I don't raid cities because of DK's but I'd gladly take time away from BG grinding for an epic city raid event just for fun
---
Imagine being so stupid you think that joke is misogynistic.
---
How come people say that summer ends in september?
---
So it opens the possibility of confusion, which I know you understand already
---
Yup since WoD
---
Cool!
---
I hate how they are reluctant to make changes on live because they don't want to alienate the playerbase that doesn't want a challenge or a grind, but they have been 100% okay with alienating people who liked the game how it was.
---
Wasn’t this posted as a gif earlier today could have sworn I commented on it.

The quote and the bottom half of the meme with Travolta are from pulp fiction, but the Rock and the blonde...?

---
I don't think you can do this solo, it requires 2 people. Lasher farming and trib runs are the standard solo dire maul farm runs.
---
This is usually more effective than lasher farming *for the classes that would do this*. Warlock and mage might be faster g/hr/person, but it's definitely close. Hunter trib runs likely beat it. However this is a standard run for warriors, priests, shamans, paladins, druids, etc. who don't have as good of solo farming options.
---
Yeah that is true, i’ll probably just stick with a mount then.
---
This is a solid choice. Maybe from Library wifi or a coffee shop.
---
Leveling is actually a part of the game, not a hurdle. Things are worth doing. Classes have pros and cons and actual identities through those and fringe abilities like Eyes of the Beast. 
---
I also didn't play until early BC, so experiencing the content when it's relevant would be nice.
---
To be clear, I am fine with sharding in starting zones (not everywhere) and only until the populations all settle down.
---
If sharding refers to the entire game, that’s a 1 from me, dawg.
---
I love my Razer Naga, it’s a fine choice. I’ve not gotten a nice keyboard, though.
---
It just doesn’t seem necessary
---
That should have been your whole argument the whole time: "It's magic!"
---
You know there is no "art team", stellar or otherwise?
---
Classic is not a remaster. It'll use the original Vanilla data (graphics) and it'll look exactly like Vanilla (except the *optional* modern shadows, water and increased ground clutter distance, demonstrated here).
---
See the "Restoring History" panel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
You know that feeling of an old game you loved because it was good and you want to replay out or share that experince with people that missed out. We can’t do that legitimately as wow fans. That’s why you see the hype and the happiness. It’s essientially if Zelda changes over time and you loved OOT but Nintendo made it non exsistent then -5 years later Nintendo going okay you guys deserve your toy back here.
---
Classic is build on a Legion engine, so yeah, modern addons will probably work.
---
What does this post even mean?
---
My buds will have significantly more time than I will, so they'll outlevel me pretty fast. We'll hang out in discord and talk shit while we play and when I need to do a dungeon for a quest and can't find anyone quickly you bet your ass I'm gonna have them trek half way across the world to run me through real quick. 
---
Once we're all 60 we can jam together on stuff.
---
How?
---
It was. In a world suffused in magic, a creature's 'natural biology' can contain magic.
---
Yeah but still your CPU needs to be very strong. Laptops usually don't have strong CPU-s
---
Warlocks can summon whole raids of players in the tram tunnel without anyone noticing, I don't see how that makes it easier for Alliance.  Never in my life have I hear of Alliance players forming a formidable counter raid and walking down the million mile tram tunnel or jumping off the tram to fush out Horde pre, during, after, or between raids.  Though maybe you have idk.  Could just be my lack of Alliance experience showing.
---
On the other hand, I have been part of counter raids forming in the cleft of shadows and out front by the zeppelin tower for example.
---
Chill af leveling as a Paladin.
---
I really like this template
---
&gt; sempt
---
That's a rare one.
---
Imo you don't need an MMO mouse. I would get a logitech g502, has more than enough buttons, amazing quality and is great for FPS games as well. I've heard mixed things about Razer products.
---
You will not be able to get it as a main raiding fury warrior. Maybe a couple years down the road after your main tanks all have it.
---
&gt; You can't raid in BfA with 25 men without a gaming PC
---
Probably not a toaster now, yeah, but a ~4 year old mid-range gaming laptop (1060 was released in 2016) will run it just fine - you don't need a gaming PC.
---
Also, the minimum gpu specs for BfA are intel integrated video on haswell (2013) and above, so the game will "run" on something using that... though using minimum specs likely mean it will run shitty even with all settings turned completely down.
---
You don't need a gaming PC, but you are right that you should probably use something more advanced than a toaster.  I wasn't sure if you were taking issue with the "toaster" comment, or taking issue with my plan to pick up two gaming laptops.

I have never played a healing role in all my years of WoW. It has just never once appealed to me as a play style. But I've mostly spent my time playing classes that have healing capabilities (Paladin, Druid and Shaman). It's a huge problem for me as every single time I'm invited, I am invited on the presumption that I am a healer. I'm afraid to say I am one of those people that will stand my ground, even if it means I am ultimately removed from the group. I am joining as a DPS, and that is that.  
---
...this is also why up until the addition of PUG Raiding I pretty much just kept to PvPing and didn't do any endgame PvE stuff.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but badge gear wasn’t added until magister Terrance correct?
---
I’m pretty sure he means Warlock weapon. Shankar in main hand, firestone in offhand and become an unstoppable force of power!
---
My girlfriend of 2 years is completely used to my videogame binges by now.
---
I'm only subbed so I don't feel guilty about playing on p-word servers.
---
Although when 8.2 hits I may level another character using the new transmog changes.

Great Advice, I plan on somehow affording and acquiring all of GoT for my wife. She has been mentioning alot lately and we were only up to season 3 so there should be a bit to keep her occupied there on the lonely nights while im playing classic.
---
Oh, sorry. I don't know actually, I've only ever seen the meme format.
---
When wow was released i made fun with my Friends and used vis name backwards. It sounded voor and never had a problem claiming it
---
This looks horrible.
---
I was gonna make some snide comment about how no one here has an SO: we’re all turbo nerds. 
---
But then I realized that’d just be projecting, because I’m a turbo nerd, and I have no SO.
---
A lot of the appeal is the slower pace.  Finite raid progression is a positive in my mind--there's no rush, no obligation to log in every day for dailies or garrison missions or artifact power or whatever the gimmick of the month is.  Knowing I can step away from the game for a week and not feel *left behind* is a huge mental relief.
---
As others in this thread have mentioned, the lack of Quality-of-Life features like heavy sharding, Dungeon/Raid Finder, multiple hearthstones and portals everywhere, etc. encourages players to socialize.  You'll run into the same names over and over again.  Forming parties for dungeons takes effort, so if you want to be invited back you need to build relationships and perform well.  If you want to travel across the world, you have to talk to a mage or start walking.
---
I don’t think there will be a beta, 10 employees could be done with testing everything by now.
---
Step 1: Find a guild run by a female GM.
---
Step 2: Become an officer in that guild.
---
Step 3: The girls that the GM invites to the guild come to you for advice.
---
Probably because that's when summer ends.
---
Yeah, in the age of participation awards it'll feel good that my actions (or lack thereof) matter.
---
It's not even that Vanilla was uber meritocratic or anything, but it didn't hand stuff out willy nilly.
---
Say that to the Furlbolgs.
---
What do you want to see?
---
Things like this make classic less appealing to me knowing that yeah there's freedom to building your character but really, it's an illusion, at least that's what I'm hearing and have read about.
---
Have never played vanilla though so I do look forward to it.
---
what do you mean this summer?
---
Sword spec works with 2h swords. Checkmate atheists.
---
Look what they’ve done to my boy!

Ouch that last sentence hurts I want ironfoe and will be attempting to farm for it lol

Have any barrens, ashenvale or red ridge
---
Once you guys are satisfied with your mains (maybe that means everyone is 60, maybe the power guys are 60 and the others are having fun) create an alt group to run together.  Maybe set up rules like "ok, don't get these guys past level 32 before our run next week".
---
Never has anyone ever said an Alpha is supposed to be 14 days
---
Honestly, this is more my reaction when we invite a warrior to a 5 man and he says he's DPS.
---
[Skill with **Swords** and **Two-Handed** Swords increased by 5.](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=20597)
---
It's worded precisely, just like bow specialization.
---
At this stage I'm thinking healbot mostly. I experimented doing the melee thing on a private server but found it too clunky and annoying. Haven't had a chance to experiment whether switching to AoE grinding at the higher levels will work. Would be interesting to know if others have  and whether it worked well or not.
---
Were you subbed up until now...?
---
Just make level 20 warlock alts and suicide them over to a quiet spot in the enemy city with plenty of shards. That's how we approached the Archdruid in Darnassus. We didn't kill Tyrande because she's like the only good person left in the Alliance by the start of WoW (I was in a RP guild and most of us had played ROC and TFT.
---
As I recall, the Stormwind and Ironforge leaders are just tank-and-spank. Janina on Theramore Island was a pain in the ass to kill with the teleporting, but she dies fast.
---
While leveling it's no problem, at 60 it's doable. You won't be the best dps, and gear can be hard, but I think both elemental and Enhancement can work.
---
get her the books they are longer and MUCH better
---
I knew this thread would accidentally bring out the MGTOWs and sexists lmao
---
I just found this series but its so fucking good. Ive watched every single one today.
---
There are goblins in bwl that likely would be to blame. As to why I have no clue.
---
Enhancement Windfury is pretty funny to watch, but very RNG (and you need good gear). Elemental is mana intensive. PvP is a different story, but in PvE, you're expected to be Resto.
---
It will use a lot of data, for sure. Can't really say more than that personally though
---
Some of the upper teir dragons can take humanoid forms. 
---
I also think they had orc minions under their control, cause you know "something need doing?".
---
This isn't lore just spitballin.
---
Have you 40-boxed MC before? What's your setup?

This comment is to informative and helpful for this sub. You will probably get downvoted into oblivion for not posting a meme.

Castles in the Sky by Cascada
---
blhahahaha
---
haha I would agree with you there, But!! she hasn't really enjoyed reading much lately :( she still has a few books she bought and hasn't got around to reading so ill probably roll with the TV series as a safer if not more expensive option.
---
Ah, memories of grinding quillboar for a very angry man with a notoriously hard to find wife.
---
The ones you want to use the most
---
There are goblins in the following rooms with the dragon bosses that could have built them. Or all the orcs. The black dragon flight has a lot of followers. 
---
Also I think they are helping incubate eggs in that room? I remember a lot of whelps. Perhaps it’s to help them grow faster but it slows humanoids? Just guessing here.
---
There’s also the archbishop in Stormwind.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks such high ground clutter density is silly, the game wasn't designed for it to be cranked up this high.
---
Rexxar is kinda similar, Though I don't know how they compare in difficulty.
---
it's like 3/4 days played to 120 for an average player
---
You're correct. I'm pretty sure there are no long capes before lvl 25, perhaps even 30.
---
TIL shitload of grass = HD graphics
---
TBC was fantastic. The only bad part was that all time was spent in Outland, so the world effectively shrank. Maybe Shat'trath (sp?) just shouldn't have been a thing.
---
If you're interested in roleplaying as a fire-only mage, why do you feel your mage should be powerful enough to defeat Ragnaros, the Elemental Firelord, with fire?  Would it not be more logical that your fire mage would either need to leave that feat to other heroes or embrace the other half (frost) of his mage training?  Think of it as character-building.
---
If I'm reading you wrong and you aren't really interested in RP, then why are you so determined to use only fire?  There's nothing stopping you from casting frostbolt as a fire mage.
---
The one of the classes you're considering the most that feels right when you make your first character.
---
I have literally never heard of this until it was mention on this forum yesterday, and i assumed he was an anomaly.
---
Honestly, vanilla Shaman is nothing like retail, so I'd recommend it for the experience alone. If you want to see what a Hunter is like, play retail. In terms of gameplay, they still play similarly.
---
Vanilla played it smart by mostly relying on new story elements with occasional calls back to the older Warcraft games (and the same characters, Of course.) TBC is where things started getting sour, killing off tons of established characters or turning them into loot piñatas (poor Kael’thas). Once they burned out all the plot points set up in Warcraft 3, things got really bad. Cata was the first sign of this, Warlord’s time traveling orc nonsense was the pinnacle of how stupid it had gotten and it’s only gotten worse from there.
---
Gross
---
Actually nevermind on that. Something unexpected happened, can't help you.
---
If you pay the 15$ for HBO Go on almost any device the entire GoT is on demand
---
bokay
---
I HATE time travel. Screws you’re whole story automatically. Adds too
---
Many “what ifs”
---
I agree
---
Yep, vanilla wow
---
Well said
---
So lame. They should’ve used the broken Draenei. Draenei don’t trust the Orcs, so naturally go with the Alliance. They should have just called the space goats “eredar”
---
Thanks for the Tip Jankass, but because i live in Australia and our media laws are draconian, you cant get HBO here without a VPN/breaking the law, which is kinda lame.
---
Same... I logged in on free weekend to sell most of my retail-gold for wow tokens so I have some free Classic months 👍
---
I already mentioned how some crafted items won’t be in game until much later. That’s how the BIS changed not with stat changes to items considering how ALL ITEMS WILL BE IN THEIR FINAL VANILLA ITERATION like we were told. 
---
😐
---
Now, do you still want to be a condescending ass who didn’t understand why I asked my question even after I explained it earlier, and or do you want to continue being snotty?
---
Best part is that Warlord’s only contribution to the plot was setting up legion by adding the new Gul’dan (who then died almost immediately in a raid not long after the expac dropped). None of the allies we made on alternate Draenor carried over or mattered, and it’s effectively been buried in terms of actually mattering to anything.
---
This is how Im going to do. Ill have one character that keeps up with my wife and other characters with no such limit. 
---
During vanilla I had a lot of character groups from different combinations of friends. Life at 60 was a small part of vanilla for me. 😀
---
I’ve been unsubbed since 2007. Am I the only one who didn’t really like TBC?
---
The question is if a CL crit does more damage than instant LB with Natures Swiftness. Both can crit with 20% crit anyway. NS can also be used for a big heal or instant Ghost wolf.
---
EM is a lot of fun ofc but I will take NS anyday in pvp.
---
Yep. 
---
Either that or if they revert the guild changes that came with BFA.
---
WoW has a free trial.
---
It's the room where they spray the dragon babbies with lavender essential oil and weed vapor so they don't get too fiesty and light each other
---
NS is broken in 1v1... It’s basically a LoH every 3 minutes.
---
Good. They're focusing on the real sht before the less important stuff like foliage density.
---
unsubbed since the end of warlords
---
If you buy a higher rank of a pet ability it auto learns all of the lower ones.  That’s why it’s suggested to only buy the useful spells you need for Voidwalker while leveling and save the rest for when you have money to blow and buy the highest rank.
---
i think some of the managememt software can do that?
---
Yeah on my own private server. 2 paladins, 1 Druid, 1 warrior tank, 8 priests, 2 locks and 26 mages
---
ill wait to see if they remove any functionality from the beta client
---
I had a good time in Legion so I bought BFA since it LOOKED good. Holy shit is it bad. I was a shaman and being told my class would basically be broken for the entire expansion despite extensive shaman feedback given from Legion through BFA beta was enough to get me to quit and that wasn't even close to the only problem I had with BFA. 
---
The day I saw the Diablo Immortal BS at Blizzcon I unsubbed.
---
By "support", do you mean "carry their weight for them"?
---
Good PvP players will still be good. 
---
Dungeon is different. Everything just hits so much harder. Mistakes can lead to a easy wipe.
---
Also the essential oil helps prevent measles in the baby dragons.
---
Competitive? Not even slightly. You’ll be the last dps on the meters. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find a raid spot.
---
Release in September -&gt; all university students suddenly fail the semester
---
LMAO
---
Well actually a lot of DPS gear is great for TPS tanking and obv. even more viable in dungeons but fair enough.
---
I wonder where you heard that nonsense.
---
August-Sept for sure. Legion released Sept. 1st and BFA released mid-August. It has to be in that range, that seems to be when they release WoW stuff now. Although TBH I did see speculation online that it may be July 16th because of something to do with the BFA patch-cycle? Not sure.
---
Yeah I mean we have gnomes and goblins who build much weirder shit than choppers lol
---
Nah I saw people paste the wall of no that were also very critical of various things about Blizzard.
---
We're talking about a group whose sole mentality on this topic was to shit on people who wanted Classic.
---
Flame tongue weapon
---
More or less the same here except for WoD, I outright shunned it.
---
The OST which I randomly discovered recently is fantastic though
---
Was subbed from mid TBC-End of Wrath, Subbed again at end of WOD-Mid Legion. Will sub again for Classic but I won’t play retail.
---
Too used to seeing DK meaning death knight. Took me a solid 10 seconds to realize what you meant haha.
---
I played for a bit of it, but i never even made jt to a flying mount.  I loved some of the new zones (forest around shattrath and zangarmarsh especially), but I got so tired of more and more rep grind.
---
You do know that Chen was in WC3 right?
---
Make a set of alts that you only play from, for example, 5-8p on Sunday (whenever fits your schedules).
---
If that isnt their style, make a guild.  Invite people that you meet along the way who are your speed.  Then you'll have a nice distribution of lower and higher level characters, and everyone will have the freedom to help out (or not) when it is needed.
---
Otherwise, Discord.
---
This The exact 3 I had trouble with. Picked warrior as I want to pug my way through instances and haven't time to wait around for groups.
---
there is a classic community , i think its fair to say you can be a content creator for a game before it comes out
---
sure he cant play or show people the game but classic is based off a knkwn product vanilla wow so he can talk about classes and such at length.
---
this guy is also pretty careful not to talk about unofficial wow content an pretty much just talkes about blue posts.
---
I know im subbed to him mostly to stay up to date with blue posts, the phase implementation etc and things like this.
---
Looks like winterspring needs to shave.
---
You won't really be competitive however you do, so might as well do the hybrid. Improved Weapons Totems are very saught after and you can always just equip an off-set healing gear if you need to heal on a fight.
---
This conundrum has existed for as long as MMO’s have.  There really isn’t much you can do to prevent it.  What me and my friends typically do is just hangout in Discord and chat / joke around / ask each other questions while each of us is doing our own thing. And then we’ll help each other out if needed / we can.  Eventually we all hit max level and can play together more again.
---
I’ll add one thing I always found favorable for the expansions is that I spent way more time playing directly together with my friends as the level gap issue was far less of a probably when there is only ever a 5-10 level gap.
---
But Chen appeared in WC3 lol
---
Mobs that would flag you for pvp if you buffed/healed them had an actual faction crest next to their portrait. The tiragarde mobs in durotar did not, and as such did not flag you for pvp if you attacked them as horde, or buffed/healed them as alliance.
---
Same, but honestly it doesn't bother me like it did when I played vanilla
---
Haha, I love the phrase turbo nerd!
---
Play the game, not the patch 
---
Don't have your progress reset every 4 months
---
Wear your achievements because they actually mean something
---
Play an actual RPG where your spec is of actual importance , and your class actually define your role and not just how you look. 
---
The community because people you cross path with are actual people you will meet again and not someone that could be an AI and you wouldn't actually care more at all
---
Have the world be something you travel thru , venture in, and not somewhere you wait in before getting teleported to an instance.
---
This is a great idea! If she's anything like me though, she'll blow through the series in two weeks.
---
Mini map ≠ map
---
Pfft, I used to tank UBRS as a warrior with unstoppable force equipped. Vanilla was the shit.
---
This is terrible information.
---
Break up with her.
---
It's the only way.
---
Is this a butterfly?
---
(There, will this count?)
---
Well fuck me, I played a lock to 60 in Vanilla and never knew that. Or forgot. Thanks.
---
That's something I really like about Vanilla, regardless of what spec you invested into, you were first and foremost a Paladin. You have all the abilities and capabilities of your class, specs were more like "flavors". In fact, gear made much more an impact than spec. Of course, it's easier to heal dungeons as Holy because of some of the Mana conservation talents, but you can still do it regardless of your build.
---
mini what now?
---
This did make me laugh out loud though.
---
Like I always say, 39 people and a Ret Pally is every bit as good as 39 people.
---
Lots of jokes rely on racist stereotypes or misogynistic stereotypes for their comedy value. Irish jokes are only funny if you get that Irish people are meant to be stupid in these jokes, for example, and blonde jokes are only funny if you get that blonde people are meant to be promiscuous and stupid in the jokes.
---
"Nobody understands women ha ha" is a misogynistic trope. Women are just people. It's not as bad as some other tropes but it's definitely an attitude that trivialises women. And in this case that's all the joke is - "nobody understands women ha ha".
---
At least jokes about Irish submarines having screen doors are a little bit creative.
---
Leveling is the entire game for me.  Hit 60s, some BGs, then reroll on another faction or with a totally different class comp.
---
That and the endless circlejerk you can find on the reddit and on YouTube amount community.  The community aspect is for real and awesome.
---
Well homie, a girl doesn't have to play videogames just because I do. There are other interests in life besides WoW, maybe they share a bunch of other interests but WoW isn't one of them.
---
I don't think those people will leave indefinitely though. Some might. But with the subscriptions being bundled I think there will be a lot that bounce back and forth between them.
---
You can keep telling yourself things like that that but it's widely accepted that alliance premades are a nightmare to deal with, I'm glad you haven't experienced this yet but atleast now you know what's coming in Classic.
---
And that's coming from a guy who played Horde from vanilla to WotLK.
---
Mini map shows your immediate surroundings. Like a lantern in the dark.  A map shows the entire zone with the locations of entrances and exits as well as players location within the zone.
---
No mouse pad...?
---
I've heard all the attempts to justify it.
---
I'm pretty sure there will be, the amount of content that needs to be tested and the amount of small bugs that might not occur every time you test something require a bigger tester base
---
I'm playing Dark Age of Camelot on the Phoenix server until classic start.
---
Still raiding with the guildies. Was doing a lot of m+ before but got tired of even that at the moment, so pretty much taking a break and just raid logging.
---
The Mechano-Hog was perfectly fine, not that far from the engineering flying machine mounts in TBC, but some of them added after that got pretty ridiculous. The flying mech suit mounts and tank tread motorcycles are a bit too silly imo.
---
I actually let mine run out last week to give myself some room before Classic :) don’t want to burn out before I begin
---
Fucking lul!!!
---
I think the last time I played was when cata came out.
---
Same, hype!
---
God damn, I haven't seen that image in over 10 years! Thanks for that.
---
Haha yeah I'd totally be on the beach with hot women every day if not that darn classic wow
---
You could with an exploit that a bunch of people got banned for. It takes a few days to do it. But levelling through old expansion is not "content" any more, it's just a grind to get to the real game. Only reason Blizzard aren't boosting everyone to 110 is so they can earn money from everyone buying level boosts. From a game design perspective 110-120 is the whole game in BfA, nothing else matters.
---
Summer 2020.
---
I assume you're a bit, op.
---
I've learnt a few things about women. I don't want to generalise or offend and this is only my opinion, but one thing I've learnt is women often like commitment, routine and kindness. Throw some fun and sexy time into the mix and you're golden. So in terms of WOW. Stick to a routine, play at certain times on certain days. Up the fun and sexy time outside of those times. I don't see how that can go wrong. If she can be brought into the game to play together, then that's a winning formulae - I'd guess - never dated a girl long term who likes gaming.
---
Haha I expect my wife to do the same but two weeks of peace is better than no weeks of piece
---
Tell them to git gud
---
No one is really mentioning Druid. Entangling Roots doesn't have any diminishing returns, and so any melee elite can be easily solo'ed and you don't get touched.
---
Nice. How do you log in and load 40 accounts at once? What're your rough PC specs?
---
I gotta agree. Until you have zhc, talisman or a 2h with big top end and caster stats, NS seems more reliable. A guaranteed crit? Big deal. Guaranteeing a crit whencyoir trinket is active, much more impact.
---
Play 30/0/21 till geared, imo.
---
Lol this is so true. WoD was just an attempt to grab people by their Nostalgia. "Ooooh look! All these characters that died before WoW!"
---
All they really had to do was release Vanilla lol
---
I think so too. It would be a great opportunity to hype release if it wasn't out by then.
---
Not going to do this until 60, but this is a great guide. Thank you for sharing.
---
It's not really catfishing though, no-one thinks that having a female character makes you female.
---
Aye much in the same way I supported my blind arthritic dog in his later years, but I didn't bring him out to chase a ball in the park
---
Why is that?
---
Worst part about the draenei is that I'm pretty sure that, before BC, the eredar or dreadlords were evil before there was even such a thing as the Burning Legion. They were actually responsible for CORRUPTING Sargeras in the first place!
---
IIRC Metzen actually made a mea culpa post on the forums after the fact, saying that he "forgot" the eredar already had a place in the story, when he wrote the draenei's background lore. That was the mother of all retcons.
---
Here it is: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei_controversy
---
I think the chauffeur was an excellent idea to get out of the first 20 lvls fast, or what lvl mount is now a days. What I didn’t like: it totally ruined chopper for me
---
What about a Night Elf Mohawk?
---
Yea school brainwashes you into thinking summer is May through July. It’s fucked up
---
And Autism
---
Is it though? For me (and I enjoy single player hack&amp;slash games) it's stupidly easy until you get to m+ and heroic/mythic raiding. I think it's more like a clicker if anything. Just do absolutely mindless shit where your input only makes it go a bit faster and get upgrades that doesn't mean anything in the next few minutes/hours.
---
Because wasting time is super fun
---
You are an evil person.
---
Wait is it decided you and yours are all playing alliance? Awesome. I'll see you out there, look for the tauren 😉

A RL friend of mine who played vanilla with me all the way back in its beta told me the other day he doesn't know if he'll play classic, and we both still play to this day. We always went on and on about how much we missed it, and to a lesser extent BC. I probably shit myself during the awkward confusion aneurysm I had.
---
Didn't know about this, if it's true. Never been a huge TB fan, but I was never really opposed to him either.
---
I recently have come to realize the importance of forgiveness, how forgiveness makes people aspire to better themselves because there's room and understanding for inevitable mistakes and "sins".
---
This overly sensitive social media retribution culture is in my estimation extremely harmful. I'm not saying that there's isn't a place for criticism, but he should be remembered  for the good things he did. He contributed a lot with his content.
---
Amen
---
Yeah so you're right, procs per minute is the same regardless of weap speed. 
---
So if you have a 1.0 speed weapon (60 swings per minute)  at 7 procs per minute, that is 7 procs / 60 swings = 11.6% chance
---
3.0 speed weap =  20 swings per minute = 7 procs / 20 swings = 35% chance.  
---
However, the damage of SoC is dependent on weapon damage as well, so basically the *OVERALL* damage of SOC done over a long time frame will only really be based on DPS of the weapon.  In shorter fights there's more variability, so you might get very few procs (and thus much less damage) or get lucky with procs and get big damage. 
---
Now.  The reason I think in this instance a (somewhat) faster weap is better is because of the way vengeance works.  The faster your weapon, the more likely you are to have near 100% vengeance uptime because it can proc off of any weapon attack that crits.  If I were gearing a fresh level 60 Ret, and I had the choice, I would want a somewhat faster weap to start all things being equal.  Much later on, once you get well over 20% melee crit, a slower weap will pull ahead as long as you continue to have close to 100% uptime for your vengeance buff.  
---
The risk you run is that you don't crit with the slow weap, thus losing vengeance, thus hurting overall DPS by a lot. 
---
In PVP this is all different you just want the biggest, slowest 2h you can find because of the significant burst of SoC and the overall slim opportunities you have to get into melee and start whackin.
---
100% all of those were dudes irl
---
[starts building an ignore list]
---
The number of rogues and tanks I've had leave immediately after this boss is many. I prefer to watch them fall like peons if I get a sniff of their traitorous ways.
---
I'm ready for my subpar cloth set while healing as feral.
---
&gt; certain stats are simply more desirable for PvP than PvE like extra Stamina, less hit etc. so gear could have been delineated more creatively than by simply inventing a new stat
---
Solid point. I'll admit I really don't care *how* one manages to create that delineation so long as it's *there.* I felt resilience did the trick at the time, but I've no opposition to doing it some other way. Just so long as raiders can't come in and roflstomp my face because they're good at/put a lot of time into a completely different aspect of the game.
---
&gt; especially one that made bursting less viable
---
Personally, I always filed this firmly under "feature, not bug." Partially because I was only ever on the receiving end of said builds, but mostly because my interest in PvP is in a good fight. That can't happen if it the fight's over as soon as it's begun.
---
Still, "different strokes," and all that.
---
&gt; If you wanted to do high end raiding and PvP now you needed 2 sets of gear, way more play time etc.
---
I mained a druid through TBC. Half of my bank was effectively a wardrobe, and not a stylish one. The idea of someone else getting bothered over needing to maintain a whole second set of gear just makes me giggle.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. Just, y'know, subjective experience.
---
Because weapon skill affects glancing blows primarily and you dont get glancing blows on ranged attacks.  The +hit curve is super low on +skill.  Getting hit capped without the +skill is very easy as well
---
Currently on the longest break I've had since starting in 2004. Had plenty of short breaks between xpacs etc. I never made it to level cap on this current xpac before getting tired of it.
---
The beauty of this method is no one knows who dun it, usually;)
---
Now that I know this politely take this video down so nobody else will learn
---
Seeing all this posts... Im glad we plan to nolife classic together with my wife lol.
---
This is where I'm at... We have this giant world of Azeroth and the main zones don't even matter anymore since they were all meant for leveling to 60. That's a HUGE map for literally a completely forsaken part of the game. We're basically trained to just rush through to the end (or pay for a boost to skip it entirely.)
---
Dang it, I knew I was forgetting someone.
---
Yeah, the Alliance has much more of an all-star cast than the Horde does, as far as faction leaders go, even if half of them technically aren't official faction leaders.
---
I ain't mad, though. Just creates a target-rich environment for the Horde. &gt;:D
---
12-inch pianist still a good deal as long as he takes requests.
---
I had this issue hardcore when I first started playing at release... By the time I hit 40, I had like 68 gold. A kind guildy bailed me out.
---
Your flavor videos killed me!  Took me ages to rediscover the audio clip you used in the priest video.
---
“I’m going to wand you to death!!!!”
---
Thanks alot for all the helpful answers! This was my first ever reddit post/question, and i honestly did not expect to get so many insightful answers
---
Pro move, less friction.
---
My girlfriend has a part time job, she only works late shifts. I'll be able to go to the gym after work, put in a good two hours of vanilla and then get sex. Life is good.
---
&gt;9 times out of 10 the group just was WTF what happened.
---
This is a good reason for having a "Who Pulled?" addon installed. Then you know who to blacklist for costing the group repair money "for the luls".
---
You know that dragons can transform right... Like best dragon Chromie is transformed into a gnome.
---
Hey man I really appreciate this. I’m in my first ever relationship (have been for about three years now) so I don’t necessarily get excellent insight like this organically. Thanks a bunch.
---
&gt;  It seems like most people on this subreddit are just veteran speedrunners 
---
What
---
We’re min/maxing our relationship by playing together at launch.
---
same. BFA burned me the hell out
---
Maybe it keeps the larger male Drakes from eating the whelps. They likely see them as future competition.
---
You didn't answer my question.
---
Word.  It must suck choosing between hobbies and loved ones.  Let’s just live the “why not both?” dream.
---
True it’s honestly just an aesthetic thing.
---
It appears that the majority of the users on this subreddit are players who have played WoW for a long time and plan to play the game very quickly when it comes out.
---
what does this even mean
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were keeping the eggs in stasis. Nefarian is known for his experiments and genetic altering to make chromatic dragons.
---
Quit after first tier of Cata, which I believe was summer 2011. Never logged back in
---
Azure Silk set with that blue hoodie and Frozen Wrath pieces.
---
I gotta add that 30 damage to my frostbolt boys. You just dont get it!
---
That’s a big difference between old blizzard and new blizzard. 
---
D1-D2, warcraft until Cata and  Starcraft  all distance the story anD it’s happenings from  you, the player. 
---
In Diablo, you’re some random joe, who is just looking for glory, the story is diablo and the wanderer and the aftermath. In D3, you’re the main focal point of the plot—the nephalim. Without you humanity is doomed. In d2, they make it clear you’re one of many adventurers who’ve passed through. 
---
In Warcraft you were passive to the story and only participated in the operational side of war campaigns. Then wow happens and it isn’t 25 guys from &lt;Pals for Life&gt; who kill Illidan (well no one does...) it’s Maiv. The player doesn’t kill arthas, Bolvar fucks his ass. 
---
Then in Cata, we are interfacing directly with thrall, a guardian of the planet to be, (speaking of, shouldn’t he know about all these surprise islands and shit?) regarding the fate of the known world.
---
That was at least sort of believable I’m Vanilla and Bc. Only the best characters on your server were heading into Naxxramas and Sunwell. There was mystique to it. It feels completely artificial when you tell me the fate of Azeroth hangs by the success of my LFR group. 
---
When you make the millions of scrubs “heroes of the alliance” you completely devalue what that means. If Azeroth were real, Sylvanas wouldn’t be summoning any and all adventurers to travel to orgrimmar at once to meet with her regarding urgent matter of Horde national security. She’d dial up method, the 20 most badass pve raiders in Azeroth. She wouldn’t send the call out to joe thecscrub in dungeon blues, telling him he’s the only one who can save us...
---
With a lot more gear treadmill to go through that as soon as you reach near the top new patch new gear.
---
Regular Rockstar flavor is so gross.
---
I mean, if you really think about it, taking out Staghelm is almost doing the elves a favor. Dude's a dick. And not an especially competent one, from what I remember.
---
That would probably be enough to dissuade me from crossing his name off the list if it weren't for the fact he's still an elf. Thus, his fate is sealed.
---
Elves are for eating.
---
Gnomes are for punting.
---
The only good pointy ears is one with tusks.
---
Lok-tar ogar, brother! *For the Horde!*
---
Yeh, if you wanna spend your time doing that then fine. No more portals and food from Gandalfx anymore.
---
I never get this meme for classic as to get progress in game you need to have at least some form of sociability to form a group and join a guild.
---
It can be competitive for their level, as long as they're trying hard
---
That's like saying gold games in League can't be competitive because it's not pro level.
---
Ya mon
---
basically you just get a cat they do the most damage
---
Try dual streaming. Watch each other's progress. Otherwise, healthy discord chatter. Or the faster person can level an alt.
---
I think it was much earlier, however they upgraded the quality of the badge gear several times as content patches came out.
---
However I could be totally off on this, I didn't start TBC till a year or so in.
---
It’s even worse when the ret says they’ll heal but they want to roll on dps gear... it’s like hello, you’re healing you get healing gear. Save the dps gear for the dps. /s
---
Some of retail (the first twenty levels) is free. I would give that a try. Especially a goblin or worgen as their starts are pretty fun. Keep in mind that Classic is quite different. I do agree that in terms of getting into the game, overall Classic is better, but it’s not out yet and retail is, and the first twenty levels are free. So I’d say give a try to kinda dip your toes in.
---
Seeing as the WoW sub doesn't currently provide me with a product I enjoy, I'm unsubbed. Imagine that is true for quite a few of us.
---
That being said, I would love some CE type stuff being available for a 12month sub, or just a relaunch of the old CE.
---
Yep, take my laptop and sit outside in the sun.
---
It's not like we're playing a moba, lol. Nobody's going to get pissed off if you get the killing blow so go for it fam.
---
Played but just on private servers for 10 + years, bc + wotlk was waiting for a classic vanilia for 3 years ...
---
You can relax in stv? Ha!! Good luck with those. I’m always on my toes in there. Randomly turning around and seeing who’s behind me.
---
Lol.
---
Even if you don't have kids, lots of people have priorities other than video games that mean they can't play video games every afternoon!
---
Lots of people learned from their mistakes and don't want to throw away everything they have now. And of course it's understandable. It's like saying one drink isn't too bad to an ex-alcoholic.
---
"My hobbies and interests include auto attacking relentlessly and never casting blessing of freedom on the tank."  
---
-XxLeeroyxx
---
Cata wasn't anymore shit than the later expensions, it's just that the game radically changed in Cata
---
tbh, daily quests when they first came out really didnt bother me much, but with the onset of world quest it just ended up making them mandatory\*. like its ridiculous.
---
\*technically you can still get by with out doing them, i did this in legion, but it 100% gimps you as far as gearing and money goes.
---
(i legitmatly wpend long enough trying to figure out how to pluralize daily that it doesnt even look like a word anymore)
---
A bad meme is a bad meme.
---
&gt; Is this a good goal to set for myself in wow classic?
---
You'll have a better chance of getting the Scarab Lord mount
---
My first alt will be ret. Not once will I swap to healing. I'm rolling ret because I enjoy dpsing. People can play the game how they want. It shouldn't be expected of paladins to do things they don't want to so you can be happy. I'm not wasting half my inventory space on off spec gear.
---
If it's a female character just send them a whisper saying 'Hi - if girl, can I have ur instagram???', you should be sorted in no time.
---
how can u say tlk is better than TBC bro. Only the lore and gameplay was really good, they fucked up so hard in TBC
---
The aboslute worst thing about modern wow was getting to lv 60 then fast-forwarding onto some zeppelin having to relearn all of my abilities then getting caught in some endless action cutscene montage on some contient I don't give a fuck about alongside the dark lady.
---
"Hurry, young hero. The entire world revolves around you and this is now an action game!"
---
Like dude, let me roam around Silverpine Forest for a few hours and leave me alone.
---
It held the greatest feeling of satisfaction having grinded for something. I grinded 2 months for mats to build a Lionheart Helm. When I got the mats, I quickly realized nobody *had* the pattern for Lionheart Helm. So I had the Titanic Leggings built. I wore the shit out of them proudly. My guild recognized my commitment to getting geared for raiding at the same time, rather than simply expecting it like you'll find today.  
---
It's knowing there are only so many gear items for your class and spec, and going out and getting them. Each one is a mission. 
---
The balance of risk and reward was far greater. I remember thinking I was hot shit for getting a rare item at level 21 in SFK. I'd never even seen one before. 
---
Now people expect purples to start the expansion. 
---
Different time. Just felt different.
---
The fact a faithful recreation of Vanilla necessarily means DHKs is probably the primary reason I've never been fully on the side of the no changes crowd.
---
DHKs effectively ended city raids and had a dramatic damping effect on world PvP in general. I would be over the freaking moon if we could get Blizzard to remove them from Classic, at least on PvP servers.
---
Agreed.
---
\&gt;stances are hard to master in vanilla wow 
---
topest kek
---
I was so sad when they nerfed my ret pally. Went from tanking to failing at dps in one sad Sack expansion... F
---
I don't think I will cos I can only play maximum 65 hours a week.
---
Did a google search and I think your correct they were always around but we’re mostly relegated to Kara level gear until they added magisterw terrace. I guess that’s why I didn’t remember them being an issue until later when they quickly became a way for people like me who were in T4 to get upgrades. I didn’t really start to hate badge gear until it became the way to gear up vs doing raiding content.
---
No, it's not. People just want to enjoy the game without having to deal with unwanted advances imo. Tbh I don't know where the time and place to meet people romantically is these days but don't think it's in classic wow
---
Me and my wife, then gf strengthened our relationship and tempered our bond in the flames of Molten Core.
---
Good luck to you sir.
---
Western Plaugelaaaands
---
Don't group your mains. Make alts that you specifically level together. If people want to do their own thing, play more/less, do so on the main character, but keep those alts together for shared lols.
---
KEK
---
Anything with a raid buff ayyy lmao.
---
Oh no, the one shitty mage that everyone hates because he is a selfish dick won't make me food. If only mage was the second most popular class and there were tons of mages everywhere you look.
---
OH WAIT
---
It really says something about retail leveling currently when you are willing to risk the ban to avoid it.
---
Hi, /u/lazypeon-ru
---
Crap. Where else would we get portals and food from then?!
---
TL;DR you make and ultimatum - breakup or she is gold farming slave
---
^ this
---
DEMS IS SOME WEED HOMIE
---
im planning on cat cause they can stealth while youre shadowmelded
---
But of course he shouldn’t need to change. Others are selfish for not playing a spec/role they don’t like but somehow he isn’t for doing the same.
---
I played vanilla... not a veteran but I'll still own you noob.
---
Nah I'm just fucking with you. I work 330-12/130 and I consider it night shift. Iunno. Graveyard is the like 10-7 one
---
So could you... but you expect someone else to for reasons.
---
Been unsubbed since WoTlK. Other then a breif stint in MOP. Joined for a month. Wasn't liking it. Then they announced the next raid would be Org and, I would be forced by the world worst writing team to invade my own beloved Orgrimar. I Should have died on those walls. Defending my city. I could have lived with losing but, betrayal? Stand with the knife ears against the greatest war chief the horde has ever known? I think not.
---
Nefarian, before big daddy, was breeding hybrid chromatic dragons for his world conquest army. He ended up failing, creating only abominations like Chromaggus the chromatic puppy, where big daddy Neltharion succeeded by breeding nether drake hybrids, and ended up with Ultraxion the twilight dragon.  
---
    
---
The suppression room (halls of strife) was a hatchery much like the UBRS hatchery. However the UBRS version only had eggs laid by members of the black dragonflight, while the halls of strife had corrupt eggs from all the other ones (as evidenced by the Corrupted Blue, Bronze, Green and Red whelps).  
---
Also just like big daddy, Nefarian was assisted by a lot of goblins, they're most likely the ones who created the Suppression Devices, which were either a way to control the temperature/moisture the same way we in real life control terrariums, or the devices used to corrupt the eggs in the first place.  
---
Some nasty shit went down in that room.
---
Doubt.
---
Great advice. I’m getting married this summer and have already started talking to my wife to be about it a bit. Definitely planning around her rather than forcing her to plan around the game. I’d like to stay married to something other than WoW.
---
But then the screen glare makes it hard to see.
---
Then your definitely don't have the time for a woman.
---
Your ass?
---
We are a union us mages. If you disrespect one of us do not expect free handouts.
---
Had the same problem back in vanilla. What we did was we each had a character that we only played when everyone was online and would level together. Play on other toons if not everyone is there.
---
Buy a sun umbrella or get an anti-glare screen.
---
You couldn't just rush to 40 and have 100g by the end. You needed to supplement it somehow, be it tradeskills or AH work.
---
Now there are selfie sticks
---
I've done a solo Scholomance run in vanilla as hunter.
---
Old school troll ;)
---
Get a clue dude
---
It's hard to compare the two but think of osrs. Its the same sort of feeling at least for me.
---
Enchanting/tailoring
---
Weapon swapping will probably drop stacks. Given it did in 1.12.
---
this is marriage. you become a slave in exchange for sex.  
---
(watch this get crossposted somewhere)
---
We all do - then threads like these will be happily forgotten as we make brain-space for that one time we solo’d hogger
---
What now? Wife and GF. Alright for some.
---
owls are a meme
---
Sorry, I'm one of those strange people who enjoy having lots of alts. As such, I play both Horde and Alliance. And have perfectly good rhetoric demonstrating why each side is justified and best as well as why each side is abominable and should be destroyed.
---
And yes, from a totally logical point of view, the Orcs screwed themselves over. Why in hell should they be entitled to land in Azeroth? They destroyed their own world and started an unprovoked war which they then lost. Every fucking orc you see is the descendant of those losers. How should that give them the right to exist in Azeroth? In all reality, they should go extinct. They fucked up and honestly should all be dead.
---
But then again, the Humans aren't all that great either. Hell, the Dead Mines is a direct result of them screwing over VanCleef because they weren't willing to pay their debt. But then again, the work that VanCleef performed was because of the Orcs in the first place, so you might lay that issue at their feet as well.
---
I also tend to create full alt sets consisting of each race/gender combination and see about how I distribute the various classes among them. For instance
---
Alliance:
---
Male Night Elf - Druid
---
Female Night Elf - Hunter
---
Male Dwarf - Rogue
---
Female Dwarf - Priest
---
Male Gnome - Mage
---
Female Gnome - Warlock
---
Male Human - Warrior
---
Female Human - Paladin
---
Horde:
---
Male Tauren - Warrior
---
Female Tauren - Druid
---
Male Forsaken - Mage
---
Female Forsaken - Warlock
---
Male Orc - Rogue
---
Female Orc - Shaman
---
Male Troll - Hunter
---
Female Troll - Priest
---
It’s crazy how some of us actually turned out like this guy
---
Remember, when WoW first launched we were all newbies.  Consider yourself lucky, you're not going to be dropped in the middle of a game that's undergone system change after system change after massive gameplay change, you're going to play the original game that started the phenomenon in the first place.  I would suggest learning the basics from YouTube(trust me there's 100s of hours of content), decide on what faction you like, what class you like to play, and, like the rest of us, wait for release.  I think you'll be much better off waiting for classic and getting acclimated to that, as opposed to playing retail WoW in the meantime, and getting used to the quality of life and gameplay changes that have been implemented over 14 years and 7 expansions.  If you try to go to Classic after that, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Stay strong, traveler.  Good things come to those who wait!
---
I played Vanilla but was super young. I dabbled in a private server for a bit but found the experience uninteresting as the majority of the playerbase was 60 already.
---
yep, i unsubbed after getting my ulduar leggo
---
even then my interest was severely compromised
---
More cushion for the pushin’!!
---
You can have sex for the rest of your life. 2 hours a night is not going to cut it for the next two years.
---
Finally
---
You think it takes nine hours to learn and clear a whole raid?
---
I want engineering for the PvP advantages. What does enchanting have to offer me?
---
It's beautiful
---
As you wish.
---
*Plays in volcano*
---
I played back in the day, up through Cataclysm, where my subscription started being more sporadic. I was never hardcore - just played for fun with my buddies, exploring, reading all the quest text, getting super excited when we would find even the most useless of recipes. Good times.
---
I think you have a misunderstanding about which party is being disrespectful in this scenario.
---
excellent summary of what i cant stand about retail
---
i dont want to do your shitty cutscene riddled quests with paper thin plots and mary sues out the wazoo
---
i just want to farm runecloth
---
I am. Currently leveling and maxing out some lvl 20 characters on a starter edition. The hype is real!
---
Yikes
---
&gt;My GF (who eventually became and is now my wife)
---
they have a word for that, you know- wife.
---
Well the reason those people get banned is because they collude with the opposite faction in order to control these spawns.
---
This should always be a bannable offense.
---
I was gonna' say.
---
I've been unsubbed since '09. Does that count?
---
Personally I believe a little friendly tension can be wonderful for a relationship - especially if she’s got a competitive streak
---
Yawn. No one's arguing it should work with x-bows, just that it could be possible considering x-bow is obviously a type of bow (and no I don't want your 3,000 word treatise on medieval weapon classification).
---
Call me a moron but I’m gonna try a ghost wolf NS build and forego hardcasting LB/CL in favor of heals totems and shocks to fill my rotation. CL as an initiator in wpvp or with NS as a finisher. I love 1 sec GW too much and you have enough to do as an ele shaman that I don’t see hardcasting LB/CL even with uninterrupted cast time as necessary to win.
---
Yep. Same boat here. We regularly vacation in other parts of the country and watch TV in the bed or on the sofa, so having a laptop I can plop down with anywhere is key. Not to mention the vacations to various parts of the country because there's always going to be some downtime.
---
Did not work since something like 1.4... or earlier. Will not be able to do it in classic imho
---
disagree
---
my Breville 4 piece runs WoW just fine AND i get breakfast every time i enter Shattrath
---
For me it's because I already know it's solid and I can't wait to drop some time back into it.
---
My dream come true would be if they took the OSRS approach, but I doubt that would ever happen.
---
Played like a full time neckbeard through vanilla and TBC, stuck around during WOTLK but unsubbed after cata release.
---
I've done the private server stuff but that won't compare to the official blizzard release.
---
\#TakeMeHome
---
What YOU don't understand is that it was a joke.
---
If YOU removed YOUR head from YOUR ass you might get the joke. Probably not, but you might, in time.
---
why do wives consider it being "sociable" to stare at the TV in a vegetative state but if you do it to  pc screen its you who has the problem?
---
never got that
---
It really doesn't matter that much, but go pvp if you want engineering.
---
Maybe you just didn’t like my answer.
---
Some specific pets were nerfed before 1.12, like Lupos. The wide spread attack speed normalization came in 2.x sometime.
---
😂😂😂
---
Retail is a clusterfuck, and i think over time Classic will overtake it
---
people dont want the current product, as declining subs continually prove
---
and yet Activision somehow thinks they do, its weird
---
Classic being a roaring success could be good for all MMOs, not just wow, because it will demonstrate what the silent majority want
---
yep, whenever I see the gameplay of people from the demo or whatever and they switch to max graphics the foliage looks ridiculous.  there is no possible way there would be that much long grass etc over such heavily trafficked areas
---
I just resubbed. I was subbed at the start of BFA, leveled the Demon Hunter as I didn't level any OP classes when they were released. I didn't level DK during wotlk. I didn't level a panda monk during pandaland. I didn't level a DH during legion. Felt I had missed out on every OP class so went DH and loved it. So much utility. I did all the dungeons on heroic/mythic, the first raid, close to maxed my gear, and did heroic raid. Loved it but didn't feel like keeping up with the grind when in a few months every time you get new gear from the next source so I stayed unsubbed until now. With classic coming out I am challenging myself to try to complete the mythic raid as mythic raids are a pretty high skill floor so it won't be the easiest thing to do.
---
Legion was awesome.
---
BfA isn't fun. There's stuff to do, and there are sometimes rewards to earn, but honestly, I have more fun at work dicking around with spreadsheets than I do playing the 120 content.
---
If you want to get crass about it: &gt;!BfA is like a handjob. If that's all you've ever known, you're fine. But if you've had better, a handjob will never suffice.!&lt;
---
I can't wait!
---
What about a boyfriend Then?
---
I agree.
---
That would imply some effort on Blizzard's part.
---
Unsubbed in December.
---
He said tailoring
---
If you define best as the combination of powerful buffs/throughput/efficiency/pvp support than pally is it for sure.  
---
Just like if you're talking best dps it's clearly warrior once you factor in  cleave damage, single target, fear breaks, powerful cooldowns, mobility.  
---
Note that doesn't mean they're always the best, or that others don't bring plenty of other advantages, it just means overall it's easy to see which has the most consistent strengths.
---
Don't worry we're not getting classic this summer.
---
That happened more often than it should, especially on P-servers.
---
The hilarious thing is that it's often done by Hybrids who could potentially be healer, but they don't want to yet they expect you to do it despite saying that you are in it as a DPS.
---
The correct answer is tailoring/engineering
---
Months? According to my friend from WI y'all get about 4 weeks of decent weather up there between ice murder and heatstroke.
---
...rather like UT in that respect, now I think about it. No wonder she settled here.
---
Oh right, damn I am old school!
---
Change their entire character?? You don't have to respec to heal dungeons though, you can do it as Prot or Ret, just slap on some +healing, int, spirit gear and it's fine.
---
The memes keep getting better
---
I knew a guy would’ve once said women do too...
---
...he’s got 6 kids from 5 women now
---
Lots of /woosh going on in this thread
---
yeah people seem genuinely unhappy about it. I played Legion for a while and then took a break. All this vanilla hype has me jonesin, but I don't want to blow my wad (since we are doing backseat references).
---
This is such a brilliant idea. Many kudos to you. Is their any other spots you'd recommend parking a lvl 1 alt at?
---
Yup. 100% refuse to sub until that client is available for download!
---
I would take all this with a grain of salt.  
---
People are planning to "nolife" the game for a certain amount of time.  Some on this sub.  But most are not speedrunners.
---
Ill be dropping more videos soon on that exact topic so stay tuned.
---
But yes there are many other vendors with very lucrative items ;)
---
Hi Ion
---
I’ve tried all expacs except for Mists and never last more than a couple months while chasing that vanilla high.
---
As a goal? No. But it's possible. My cousin met her now husband in wow.
---
I unsubbed within about a month of TBC being released so...  12 years since I was last subbed.
---
Like you wouldn't believe. Mario Kart gets pretty heated haha.
---
Probably not. Discrete realms no longer really exist in BFA. Basically every world zone, and raids and dungeons etc all are instances shared by many different realms across the world. Basically you have a massive clusterFK of sharding/phasing/CRZ/cloud technology that sounds awesome to engineers and investors but makes for a garbage play experience.    
---
Classic is going to be a completely different server  setup. It has absolutely no CRZ or phasing, just sharding limited to low level zones.  
---
Obviously it doesn't exist yet so we don't know 100%, but it seems a pretty dumb to think to be worried about at this stage given what we know.
---
Thematically, maybe, but Rexxar is off wandering a road in the middle of nowhere. Jaina's smack in the middle of Theramore.
---
He might be a prestige target for lore junkies, but even if he's a difficult kill there's no real comparison.
---
Well, unless you want to crack a joke about his isolation simply being another back door to a Horde leader.
---
According to [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bcu5qe/updated_census_survey_explorer/), you're right about the appropriate question.
---
5,362 currently subbed, 14,298 currently unsubbed (72.7%).
---
If you play enough on those cheap pseudo wood desks they get so slick you dont need a mouse pad at all
---
Yeah I’m looking forward to release. I work from home some and can get right on after I am finished. I need to keep active and mentally in shape for the grind. My first toon (NE warrior) took me many extra days to hit 60, as this was my first MMO and didn’t have good people to level with who I knew. I’m hoping to efficiently grind to 60 as quick as possible as a human paladin. Can’t wait!
---
I started late bc and dropped the game before the end of wotlk, picked it up again in mop and bfa just to drop immediately in both expansions. I still feel like vanilla is my home. Explanation follows in boring story time:
---
I never played vanilla, but still remember the questing experience pre cata and without heirlooms (even though there was a 2x xp multiplier I believe).   After my guild broke up in wotlk, I took a time out. Later on I started new characters in both mop and bfa. my personal problem in mop/bfa retail was: being a noobie without old time friends, I actually NEVER interacted with anyone socially (I mean actually talking to someone) while leveling. Not once! I felt like an social outcast. At max level, I tried to get to know anyone while doing dungeons via groupfinder, but it did not work out at all. The only time anyone wrote in /p chat was when something went wrong and they started blaming each other/calling each other out. After i tried a private server once, I never went back to retail. I really enjoy the social aspect of pservers; people engage with you and you help each other out, it is so much more satisfying. My whole faction feels like my /g chat back then, and it reminds me of the good times I had when I first started playing and leveling through the "old world". You can say even though I never played vanilla, it feels more like home than any later iteration of wow I played
---
My girl friend doesn’t mind me playing games now that I have a new monitor setup in our living room, she’s a good sport
---
Lupos will likely be fixed.  
---
The attack speed for Brokentooth etc should remain different
---
Deso is one of the best zones imo - so long as you skip the rep grind.
---
For sure, making friends and having adventures is what made wow classic. No life power leveling was just the first step. Alts for days.
---
Maybe I am wrong but you really don't seem like the type of player that reads all the quest dialogue and gets into the lore behind the quests. If you actually invest yourself into what's going on then the singleplayer experience becomes much stronger I feel.
---
The 30 second cool down was a “huge boon?” You realize that a boon is akin to the word blessing right?
---
 Thank you for clearing that up, guess we will see. Can't wait to play !
---
Not my field of expertise
---
There are also 2 fish which are seasonal: Raw Summer Bass and Winter Squid :)
---
Started in 05, first time i I subbed was a few months after Dragon Soul in Cata. That raid is just sooooo dogshit, I probably would’ve stayed subbed if it was a different raid, but Dragon Soul helped me realize just how out of touch Blizzard was. 
---
From there I played MoP on and off, Unsubbed twice, played WoD for a month, very quickly unsubbed. Tried the tanaan jungle patch cause I wanted to see old hellfire... that was a shitshow, so I unsuccessfully again. Then I played 2 separate times in Legion, a month or two each.
---
I can’t wait to funnel my wallet into Bobby Kotick’s account for more than a month at a time, for the first time since Cata.
---
I’m literally thinking about saving all my friends first names.
---
You can even level pretty decently until 40 as holy if your spec'd into smite/holy fire and still have spirit tap and improved wanding. Check out this guide written by LiterallyMrRogers

You're describing a *bad* marriage.
---
Eh... I'd put him on par with Hamuul Runetotem in Thunder Bluff. You can make an argument for including them, but the fact neither existed before WoW nor have any significance in the lore makes 'em more like bonus targets. Grab 'em if you can, sure, but no one's going to judge you if you don't.
---
Its unlikely the guys who are writing the code that makes the 1.12 databases agree with 7.3.5 client are the same ones manipulating the values of light reflection and going in and manipulating Westfall light poles. 
---
Call it what you want, but they have more than one person working on this, and given human work methods since the industrial revolution, Id wager to bet the specific employees are specialized in what they do and dont jump to wildly different tasks hour to hour day to day.
---
Right. That's how you most appreciate the zones.
---
Farming runecloth in Western Plaguelands while looking around: "Gee, this place was probably a cool place to live before the plague."
---
I've played every expansion, but BFA was just so un-fun to play I unsubbed until classic
---
This is blizzlike. It's always worked like this. In cata I used to stack on use spirit trinkets for insane periods of regen you would drink an intellect potion + pop divine plea ontop of on use trinket and since your spirit and cd scaled directly with how big your mana pool was when the potion fell off you would have gained like 50% mana in 10 seconds. Also resto shaman mana tide would buff your spirit/druid innervate so you could time your on use for maximum gains. Spirit is a super underrated stat and I miss healer mana mattering :(
---
You dont go into a videogame looking for a girlfriend.   
---
Go outside instead, meet someone, and get them to play is a much bigger chance.
---
Are there any ways to increase stun resistance other than being an Orc?
---
Any weapons, armor, consumables, gadgets or something?
---
You clearly never played a shockadin and felt like a god in bg’s. In its heyday you could do legendary healing AND kill a motherfucker every 30 seconds or so. It made playing a healer way more cool.
---
Where the queen is shenna? :P
---
Good idea. I’m also going to play a tauren Hunter called nightchief.
---
The end of WotLK was a goddamn paradise compared to BfA.
---
Ah, the Depression/Opression room. Can’t wait to spend waaay too much time trying to get through there in Classic, only for somebody’s pet to run and attacking a dragon spawn right near the boss, and then doing the whole run over again.
---
Hey, I only ever played retail since about 2 years ago. Vanilla seems like everything I've wanted from an MMORPG :) Hope to learn the game as I go, will be looking for a guild of noobs who wouldn't spoil the fun of finding things out!
---
Great story! Every once in a while between all the elitism and toxic players, some genuine generosity can really make this a terrific game. 
---
I knew a guy who after healing him in DM, praised me for keeping him alive through a rubbish group and getting the instance done in a reasonable time. He bought me a set of the spider silk boots as a thank you and would then bring me to other dungeons with his guild as we levelled. Turned out his main and guildies belonged one on the best guilds on the server.
---
Sitting forces crits, which triggers reckoning.
---
Can you give me or link to a good explanation of why people are so opposed to panda people? You have all the other fantasy shit in this universe but you draw the line at talking pandas, why? The most common thing I hear is "they were originally a joke easter egg" but I don't see why that matters. They were originally a joke and they saw potential so they turned it into something, where's the problem?
---
Definitely false. If you speedrun the fuck out of the game, perfectly plan out your path, use enchants and heirlooms, never sidequest, never explore, and only do whatever offers the most experience, I'd say it's POSSIBLE to do it in about 24-36 hours /played. The current record for 1-120 is about 22.5 hours, and again these are people who do nothing for nearly an entire day, just grind out level after level and never experience the game.
---
Made this from Platinum WoW's fantastic video here while I wait for the next crumb of information from Blizzard.

I’ve been married to the love of my life for 12 years now after having progressively raided with the woman for the entirety of vanilla wow. We sold out decked out Warrior (her) and Rogue (me) pre BC to the tune of 7 grand for the two accounts and have lived happily ever after? What the heck do you mean what now?
---
If you're planning on going engineering go mining/skinning while leveling I think.  Sell most ores but if you find stuff that isn't selling use it to level engineering when you switch.
---
Mom?
---
Your best bet is a cat with at least a 1.4 attack speed. 
---
This gives you solid dps and later when you train frenzy increases the crit proc rate. It also helps increase interruptions to spell casting. 
---
Plan a programme to keep the following training:
---
Stamina
---
Armor
---
Growl 
---
Level 1 resistances
---
Tame animals for the following:
---
Claw 2
---
Bite 2 or 3
---
Claw 4
---
Bite 4
---
You can skip Dash and Prowl as these are more useful for pvp
---
Bestial Swiftness talent substitutes for Dash
---
Not me personally but I do know one couple who met via WoW.
---
Haven’t subbed since TBC. I’m ready
---
Warlocks can use succubus sap. Just as effective as mage sheep. Only downside is you lose a small amount of damage. Still totally viable.
---
I use a 4 letter name.
---
The server I roll on is greatly dependent on being able to get my name. 
---
One of the things I loved about the early days were all the 3,4 and 5 letter names. its a pain in the ass to
---
 /w toilëtmæster
---
Needing to only put in /w Jon or /w life (dank druid name btw) is cool and slick. 
---
A short name, with no title and a single word guild tag is a cool aesthetic.
---
Same goes for Warriors.  My favorite is this scenario:
---
Group looking for 3 more, need a tank and some dps.  
---
You: "I can do either."
---
*Accept invite
---
Group leader: "LF2M, need dps!"
---
A.  I like to DPS occasionally too while leveling up.  Fuck me, right?
---
B.  We're now limiting our options.  What if there was a tank out there who wants to come and tank the instance?  Fuck me, right?
---
Facts arent sexist lol
---
I like the simplicity. Level up, gear up from dungeons, raid. No Azeroth to farm, island expeditions to afk in, warfronts to afk in
---
This image is edited to make it look more like WoW, so it's not exactly the same situation. I don't know whether that's the reason this one was not removed though (or whether the mods even know it's an edit).
---
Thrall's Balls, this is exactly it. Blizzard focused on the two extremes, completely forgetting the bulk of players who fall between. I'm disappointed how Legion was a step forward, and BFA was 2 giant leaps back.
---
Been unsubbed for 2 years waiting...
---
&gt; it's an illusion, at least that's what I'm hearing and have read about.
---
Mostly a meme at this point, there's a lot of elitests who will shout from the rooftops how hard it is and how you need to be the "ONE SPEC" for you class, it's mostly an illusion.
---
If you aren't pushing world 1st, it won't really matter.
---
(With that said, Ret is a total joke)
---
Please people were complaining since wotlk.
---
Trying to get to (razorfen?) as a level 30 alli party was always fun.
---
The real 200 IQ play is to have a relationship with your PC.
---
This. Except his druid will have Feral Instinct instead of Master of Deception. FI and MoD both give 3/6/9/12/15 where 5 is equal to 1 level.  
---
To add onto this, Perception (the human racial) gives the player +50 to detection, meaning the game will treat your character like it's level 70 in terms of stealth detection. Catseye elixirs are worth +10 to detection and the catseye goggles are worth +18, so with all of those you can get the game to treat you like you're level 75½   
---
So for PvP, that 1 stealth level will be effective against mobs and normal people, but its not gonna do much if anything against a human with perception. However, combining the cloak enchant (+5) and Naxx boots or Darkmantle Boots (both +8), you can become extremely hard to detect :p

Hola, I'm Mab.

I've been playing WoW on and off since the Summer of '05. It's been a hugely important facet of my life every step of the way and would really like to focus exclusively on Classic when it re-arrives to get a dose of that good ol' community I was so fond of back then. I've been a warrior since day 1 of my career and MT'd everything up to and including some Naxx as well as most of TBC. I've furied for at least 75% of my total career so I'm versed in DPS. I've also resto shamaned LFR for two WHOLE LFRs in MoP and cat durided in the latter half of Legion (4 fite!). I achieved 30/36 Legion Mage Tower appearances and some of those fights can be really difficult at recommended ilvl (read: Kruul) so I can learn anything well enough to be effective. I plan to hit Classic pretty hard and stay at it consistently until I finish unsettled business in Naxx but that's not to say I'm not comfortable teaching or bringing along less-experienced folks - as such, I'm primarily looking for a medium-ish guild (not casual but not hardcore (I'd like to get it done after all)).  
---
**Intended Region:** NA or EU (makes no difference to me but English is my only language)
---
**Intended Server Type:** Normal/PVE
---
**Intended Faction:** Prefer \[A\] but \[H\] is fine - I just want to find a fitting community
---
**Intended raid/play times:** 6PM - 12 PM any night(s) except Friday (GMT-4 (Eastern U.S.))
---
**Priorities:** Raiding; PVP; strong community; tall order but I'd like to MT (Warr) unless \[H\] in which case I might Sham instead of Warr
---
**Rules:** Don't message me unless Classic will be the primary focus of the leadership of your guild
---
**Contact:** PM here
---
I really hope the nolifes are a minority. I want (# of players)/(number of lives) to be at least 5. I want an authentic experience where not everyone knows what they're doing.

Not just any earth elemental, the one and only Princess Theradras of Maraudon fame.

Sure as shit not posting it before I have it.
---
Welcome to the club
---
There are many factors to consider.
---
First the most obvious, what's the max computing capability? As in is it an i3, i5, or i7?   
---
Then, is it the mobile version? 
---
Then, what's the cooling situation like?   
---
A slim laptop will be downclocking on high loads because it can't transport enough heat.   
---
A slim laptop will struggle even harder when both the CPU and the iGPU is being maxed. That means the *entire* die is being engaged and is generating heat. They are literally the same component. 
---
Then, you have to consider the build quality of the laptop in general. Did they use a good thermal paste? What's the heat transfer like relative to its size?
---
Safe to say navigating the laptop market is a nightmare.
---
To make matters worse with some manufacturers you even need to wipe everything and go with barebones Windows because the manufacturer felt it a good idea to "boost" the fuck out of your computer: installing non-working antivirus (which is ALL of them) and adding super-special performance enhancers (read: performance REDUCTION to save power.)
---
It's not just the strength of the CPU. If only it were that easy.
---
Played through vanilla (full clear), tbc (full clear), wrath (full clear), cata (left after first raid tier, bored), MoP (came in for first two tiers, then left, then came back for final tier), WoD (came in for last tier only then left),  legion (full clear then stopped, liked a lot of it but disliked insane RNG shift and stupid fucking weapon), BFA (Never played), -&gt; Classic (YASSSS)
---
You forgot Ironforge...
---
Where you have to run through the ENTIRE FUCKING ENEMY FACTION to reach the faction leader. (Because you have to run by the AH to get to the faction leader the quickest way, or at least you'll be in full field of vision of anyone near the AH when you walk into the god damn city)
---
Aiming to level in 5-8 days isnt speed running. WR is under 4 now, I believe. 
---
5-8 days is just being 'good' at the game.
---
Once BGs come out, hitting R8 is really not a tall task. R10 is fairly consistent and anything beyond is just nutty. 
---
Naxx and AQ will requirean element of no life with all the out of raid stuff. But getting BWL gear over the course of 2 years is completely plausible. 
---
Min maxing raid comp, spending 18 hours a day farming prebis, and camping flightpaths are "speedrunner" type activities. 
---
All that said, if you are on a subreddit for a legacy game prior to even the release date of the game being announced, its highly unlikely youre are complete newb to the series/game.
---
\&gt; If you could change that at any point mid raid it would make choices far less meaningful. 
---
JUST ADD A CD SO YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE SPEC ONCE EVERY 3 HOURS
---
YOUR ARGUMENT IS NOW INVALID

After WoD I swore I wasn't giving Blizzard another penny until they released Vanilla servers, and that's what I've done.
---
It's just Mr. T
---
sure, since 2007 (whenever TBC beta came out and vanilla was ruined)
---
Bitches ain’t shit.
---
Honestly, I'm a bit surprised that this has worked for you so well on P-server launches. These recipes have a relatively fast respawn rate.
---
&gt; Got a vasectomy to reduce the chance of unplanned parasites.
---
I laughed.
---
I'm sure they were, but wrath is still widely considered the best expansion by many.
---
Yeah, when all you do is tank and heal dungeons while DPS mindlessly DPS, the last thing you wanna do is heal or tank another dungeon when you finally got a coveted DPS slot.
---
Boohoo you been waiting over an hour for a proper tank or healer.  Go roll one yourself instead of trying to peer pressure someone else into doing it and then looking down on them for refusing you.  That's the price you pay for being a DPS, you're just contributing to the problem while bitching about it.
---
That's not how it works though. Notch says really sexist and homophobic stuff on twitter, doesn't get invited to minecraft anniversary thing and is pretty much getting deleted from the history of it. 
---
People change, sure. But did TB change because he realized the things he was saying was shitty or did he change because he willed "ass cancer" on himself from wishing it on multiple other people? Like, Bill Cosby contributed a lot with his content, but he's still a rapist. 
---
Stop excusing shitty behavior because someone died. It sucks, but let's not pretend the guy was a saint. If a random nobody was wishing people who disagreed with him got cancer, people would, rightfully, call him an asshole and ruin any rep he had or was wanting to have.
---
Nah, it’s okay, you don’t come off as condescending. So, for me, it’s a return to an mmorpg game with so many elements I love. The world is dangerous, killing a single orange mob is exhausting, let alone two. The world is also massive, it feels like you’re actually in another world. I DID love BC and Wrath, but that’s one aspect that’s way better in Vanilla.
---
It’s not necessarily just the content. It’s the way the game is structured. The modern game does not resemble either mmo or rpg, in my opinion. Any socializing is a lot harder to do. Whereas in a Vanilla, the game encourages you to socialize. 
---
Have you ever done a LFD dungeon and seen nobody talk? That doesn’t happen in Vanilla. You already talk a bit while you make your way there, and then the real dungeon starts. You have to figure out CC, what specs people are, their skill level. 
---
Something as simple as a patrol, or a broken CC can wipe you. It’s not like 5-mans are *hard* compared to Mythic+20, but they’re engaging, challenging, and it feels like RPG wholesomeness.
---
Trash people with Trash loot tables.

---
They drop like 16 different types of food and water, ranging from level 5 to 25. It is a pain in the ass to farm them.
---
All three of those are going to be really overplayed imo. I'd go with the holy pala.
---
Uldaman
---
you actually can, since we're looking at a mid-late september release at this point.
---
enjoy your last summer, folks.
---
That's the absolute funniest thing to me too. It's ALWAYS some fucking DPS player yelling at the Paladin to Tank/Heal the dungeon.
---
Its more so the fact that with a 10k population 2-3 months into a servers lifecycle the items are 99% sold out so obtaining them early was an easy way to bank in on the scarcity. 
---
Depending what blizz does for population cap, it could hurt this method quite a bit
---
Not neccesarily. The reason why memes are so popular here is because there are no discussions that haven't been had before. People like memes because they offer something of original value rather than a recycled discussion that already got talked about to death. When someone posts a genuine text thread, people like it. If it's a question about what we're gonna get after Naxx, it gets disliked. That simple.
---
Than its gonna take you about a year or two to hit lv 60 lol
---
Actual end-game raiding is the hardest it has ever been. 
---
But aside from that, it's face roll. Leveling is boring, theres hardly any social interaction anymore because there's no server community thanks to sharding. LFD/LFR play a role in that too.
---
You'll have some great rested xp!
---
In 2005 I was desperately grinding Darnassus rep on my human to get a swift white cat, but I didn't make it before the mounts were updated.  
---
Here's hoping we get a second chance!
---
Well they just announce there will be a beta this summer
---
The whelps and eggs in BWL were stolen from the other dragon flights. They were used as a source of genetic material and as test subjects for Nefarian’s efforts to create a Chromatic Dragonflight with all the powers of the other flights. Dragons have consciousness and free will and are quite powerful compared to a regular laboratory animal, and these definitely did not want to be in this lab. The suppression room was built by the goblins to contain and pacify the dragon whelps, to prevent them from escaping or resisting.
---
The suppression room is a cage for the whelps.
---
They announced classic beta will be this summer
---
Already though
---
So that debuked
---
I just wanted to say, I appreciate you making this thread. I hope you give the game a shot (it might take an hour to sink it’s teeth in you, but it will) and it was fun reading people’s responses here.
---
It doesn’t? 
---
*walks away from gaming completely*
---
1.9 normalized everything except the attack speed (as that had no impact on actual dps
---
(aside from some very specific solo farm bm specs with 1.0 or 1.2 attack speed pets as it allows them to save more than just the usual 2 points in frenzy))
---
So no shadow damage on the infamous Lupos
---
no baseline faster runspeed than 200 % mount runspeed on  and AV wolves or Bangalash
---
no inherit higher base AP on Rak'Shiri
---
no massive base stamina on Ursius
---
no immunities or baseline high resistances (famous example were the flying chickens (Wind Serpents) from the sunken temple)
---
no inherit crazy high base armor values on Ironback
---
So for general PvE it makes little difference which pet you grab. For PvP the faster attack speeds are still more desirable for caster pushback
---
Let me know when you give it so I can decide if I like it or not.
---
No, but I know at least two long-term couples who met online in my guild.  
---
I met my last gf offline, because we both played wow, and we ended up re-rolling to play together. &lt;3

I actually just got back into wow and having fun

Content creators like Platinum WoW help ease the withdrawal I’m having until Classic is out. I wonder how his colon is doing though, after all that paper he’s eaten.

---
Hahahahaha that never happens...
---
*pours another orange juiceless screwdriver*
---
&gt; you can like that
---
This is a true statement. Its not the content that should be in an MMO tho
---
Nope from personal experience. I've healed warriors, paladins, and druids in quite a few dungeons all the way up to 60. You can certainly wipe here or there, but with CC and some ok awareness there isn't really anything thats going to be impossible or even very hard.
---
If the rogue vanished and peaces out without a repair bill, I think the jokes on you :)
---
Rogues may be overplayed but they sure are fun. (After the first 20 levels)
---
Must be hard there's not a lot of open space in there to kite
---
This is true, so you’re just hoping on people paying for the convenience factor? Because if you estimate that ~20 of these will be sold a day about 1 week post launch, 2-3 months into the server could mean that a lot of people own the recipe and I’m not sure what the price of the actual items would be at that point. My guess is that they would be decently competitive.

It’s  really hard to say “best”. Priests are far less efficient, but have the oh-shit potential to really save people in a bad situation. Pally healers can go forever, but what’s the point when half your dps is dead? 
---
I’d say pallies are arguably better, since I’d rather have more pallies than priests in a raid. If I had 7 healers, I’d have a Druid, 2 priests, and 4 paladins.
---
And Blizzard will know how many accounts play BfA, how many play Classic, and how much overlap there is.
---
It doesnt matter that your sub of $15 gets "both games". You dont have to play both, and I can assure you Blizzard will know which ones you play.
---
Many semi-hardcore guilds clear Mythic before the next tier with 9 hours a week of raiding.
---
Outside of raid, these semi-hardcore guilds will typically require you do your weekly Mythic 10 dungeon and your weekly AP quest for Island Expeditions.
---
* Mythic 10 - 1 Hour (and that's generous, most people do it in 20-30 minutes)
---
* Island Expedition Weekly - 1 Hour
---
That's 11 hours a week of required gameplay.
---
Let's say content is new. People will watch a video guide of the boss for Heroic and for Mythic, these videos are never more than 30 minutes long each. Lets say the average raid tier is 10 bosses, so 10 hours of video guides.
---
So the requirement to get cutting edge at an acceptable pace and to pull your own weight requires **11 hours of gameplay a week**, and **10 hours of research on boss fights when a new raid tier opens up**.
---
When a new expansion comes out, people will play regardless if it's required because everything is new and exciting, so I'm not going to bother coming up with napkin math for that.
---
11 hours of week, with 10 hours of extra work every 6 months is no where close to a full-time job, let alone a 20 hour part-time job.
---
Spent a lot of time raiding in vanilla. Was my wife's pocket healer for her rogue/hunter, pvp'd alot in AV on my lock, and in WSG on my rogue. But, by the time WOW launched I had already graduated college.
---
Warriors don't have a healing spell is that a bad reason?
---
Warriors and Paladins
---
I know for a fact, you will not loose money doing this farm. People are so lazy that at the very least even in all the worst possible scenarios, youll make your money back.
---
Depending on your server/economy their may be times when you camp everlook all day and cant get a recipie due to bots missing item spawn times etc. I have seen these recipies go for 30x what they vendor for. This is on 10k superserver though. We have no idea what blizz is going to do in regards to item spawn times etc. Dont know how much i trust pserver data
---
The old forum look too, man. Why did we grow up?
---
I think he read your post thinking your wife and your gf were 2 different people
---
Same here. I will be going priest, shadow spec to level until possibly around 55, then BRD/ST dungeon runs to max probably as holy.
---
Great story! This is exactly what I was hoping to hear because my experience with bfa is exactly what you said. I had trouble finding people to play with. Back when I played in vanilla (I was about 9 or 10) it was incredibly easy to find people. People were lining up to help newbies and I paid it forward when I got decently far. I'm just hoping the community will be close to what it was. A lot of people are saying Classic will be great for a few months until most people leave but I think the first few months will filter out the hardcore players. After 4 or 5 months I'm sure most players in Classic will be real ones. Not speedrunners.
---
For dungeons:
---
S tier: warrior, druid
---
Every group needs a tank druids ability to both heal and tank make it a perfect fit for any group. If you're not willing to tank druid becomes C tier as most groups would rather have a real rez on their healer.
---
A tier: paladin, priest, shaman
---
B tier: mage, rogue
---
Mage food, portals. Sheep. Sap. Cheapshot can be fantastic with helping your tank hold aggro. Tons of utility and good damage.
---
C tier : warlock, hunter
---
Expect to get asked for a lot of summons. You will always be the one stuck walking.
---
For raids:
---
S tier: priest, paladin, shaman
---
Healers are always in heavy demand
---
A tier: rogue, mage
---
They're the most played class but also fill the most raid spots.
---
B tier: warlock
---
You only run 3 early game but later on they become very strong and more guilds will look to recruit. Super easy time finding a guild as alliance.
---
C tier: druid, hunter
---
You only run so many druids and hunters as ultimately they don't scale as hard as other classes.
---
Ahh I see
---
That's why you need a bear tank on Vael. Much better TPS even before Crowd Pummeler.

By this logic your skills with bow ties is increased by 5. You also have an increased skilm with taking a bow by 5.
---
Lol same as a paladin here. Although I know I would end up healing in raids, I plan on playing the hybrid class as it says: a hybrid class. Need me to heal? Okay can do! Need me to soak up some damage and tank mobs while we look for another tank? Of course! Lemme equip my shield, cast righteous fury, and drop some consecration.
---
They didn't just seem bigger. In the Cataclysm the entire world was scaled down in many places. Darkshore for instance is like half the width it used to be.
---
Right!?!
---
what happens in the goldshire inn stays in the goldshire inn
---
I’m expecting a lot of rogues named Arya.
---
Definitely seems like it is worth the hour run, at least at some point during the first week. Can’t hurt to try and diversify the income sources. Thanks for the content and cheers!
---
Try to sit your wife next to you and narrate your gathering mats for Billy's boar meat pie in Elwynn and let me know what she has to say about it
---
I think your friend may have misunderstood the core concept of a free trial. It looks like he has 5 permanent subscriptions now.
---
I was subbed until MoP.  Though I skipped Cataclysm and the end of Wrath.  
---
I know people weren't a fan of MoP, but the assets in that expansion were great, blows cata and WoD out of the water.  Can't say anything about legion or BofA.
---
oh, really? i know some were split in half like barrens, but i had no idea they were actually scaled down. that's a travesty wtf
---
The best leveling pet is spiteflayer lvl 51 elite carrion bird. Can learn screech, bite, claw, dive, growl and has a 1.2 attack speed. If you manually control your bite you lose the claw. Else lose the bite. His modifiers are dead in the middle, tanky, decent health and deals damage.
---
Which has nothing to do with this *hilarious* meme.  Let me explain it again:
---
Kid thinks he has to buy Classic.
---
Kid asks mom to buy it.
---
Mom being mom knows he has "Warcraft of Warcraft" already and tells him so.
---
Kid realizes he has Retail already and is sad or happy, or whatever.
---
The point is it doesn't matter what he has, because he will have Classic with his sub.
---
This is what I want to see. I'm really hoping the speedrunners will leave once they finish and let us have the most authemtic WoW experience.
---
I honestly dont mind the heat, so i consider that nice weather.
---
&gt;Some hordie randomly standing about in Westfall.
---
Yeah wtf is with that? Used to happen all the time on my server, sometimes it was a lower level player, but I remember most of the time it was a level 60. Incredibly creepy waiting out the front of Deadmines, only to see a ?? level Orc warrior standing between some buildings looking directly at you...
---
This guy gets it
---
You can do some very nice gold/hr in solo live strat runs. It is not an easy instance to run solo (I've wiped many times even after practicing it) and you need to be on top of your game, but keeping all the Righteous Orbs + other dross to yourself is very profitable.
---
I was 60 in 11 days 7 hours in vanilla and I’m pretty sure that was a tad on the slow side.
---
Why not? Why should any game not be like anything as long as there are no ethical issues and people want to play it? If someone wants to play a MMO like retail then that preference is not worse than someones who want Vanilla. Acting like vanilla is the one true god and anyone who cant see that needs enlightenment will just make you look like an ass.
---
Warrior is rough to level and needs gear, then you will be a god. 
---
Hunter is easy to level and is strong in PvP throughout, but you fall off in PvE mid-BWL.  
---
Shaman levels pretty well, if you level as Ele it is really slow (I did it on my first toon and it took me 17 days played).  If you don't mind healing to get gear it is a good choice.
---
Go with "Ex-gf, current wife"
---
You know what’s actually a problem? People who make a problem out of nothing. Who are you to say what is and is not allowed in comedy? That was not misogynistic. You have the wrong sub reddit!
---
boxing 5 characters to 60 at the same time is definitely faster than leveling 5 characters to 60 sequentially.
---
Yeah bruh you tell them how to live
---
I've never played wow and I'm starting with classic.
---
Imagine playing live, not knowing what comes next, but knowing its shit.
---
At least with Vanilla I know the experience Im getting and I know it was fun the first time, and has been fun everytime since. 
---
Progression raiding is the big thing missing on classic wow. But unless you are a hardcore mythic raider who downs content before mythic boss guides come out--you dont really know what progression is.
---
What we get instead is the world and war of World of Warcraft back. Live is a constant grind of world quests, dailies and bar filling activities like azerite. All of them I am told to do because of a big shiny graphic on my screen and i know if i dont do it, I miss out on my daily chance at rng and i fall behind. 
---
In classic there is no mini map arrow, figurative or literal. From minute one on retail you are guided to the next step. For a new player on classic, their quest log may dry up by level 44. They may have absolutely no goals that the game is suggesting they tackle. Alternatively I log in after years of being offline on an alt of mine and there is a MASSIVE menu on my screen telling me what to do.
---
You hit 60 in classic and there are 3 things that happen to incentivize you to do things. Weekly Raid reset (including world bosses), PvP weekly calculations, Darkmoon faire. Everything else a player did was of their own volition. People grinded for enchanting patterns cause they thought, "hey I can make a profit selling this enchant". We wpvp cause we enjoy the combat, not cause I need to hit my weekly honor cap to get my random weekly pvp piece.
---
There is real opportunity cost. I have to make tough decisions with drawbacks and payoffs. Whether its talents or time investment. My spec isnt changable on the fly and any given talent spec offers a totally different playstyle, considering that Arms makes you great for pvp but gives an undesireable debuff for pve is good. Warriors, as powerful as they are, should have a drawback due to having the best melee pve dps and best melee pvp dps specs--about 100g. 
---
The scale of the world means something. Without a flight path, getting from Winterspring to Silithus is a 30-40 min journey. In modern wow, silithus to org is like a 30s flying mount trip. Forming a group for Strat Living when youre deep inside a hive in silithus is a real dick move--if its gonna be 20 min for you to get to the instance. 
---
The powercreep in vanilla is gradual. By BWL and ZG the raiders will be more powerful, but the non raiders will have access to comparable gear via pvp and dungeon blues. The gulf between them is low enough they can still enjoyable pvp vs one another. If you took a fresh 110 and had him play against a 2nd tier bfa mythic raider---its not even a competition. 
---
There are more elements like community, economy, depth vs complexity and more that explains the difference and the above should be enough for now.
---
...I mean, me too thanks.
---
Seeing you generalize an entire gender, I'm not surprised you don't get it lol.
---
3 mages and a priest is really fucking strong since sheep is so good, and if a pull goes bad and you get extra shit you can usually still survive by just mashing arcane explosion + holy nova
---
Great! You'll love it!
---
Extra large tupper ware bowls with lids are a trick. Stackable and storable.
---
Username checks the fuck out!
---
Roll tide
---
Hoping so, I've found a guild of cool people that don't mind me being new so I'm sure it'll be fun!
---
Wow this was insanely informative, I presume you play your fair share of elemental? Any tips?
---
&gt; given what we know
---
We KNOW like 6 things right now and half of those is Blizzard cutting corners...
---
Unsubbed when panda was announced.  Never been back.  Thought about subbing early and revisit my old toons....but I want to help the metrics "spike", so I will resub prolly a week or so before classic releases.
---
Here's the easier way : Don't have any relation ships.
---
Blackcrow is pre raid bis in phase one. In phase 3 its bloodseeker.
---
vanillafriends.com is going to have a better chance reuniting friends than a Reddit thread littered with replies that can't be filtered.
---
Mmm... those added pats that spawn after you get to the metalworking room. Makes running back a huge pain in the ass.
---
I also got invited to a guild but I decided not to join. They were a speedrunning guild and nost players were the nolifes I was worried about. I hope the guild you found won't put too much pressure on you.
---
No transmogs. Original character models. Old Azeroth, pre-Cata.
---
But will they be Night Elf female rogues?
---
Pretty much all early mats are more valuable early in a server's life.  From lvl 1-60 many people level professions as they go, and others level them at 60.  During that time, ores, cloth, leather, dust, essence, all of them sell much better.
---
Damn skippy.
---
Not only is that incredibly wrong, it’s also missing the point of the game now. 
---
Funny how stupid people play Chinese whispers.
---
I asked a specific question about the gear in Phase 1 before and after the Itemization post.
---
Not today.
---
There's a square room near the end that has 3 chambers coming off it with the ravenian, the final boss and one other. You can just kite them around the square forever.
---
I think I had a pet run away very early on. I seem to remember it but  I don't know when they took it out.
---
Gnome with pink ponytails.
---
Hunters will require anything with agility on it. It is their gift to us for being hunters that they require all things with agility on it. Even the pets.
---
I did t even think of this!
---
There was that story about a woman who sold sex for in game gold to get a flying mount.

Wtf
---
Legion was fantastic (gives Wrath a run for its money, imo, as a huge Wrath fan), but aside from that you haven't missed much at all.
---
I didn't get into WoW - I played FFXI around 2005-2010 instead.  I tried wow around 2010, again for WoD, and again Legion, however, I didn't get into it for whatever reason.  Legion was the one that held me the longest, but I felt like I skipped most of the game to cap, then stood in my class hall thing and just queued.  All the content seemed to surround the final ten levels and everything else was just skip-able.  FFXI didn't have instantly instanced content and the level cap was 75 for a really long time, along with items last for many, many levels (some items you could get at 30ish and have last you until 75).
---
Since then, I've jumped around from MMO to MMO trying them out and just wanting that old school game again.
---
I've played vanilla pservers and have loved it.  The small groups that form up to tackle kill quests, the random pvp that starts up, getting whispers to come and heal/tank/dps whatever dungeon, and an ever building friends list from these interactions.  If there was a new game like this, I would join it.  Closest thing I've gotten to it is ESO.  I have no problem paying a sub for classic - that is not why I try out pservers.
---
Plus no loot boxes :P
---
my reckadin will be at home on the wpvp battlefield, not the instances. 
---
carry on =)
---
What about zg bats? They didn't fix those until the 2.x patch.
---
There's a lot of grass.
---
Unless she's just one of the many condescending c**ts who will only hassle you about playing later.  Either you're a match or you're not.  If she can't accept your passion, she's not worth it.  End of story.  She doesn't HAVE to play with you, but if she makes you choose one or the other - I would pick the other no matter what it is.  Healthy relationships are not built on ultimatums.
---
There is no class in the game that will beat a Rogue for single target damage unless all of your rogues are played by complete baboons.
---
Why make your team weaker by trying to use a toon for something they shouldn’t be doing. 
---
Shaman heals and adds some shocks and totems. They are a support class. A very important highly efficient support class.
---
Classic will get me to play something besides blood elf. I have 9 (and a void elf). Send help.
---
Ulduar and ICC was great but naxx and ToC ruin the expansion for me. 
---
There was a long time between the launch of wrath and the release of ulduar where there was basically no challenging content in the game,  then only a month after Yogg 0 dies they release toc a tiny raid with no trash two rooms and a hardmode that gets beat on the first reset. And all the loot immediately invalidates all of ulduar.
---
ICC was great but then they implemented the incremental damage buff you get when you zone in making the raid easier and easier each week. Plus random dungeon finder and aoe Zerg rush dungeons.
---
A few minor tweaks and wrath could easily be the best expansion of all time.
---
I can’t believe they actually put those in, I thought it was some kind of April fools joke at first
---
That’s what made wow great (at least one thing). You were just a denizen of the world. You weren’t special, just some guy or girl trying to make a life in the world with all of this crazy stuff going on around you. 
---
I want to be anonymous, so to speak, again!
---
What a low effort comment. Reddit is really going to shit.
---
I see, thanks!
---
one minute cooldown on the stomp though, rather just take an owl for screech then
---
Does remind me of an absolute gem of a commercial - I think it was Toyota? Four Wheels of Fury! Did you see me lay down the law? I am the LAW GIVER! 😄
---
What era are you from, Armor Class is not a thing in WoW xD
---
But for real though, hiding away to play games all day is super dropping the ball on your half of a marriage (aside from a few days at launch, of course!), so you've got to compromise. Getting a laptop so you can game *and* have time together is a great compromise, especially if your SO doesn't game.
---
Your name worries me tho
---
Because he was a moron for fucking up like that. So while I honor him I choose to make fun of him as well.
---
Sounded like you were trying to insult the guy with “Jankass”.  Can’t stop giggling.
---
As a pretty casual player and by casual I mean I would MAYBE do a raid once on heroic near the end of its life when it's trivial to join a pug if a quest line made me do it. I will state outright the game has been nothing but detrimental to casual. They've thrown transmog, more mounts, collections tabs, battle pets, and more at me but for what? 
---
The game doesn't have the depth of story, community I can participate with or the rpg gameplay that drew me in. Being given an achievement and another of hundreds of mounts for doing X feels hollow and I hated it. BFA was the second time in my 14 years of playing WoW i willingly dropped my sub. The first being the day of the Cataclysm announcement trailer when I received a oppressive inkling that the game I loved was dead.

I was more or less referring to this ;p

Not sure what neckbeards are downvoting this. Great answer. I personally had a wolf a turtle a boar and a cat. Wolf and turtle were my favorites.
---
I'm 35 and with Ross on this one.  If Mr. Right wants to come sweep me off my feet, so be it.. but I'm not gonna go chasing douchebags just to combat lonliness.  I'd rather have a fun night in gaming with my friends.
---
“You will roll a mage and you will LIKE IT!”
---
“Yes, it’s called DM and you live there now.”
---
There is an Infected Mushroom memory of every zone in wow  for me, it's awesome. What incredible talent those two gents have.
---
Ah, a fellow Paladin!
---
I'll be honest, I really liked the leveling experience and zones in MoP
---
Literally same except I joined in late vanilla so I played TBC, but never really experienced that content since I was around lvl 62 when wotlk came out
---
Haha it’s cool trust me the name checks out like 50% of the time.

Enchanting allows you to enchant your own gear for free and make bank enchanting other people's gear. It's popular to combine with tailoring because you make a lot of items you are able to disenchant, supplying you with cheap or free mats.
---
Sure but you need multiple tanks who can out threat DPS. I doubt most raids are going to carry multiple tank geared druids
---
