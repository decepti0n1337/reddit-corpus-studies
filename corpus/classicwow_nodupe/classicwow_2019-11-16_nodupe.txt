Can you imagine how much fucking fun it would be if they fixed it though????
---
---
---
Sure, being an asshole for money isn't as bad as like murdering someone for money. But what do other bad things have to do with this bad thing?
---

---
Being an asshole for money is still being an asshole for money even if there's worse ways to make money. There's still plenty of ways to make money that don't force you into pretending to be an asshole for people's entertainment.
---
No. They wont be. What we are seeing now is the, lack of a better term, impatience of players wanting to earn honor kills. Once we get BGs we wont see large roaming groups like we are now. Of course we will still see BRM group pvp on raid nights and general world pvp like before, but it WILL NOT be as wide spread as it is now.
---
I'm about as geared as he is (2nd tank in my guild), I only join runs with reserve that are made by guildies/friends. I generally don't even join runs for anything else, because there's nothing I need in dungeons and I instead spend my time farming thorium for arcane crystals. However, when I'm asked to tank, I usually try to ensure that my time spent there is about as profitable as the time I lose by going there. So that means reserving first orb in strat living or asking for unneeded blues/greens for other dungeons.
---
Better offhand for sword rogue, Brutality Blade or CHT? I’m a dagger rogue now, perditions is busted, but I’m honestly curious about this. BB 2.5 speed is weird and corehound would get more poison procs. BUT with the 2% crit sharpening stone, who’s pattern won’t drop for my guild, BB would probably come out on top?
---
A few addons can do it, I think LeatrixPlus can do it(?) if not Lorti UI  can for sure
---
snowblind of forceful entry checking in.. were u alliance?
---
Most modern games aren’t games.
---
They are online gambling for children disguised as games pushed by businessmen who care less about having fun, and more about screen time and sales per hour.
---
Why? Why can't a gameplay server in 2019 handle 150 or 200 people in a zone? There are many games that have this. Planetside 2 crushes these numbers
---
WSG and AB are available to premade. AV always had a hard cap of 5 players per group to queue.
---
how is that perfect?
---
Yeah I don't know why everyone is so stupid about this.  The wow world was designed around only so many people, blizzard, in the infinite ability to fuck good things up and be incredibly stupid, decided to ignore that and just stack insane amounts of people in to worlds designed for far far less.
---
Vanilla wpvp was nothing like this.  Because there simply wasn't enough horde or alliance to make every zone uninhabitable at the same time.
---
You missed a key word before you went off. N E W news, this has always happened. Just to be clear I completely agree this is unacceptable, just pointing out it’s silly people are acting like this is some new unexpected thing.
---
My question is if a majority of players are &lt;26 then why are the majority of players horde?
---
Or are we on different terms of what old means?
---
I mean, it's like killing an endemic species, everyone would feel bad
---
&gt; They way that I do this is that I kind of dial things up to eleven. I'm not necessarily a different person when I stream. It's like I act like the most sporadic and aggressive and crazy version of myself. It's not necessarily a different person, it's just more or less an accentuated personality."
---
He has literally said it's not an entirely different person and it's just him but to the max.
---
Yeah I also think that’s what is going to happen. Still have 11 days on my sub, so I’ll see. 
---
Thing is, being father of 2, I have limited time to play so wasting my 1 hour of my 1.5 hours just being ganked isn’t appealing. Sure you’ll tell me I should have rolled PvE, but I like PvP. I achieved rank 11 on a PvP server on vanilla, but now the servers are 2 or 3 times bigger  so there’s a horde player every square inch.
---
People usually fuck up the order of the scene.
---
It's become a meme itself at this point lol
---

Asmon disagrees with you.
---
All right, then I think I'm all good. Thanks alot!
---
Rouges aren’t too great at spelling.
---
Sitting at a bar atm, waiting for my Best Friend to show up so I can tell him I'm going to be a father... and just bust out in a chuckle over this one. 
---
Thank you, OP. I needed that.
---
Spent a lot of time in Hillsbrad and came back after I hit 50 or so to help some guildies . This could not be any more on the pulse.
---
I certainly hope so
---
Yes this is how it will be forever
---
Ahhhh
---
This is awesome man. When do you think you’ll have it done?
---
I'm super jealous alliance can say "ok Boomer".
---
Legit gets me so triggered. Not that they said it... Just that I can't..
---
Because... it does.
---
Alright, good luck with your concerns. I have some links for you to learn more about what you're complaining about.

Happy posting friend!
---
Nope. Has to be 5 minutes out of combat.
---
Well watch a few of his discussion videos and you will see a difference.
---
But that is besides the point. If you hate him just ignore him and dont give him exposure.
---
&gt; horse guy 
---
So still Alliance?
---
&gt;Last night was a blast, probably on both sides. We got our asses kicked sometimes, othertimes we steamrolled the opposing raid. 
---
I would've applauded your attitude if you hadn't ended the next sentence with the nothing personal, lol.
---
I've been cruising my realm forum and I see a lot of people trying to stir rivalries up but it's always with focus on being obnoxiously disrespectful and telling people to git gud. Maybe just the rose colored glasses but my impression of the PvP rivalries in vanilla and on private servers was always that it was with some degree of sportsmanship, at least among the regulars. With classic it gets really into personal namecalling and LoL-like arguments about all the things you did that means you're a shit player, even if you came out on top. Real bummer imo, but again it might also just be my realm.
---
Thank you for your clarification and happy birthday!
---
Do you have a source for "intended 4-7 days?" as far as I know there was never really any exact details on their respawn timer.
---
Tanking dungeons is a lot more taxing mentally than DPSing. When gearing up, I had multiple times where I simply just had to DPS a few runs because I couldn't focus enough to tank. Tab toggling through mobs to sunder them, trying to guess which mobs the DPS are on so I can use revenge for extra threat on those. Then taunting mobs who I lose aggro on. Then swap to battle stance to mocking blow another one that the other DPS  got aggro from. Then swapping back to resume sundering only to realize the healer asspulled a new pack so i need to berserker stance and intercept over to save his fat ass. A few hours of that really takes a toll. Meanwhile, as DPS i can litterally just sit in a stance spamming a few buttons.
---
i ran a census scan on my server, i had a horde person run it at the same time. we added our two numbers together and that is what we got.
---
a census scan takes ~20 minutes. an online population is not going to fluctuate greatly in 20 minutes, so the accuracy is relatively high.
---
blizzard has said that a vanilla server was roughly 3000 people, but they also said that classic server player caps are higher than it was in vanilla. 
---
you *could* assume that they said that due to layering, but layering is out of the picture. so it is safe to assume that with census scans *and* blizzard saying "a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006." that realms do in fact have a higher population cap well above 3000.
---
luckily for you, the census addon is free to download. you can go and make a character on a locked realm, run a census scan on one faction, go and make a character on the other faction, and add the two numbers together.
---
Yes, phase 2 just came out and the hype will die down. The rest of your logic makes no sense; it's not as if the people on classic WoW have never seen PvP before. BFA was new once; phase 2 is new; there is no comparison.
---
From what my friends have told me. You can que for any battleground from one NPC
---
Stop straw manning, nobody is crying this is NEW. They are angry this is happening in a fucking 15 year old game.
---
Uhh yeah these fights are boring as fuck. Even without lag, you just do them because you have to in order to farm honor, it's just a buncha people spamming AoE and respawning if they die.
---
No, the kiddies picked the pretty factions: Humans (Just like they are in Real Life!), Gnomes (Like Lord of the Rings!), Night Elves (Pretty!) and gnomes (lol so cute!)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Whereas the older folks and the metal heads see the ugly class and think: "Well shit, I gotta be an ugly troll. Oh shit, cowmen." or Orc because they played the old games. :)
---
I don't know, man, rolling human just seems too vanilla of a choice.
---
I’m running wow on my Mac as well and I can’t seem to get the game out of full screen mode did you have this problem?
---
Either grind Maraudon until Sunken Temple or
---
Go to Azshara and kill nagas. Maybe the murlocs on the beach are low enough. Eventually move on to satyrs and blood elfs.
---
Another options is the Elementals on the beach of Feralas. Or the harpies in the north that are really squishy. Perhaps the yetis also.
---
Prepare to grind if you're not gonna do instances.
---
It seems that a lot of people are affected by lagg. I was just doing some 200vs200 at hilsbrad and there weren't much lagg.
---
Where are you living guys and on which server ?
---
[removed]
---
Ok... there's no guaranteed gem drop in Classic, so... what're you babbling about?  You clearly don't know classic as well as you think you do. 
---
And no one believes you btw.
---
Dying to pvp &amp; ganking? Expected &amp; standard for pvp.
---
Getting slaughtered &amp; camped by pvp raids of 20+ lvl 60 ally? Including any boat or zep for hours on end? Literally unable to turn in quests or find a living flight master because of these raid groups? This shit wasn't in classic &amp; it hasn't existed in any successful MMO.
---
Amen, preacher!
---
How does that work? Since it’s not a contested zone, aren’t the players you encounter unflagged for PvP?
---
Yeah, I'm in the same seat.
---
I like that first bit
---
Lolno
---
His shitty escape (the ice block) does happen first, however.
---
Be on a guild that kills things incredibly fast. Faster kills = you maintain higher dps
---
Just hit 225 today. Now I'll be rolling in lock boxes and free training
---
Happened to me when I was like lvl 45 flying over searing gorge, landed right by some 60 elite mobs, good times.
---
Bigglesworth:
---
Why is it that Horde are literally everywhere... it feels like a cancerous tumor that's spreading. I get 20:1'd everywhere I go.
---
I am 60 geared..
---
I wasn’t having a good time since launch. So many things about Classic are just frustrating, lol.
---
Just because he banned you from his chat for being annoying and sperging out doesn't mean he's a fascist
---
Don’t blame me. That’s what all the naysayers were saying about classic before it got rumored it announced.
---
Just whenever you get an upgrade. I had gnomeragan quest legs until I was around 52.
---
My server is overrun in blasted lands for people farming the buffs. Not sure about the mines as those mobs are friendly to Alliance
---
8 hours LOL maybe maybe 7-15mins
---
Dude it's why I went from holy to prot lol (still some holy for dat AoE)
---
I mean, except for the fact that you can google image search, 'giraffe' and see what they look like.
---
Being downvoted for telling what happened, cool
---
How long ago do you think this was happening in his discord? Yea people change but it wasn't that long ago bud.
---
Still classic has the best world. No fly mounts make you feel small in the huge world. Opens up for great wpvp
---
Thanks :)
---
Yep he’s just picking off people flagged in cities who for some reason turned on their PvP flag to make it always on even in cities or just got into the city and haven’t been there 5 minutes.
---
Looking for some opinions...
---
Currently hit L55. Playing Mage. Have been leveling via AOE the whole way thus far and just finished up ~7-8 levels of solo grinding in Maraudon. 
---
How would you recommend hitting 60? Keep the AOE solo grind going in BRD and DM:N? Respec to frost single-target and quest?
---
Thanks!
---
What's so silly about it? Saying "LFM Angerforge HoJ Reserved" is better than saying "LFM Angerforge Casters only"
---
With the first, melee who don't need HoJ are free to join the run whilst they'd be excluded if HoJ wasn't reserved.
---
Wot m8?
---
I didn't play during phase 1 of nost, but yes, during world bosses with over 500 players clashing, there was much less delay. There are plenty of videos demonstrating this if you didn't have the chance to see it live.
---
I've decided I'm just not going to play this week. Far too many people on my server take camping lowbies as a kitted 60 as fair PvP.
---
What makes you say that?
---
They do this shit, but i get ripped a new asshole when I reserve Foror's in DM as a tank.
---
kinda /s?
---
I always ask and let the timer run down. I have some pretty great blues because of it being lvl 45 Rogue. I get made fun of for having spirit but I got some sweet shoulders from ZF.
---
Leveling Horde on Incendius, level 36. Honestly in the zones I'm leveling I'm really not seeing any difference since Phase 2. Have quested alongside several Alliance players and we just ignored each other.
---
Passed on 3 CHT’s so far and in the 8-9 Mc clears so far we’ve seen 0 perds. Ended up just taking a gutgore no one wanted and I’ll be taking the next CHT while passing on perds. And gutgore has a nice proc for PvP.
---
Cross realm BGs came in retail and I remember horde still having 7-15 min  waits for WSG so there will be ques but not nearly as bad as OP would like to believe
---
So there’s literally nothing better out there than Classic? Nothing better than pressing one button constantly and spending half of your time in-game drinking water and flying on hippogriffs? That is sad.
---
I’ve already explained it to you thoroughly. If you can’t read or understand what I’m saying there’s nothing I can do for you. I guess keep whining and crying about it if you want though.
---
Oh man, I legit laughed out loud.
---
That was awesome, but I can't believe he wasn't saying it like this:
---
https://youtu.be/fuJ1fGAxMD0?t=71
---
Pagle hypeeeeee what upppp
---
Get a sword. I used Thrash in MH and Vanquisher’s Sword in OH around that level. You can get Vanquishers from a Razorfen Downs quest.
---
ok now this is epic
---
Mages can aoe grind lashers in dm: east. Probably your best bet
---
I'm a horde on Skeram, there's plenty of Allies ganking just about everywhere.
---
Little bit different comparing a 1.5k Epic to a 20-40g orb.
---
The tanks reserving orbs came from not having a reliable solo gold farm for tanks so they'd sell their services for gold or orbs in these cases.
---
Method is a plus for streamers and yeah, it’s not where their money comes from. The job is streaming. The other guy didn’t say he “lost” his job. He said he fucked it up. Which is true. Classic wow is on phase 1 of 6 and the streamer market is fucking so fully saturated with streamers. Everyone is trying to penetrate the market, trying to stand out, and this guy does it by being the first 60. Gets into Method for it. He had the potential to turn this a well paying long term gig. And then he goes and does this shit. He’s representing an organization now and starts willfully perpetuating toxic shit. I’m just one guy but why the hell would I watch this guy now? I’ll just check reddit for highlights for the shenanigans and watch one of the other 5000 mage streams going on. At least I might at least learn something or get a laugh. Maybe others feel the same way. I feel like he would just be sitting in his garbage chat with all the other assholes he attracts. Even if they aren’t assholes. This is the best place to act like one. So yeah, I think he fucked up his job. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
He should’ve at least waited until Phase 3. Fuckin A.
---
In the priest section it says: "Because of this, Spirit is very important as you will restore 2 mana per  2 seconds while casting and receive 0.25 Spell Power for every point of  Spirit you have!"
---
There is a mistake. 1 point of Spirit gives you 0.25 mana per 2 second tic outside of the 5 seconds rule and 15% of that while casting with Meditation. If 1 spirit was 5mp5 it would be a far better stat than mp5 itself and Truefaith vestment would be a joke compared to the Robe from the Baron and its 18 or so Spirit.
---
why are people so scared jesus
---
It’s not hot garbage when it’s the best trinket for melee. Maybe you’re not using your abilities right and ruining melee resets so your procs are low.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Add_aA3L0
---
Shudder
---
Sorry, if it makes you feel better, is horde wish the battles weren’t (quite) so one sided.  Kind of sucks having to roam both continents to find someone to pvp (outside of south shore)
---
is there a website that gets all this? the one that i search with google is terrible https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php
---
I've been selling this to my friends and the most resistance is lost progress.
---
I think the niche is bigger than people might think.  The tourney might be too long to get to max lvl, kill some shit, and delete progress.  Maybe a L50 to max, or a L1-30 could be seasonal as the time investment is much smaller.
---
The concept
---
Not sure if you are /s but I meant that you should lead your own group with your own rules bud.
---
&gt; this is NOT "as it always was"
---
no this was how it started in vanilla as well, remember? #nochanges amirite?
---
Briarwood + eye of the beast
---
The rebuff has a low priority rebuff slot. Other debuffs would take it off the boss.
---
Berserker rage -&gt; death wish when seeker expires -&gt; berserker rage again when death wish expires
---
You’re warlock proof as a fury warrior, even more so with that bs trinket!
---
In that case roll a tank and make your own runs with your own loot system.
---
I understand you completely, but I just don't agree that we should let spy ruin pvp just because you think it will be too much stress on the servers (which should be fixed rather than "avoiding stress").
---
Imo McConnell is just bad at being part of the act. Imo asmon is pretty good at being satirical, where he'll agree with some opinion McConnell has spouted and then with sarcastic undertones lead it into the absurd which then makes McConnell look like an asshat. It just doesn't seem to me that McConnell is doing any of it sarcastically or satirically, he really is just an asshat and it's more on Asmon's ability to play off of it.
---
A lot of times it seems to me that they go through the procedure I mentioned, and Asmon sort of lets it go because it's "done" and has been taken into the absurd, but McConnell is still on board with it and is passionately defending the absurd so Asmon makes a hard stop and changes the subject very jarringly. Like just asking chat a totally unrelated question when McConnell is done talking or sometimes even interrupting him midsentence. 
---
Then there's also the streams where McConnell is just wallowing in selfpity, namecalling chat and is just whining and there's nothing for Asmon to play off of, because his only option is to 1) try to cheer McConnell up which always just results in more selfpity or 2) Make fun of him being sad, which is then just coming off as mean or bullying which I don't think Asmon likes using as content.
---
wow i had a lot more opinions on McConnell than I thought lol, man I hate that guy.
---
Hard agree my dude. This type of pvp is so boring. Rising back and forth in a raid group looking for any solo player to kill sucks.
---
Everything Apart from expansions
---
Have you seen Southshore?
---
Other way around, the cells would release all the fluid they had left
---
Group comp is not at all the sant thing as loot reserves.
---
barovian family sword does not.
---
I’d say it dose not  really matter but level 47 is a horrible time to respec. What dungeons will you heal? 
---
There’s not many, and most will be green to you. Your at the point where you either need to bite the bullet and put in a few grind sessions in to get in the mid 50s (w/shadow) or expect to take a very long time finishing your journey to 60 as a holy priest. 
---
If you have good gear, and a good team/comp then you can heal as shadow.  Witch is rare.
---
Ffs I fell asleep right after posting yeah you just wanna either roam the edges and pick off people in bad spots, or coordinate a rush of 5+ to boost in w sappers etc. Fun stuff as melee xD
---
People don’t understand that DKs don’t matter this week
---
59 was the last year to be considered a boomer, 59 to today is 60. boomers will be, loosely, between 60 and 80
---
They don't have a group. They just have an attitude. As a 60 war tank, I don't spam 30-90 minutes LFG. I just pick whichever dungeon I want to run and we're good to go in 5 minutes. If I go "LF 3 dps 1 healer strat live" I'll have a finished run done before this guy found a tank.
---
Look at my posts ITT, I'm a fan of him myself. I don't know he has an alt on Herod because I need reasons to hate him, I know because I watched part of the stream when they rolled there. Dude you first replied to also claims there's two guilds of fanboys left on Herod so clearly his community had an impact on the server.
---
Any more straws you wanna grasp at?
---
That's part of it too, mostly when you hit level cap, but it doesn't explain the lack of tanks in the leveling experience, since there are plenty of warriors floating around.
---
Most PvP servers are split 1/3 and 2/3 on the side, and that 1/3 of the server will be having a bad enough time to stop playing.  Most are a little more skewed to 70/30 or worse, which only pushes the problem further.
---
&gt;Warriors can't even roll on them again once they have Quel so its a double Fuck you.
---
Why not? Can you not loot it?
---
Hookers are reserved
---
they will be gone soon? Lol they have been playing 1.12 patches for years while you probably just started in August. He's not going anywhere so stay mad
---
https://www.dexerto.com/world-of-warcraft/asmongold-defends-jokerd-over-wow-classic-ninja-controversy-1286413
---
He was literally PvPing with Staysafe last night. What is this meme even trying to say? It's not like Method dropping him makes him unable to play WoW.
---
Your tendency to make assumptions and then reason based on them instead of engaging with the available information or asking for more indicates that it's basically pointless to engage with you. Have a nice life.
---
Can anyone give me some general sequences for PvP as a rogue?
---
I played mage back in vanilla and so I'm still learning the patterns and signals and responses as a rogue. PvE seems to be mostly trying to get combo points for eviscerates, but is it always better to spend 1 cp to stun/interrupt casters? Should I ever be exposing armor/rupturing against plate?
---
We need to go deeper on these dudes
---
I bet money that the split is so close it doesn't matter. But if I HAD to put money on one, it would be alliance. 
---
source: me being 13 and having 13 year old friends and we all picked alliance in 04.
---
Aptly named the forgotten generation.
---
Pearl harbor
---
I refuse to heal this, but more power to anyone who does. No gear I need enough to be stressed during a pull. 
---
Having to sit and drink takes longer than it saves.
---
There's a few sinews on the AH on my server and according to my add on its 25% drop... must be respawning faster
---
What's battleground like? How is it any different from pvp?
---
Cute, only problem is I still taunt the mob on you, but then the warlock pills and decides it is best to just stand still. O wait, you kept dpsing the target you pulled aggro from and when taunt wears off you got the aggro back.
---
Now I have 2 mobs not on me, and I have no rage because I'm not getting hit.
---
But it's ok you have vanish and evasion.
---
From my experience lvling a warlock I'd say that spirit is incredibly useful and possibly number one priority. There is obviously a requirement to have a certain amount of stamina and intellect in order to take multiple mobs at once, but there are diminishing returns with those. Spirit on the other hand you can never have too much of, as it scales incredibly well with one of your most important talents and allows you to have nearly zero downtime if you're continuously killing and using drain soul.
---
Any attempt to do an I depth break down of this episode is kind of fruitless when you realize so much of it is totally inaccurate. Like PVPing own faction, a human hunter(in classic), a mage summoning scorpions, using ctrl+I to bring up your invintory, Randy Marsh bragging about exploring the Tower of Azora, being able to kill 1 type of mob in 1 zone for more that 10 levels, the characters keeping the same gear as the level up, Randy Marsh being able to wield the sword of a thousand truths at such a low level, etc...
---
Battlegroiund is instanced. So 10v10 Capture the flag. 15v15 base controls. It is coming next phase. Also big battlegrounds which is 40 v 40 in the mountains.
---
What if he doesn’t have a rogue? Isn’t high enough level? Isn’t hemo spec? There are lots of reasons why it might not be easy to check. Use your brain
---
What? Are you not happy to become a father?
---
Lmao bed at 10-11pm is the sort of thing nearly all actual adults to in the western world mate.
---
With an attitude like yours maybe everyone would be better off if you put the entire server on ignore. Wow, people want to group with you in the game, THE FUCKING HORROR!!!
---
You joined a group with a random idiot. Yes that is your fault
---
The title is misleading as you are assuming there is no solution to the longevity of Classic.
---
We were all wrong and  moonkin is the  superior spec.
---
They don't have an attitude, they are asking people to join their group, clearly stating loot rules. Other people have attitudes towards them because that's not "how you should play the game". 
---
Good on you, a tank getting groups fast. How rare and very surprising. Its heartwarming to know that you care so much about their time spent looking for a group that it's made you angry.
---
So why do so many people feel the need to ask for server upgrades? I mean blizzard is doing awesome with classic imo, layering ending in P2 like they promised and everything else why can't people cut them some slack?
---
Wasn't Jokerd in Method? I mean he's clearly joking around. Didn't he cross his face out of that picture too?
---
Get a PC.
---
Also I believe at some point in vanilla the fight itself was made easier (boss hp reduced).
---
Horde are 50% dads 50% zoomers
---
&gt; I doubt anyone playing this game is a boomer.
---
I know more than a few. I know a person who has two priests because swapping talents back in TBC annoyed her so she just leveled another. She doesn't raid, pvp, or do dungeons. She just farms herbs and supplies the guild with flasks. Occasionally she'll crash the entire market on one herb by mass posting 11 pages at a sharp discount.
---
I've met her once IRL she's a real sweet lady who just gathers herbs to kill time really.
---
Im starting to feel like that a little. It got on my nerves that my friends just didnt wanna do any dungeons becuause im too low level
---
Im new to the game for fuck sakes
---
You don't need to run away.  Combat drops after 6 seconds of not attacking/being attacked so there's no reason to run and plenty of reasons why not to.
---
They don't care. They're just farming honor, you might as well be a rep grind mob to them. 
---
You're a resource now, until you hit 60 and can bite back
---
I keep seeing him everywhere. So thats what you were yelling yesterday Kaymorae.
---
This guy works
---
hey man I may have had a shit reaction time there but I was definitely not keyboard turning
---
&gt;It's a game.
---
Which is why I'm not saying anything other than he seems like a dick *based on my limited knowledge*.
---
I've considered it, however with my time and at my pace it will be another few months to even reach where I am now. It sounds brutal
---
I'm just fishing for the chance that somebody reads this and knows why this helm gives me twice as much rage as the tooltip says it should, lol.
---
Given things that have come to light about how he ranked highly poker, hearthstone, league of legends, etc. has it been verified that he actually achieved this legitimately?
---
There's a 62 year old who's been raiding with my guild for 5+ years through multiple private servers.
---
If you'd have to farm level 1 boars for honor, all these people would be doing that instead.
---
Looks like someone just got served oooooooh
---
So the entire random prompt doesn't appear for you? It's my understanding that only actually having the book blocks that prompt. Do you still have the book after complelting QS?
---
It really sucks that this seems to be the only realistic "solution" right now. At this rate I won't reach 60 till mid next year
---
Spy. Yes it's allowed and super useful.
---
Twat is just a funny word. 
---
I envision you saying it as "TW AT" you know like a virgin.
---
Instead of the more Chad-ian "TW AUT" like a real man.
---
Staysafe doesn't let 'agenda andys' dictate how he should lead his own guild and he hates when people keep asking him about it, because people thrive from drama and want to see Joker get crucified in more ways. He accepted Joker's apology and kept him in because he felt that having your career ruined over that is already enough of a punishment.
---
You could transfer to a PVE server for free right now right? I'm considering doing that on my alt.
---
Yeah idk how people find this fun.  Literally no skill involved
---
I don't give a shit about the guy's popularity, I just hate ninjas. Is that difficult to understand somehow? .\_.
---
I just don't get how something like this could make a person hate him. It's craziness.
---
There is actually an updated of version of wow for the modern player, it's called retail and it comes free with your classic subscription.
---
It works, but what it doesn't tell you is that you can only make certain phrases/letters as each faction. So if you use literally any of the characters that don't work, (e.g. if you had a Z in there and if common-to-horde didn't have a possible Z), the f00l translator will just tell you GG it's not possible.
---
=
---
This is the "list" I used for horde to alli. Try to create a phrase using only possible characters from lists like these and then the f00l translator will spit out whether or not it'll work for sure, I guess. https://pastebin.com/tysej22Z
---
Holy shit that was murder, half of everyone laughing, the other half looking around like "did he just say that? Is it ok to laugh?"
---
lol "angry". you're cute.
---
Not be in a raid grp.
---
Druids ganking druids at Moonglade!? I'm no RPer, but druids hanging out in moonglade just always seemed sorta right in a way...
---
In such moments you really wish the game was advanced enough to have suitable punishments, such as  the druid trainer banning them from using Teleport Moonglade etc :P
---
I've tons ideas but Idk how to code and never be implemented....
---
Such as BOTW weather effects or survival mode; Basically a WoW type of BOTW but the current races and their racials etc.
---
So you can go to Tanaris but you need heat resistant clothing...
---
Go to Northrend and you'll need frost/shadow resistant clothing because its HECKIN' COLD.
---
ohh no no no it looks bad I told them on reddit
---
this comment servers to show that even though OP did not say which faction he plays on you still know he will be mercilessly ganked  so anyone who says X does this or Y does that is just wrong.
---
Same Wilco from back in Archeage? If so it's Ragnarbloodfist idk if you remember raiding with me
---
Why isn't it appealing? You like PvP, you've got PvP. Sounds like you want PvP on YOUR terms, where it only happens when you volountarily mark yourself as willing to engage in PvP, which is **exactly** what the Normal servers are for. So yeah, should've rolled "PvE".
---
A generation said to the demographers:
---
"Sirs, we exist!"
---
"However," replied the demographers,
---
"The fact has not created in us
---
A sense of obligation."
---
It’s weird how excited they are about camping a flightpath on a horde dominated server. Look at him literally jumping around in his seat. Although I guess it’s probably exciting to see PvP on a PvE server! 
---
You might wanna research honorless target buff too, FYI.
---
Just stay vigilant and keep at it. It’s understandably frustrating, but it will be an incredible payoff when you hit 60. The game will really open up to you, and you’ll know you accomplished it with the game at its most difficult.
---
I’m not sure how committed you are to your professions, but I would recommend Alchemy so that you can craft speed, health, and invisibility potions. It will at the very least help you avoid some ganks.
---
Yeah I'm 56 and just trying to level but still get fucked since I'm free honor pretty much :( they just need to make it so unless ypute 60 you're honorless
---
It's understandable to hate ninjas but what you're saying is just not true don't spread misinformation.
---
It's such a good one
---
Without MS any class that can heal makes it really hard to win against any class with heals. It also makes health pots and bandages almost useless for pure dps classes, so it really does make a huge difference. Since everyone is grouped up with a healer right now MS is a must for warriors and kinda their role in group battles
---
When they put 4 paper plates, 4 solo cups, and 4 plastic silverware in your bag that contains only your dinner
---
When you get to the point of having great gear, char knowledge, and a great composition you can literally heal/dps with nova throughout a good portion of the dungeons at 60. 
---
For example a brd prision run, as I’m pretty well geared, I do massive amounts of dmg while still keeping everyone topped off. 
---
For a normal run is strat UD I run towards the pack as the tank pulls while throwing a max rank renew on him and cast a few down ranked novas until he either gets low or there is less then 3-4 enemy’s.  If there’s only 1-3 then I’d rather use power word pain if I’m trying to dps. 
---
55 mage water makes the difference for me, if I don’t have the good shit then I’m just a healer..
---
Everyone eventually stopped playing vanilla so the #nochanges crew are just going to set the game up to fail again.
---
I'm on alliance
---
So then play retail and leave classic alone.  The BFA pvp toggle thing is just how pve servers work in classic.  They turned all of retail into one giant pve server and you are applauding them.
---
senor del fuego!
---
As someone on the winning side of their server I think it’s a big mess. I’m sure blizzard is not happy about this. The alliance on my server are getting destroyed and it’s not even close. I’m guessing they release bgs really early because people are getting rolled left and right.
---
Ok, so how much dmg has Hoj been responsible for on your end? My rotation is tight and unless it’s one of the non melee friendly fights I’m top of the charts. Also, are you using daggers or swords? Because yes that does make a difference.
---
Geared here would mean wearing the best gear you could obtain for whatever spec you're playing.
---
I think you're trying to get an idea of how much meme specs weigh down a raid. That's really difficult to assess, but in the case of feral druid your issue isn't going to be that no one will let you tank as a druid (because it's not really considered a meme spec). The reason you're going to have a hard time finding a spot is that there are 2-3 tank spots per 40 man raid, and all of them were taken more than a month ago by people who will probably have full BiS raid gear by the time you hit 60.
---
I LOVE druid, I just got my feral druid alt to 54 tonight even in the midst of the PvP purge. I don't want to dissuade you from enjoying the game. I just don't want you to get all the way to 60 and then get burned out because it's not what you expected.
---
You can be happy and also nervous, scared, etc. it’s a big life changing experience!
---
when is reset usually?
---
“But I already have medallion of steadfast might!”
---
/s
---
It costs gold. Go to the vendor of your faction and see how much gold, and what rank you must be, to purchase said items.
---
It only took being yelled at 80 times for me to learn to attack the primary target. In my defense, though, at the start of a lot of run the tank will name the kill order for groupings, and a lot of the times I got yelled at it was for following kill order while theyre on a different target, and no marks up. Or itll be a non-elite or something I can easily solo without a healer that I misclicked but i figure "screw it, might as well take 5 seconds to finish it off"
---
There are not enough Vietnam references in this poster.
---
It's 100% from Azuregos, but it also drops in Winterspring.
---
I laughed my ass off at this idiot
---
ok Boomer
---
yeah, how dare he not want to be corpse camped by the vastly larger number of other faction players on his server for every minute he's logged into game?
---
Pretty sure he already did
---
News flash, boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. No way most of the ppl playing this game are 55 or older.
---
Small-scale skirmishes are more fun than SS vs. TM for the sole fact that you don't have to experience the excruciating lag.
---
There’s another record he can brag about.
---
"PvP sEvErS aRE tHe OnLy wAY tO EnJoY tHe GaeM"
---
Note that for raids deadly poison is a big no-go as it takes up a debuff slot. Instant poison is the way to go for raids.
---
Yea every fp in a contested zone is being camped. Gadgetzan is being camped and the guards are useless...
---
really??? Talkin shit because people are actually enjoying WoW.... I am excited because I love the game of WoW. It's exciting to wipe people. Skeram has arguably some of the best alliance players in US. Also its a PvP server. Prior to blizzard fucking it up with server transfers it was one of the best US servers by far with a ratio of around 60 / 40. Honorless buff target was patched into game at or around 9pm EST last night. After this happened. Additionally as you can see these guys are attacking us which makes the buff go away and they become honor kill targets. thanks for your lame ass comment
---
I got to know him by watching his "how to.." videos on youtube back in MoP. If you're not an idiot or playing dumb and realize he's obviously joking around they're gold. I honestly think his goofing hit a bit too close to home for the actual elitist neckbeards and that's why he has so many haters. I actually don't watch a lot of streams it's just not my thing but it makes me angry to see people purposely misconstrue him just to hate.
---
This could easily be a troll with some video editing
---
Hello hunter here. I have a question. When is the hunter quest available? The one that gives you Devilsaur Eye Trinket?
---
Keanu loses-Keanu grieves
---
It never gets better. Either u do the camping or become the camped.
---
This reminds me of a post where a guy was anti-pride parade because "gays shouldn't have more rights than straights". You know, the pride parade that's in honor of cops beating gay people. 
---
Maybe, and this is a crazy thought I know, but stay with me. Maybe when people say "this is my negative experience and this is how even trivial things contribute" you listen and shut the fuck up?
---
Let me put it another way: you're contributing to the pollution of women's gaming experiences, with your know-it-all attitude. Sit down, shut up, and start listening.
---
Correction: Yes it's allowed and super broken. Please forbid it.
---
You seem to forget that is 2019 now, technology and infrastructures able to avoid this shit are there.
---
"Look at me not care by repeatedly commenting"
---
You want to know the actual reason for that? 4Chan are overwhelmingly boomer horde players, and /r9k/ was the originator of the boomer meme. Not because horde players have been regarded as older. If anything thats some new zoomer shit to think that way.
---
This is as bad of an award choice as when they gave it to Fortnite during its early release.
---
This is wrong:
---
&gt;It’s probably the best stat for raiding
---
ok boomer
---
No but you have to remember that Full servers in vanilla is Low in Classic.  I am seeing probably 5-7 times more players per zone than I did in Vanilla.  That said means there are now 5-7 asshats reserving items than there was.  It is a main product of private servers, I saw it a lot on some of the major private servers.
---
No way in hell I’d compete for gear when I can get it faster and with less stress by making the right group comp. Even if there is some overlap, I’d rather go in saying “hey, I’ll pass on savage glad chain, you pass on hoj” than just let rng fuck one of us.
---
Yup that's the excuse everyone uses to defend small indie company Blizzard.  Was the reason they launched classic with a quarter of the servers we have now also because of client side security?
---
It’s like he’s in the pageant circuit lol
---
He's right tho,he gave her mo honor
---
I've never really watched his videos, so my perception is definitely coming from what I've been told, which again, is why I'm not calling for his head or whatever the video game nerd equivalent is. People take it way too seriously, but if there's an easy way to trigger wow players (myself included) is to act all laissez-faire about ninja looting.
---
Is he human? If not the axe off Ony is way better
---
The problem with this sub in one sentence.
---
Does anybody expect Mature Blue Dragon sinew to go down in price now that the world boss can drop it? Debating whether to sell mine and rebuy later, or just use it
---
How? I've been looking to get off Kirtonos (one of the least balanced servers) and have found nothing.
---
you also forgot the \* scream on the hybrids players who DARE to want to dps and not always tank or heal \*
---
How about no updates, that's kind of the whole point of classic.
---
Don't work for blizzard, but software dev / server engineer here. Yes, it is naive and unrealistic when it gets to a certain point of several hundred players in that small condensed space. Was just doing hillsbrad now, with 4 raid groups on Horde and at least 3 on alliance. That's close to 300 people in a small area. With the server tracking every player's casts and positioning and informing that to all the clients - all 300 of them at once, while all 300 of them are also inputting. 
---
 For the same reason you can't crank up a knob on your computer and download a 100GB game off steam *instantly*, there exists a point to where the data coming in and going out takes more time to cause noticeable lag. The more people and data going in, the effect scales linearly. 
---
This is the reason why there aren't many games that even have 300 people in one session possible. I've never seen a console game's multiplayer handle more than 64 players, and it really all boils down to the same reason why your WoW will always lag when there are 300-400 people in your zone
---
Not in bearz !
---
So the game will be playable for non-60s in a few weeks? Ok.
---
... no?
---
It sounds like he rolled PvP expecting a similar experience to vanilla, but since there's several times more players per server this time around he can't go 5 minutes without tripping into more PvP.
---
You can enjoy PvP while still admitting that it's a bit of a shitshow right now. You can have too much of a good thing.
---
Confirmation bias
---
Because there is no other endgame content for geared players and it's laggy AF. P3 won't be out for at least a few months if blizz sticks to its schedule... people ask for better performance because the idea of the game being a laggy pvp aoe fiesta doesn't sound like great gameplay for many people.
---
Yeah level 52 and started up searing gorge quests Wednesday night. Log in the next day expecting the worst when I flew to TP and it was even worse than expected (I'm alli, but at least Benediction was relatively balanced before blizz broke easy census data). Sucks cause I'm in the prime spot of zones where 60s have raids/dungs or farmables but too low (especially as a mostly solo leveling warrior, even my ZG luck hasn't been great for gear, and would be expected to tank) some of the pre-BIS dungeons like BRD. I guess I could do princess and ST a bit but after work I'm rarely looking to take on the responsibility of tanking. I'd also die 20 times trying to get to BRD to instance grind
---
I thought blasted lands would be fairly safe and got a decent 30k exp/hr for 20 mins starting the lower level quests until a horde 60 gank squad rolled through. Netherguard really needs higher level guards lol
---
Don't know who this guy is buy name seems fitting, he does sound like a clown.
---
An actual boomer is like 70.  I can probably count on one hand the number of boomers on 4chan.
---
Herod
---
Most are Gen X/Millenials lol. You're a Gen Z because you think everyone older than you is a Boomer.
---
It’s not about the honor. It’s about the ganking. 
---
Go to retail
---
#2
---
AFAIK, rank is required to purchase. After you have the item, you can equip regardless of rank decay.
---
Level 35s get honor for killing level 35s tho.
---
I've been there.  I learned all the good grinding spots to stay out of the way and under cover until 60.   Not the most fun way to play but it's how I got to 60.
---
i was joking that I was triggered lol
---
Is this on bigglesworth lol?
---
This is such a weird thing to say. I know plenty of successful people that stay up past 11.
---
No, this is "as it always was". BGs are separate from world PvP, which has always had these issues. 
---
Any BGs beyond "Capture the flag" were generally a hot mess of imbalanced map design that they never really fixed. 
---
The people who complained about PvP back then were always told "just do BGs" and the BGs were always full of people doing buggy exploitative shit or just Alliance sitting in AV until they inevebbed it . WoW has always had crappy pvp and devs who were never interested or lacked the dev time, but going from blue posts and memories it was usually the former.
---
JuSt KiLl ThEm BrO
---
Yeah and often that run includes golemlord so that’s more stuff people will want
---
It is ironic, Staysafe is involved with so much drama but never when it involves his corrupt guild. Joker never apologized, he specifically said he wasn’t sorry LOL. Staysafe is a liar and a poser. His whole image is based around him seeming like an Alpha male WoW player, when in reality he’s just sucking Joker’s dick cause he’s a content bro. SS is pathetic.
---
Except the Spanish inquisition didn't have anything to do with a Mexican sombrero?
---
Side note: why am I never invited to parties?
---
I definitely remember raiding being much harder in vanilla, we did not have the amount of data we have now, I still think the real kicker is gonna be personal responsibility, every raid adds more and more personal responsibility to not wipe everyone, and that is where people are going to fail.
---
&gt; It’s understandably frustrating, but it will be an incredible payoff when you hit 60.
---
It's really not. I hit 60 with one, and near 60 with another, and it's still complete crap. 60 mage with decent gear, but getting farmed by rogue duo's constantly. **Everywhere I go** there is some no-life rogue who delights in corpse camping. 
---
OP, there is no "payoff" for hitting 60 in regards to PvP. The PvP is insanely unbalanced, and not really fun, even when you're rolling around in a deathball killing everything.

I will elaborate. Classic is set patch 1.12 classic which is the very last patch before the TBC pre-patch which would imply it will be after the rank requirements to equip were removed but before it was converted to currency.

OK BOOMER

I was corpse camped by alliances the other night in epl ... there were so many alliances there, i didn’t know the server had lol

So you dont think about not being a pompous asshole when you post on Reddit?

Woosh? In the context of the meme thats dominated this sub lately boomer is 25-35 year olds

I feel useless in big WPvP fights: I´m not a huge pvper, but I tried some WPvP earlier  and I honestly feel useless when we´re in a large grp. 1 vs 1 and smaller groups are fun and I feel like I contribute as a rogue, but when it escalates to 40 vs 40 I feel like I can´t contribute.  
---
Any1 got any tips?  I try to stay in the outskirts and pick some loney guy off here and there, but yeah..
---
Gotta hey that Hydraxian rep grind!
---
That would be a dumb bet considering there is zero data to back it up besides an equal amount of people on both sides saying the exact opposite. If both factions claim the other faction is the "kids" faction, than neither of them are.
---
Bear dance has saved my life too.
---
It's "you 'ur"
---
There a guild on my realm that every week, without fail, posts on the realm subreddit looking for more people to join their raids for the coming week. Literally every single item is reserved. I wonder why they have to post every week?
---
There's pretty literally nothing else to do for decked out players. Until bgs are around I wouldn't expect high level questing to be very enjoyable.
---
i honestly havent looked at raiding since wotlk. I bought MoP at some point because I just had to see what this panda nonsense was about, the day I capped my character i completed all the raids i could access on lfg difficulty, was pretty dissapointed in the gameplay
---
LMFAO
---
Is that with forming your own groups as well?  Haven’t been outside the bulk pack of people leveling on my warrior, so I’m concerned how difficult it is to find those lowbie groups.
---
Because it was a really good design decision?
---
Imagine complaining that people that didn't want to take part in pvp could avoid it while not having to play on under populated pve servers.
---
Ole' Broken Tooth is about to get some hungry lion tail...
---
Got to work yesterday, my stomach went nuts, turns out I had a kidney stone, had surgery last night and 2 weeks (at least) off work fully paid.  Rank 3 here I come.
---
I literally hit a full hp hunter lv 45 (me, paladin, lv 42) from his mount while having 80% hp/50% mana. We both died simultaneously and he then camped me with another lv 45 warlock. I waited a bit and then killed the warlock twice.
---
PVP = circle of hate.
---
NEIGHHHHH
---
Wpvp, all the 60s are out killing people... trying to quest almost certainly means spending 50% of the time dead.
---
=[ rip
---
Starting a new character is not a very good option during prime hours.  Without layers its near impossible to finish quests in uncontested zones but mobs free up after prime hours.  Also depends on your server pop but its damn near impossible to play in some contested zones atm.
---
Yeah, come out of your damn cities you pussies so we can kill you. Tired of your sissy shit
---
I checked and all free transfers are to other PvP servers.
---
Ehh in those games I don’t really like how I’d get a really awesome rare weapon but if I don’t repair it it’s gone forever lmao at least in classic I don’t have to worry about that XD
---
I don't think so.  PvP transfers to other PvP servers.
---
Would be interesting to know, it's a pretty big buff to the helm in general. Curious to know if it also affects the amount of energy you get?
---
Stalagg on reddit: Blizzard please stop letting Alliance transfer from our server. The faction balance is already 70/30 and it's only going to get worst.
---
Also Stalagg on reddit: Lol, you want to transfer off the server? It's called a pvp server, noob. That means pvp happens whenever someone feels like it, not when *you* feel like it. You should've thought about this before you picked pvp.
---
&gt; it's called retail and it comes free with your classic subscription.
---
As someone that hasn't bought an expansion in years, battle for azeroth is free?
---
Most have never seen the unicorn, let alone the dance...
---
We have one Boomer in our guild and he's hilarious. Been playing with him since we were 15 and he was in his early 40s. Cranky old military guy, who always makes raids and has consumes because he's retired.
---
Oh baby it will persist on Grobbulus. Just look at Emerald Dream :)
---
That Boomkin has good taste
---
No they aren’t. It varies by state but if the internship is primarily an educational experience and does not contribute positively to the employer, it is legal to not pay the intern. In some states (e.g. California) the internship has to be overseen by an approved educational institution.
---
He'll make a fine president one day..
---
Paid transfer is probably coming sooner or later, keep on keeping on till then.

---
Where are some good places to quest for alliance in 30’s?
---
tl;dr version please
---
Why I said “I” and not making a general claim.
---
My guild ran BRD angerforge with every single warrior/rogue in our core group to get trinket soooo find a guild that isnt shit.
---
I wish they could get rid of it but at this point I feel like I have to have it because everyone else does. I’m already bad enough at pvp, I don’t need another handicap lol. Very broken though I agree, it feels like cheating.
---
You can take those glasses off, this shit did happen in vanilla.
---
Why are you assuming his faction is outnumbered? He hasn't, or hadn't by the time I replied, mentioned anything about faction imbalance or which realm he is playing on.
---
Probably the fact that they have never enjoyed it.
---
Try to focus on healers and prevent them from healing the raid, and use your CC abilities. Other than that, large scale pvp is pretty tough for rogues.
---
It's so stupid when people make claims like that based on their personal experience when the game has millions and millions of players. It's the same kind of mentality that breeds bigotry and racism.
---
Basically, if you think there are more kids on one side, you're a racist. /s
---
Anyone older than the person using it. I've seen middle school kids call highschool kids boomers.
---
I leveled from 50-54 open world last night. On benediction high population pvp server during primetime. Even got 50 hks after respeccing to soul link as to avoid getting 2 shot. I got destroyed by roving bands on alliance at least 20 times but I had the most fun leveling experience of classic so far. It's amazing seeing the world so alive with people. If ya'll cry loud enough they might open battlegrounds early.
---
Laughs in Druid
---
Well yea but isn't that like.. the main reason to roll on a pvp server? Those times where it's a fair fight in the open world?
---
1 honor kill does not give 200 points and I have no clue where you got that number.
---
It's just not a very good joke if you have to explain it to half the audience every time.
---
The best pvp is bring a rogue in ironforge when BGs come out.
---
I love that you actually think they are genuinely trying to insult you.
---
I’m new here
---
so push ups and  are nice and all but overall this advice is not the best because were all sitting all the time so we tend to have imbalances that favour the front, or the chest area which leads to rounded shoulders and bad posture.  with only training those parts this will make it only worse leading to bad posture. so don't forget stretching your chest maybe if you can try to put in some back workouts instead of only pushups.
---
Rogue is all about control.. use your cc to peel for healers and lock down kill targets
---
15 days too late
---
You're lying to yourself if you think this is fun. Half the people in this screenshot are mounted up and afk...
---
Now that's a lotta damage.
---
Yeah well your shield looks stupid, only a loser would use a blue shield
---
I have a level 16 Druid. When I get low on health I switch out of bear form to heal. Fairly often the mob will interrupt/cancel my healing spell continuously until I die. How should I handle this?
---
Yeah man, because its *such* a feat to have played on private servers.
---
What is it with pathetic losers like you who blindly worship these egomaniacal nerds?
---
Well Jesus, you don't do it while they're ON
---
It just changes the mindset of players towards more aggression. While you may normally avoid demounting to killing someone who is already half hp on a mob you now definetly will.
---
I punish lowbies for picking the wrong faction if I pass them, fuck 'em. They'll undoubtedly be in full raids camping me once they level up, since my server is about 80-20 horde to alliance.
---
My favorite is going to an area with a lot of them, slaughtering 5+ and leaving one left. I just /wave and ride into the sunset.
---
What does it say
---
snowflake cry more lvl 60 camping a 35 is fucking behing a cunt ;)
---
Find a nice quite place and just grind out mobs. I've been grinding turtles in Hinterlands for two days now without getting ganked once. It will calm down in a week or so, so I'm just going to grind till i does.
---
To allow cities to not be absolutely overrun and camped
---
Yeah same thing in making groups. I’ll see multiple people spam lfg for the same dungeon and no one wants to take the initiative to make the group.
---
This lfg Spellcleave pvp?
---
Grobbulus, Benediction, Sulfuras are all pretty close to 50/50
---
&gt;  You are not special.
---
That's wrong.  Tanks are special.
---
If you're gonna cry about getting ganked just roll on a pve server
---
Dope racial indeed.
---
Just because some people use the term incorrectly online doesn't make it the new definition, Zoomer.
---
The context of "Ok Boomer" is more akin to ostracizing someone from the collective. It's closer to calling someone a nerd because they don't like everything you like than calling them old from the way you guys use it, now that nerd is socially acceptable.
---
TLDR: Zoomers are annoying.
---
Warrior might want 2h from Balnazzar.
---
I believe everything up to BFA is free but you do have to buy the most recent expansion to hit max level.
---
I play a warrior.  Even if I knew someone were close I couldn't do anything about it.
---
I'd rather enjoy the last couple moments of bliss than see the reaper coming; I like to imagine my death like the children travelling in steerage on the Titanic.  That is to say, not at all, as my parents - choking back tears of hopelessness and adoration - read me my final bedtime story.
---
Your post history is sad dude.

Lol what? We stopped playing vanilla because burning crusade came out.

He’s calling you a NEET

PvE servers are gonna ease your pain

We only speak American in here

You should charge in, blood rage, then do whatever ya want
---
I love how you think no one cares about ninja'ing. I mean, if no one cared, it wouldn't be frowned upon.
---
The only people who don't care are the sad pathetic people who have his cock so far down their throats, the only thing that they do care about is when they're going to get their next gasp of air.
---
As others said, I had no idea servers would be bigger and things would be so different. 
---
Doesn’t have anything about being on my « terms ». Before phase 2, I enjoyed every fight I’ve hads, fair or not. 
---
Right now, quest hubs are camped by horde and dungeons entrances too. My server isn’t balanced, I don’t have any backing numbers but I’d guess 60:40 to 65:35 H:A. 
---
It’ll eventually settle. By then, I’ll wait for phase 3.
---
70% armor mitigation is getting me all hot and heavy over here.
---
No honor to be sure, but plenty of the like.
---
Yes theyre sick, i used em till I got devilsaur.

Your fault for rolling on a PvP server.  Should have taken off your nostalgia glasses when you chose a server for classic.

I'm horde on Grob and there are a lot more alliance than Horde, a lot
---
what does the honor cap at?
---
As someone who bought a "gaming" laptop, all I can said that it is avoid them. They are too big, too heavy, heat up too much &amp;  use your battery so fast to carry around.
---
My 15 Alienware laptop has 97kw battery and it is gone in 3 h playing hearthstone. Unless you have a reliable power outlet at all time. It is not worth it.
---
No it's not, that's not what the meme means.
---
Yes I have, PvP just became enabled so people are going to to go crazy this weekend then it will calm the fuck down. Some people will still farm honor the vast majority of players aren't going for rank 14 or even rank 7 they just want rank 3 for their discount.
---
Hey, sorry I meant to say “not” helpful after 51 as they’d probably be grey. 
---
Can you join a sunken temple or brd group?
---
Your argument is as simply stated as this....     
---
    
---
"My internet is to slow, lets upgrade the RAM, CPU and GPU and maybe my internet will be faster."     
---
Thats your argument.. which is straight up not how data processing works you dumb fuck.
---
I'm 60 on DD. Its low pop, but I've never had problems finding groups, even though I'm PST and the server is EST. Even found a full raid to farm honor with yesterday at 12pm on a Thursday lol. I really enjoy the community as well.
---
Somebody is a cranky boy.
---
Ok elder
---
I'm just going to hazard a guess that you were recently killed were killed during an escort quest.
---
Tell us what happened, it'll help.
---
Dungeon spam
---
Life is good of you're a bear or a warrior.
---
After you kill a mob with drain soul, you gain 100% bonus Mana Regen for 15 seconds, you don't need to tap your Mana will Regen on it's own while you walk to the next mob. Life tap is an amazing ability but when leveling it's far more efficient to let imp drain soul do the work so you get free Mana instead of trading your health for Mana.
---
You\`re a caster with plate-lvl armor, heals and a ton of CC. Why would you need a survival tactics?
---
Idk why, but I honestly can't even tell that it is 3d printed. That shit is tight.
---
I’d recommend just running dungeons or an alt until the PvP dies down. It should die down after a few weeks and definitely when BGs come out, which could be very soon
---
Bro I have tried to form groups. Horde are just better in numbers... Alliance refuses to form groups to retake fps, inns, etc. I've tried for hrs just to end up playing with my friend
---
I don't think it will have too big of an impact. Guilds will likely gear up their characters or alta s first, and there are probably more sinew coming in from WS anyways. The bosses have long respawns
---
So many people. There are dozens of you!
---
In all seriousness awesome!!! Looks like it was fun.
---
Nothing can help being outnumbered 5:1 in pvp unless you're organized and experienced like APES
---
I'm not saying it's priority number one by any means, just that it's not a throwaway stat like the person I responded to said. And I would take 10 spirit over 5 Stam or int on an item while yes.
---
Find out the way areas to grind mobs, dungeons, wait a week after the intial 'omg gotta pvp all day' settles down. Or complain I guess.
---
I’ve been playing obsessively since Classic released but I unsubbed today. World PvP wasn’t like this in vanilla at all. The servers are far too over-populated and people can’t farm honor in battlegrounds right now so the open world is a huge grief-fest.  It’s not fun being ganked by 100 players and it’s not fun to be in a group doing that to others either.
---
It’s more like a DDoS on people’s game sessions rather than good PvP! 
---
I’ve got 11 days of play time left but I’ll probably not renew until BGs arrive.  It should settle down then.
---
Some mobs have very long paths in DMN so I think its best to see what you run into because it can vary based on how fast you are clearing
---
Then roll on a pve server 
---
wait what?
---
DHKs do not affect your standing. DHKs result in an immediate drop in rank points, which depending on your current number of rank points might mean a drop in rank too. You are correct in that they don't affect anything for the first week, though, seeing as we don't have any rank points yet either.
---
I don't have invis and I'm not an engi but I'm 99% sure it would reveal you as soon as you start the cast.
---
Your keybindings are giving me anxiety.
---
Haha, yeah, I’ve actually been doing ST and BRD. Def prefer BRD but getting through searing gorge has gotten challenging
---
thank you! F streamers and people who watch them
---
AOE groups in BRD doing gorshak can get very fast levels, if you can get a good group thats a good spot
---
300v300 works fine on my server... full servers are just too many people pure and simple.
---
I think most spells that aren't on the GCD can be used but don't quote me on that I don't play a stealth class.
---
Nah. It actively lowere your current honor, which is only given at the end of the week. You're fine until tuesday
---
Takes 5 minutes for people coming in to drop their PvP flag, whether it's by FP, portals or HS. It also "spreads" to those who cast buffs on people who are still PvP flagged.
---
There is no battle in BFA
---
There is a reason this game isn't called World of Peacecraft. 
---
We are experiencing the release of content phases similar to what was experienced by the Vanilla players. Granted, I hope this phase is shorter than the past one but I've never played in a game where the only active PvP is world PvP. Very unique phase. I'll enjoy it for what it is. 
---
Getting into Blackrock Mountain can be a hassle but it was also hit or miss last phase depending on which faction was dominant at the time. The only adjustment I can suggest is fine either long/full dungeon runs or groups that are willing to spam the dungeon or a portion of it a few times.
---
Why is staying up late to play a child's video game worse than playing a child's video game during the day
---
Southshore, STV, Arathi highlands, shimmering flats, desolace, duskwallow marsh. 30-40 has a lot of zones available, but you quickly run out quests around your level in each zone, so you have to hop around. I spent most my time in STV and would fill xp gaps with the other zones I listed + scarlet monestary
---
Nah you a bitch if you do it /s
---
The aspects weren't created by the watchers, they were empowered by the watchers.
---
Red is dead
---
Likely answer, a nameless proto dragon
---
Explain to me how to use the joke then since I clearly don't get it. What is an appropriate example?
---
That's a great point I will need a more sleek version of a gaming laptop.
---
&gt;Gnomes (Like Lord of the Rings!)
---
Did you read a bootleg Limewire version of LotR?
---
If only you weren’t such an insufferable twat you might have had some backup.
---
I do this now when flying to Thorium Point - when I am just about over BRM.
---
no, u
---
No one is able to answer that since it's a comparative system and as such the effort required for any given rank is going to depend on how much effort everyone else is putting in. This is what makes mafias so valuable because if everyone agrees to take it easy and stick to the proposed plan of who-gets-what-rank, you are able to significantly cut down how much effort people need to put in to be sure of getting the progress they want.
---
If you're on a pvp server, organized high level groups are out in such force that it is debilitating.
---
On PvE servers it's not much of an issue for most of us.
---
Agree here. I travel for work. I use a Sony vaio that has everything I need. My old gaming laptop with a super beefy graphics card basically had to be plugged in all the time
---
“Play the game”
---
You literally can’t when you’re being deleted by armies of horde in every damn zone.
---
Ya but nobody will be able to see them for a week and a half.
---
😂
---
What if those 5 minutes are as a ghost? I know they changed it in retail but if I remember right you could inflag by waiting 5 minutes as a ghost.
---
die alliance piss
---
At some point I read that according to parses from raids boomies are 0.08% of the player population. On a realm with 65k people that leaves room for 26 moonkin per faction.
---
But that's exactly the farm that gives rogues depression. My god, that shit is boring.
---
Ok Boomer
---
It's localized too. I've seen some fun ones on my German server. My personal contribution (H &gt; A) is: "üö Ÿ ƒ f ƒ ƒ j" - geh kakkn.
---
this meme would actually be good if people actually used it for the good reasons
---
Rogues like myself get fucked with this shitty addon.
---
So alliance got it first.Kudos to Horrigan ,horde needs to admit it
---
Yeah I really haven't seen this as a big deal since you can just buy a 120 token on retail.
---
One can hope. I cannot wait for BGs. As someone not interested in PvE the game still feels very empty.
---
This addon is so stupid.. On my hunter I can watch for stealth warning, press the player name and huntersmark. As long as I do this fast I mark you, even if you stealthed, because of batching. 
---
Also with Track Hidden on, there is a delay between you stealthing and actually being invicible, this allows me to see you on the mini map, when the warning goes off. Flare --&gt; kill you. I know I can see you even without the warning from the addon, but I'm not staring on my mini map 24/7. Because of this I only have to have a quick look every time Spy warns me..
---
Hey, that's my server!  I watched this druid bring him thru Redridge a little bit ago.  I asked him where he was going and he said "South shore".  I knew some shenanigans were gonna ensue.
---
Yeah, guess I’ll have to do that. Thanks
---
Lol love it...that and VolChan being in Hillsbrad
---
Forsaken can apparently say it with Gutterspeak as well. Not sure what the code is, though.
---
Unfortunately I think they nerfed the exp on those pretty early into classic, based on wow forum posts.
---
I am currently compiling a list of Alliance to Horde insults you can spam to people...
---
I am usually working on them (instead of leveling) and do it on stream or in my discord with some friends.
---
Ill be back in a day or two (if i dont lose the page, or if I am reminded) and might have a little list compiled.
---
Yes, but it is very hard to contribute to the PvE elements if not 60.
---
Ah yes I remember you
---
U/Doomgoat just realized you were the druid.  Nice
---
We have 1 boomkin in our raid that we put in our mage group for that sweet 3% spell crit buff. Hell yeah I want to stand next to big bird! Gimme dem frostbolt crits!
---
I don’t remember “reserve” ever being used. “Dibs!” might have been pretty common.
---
I just do now what I did back then; if there’s an item I really, really want out of a dungeon, I’ll say so at the start. Most groups just give it to me. Granted, daggers rogues are so rare, most people don’t even care about competing for the weapons. I’m sure I’ll have more competition going after my Shadowcraft set.
---
But I’m literally in between :/
---
On Venoxis as well. Alliance made the kill!
---
Exp gain was added in WOLTK as a way to force twinks out of brackets. Prior to that BGs gave no experience.
---
my experience is the complete opposite, when i picked a side in 04 i picked horde along with my friends. i was 14/15 at the time
---
Why even play at all? Just buy a char with full MC gear and you wont have to log on.
---
Ok, boomer.
---
Couldn't you make the same argument for gold buying? "I earned the mount on private servers, so do I really need to earn it in classic?" If you replace "the mount" with "level 60" it's the same question.
---
The entire point of this game is fairness within the game world. You only get what you earn. Bringing real life advantages into it to buy levels? Yeah that's wrong. It's against the game rules and against the spirit.
---
Tbf, I feel like this post is mostly fishing for PMs offering leveling services.
---
I’m 46 in phase 2 because I don’t AoE farm and I work full time and have a life besides WoW haha my /played is like 5 days.
---
Well...glad you at least got to be frustrated about the lag.
---
I rolled on Faerlina, in fact I subscribed, after at least 10 yeears, just becuase I knew that with Asmon 'King of the spergs' there with his leaigons of followers and haters it was going to be a jolly fun time!
---
Now...my characters are there and every time I get a chance to play there's a 240+ minute queue.
---
I bought some $29 package to be able to play classic and 3 months of game time for this.  I guarantee you I wont be buying any more time.  Blizzard needs to recognize that being able to play WHERE you want to and have a reasonably good experience, whether it's lag or queue times, is incredibly important to some players.  
---
I know it is to me and I'm really upset that a company full of people who know everything about MMO's and have decades of experience in the business can't figure out some way to adjust the amount of hardward, bandwidth, or whatever to mirror the choices the players have made about what realm they wish to play on.
---
I didn't like the layers either but at least most of the time I had a 30 min or less queue time.  Removing the layers without having another solution was a real dick move.  Now I have to watch all these people having a great time this weekend while I either wait in an endless queue or play on some low pop wasteland that I have no desire to be on.
---
slightly more impressive than the rogue ganking a fresh 60 and failing miserably
---
Take a look at the Acer aspire series. Look professional and not gamey.
---
People are posting acting like he's never going to be able to play WoW again since his "reputation" is ruined. I think the people on the reddit post were more upset than the people in the raid at this point.
---
It's not tied to age, it's a certain mentality.
---
Is it morally wrong? No. It's a game and this has very little consequence. Is it allowed? No. Do I personally agree with it? No.
---
Every 5 days.
---
Hell Yeah Brother !
---
Fair enough atleast i got honest feedback
---
That doesn't even make any sense lmfao younger people don't watched LOTR
---
they 100% were
---
i transferred from Chromaggus to bloodhoof
---
which was PVP to PVE
---
Gave up on open PVP servers a loooong time ago.  Not just this game but everywhere.  
---
Anonymous environments.  People have no integrity when there's no accountability. 
---
I get why people enjoy it.  It's fun when you're in the mood to embrace it, but when you're having a day where you just don't want to deal with it, guess what?  You're stuck anyway and the only option is to get camped or log off, or reroll, which it shouldn't come down to. 
---
Just isn't relaxing and honestly too much bullshit for my tastes though.
---
Horde by far.
---
Just give me the new models blizz. Old players can use their old models. I just wanna have my fun.
---
It’s worth it if you somehow fell into the trench of being a PvP ranker and are in a raid team where Ragnaros refuses to drop 2Hs. It’s better than OBE and Demonshear at this gear level.
---
Regardless on right / wrong with your hypothesis , always go with the tin foil
---
Horde is better almost everywhere if you ask me. For example, you'll spend a lot of time in STV, and Gromgol is extremely convenient.
---
Spy already doesn't read enemy movement because it isn't in the log.  You can walk right up to someone using spy and not trigger spy, so long as you don't use any abilities that show up in log.
---
what about wolf howl? ive found that if i dont wait half the cast speed it wastes the buff on the autoshot even though the hit triggered a half second before i cast the buff.
---
I’m 60 and it took me over an hr to turn in a quest that was 10 ft away from fp....
---
Unless you want to play a broken ass game then I’d suggest transferring to one of the few dead servers they let you go too. Sadly I’ve done this and it’s honestly nice that I can play the game but is dead at night. Big urge to just call it quits till they fix lag and maybe put in bgs. 
---
My server was about H70%-A30%. I’d say it’s even worse when you log in now since horde camps every city and area worth going to. Raid on IF and Darn at the same time, not including ss.
---
This isn’t a competition for having the worst weapon
---
No one is saying there wasn't any lag back in 2005. We're saying we've been doing this fine for the last 5 years on $200/mo russian servers, why can't a multi-billion quarterly revenue company at least be close to on par with them.
---
yea tried it once, as a melee its pointless, nothing is in range and when the lag snaps back you are dead
---
im just gonna raid log and AFK in IF till BGs exist
---
I'm a Warlock and have never felt even remotely threatened by any Druid, even while leveling and getting "ganked" (lol deathcoil&gt;fear&gt;dot&gt;dance)
---
It's not rock paper scissors, its paper vs a papershredder
---
You suck it up and return the favor in due time.
---
Just transferred from Stalagg! Didn't realize we were that outnumbered but that's much more fun than the other way around.
---
Always an option. It’s about price to performance and getting the best for your buck IMO.
---
If you can play at 100fps and spend 500$ or play at 30 and not be able to raid for 200$, what would you pick?
---
How did he ruin WoW for you?
---
Then why did he make multiple videos talking about him going to the dentist?
---
Whoa you're so chad
---
It's assumed that any rogue that's asking this question is using instant.
---
Lol "jUsT lEaD". Easy to say when horde outman alliance on every server.
---
EPIC
---
Buying a leveling service is not nearly as bad as botting or buying hacked gold.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Ah, so there totally WAS evidence of 300v300 fights without lag running on Russian toasters, but it's sadly gone now and we'll just have to believe you.
---
Oh, what's that? Your girlfriend goes to a different school? In Canada?
---
Ignore these backseat neckbeards and keep learning through playing.
---
St Leonard's?
---
Yeah hopefully WSG will be out soon. Rival guild fights are fun but large scale WPVP is mostly just lame back and forth between either zerg numbers or consumables.
---
In my opinion, that's probably a good thing. Server populations are much higher now, so we will need more Azuregos and Kazzac spawns to compensate. Anything less than 24 hours though is probably too much.
---
It’s not right though. The whole point of rogue is to be sneaky and not have a buzzer go off whenever you press stealth.
---
You are welcome to try mate, jaimaster, come take your best shot :)
---
"Ima camp a NE hunter" hah
---
Nah, when the butt of the joke is the person that you're calling clueless and out of touch then they don't need to get it
---
I love "3 1 p ‡ 2 Ÿ Š 2 öh ž À 1 ‡ 2 11" which translates to the Horde as "y o u re an e vil ko re an"
---
You could go pvp --&gt; pve, but not the other way.
---
Wait until you are 48
---
It was a one way transfer. Only those that were on a PVP server could go to a PVE server. Not the other way around.
---
I’m on arcanite reaper. Had a 50 on 50 match last night in hillbrad and it was amazing. Zero lag, tons of back and forth, strategies about splitting up and baiting groups then flanking them with groups of mages. You’re just not finding the right battles my friend.
---
No one cares at all
---
There's also nothing morally wrong with this tank choosing to not participate in such a system. If you want a tank that will participate in such a system, tank it yourself?
---
thanks man, worked for me too
---
You obviously never participated in a faction incursion with war mode turned on
---
It’s an easy way to get scammed.
---
It's relatively balanced teams instead of zergfests where one of the zergs is 4 times as large as the other.
---
Lol I was just going to downvote sand level but this made me laugh.
---
Dying multiple times in MC and I still pay less than 2g after a night of it as a clothie
---
Phase 2 just dropped. It will slow after a week. And if you play that infrequent a weeks should be too big of a deal.
---
Hope you find happiness.
---
It's literally "Ok, whatever" really
---
Saddly there are enough worthless pieces of shit for this to be an issue.
---
Ok zoomer.
---
Horde here on bigglesworth, currently getting stomped by the alliance
---
Alliance is little kids and adults who have their shit together.
---
It depends on the expansion, original Alliance was the kids faction, BC and wotlk it became Horde because blood elves, and then back to Alliance at whatever point worgs were added.
---
/hug ?
---
There’s a father/son combo in my guild, boomers gave birth to zoomers, we are all the same
---
They're an endangered species.  Killing them results in a DK.
---
Exactly, go to SS where y’all can lag out with each other and watch your DK’s stack up.
---
I don't think they're looking to see if they will get honour or not they just see someone from the other faction and charge.
---
Yeet that apparatus my way, family. I too am one of the children. You can tell because my urban colloquialisms match the other two commentors.
---
This guy addies
---
The worst part is that they draw so much power that batteries doesn't last more than 1.5 years. That 3 hour of hearthstone is a new too. 
---
I also do travel alot. I picked Alienware cuz they are dell. Laptops tend to fall apart after one years old when you travel. Dell has one of the better international premium warranty. I had my motherboard replaced/fixed in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Toronto within 3-4 days. They also have 24 hour phone support.
---
Don't get this whole "I rolled pvp server but I keep getting fucked so I'll complain about it constantly" mentality. Do they really not get it?
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer?full=1
---
While the "ok boomer" thing is basically a new spin on "whatever, gramps", the recent usage of "boomer" in gaming context is from this meme.
---
How is it possible to beat a priest in PVP as a druid? It seems like they just... fear you away from them with psychic scream when you close, dot you, then run away until the scream cooldown is over, then repeat endlessly. I don't have the mana to kill them by rooting them and moon/starfiring them to death when they just heal it. 
---
Am level 34, and have been trying to kill a 29 priest, and it just seems like Blizzard didnt' even want to make that possible- am I missing something critical?
---
Smolderweb is 45;55 according to ironforge
---
How does that work exactly?
---
Just saying they died like zombies in zf,  well done.
---
Nobody who actually played private servers calls live wow retail. 
---
If you're paying to play it, it's *retail*.
---
Screenshots like this make me regret rolling PVE. I’m sure PVP isn’t all fun and sunshine, but images of this are things of great memories
---
And it has more stability. The fuck are you on about? The fact that servers can even handle hundreds of people in one area without fully crashing shows more stability than 2005.
---
Be level 60 already
---
Don't roll a pvp server
---
Hope you're on the side with higher pop and get into dungeon runs
---
Same, I just dont get the appeal of it. Literally have of a session is getting ganked and harassed. Where is the fun in that?
---
I actually used to have an aspire. It was semi bulky but then again I had a 21" screen lol. Can anyone attest to a 15" screen and whether that's comfortable to play on? 
---
Can I play wow on a Microsoft surface pro?
---
Because how are they meant to know if you're working with the other faction? People have access to Discord now, an application that's completely out of Blizzard's control, what kind of proof would they have?
---
Is that because you have improved ambush essentially twice (with vanish), and then you finish them off with improved backstab and a big eviscerate?
---
If not, what would be the general strategy/rotation for a subtlety rogue in PVP?
---
You could always transfer from PvP to PvE but never the other way around.
---
It's been around since 2009, it's not going anywhere.
---
Let's get down to business
---
To defeat the Horde
---
No more farming Stratholme
---
No more being Bored
---
We're the toughest bunch I've ever met
---
And we'll show them that it's true
---
Doesn't hurt
---
That we outnumber them times two
---
It is.
---
As a resto druid I'm honestly contemplating making another druid to play feral.  Without the keyring coming yet, bag space for a 2nd set is pretty much not happening.
---
If you're farming HoJ I'd recommend looking into the prices on your server for carries, removes having to worry about replacing or getting non-60s to the entrance
---
&gt;[This](https://www.newegg.com/black-acer-aspire-7-a715-71g-7588-gaming-entertainment/p/1TS-000X-00RV6?Item=1TS-000X-00RV6) is the one i bought. I agree that they are kinda bulky.  But they look pretty good, and the specs i got for the price $700 last year made it very affordable with a banging processor. As for comfort I do not particularly have a problem but i don't play on my lap and typically will play at a desk or counter top.
---
Yeah, it's literally the first few days.  The hype will die down.
---
It’s understandable though since when I’m LFG I’m too busy multitasking to build a grp, don’t know the dungeon well enough, don’t have key, or simply find a group really fast by just LFG. 
---
A lot of times me and a random will whisper one another and ask if we want to start a grp together...
---
Y’all kids who complain in LFG channel need something better to do. There’s an addon that manages LFG chat so you don’t have too see certain things. Feel free to black people for no good reason.
---
Alright, cool, thought the name look familiar
---
wat
---
I think you need to look up what generation "boomer" refers to.
---
i don't kill non-honor targets, but i still get it an respect it? it's a game, man. to decree another human as "a worthless piece of shit" for doing something *in a video game*, i dunno, seems a little extreme?
---
if you're having a hard/frustrating time leveling due to honor being released, either just wait a couple weeks for the hype to die down, or stop playing the game. either way i think the world will be ok, without having to call into question people's moral standards over actions performed within a video game.
---
Yeah, you're right. No idea why i thought dropping combat was like that.
---
Wow that’s really nice. I also ALWAYS carry on my laptop in my bag! Never check it if you don’t have to! I’ve had my bags busted up too many times. 
---
Also, you don’t need the big power hungry graphics cards for wow classic. It’s a 15 year old game.
---
I tried camping him after resets on both layers, nothing.
---
I live by myself.
---
nope, it has 669 as i type this, and yours is the second last, so it's 668th
---
I'm a tier 3 Asmon sub who has donated over 1,000 dollars and given him over 1,000 gold. I have attended his MC runs and let him have all the gear. If I ever see you in Azeroth, you are done for. I will more than likely get an "atta boy" from him on stream and that makes it all worth while.
---
Makes sense
---
Don’t install Spy then? I’ve never used it, and it may be because I haven’t paid attention to it at all, but I don’t feel any need that Spy could satisfy
---
Feel the exact same way, transferred after a few hours of greif and now I feel I don’t have a nice populated server to play on. I enjoyed the PvP and never minded getting killed every now and then due to pvp but this isn’t even close to fun or fair. 
---
Like didn’t the devs see this shit coming? I know there going to take a big blow for this.
---
Don't forget the 2 hour queues.
---
Tin foil hats are for filthy casuals... I'm rocking the full Tier 2 Faraday set right now. ;)
---
gotcha, yea i could not remember when that happened but i know i did it cause i did PVP-PVE in vanilla and then brought that toon back to PVP in wrath
---
That's not how the world works.
---
I make my daughter playing jumping game in stormwind haha
---
They give that crit buff to other casters in their group. It's dope
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 48 to get ganked in fucking phase 2 classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand pushups playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most pushups ever on this game. The first guy to get ganked. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
It was available under a different name in vanilla it will never be removed without completely breaking combat log.
---
Make sure to tell them to only have 5 though right? 
---
Ohh yea BGs are fair not wpvp.
---
This
---
Skeletons... skeletons everywhere.
---
The point still stands. Be very careful around him.
---
I'd bet everything I own that he wants something. And that isn't to play wow and have a great relationship with his wife's child.
---
If he wanted that he'd simply be playing wow and keeping in touch through the game.
---
You realize that not every person that is playing this game had enough existing knowledge to know that near every PVP server was going to be hella Horde stacked, right? Some people started it up, and thought, "oh, PVP, that will be cool" because when it's a 1v1 or small to mid scale pvp skirmishes it is very fun.
---
What's not particularly fun is every 40+ zone having 150 Horde level 60s rolling over every town and quest area with impunity because there's literally not enough Alliance population to compete with them. Acting like people should have to be happy about that because they thought that they might want to do world PVP is a tad ridiculous.
---
It's unfortunate that Blizzard didn't bother to do literally any sort of faction balancing at all, especially when some of the private servers did a pretty good job of it. Of course, there have always been imbalanced servers, but I don't ever recall it being so bad back in the day - and it feels more extreme now just due to how much BIGGER every server is.
---
LFG addons that parse channels do the exact same thing, yet are banned.
---
No u
---
Ironic.
---
I must be missing something here, you have time to raid but not to level?
---
Yes please omg.  Let the horde sit in queue for hours instead of outnumbering us 3 to 1
---
I saw a new one from an alliance today that was 5 lines and essentially came out to "you have a small Weiner". I wasnt even mad, it's hilarious.
---
Is there a way to see stats on a guild before you join it? Number of members, average level, etc
---
Not at all my concern, but thank you for the response.
---
Step 4: why TF is this on reddit.
---
I feel like you just took the layman’s definition of ‘rational’ and then just linked Wikipedia to shut down argument hoping nobody would take a look at the article.  For everybody’s benefit, here’s the majority of the first paragraph of the linked article. 
---
&gt; The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism). Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.
---
One would be, then, hard pressed to say that tanks acting to discourage reserve groups are acting irrationally.   ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You rolled a PvP server. Stop complaining.
---
Sure; but there are multiple spawn locations for the TLPD and other people with the same idea, so I wouldn't get my hopes up too much.
---
Don't be talking crap about the Trolls, man. They are the coolest.
---
"fame" isn't defined by what you specifically do/like/follow.
---
Sry to tell you this, but you are insignificant.
---
Wilco sux
---
Druids can win if they root you, outrange your Fear (it only has 24 yard range talented) and kill you from a distance. If you start at point blank range, then yeah, you can Death Coil into Fear and there is nothing they can do without a PvP trinket.
---
55 war I feel the pain I been just leveling ashara and running ST
---
40 rogue MC next
---
Yeah.....no one believes you.....
---
Thank you for reading my post and answering informatively. This is all I wanted to know!
---
Se escribe: QUE EL FUEGO TE PURIFIQUE.
---
Ok boomer
---
I knew that'd trigger someone lol
---
I like how “go back to retail” somehow became an insult.
---
Link them then. If they absolutely are, so me all the top voted people who thinks lag in wow is new.
---
Tfw the PVP/Honor system works so stupidly the only realistic way for players to enjoy the game is to switch to a brand new server :/
---
&gt; https://wow.gamepedia.com/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas)
---
A lot of that information isn't accurate, though.
---
If they only give us one BG I'd prefer it be AB as it was always more fun then WSG and less time intensive then AV
---
These gems used to also be vendor trash on firemaw for quite some time in the start. Supply slowly declined on these items due to many people being levelled now and people can easily spare a bit more money via mains so prices increased. It isn't predictable how the market on your server changes though, but with time prices should increase because of people generating more gold in the economies pool.
---
RP-PvP servers.
---
But ally always have at least twice the number of people before they attack anyone
---
my favorite creation:
---
You (Alliance) say: € p ƒ ƒ 3 Ä 2 Ÿ Š ƒ € 1 3 € 2 Ÿ 34 ‡ 
---
Horde will read: b u s s y m e a n s b o y b e a ve r
---
It’s the most popular alliance race
---
Ambush crits aren’t fun for me as a clothie
---
Time to reroll lol should have selected the superior faction anyways the breakdown isn’t nearly that bad anyways horde are just better 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/rankings/5025/1000#metric=speed
---
I'm talking about people quitting entirely, or re-rolling to a different server. You can't force people to be corpse camped so you can honor farm.
---
You can type /who &lt;guild name&gt; and it will return people in that guild which can give you a sense of size and some of the members.
---
It's not but if you can't find a group for pvp it's your only option, there's no solo pvp that isn't killing questers and those zones are usually roamed by death balls
---
Go heal your mom please
---
Still doesn't make sense.
---
Is a cancer called spy and will never be banned cause nochanges crew use it.
---
dude look at the other video, the reck one is just another method of having a burst without relying on plate gear
---
A semi-skilled warrior will win against every class but frost mage 8/10 of the time in open WorldPvP, just FYI. 
---
Was true when I played in vanilla and (somehow) people are even worse at PvP now than they were then, so it's doubly true.
---
your won't have much left, and that will be easily taken by another SoC crit. have a nice day
---
Lol thanks
---
Pretty chill server. Sure some goons around; but for the most part my leveling experience was great. Unsure what things are like now, but general chat seems not toxic 9/10 of the times I fly through. 
---
Careful around Goldshire or the Mage District of SW though. (usually some questionable RP going on)
---
Step 1: Read entirety of OP's post history. 
---
Step 2: Realize this post and anything else OP has to say is totally fabricated.
---
Priest is Druids worst matchup. Particularly when levelling when you don't have your choice of trinkets try to dodge the fear if you can, they don't have any other CC. But really you have pretty limited options 1v1.
---
A rogue using stealth near you should never be in your log cause it doesn't affects you at all
---
Yeah, like I said.  I get why ~~some~~ most people enjoy it.  I miss it sometimes, but it's only like 10 percent of the time that I do. 
---
 
---
I play to relax though and it's totally worth playing on Normal servers when I'm coming home and not in the mood for that business.  Never had a problem finding people when I do flag for PVP, people see you flagged and you can just see them lingering around you until you drop your guard and they try to sucker punch with an opener after a few minutes.  There's fun to be had when the mood occurs.
---
You just do /pvp and it flags you. Enemy can attack but it will flag them too. We did TM/SS last night on BB with about 40v40 and lag wasn't bad or anything. Good times.
---
I'm not saying it's everyone else's problem. I'm just saying that Blizzard should consider paid transfers away from pvp servers now that the honor system is out. No harm done imo
---
That is false.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
You last post said your wife wanted you to quit your guild.  Which is it?
---
Probably this is just due to inexperience. You don't know where quests exactly are. Which quests could've been skipped etc. On my second character I saved 3 days of levelling time by just not doing things like 20min waiting for a quest mob to spawn or just plainly skipping a quest knowing it will take so long without much reward or any follow ups. On my second character I didn't bother to level a profession and I knew where to pick up quests to open more questlines in my next levelling zone. Like getting 2 or 3 quests in orgrimar to open more quests in a zone. Netting more xp/h.
---
Druids can shift out of polymorph in vanilla. Don't even need to pre-shift it.
---
Idr where they came from but the blue Ankleguards. I get made fun of weekly for running around barefoot lmao
---
&gt; boomers gave birth to zoomers
---
Unlikely. The youngest boomer out there is 55 years old. 
---
Once again, Gen-X holds the title of The Forgotten Generation.
---
Did they? I know they aren’t considered terribly profitable, didn’t hear about the dp part as well. Maybe tho
---
Also wolfshead is 10 (don't tell blizz)
---
Gimme that big L
---
Riding a roller coaster does not involve skill but lots of people find them fun.  The same thing can be said about TM vs SS.  It's about being in a large battle that's a total cf.
---
I don't mind 1v1 world pvp while leveling. I don't mind group fights outside of instances.
---
But when I'm trying to level by myself and I get ganked within a minute of rezzing, by the same duo, 10 times in a row....thats stops being fun real quick. I enjoy almost all pvp, but not corpse camping lowbies or unfair fights.
---
With the Spy addon, how can I move the "X player has Stealthed" message to another part of the screen?
---
I'm also wondering how to move the default FPS display in WoW.
---
As far as I know, there was a time where you only could sign in at the actual places in world, ashenwale,arati highlands, hillsbrad etc.... but I guess we get end patch meaning we can sign in Major City?
---
As I participated in the SS v TM back and forth the past 24 hours I imagined it reflecting human battle psychology before gunpowder.  Huge hordes facing off with few dozen yards separating each from the other. Sniping back and forth with ranged attacks helping to keep the sides separate until the inevitable charge, either resulting in a break of the lines &amp; the subsequent mass destruction of the fleeing faction OR the charging faction being swallowed up by the superior numbers and the entire charge being engulfed and slaughtered before a counter charge wipes out the opposing faction.  Imagine if the Roman Legions and Barbarian Hordes each had graveyard respawn points 2 minutes run from the battlefield.  It would look just like Hillsbrad in Phase 2.
---
Lmao dude you're delusional
---
... isn't this whole post real world politics?
---
1946-1964. yes
---
&gt; They get the joy of
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; make others quit the game
---
This is human shit.  There's a difference between ganking targets of opportunity, and camping to make lowbies lives miserable.
---
If you enjoy playing to make other people's lives miserable, you are a piece of shit by definition.  Someone who wasn't a worthless pile of garbage would get no enjoyment from ruining other peoples day for no reason.
---
Buttery males!
---
I don't think you understand what a meme is.
---
Jokes on you I’m already on retail.
---
I'd say it's closer to half doing end game, half casuals
---
Looks like Gordon
---
I don't necessarily disagree but god, "heheheheh its the world of WARcraft" type statements are the wpitome of smallbrain.
---
Nah. I played vanilla. There weren’t 3 to 1 imbalances everywhere and 2x-3x server pops.
---
You assume a fixed flow of gold into the game which is totally unchanged by the cost of respeccing, as opposed to people farming extra gold specifically to respec.
---
Sorry, forgot to get back to you. Here ya go. Shows 21 casts of "core rat" which is apparently the invisible NPC responsible for spawning the lava waves, but it has never shown on logs before, and definitely wasn't casted that often. This was almost a wipe for us and we haven't wiped on rag since our first kill on like week 3.   
---

---
I'm keeping it because I like being able to flag people Kill on Sight.  I use it in a way where I only flag people who I know are gonna go out of their way to kill people.  That way I can try to avoid them.
---
But if it got removed, I wouldn't be mad.
---
It's not a game. It's human time that will eventually lead to your death.
---
Time doesn't suddenly stand still while you're playing. It's your life ebbing out by the minute. It's the most valuable thing you have.
---
I don't think it's possible, on a pvp server, to have characters on the apposite faction.
---
Rolled on a balanced server, it’s already almost 70/30 horde.
---
It’s not the phase that’s the problem, for me at least, it’s the server balances.
---
I don’t think it’s worth bragging that you stayed at level two for less than 3 years
---
Quality shitposting lmao
---
2 battlenet accounts with wow sub
---
This is obviously gaining, can’t tell if you are memeing or not.
---
wow what a beta statement, red is dead
---
I was unaware of this addon! This explains a lot.
---
“Abandon a character you just spend 100+ hours and several months with to restart the game because a very old and established solution isn’t available.”
---
This is even more of a thing for someone not 60 right now... they clearly have limited play time and you’re asking them to give up literally months of progress. Just let people transfer where they want to be, holding time spent as a hostage is a super shitty move.
---
maybe you dont lol
---
Guide to ding 60: 
---
Get levels till 60, then dont post about it on Reddit
---
You could remove enemy player stealth from showing up in the combat log
---
You could reduce the range of player combat logs from 100 yd or whatever the hell it is now to something like 40 yd
---
You could make enemy player combat logs only show up to you if you are in combat with them
---
There are so many possible changes you could do to break this without breaking everything else that people find useful
---
Hillsbrad PVP in a nutshell.
---
Im pretty sure my 30 rogue is getting more honor ganking level 20s in hillsbrad fields than the multiple raids of level 60s are getting duking it out on the other side of the zone.
---
I didn’t get it until this week. It’s super handy but I’d be fine with it getting removed.
---
I do enjoy the ping sound when it notices someone! It’s like the Alert noise from metal gear
---
There will still be battlegroups so Horde will still get long ass queues
---
Uh... so you mean in several months?
---
Shift click on the quest in your quest log to take them on or off tracker...
---
&gt; Don’t install Spy then?
---
Tell that to everyone that uses Spy, not OP.
---
Roll alliance on Benediction. It’s slipping towards unbalanced horde - we need more alliance to keep up with the influx of horde.
---
Kind of silly that as a hunter I get the ability "track hidden" but other players have this weird automatic stealth and player radar
---
I was hardly surprised.
---
Very hardly.
---
wtf are you talking about the only class that this addon breaks us with is hunter who has track human but as long as we can stealth in time we can still merc people they just know were coming now. oh well
---
How?
---
Is mutiny guild from a private server?
---
Literally /roll
---
It’ll die down.  Go do something else for a week and come back.
---
Nope, I have ClassicLFG which isn't banned. Because it actually does a similar role to Spy where it just scans the chat.
---
If you made these changes it wouldn’t be classic/vanilla wow.
---
such a small thing anyway, why would anyone care about such a silly thing as knowing how much honor you got instead of looking at those nice estimate numbers. it's not like something important depends on that knowledge. /s
---
The golden age of world pvp is already over in Classic. The launch up until honor was amazing. People mostly going about their business but engaging in pvp for fun. No unplayable lag for the most part (aside from occasional city raid), no 24/7 campfest, and an open world that was still mostly accessible except on maybe the most unbalanced realms. It was fun while it lasted. I'm sure Blizzard will kill wpvp for good with bgs in just a couple of weeks.
---
I know at 54, an assisted (obviously) kill on a 60 got me 91 honor. Not that i particularly care, but he shouldn't have tried to get us coming out of BRD for a reset.
---
"If I'd want to tank a dungeon, it would take me 30 sec to find one. "
---
yeah, and for anyone else to find a group within 5-30 minute, they have to do this shit.
---
you're basically saying "why are people so rude, i find dungeons in 30 seconds if i wanted to find one, i'm so tired of other people having to spam".
---
Yes at 60 it opens up to being farmed by groups of the other factions.
---
If you do not *love* PvP and intend on most of your time playing involving it, do not play on a PvP server. Problem is everyone was screaming about how inferior PvE servers are and it scared a lot of people in to rolling PvP... where they are now stuck unless they reroll and spend several hundred more hours just getting back to where they were.
---
Many people on PvP servers shouldn’t be there and only figured that out when it was too late. Personally I’d rather keep those people in the game than lose them... which is what will happen to a good chunk of them rather than reroll.
---
Just let people transfer off.
---
Correct. I prefer the old way.
---
I play at night now after 11pm on weekdays shit dies down or it did on Thursday. I’m sure weekends are gonna be gank fest until 3-4am and back to gank feat again around 10am
---
Keep your ellipses to yourself.
---
If an addon makes you worthless, maybe you're the problem. Should learn something of the rogues that infiltrated SW today. Even with some people warning bia Spy, they caused havoc until they accidental pulled an Elite guard.
---
Clearly he had the sword of a thousand truths!
---
If you think more people will reroll and spend three months getting back to where they were you’re insane.
---
They’ll quit. And more people playing classic means more money from it which means more attention and resources. There is no benefit to anybody in making people stay where they don’t want to be.
---
&gt; You could remove enemy player stealth from showing up in the combat log
---
Really? REALLY? *That's* what would stop it from being classic/vanilla wow? Not everyone having free automatic radar?
---
I audibly laughed at this. Come to herod, where every time numbers are even, horde lose and bring twice as many
---
But why does the short guy have a scimitar in the bottom image and not the top???
---
He probably makes enough to get by, but he's not a millionaire by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Nope
---
So you were drinking beer right; the. Thought to get the car with the laptop and drive and get more beer... glad no one got hurt.
---
Has this been confirmed for classic? Was this the way it was in vanilla?
---
G R O B M O B
---
Is mirahs OH really better than CHT OH as swords?
---
There was an addon like this back in vanilla, it won’t get removed.
---
From what I understand Trueaim equates to about +3% hit total.
---
&gt; Also, you don’t need the big power hungry graphics cards for wow classic. It’s a 15 year old game.
---
This is true yes, you don’t need it, but it doesn’t hurt! I didn’t wait 15 years to play this game on settings I had been playing with 15 years ago. Show me water textures and shadows baby! Back in vanilla I was playing on a shit PC that would probably melt if you turned the settings past the bare minimum. My laptop can handle this game to a reasonable degree now and I gotta say, having a field of vision that loads things from farther than you can throw a rock really adds to the open world feel of this game.
---
Well I can't speak to the min/max value of it as I don't claim to be some top tier rogue but just look at the talents in SUB, better stealth in terms of speed and cooldown, high chance to crit ambush, reset cooldowns.
---
Between Ass and Sub they both seem vastly superior to combat in PVP in my opinion. And my opinion is just based on fun factor
---
Roll horde then
---
Doesn’t it also remove warriors engraging abilities?
---
No...
---
Everlook, STV Arena, Menethil &amp; Booty Bay boat camping, ANY elemental farming spot, BRM, DM
---
Metal Gear?
---
Do you mean [Woven Ivy Necklace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19159/woven-ivy-necklace)?
---
&gt;To be clear, I’m referring to 13 and under. I think a lot of people in this post think anyone under 18 is a kid.
---
14 year old spotted
---
Gonna be honest man, you must not play retail.
---
I havent done much world pvp since late last winter on there, but i was involved in a ton of large scale PVP shitshows on retail (to the point where we crashed the servers a couple times).  
---
Now, maybe it wont happen on *classic*, but it happens elsewhere on WoW (mostly thanks to being able to team up x-realm so theres a big enough playerbase to make it happen).
---
I’d be willing to tank as an off spec Druid, but it means I’m rolling for Balance/Feral/Resto gear.
---
I used to die outside of scholomance because I was too cheap to do the quest for the key. Apparently I wasn't the only one cause I did that a lot to get groups inside.
---
I am 28 what am I? Zoomer sounds cool and my parents are 65
---
Too be honest, maybe memory tricked me, every expansion broke vanish in somehow. I remember that every expansion has a "fix vanish" patch since vanilla.
---
I am sure that this version of "classic wow" using new clients somewhere somehow breaking vanish.
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I wanted!
---
I hope enough people get this reference!!
---
Yeah, or you could take the tank that wants nothing but the one or two orbs that drop, and you have less competition for your rolls.
---
Don't forgot "you are an evil korean" and "go home and be a family man."
---
&gt; you make it sound like anger needs to be justified
---
Um. Yes? Your analogy is terrible as well.
---
The OP is pretty logical too. The right solution was more servers at launch. Obviously we can't implement that because time travel doesn't exist. 
---
&gt; the game is meant to be this way
---
It really isn't. Blizzard changed the guard radius in Goblin towns in "keeping with the spirit" of the intended design. Do you think Blizzard intended for WPVP to be laggy? And if yes, do you mind sharing your drug dealers number? He seems to have the good shit.
---
if only they could have been the non existent one too
---
Np. That doc is now your Bible as a Warrior.
---
&gt; pissing people off with fear
---
Yea fuck you lol
---
Is he raiding yet?
---
Flank. Catch stragglers. Ambush people healing and drinking in the back and near graveyards. Play dirty. Rogues aren't really meant to be on the front lines.
---
In town
---
This isn't Hugcraft.
---
Shagohod?!
---
Alliance really can't take the PVP huh? But you'll sure corpse camp Horde lower level than you.
---
Why does everything need to somehow involve skill? Is braindead fun not a thing people want anymore? Literally nothing in classic requires skill and yet we're all here.
---
no
---
yeah except every server that's pvp is basically 60/40 horde, some worse.
---
a lot of servers would have like 6-12 hour queues with this. 
---
fuck that.
---
I just got a dagger from MC so I switched to it
---
That’s like what... 2 AB’s? Or 3 WSG’s? Or 1 hour spent fucking around in the weekend long stalemate that is AV?
---
&gt; and I still got 5 hour queues once it filled up
---
What server are you on? I joined one of the last server added, we've always had the pop listed as high, even on off hour times and we have yet to have a Queue to log in.
---
There was that one exception when a PvP Server was created and PvE servers were allowed to transfer to it. It caused a lot of reeing circa 2005 iirc.
---
You don’t benefit from a dagger in oh from sword spec talent
---
Just like Dire Maul is phase 2, right?
---
unsubbed after a day LOL
---
I read that the exp dropped from 225 to 65 per mob, which kinda bites. The fact that it’s uncontested may still make it okay though, i dunno.
---
Alliance getting railed
---
The suburb of Sydney?  Just curious.
---
I’m just annoyed I watched a couple of his YouTube vids. Or that people that clip his streams vids. And now it’s like half of what yt suggests
---
Well they did mention when the servers were released that based on the numbers of players a "low" pop classic server was going to be much larger then a "high" pop vanilla server.
---
Can you take on another rogue with engineering?
---
Oh I know. There are stills lots of mega fights on retail.. but cross-server sort of hurts the immersion a bit.
---
What server?
---
Could also be the respawn time is sped up due to massively larger server populations
---
It's my first time playing on a PvP server and it sucks a lot of fun out of the experience for me. I can't get a jump on someone, and people are informed if there's someone nearby so I can't hide or walk on past them. The appeal was never knowing when you'd get ganked, and setting up sweet ambushes.
---
That still happens ofc, but with this AddOn I always know when someone approaches me and they always know when I approach them.
---
My guild did an hour fifteen clear with no flasks.
---
fun fight btw
---
There were no cross realm queues in vanilla. Good changes, there won't be any in Classic.
---
Eh, I think the Alliance on Stalagg has proven that server population being imbalanced doesnt mean shit, because all you need to do is stick in raid group numbers and just keep moving. Thats the thing, nobody is getting camped, you just get swarmed, die, and when you run back to res, theyll be gone. So even if you only have 10-15 people, youre going to find a ton more people running alone in the world than the horde will be, and even *if* the horde has a raid of their own 40 strong, it doesnt really matter because you can just avoid it. Or at worst you get caught, then the raid notices you dont get shit for HK and decide to split.  
---
  
---
While I think Hillsbrad is horde dominated still (I havent checked it today) It doesnt really matter. Just avoid it or go there and get more HK than the horde will be because people are incredibly stupid and get antsy.
---
I wish !!!! They got me training spells once I was like :O lol they should lose cenarion rep for it lol
---
Your generational cohort is with the Millennials.
---
Then why are you giving them your money
---
I heard the Alliance on Heartseeker are low skill level. Can you confirm?
---
Boomers gave birth to Millennials, Gen X gave birth to Zoomers.
---
I’m on Fairbanks, horde out number alliance by so much they’ve pretty much shut down most major routes with camping. I actually think the solution to this is to just release WSG and AV ASAP. It’ll reduce a lot of horde players camping places like BRD for hours on end.
---
Why are you in a gold spamming channel...?
---
I did this on one of my alts in vanilla
---
Hahahaha so funny omg. This is yhe funniest post ive seen all year omg
---
holy shit i live just down the to where this was filmed!!! that’s so surreal hahahah
---
Wow slippery slope much
---
Hey all I’m a lvl 54 undead priest what do I do to lvl ? Just did BRD full and it took forever but if that’s the best xp I’ll keep doing it. But it was getting about 28k per hour
---
I literally said I'd try back in a month or two ya fucking NEET
---
I think about this sometime. What does my kill actually mean to the larger objective? Statistically, it means nothing. My contribution for the kill and me getting killed means nothing. And yet posts here make it seem like we have an influence.
---
#nochanges
---
&lt;3
---
Gimme BGs any day. This mindless PvP raid zerg is boring as fuck and bad for the game. If it takes too long for BGs to come out I predict many servers will end up like the PServer Kronos, who also as one of the only Pservers did world PvP before BGs.
---
All the hardcore neckbeards farmed the casuals so hard that they quit. The neckbeards then quit since they had no one to kill. Server ded.
---
That shit's camped on my server 24/7
---
Why do people insist that it's only 60s farming players? That's not the case.
---
I think you should do that irl.
---
waaaait we’re not getting old AV? fuckkk
---
These people don’t care about those good ways tho, they wish they were this particular asshole, making money the way this particular asshole does, its unfortunate. 
---
Asmon would be qualified to flip burgers if he wasn’t twitch famous, I’m sure his supportive audience isn’t far off.
---
Sure if you’re parsing 15+ year old scripted encounters, but pretty sure the op wants to pvp mainly and I don’t think it’s worth spending that much when DM legs exist from a pvp perspective.
---
And ya didn’t say it was bis but said it was very close, quite obvious if you’re min maxing pve cloudkeepers are the way to go.
---
I am not reading any of this essay.
---
Lol pathetic rogue. You can't sneak up on people anymore cos you are bad. L2p boomer/zoomer
---
What did you prove wrong though?
---
But classic *is* retail now. You're paying for it, therefore it's retail. 
---
The insult should be *go back to modern*
---
IMO its still not worth the run with sll orbs reserved, thats still bad gold/hour.

Here I’ll explain this part for you.

It’s because they’re an easy target to blame. There aren’t as many of them online to defend themselves so they’re a handy scapegoat. It’s a nice way to feel like you’re a part of the solution without actually ever having to do a single thing. 
---
Anyone who says “ok boomer” *seriously* is typically an idiot who has no experience with life yet still has a thick sense of superiority over everyone around them. Someone who is severely immature and ignorant and can’t articulate their thoughts so they have to resort to bullying.
---
Pretty much your typical redditor.
---
This reads like a Facebook clickbait. I feel physically ill after seeing this post.
---
Is Spy making shit hard to hide? Yes.

Should Spy be removed? fuck no, you can do the same goddamn thing with the built-in Chat Log minus the alerts. Deal with it.

Killing oneself with bad hygiene is very unlikely to be an act, or image for that matter.

If I had a dollar for every time I've seen someone try to claim that they should get their way with *their* preferred changes because [insert layers/phase system/addons/wowhead/etc here] is already different, I'd be able to pay for a full year's subscription.
---
The reality is that whiny entitled people will demand a thousand miles for each inch you give to anyone, and they'll never stop until you've firmly told them to go fuck themselves and maintained that stance despite their temper tantrums.

Tbf I would get offended if someone called me that.
---
Heya!
---
 I'm looking for a way to make it easier for our guildies to coordinate running dungeons with each other, planning ahead with each other. Preferably through Discord. Are there any tools/ideas for how to make this smoother?

Thanks in advance!

Retail bad upvotes to the left

I don’t believe so, haven’t personally tested but I know it doesn’t trigger redoubt/reckoning so I would assume so with BoS. 98% chance it doesn’t work is my guess without actually testing it.
---
It used to trigger reckoning which was OP for the first few weeks of classic until blizzard hotfixed it.
---
Thanks op, installing it right now!
---
Dont limit it. Put it default in the client. Then no one gets an unfair advantage :)

It depends on the specific trinket, in the tooltip, it will say "Unique" if you can only use/have one.
---
Blazing Emblem for example, is not Unique, and as such, you can equip two of them. The cooldown between the two will interact oddly however, I'm not sure if it's shared, or if using one will just trigger a 30s CD on the other.
---
If they’re not unique-equipped, probably. Idk if they would share cds though.
---
Lmao I'm 21???
---
How much should i be paying for it and what enchant?

I am on fairbanks as well. What level are you?

I heard apple is joker’s friend

hahahahha good fuck the allys

Apart from the estimate being basically completely wrong, sure.
---
Hahaha this is great! I haven’t kept up with the games since before the social media era
---
&gt;We will all quit  
---
We sure will bud. I'll meet you by the tree.
---
I'm glad Fallen Order came out today or I'd have nothing to do. I enjoy PvP but this is ridiculous, couldn't even play my alt unless I want to reroll on a low pop.
---
I'll give it some time and come back for BWL.
---
Fitness instagram models absolutely love balding, poor hygiene, anemic, 24/7 gamers, who act childish for thousands of other children.

Or maybe its for the fame..

Nah, I must just be super jealous 🤔 lol
---
Warned who? Its phase 2 on a pvp server, this is literally  what everyone has been waiting for. No one cares about the salt miners.
---
Important questions being asked here.
---
I too have a "bunch", it's somewhere between greater than 900 and less than a million. Now you might ask for a specific number, but that's a hard thing to test before releasing stuff
---
I use Butter Quest Tracker, it puts the quests you are tracking into zones categories that you can toggle to show and hide.
---
Sinews drop from other mobs fyi
---
Guildchat seems the most simple in my eyes, but you could make an LFG channel in discord i guess
---
But also the lyrics to a Metallica song, one of several inspired by Lovecraft.
---
Keyword is that it's an estimated value. We don't actually know (it'd be very broken if it works) that's correct. Because you're still technically splitting the honor between the same amount of people
---
Oh shit im pretty sure i was there when this happened lol.  I'm on horde side tho.  This was awesome tho because before then it was just inn camping.
---
I think about how awesome it was when I was 19-24 living on my own and playing WoW for hours....days undisturbed.
---
Now I'm 31 and have a wife and son and while I wish I had the same amount of free time or urge to play.....I just don't.
---
And that's ok, I wouldn't trade what I have now for what I had then because back then I was dreaming of the family life.
---
The only time I have experienced any lag was when an ONY head turn in was announced ahead of time and pretty much the entire ally side of the server showed up for the buff.
---
Character transfers are in no way minor and existed in vanilla, so kinda stop with that crap.
---
Hamsters have an average life span of 2-2.5 years though.
---
Wed night, Ganksmas Eve on Blaumeux: 2 horde raids camping Thorium Point for over 6hrs, was essentially a horde-only town. The two times Alliance drove them out, the dipshits left and Horde just rezzed and resumed.
---
Manage to fly to IF when the FP rezzes, ask for help in Trade chat 3 times - no replies. Dude on bridge is yelling to get a Raid together to go take Thrall out, gets a handful of people. Argues with me about helping folks trying to level and taking out a more important threat than a fucking NPC.
---
Thurs, Ganksmas Day on Blaumeux: This has spread to every Contested Zone in the game and it's impossible to level. Once more go to IF to ask for help, specifying Thorium Point again, and note: It's the closest possible FP to Ironforge besides Wetlands. 0 response. Someone mentions Horde in SW a few mins later, suddenly everyone's going, "INV FOR SW HORDE"
---
Alliance are lazy fucks who wants the PVP brought to them, and with NPC assistance. This shit is why most PVP servers are horde heavy(besides their PVP-focused racials) and PVE servers are HEAVY Alliance.
---
Sad part is I say this with experience as a primarily-Alliance player from Launch until now, and it's -always- been true.
---
lmao
---
Do lbrs, especially if u can find a grp spamming first 3 bosses. Should be pretty good xp and since big chance with 60's in grp who want to farm a certain item.

Shoot me a PM please

As someone who wandered around at a random time in the week a few times and got one in WotLK, I say otherwise!

It 100% has to do with the game unless your trolling
---
Everything mentioned is situational (depends what demon you have out) but I think the best answer is to curse of exhaustion them after death coil and just walk the other way while applying dots and your demon.
---
For what? Having a better life than them?
---
True
---
I mean, I see just as many people posting long intricate and mostly non-sensical explanations as to why asmon is 100% an act and they know for sure and anyone who doesn’t see that is dumb.
---
Clearly the dude causes issues, considering theres a thread full of thousands of people arguing over it.
---
It was literally not in the beta. I played the beta starting on day one. There was never a keyring.
---
Windseaker is great!  Always have friendly people around to help out or group up with.  Not overly populated so you can still run around and do quests to collect things.
---
"  **I grabbed almost all possible words that Horde and Alliance can say to each other** "

Ur fault for stealthing too close, l2p.

Im young so im putting in dumb time to retire early like ya it sucks but at the same time i make really good money so i cant complain
---
Thank the light I rolled PVE. I’m not 60 yet, and it sounds really bad if you’re low level on a PVP server right now.
---
As an alliance on stalagg I feel your pain brother. 
---
Fuck me I feel it
---
Dont worry, they'll be in the game, first week into december at latest
---
nice, making decision behalf of everyone on whats fun in classic, stupid boomer.

First time using my 100% mount I was zoomin

Now after a few days It feels just like a regular mount, do i need to bring my mount to a veterenarian?

Oh I didn’t mean it in a negative sense, more of like a “he’s making all kinds of easy  mistakes oh my goshhhhh” kind of way. I liked it lmao, bro chill on the snappy judgements
---
When disenchanting, when is the point where it doesn’t increase skill? I’m 78 and nothing in west fall is leveling enchanting when I disenchant it. ?
---
As a lvl 60 I generally pass up people who aren't around mid 50's or higher. I feel the gear difference is too great when you start messing with people in the lower level range. Just seems unfun and I've had my own share of being attack by lvl 60's while I was 40-50. Mostly it is pointless to fight back in any way.
---
My overall desire to seek out fights in the world is fairly low but I do play on a PvP server just to have that extra thrill every now and then. Often just feels odd to me in world PvP. Do I wait for this warrior to get his HP back from next to nothing since I'm full HP/mana or kill him with a rank 1 spell essentially griefing them? Let someone finish killing the 2 mobs on them or gank them while they have probably already used any meaningful skill to counter me with?
---
Mainly waiting for BG's before I really get into doing PvP. There everyone is ready and expecting with less foot work of running around searching.
---
Seriously? Is that normal or some kind of bug? I know sometimes I get killed in Ratchet, and instead of going to the nearby graveyard I wind up way down by Camp Taurajo or something.
---
Pveserver ftw

We grew up

Haha good one man, I’m just trying to help with some of the basics. If I were to start playing a game I would love it if someone was willing to help me and toss out a few pointers

Phase 3 was always going go be at least a couple of months behind phase 2 regardless of when phase was released. Phase 2 definitely wasn't rushed and releasing it later wouldn't change what we're seeing now.
---
I literally left my 60 at a pvp server to reroll on a pve because I love leveling alts. Seeing all these posts and also all the pvping on different streams make me glad I'm leveling on a pve server right now
---
Mate, people colluded 15 years ago too.
---
“Fishing relaxes me. It’s like yoga, except I still get to kill something.”
---
Nice. But if its based on damage then it means basically only AOE classes can farm any reasonable honor like this

"Goth gets gang bang of her life."

You might be right, my 100% might need a break

You are full of shit saying you had no lag 300v300 in vanilla tho

No hard R's buddy.
---
The Warchief of the True Horde, Rend Blackhand, pulls through with his alliance with the Black Dragonflight.
---
Disenchanting stops giving you lvs  pretty early, that sounds about right
---
The absolute worst
---
what reason is there for hpriests to run strat live? it's literally only orbs... they need 4 for robe and 1 for the most expensive weapon enchant.
---
In terms of sequence your basic No fun allowed Stun lock combo is Cheap shot into 4-5 point kidney into either gouge or straight into blind.as they are blinded once you drop combat restealth and open back up with cheap shot.From there you can do a lot of things you can go into backstab or back into No fun allowed combo.A good one is as you're restealthing cold blood then cheap shot into a 5 combo point evis this time and most of the time your target is dead.If they're a warrior you try your best to deadzone them so you can drop combat and reopen up.Im still learning rogue too but I've dropped all over content now and Only PVP and you can really tell who the good rogues are vs the bad ones that only know they're dps rotation.Also yeah you can use rupture against plate technically you can expose armor and restealth then get some big crits in that works too.
---
It’s just a bunch of edgy teenagers who think it’s funny to shit on people.
---
Oh so it’s not like blues will keep leveling me at later points?
---
Not if you time it right
---
I checked the spreadsheet and Krol blade + CHT gives me 5 dps more than Krol blade + Mirah's. That is with sword spec
---
It really is. Especially when it spawns in the rich thorium location while EPL is being stripped mined.
---
Warriors literally the hardest class in classic and is the only one with a rotation though. I WISH I was a warlock. Curse, corruption, shadowbolt until my corruption WA starts blinking that its coming off in 3 seconds, shadowburn, shadowbolt, corruption, repeat.
---
My experience has been the opposite. I consider myself casually hardcore as in I have a complex understanding of the game (been playing WoW for 14 years or so and i’m 23) 
---
Often when say, a Frost Mage opens on me - a Warrior - I quickly realize the level of play at hand is near zero.. but i’m leveling alts so i’m engaging with players who are ganking cause they suck at the game anyway. I’m not a PvPer by any means and they roll over when an even battle comes..
---
These Frost Mages thinking i’m a free kill are at the “AoE packs of 2” mouthbreathing mindset.
---
&gt; but for someone like me who isnt a noob and actually does know the game but dosent have the time if it would still be frowned upon
---
Why would anyone care about that? Everyone has to level and get to 60, simple as that. If it takes you a year because you can only devote an hour a night, so be it. That was the case then, it's the same now.
---
This takes the cake for the cringiest shit I've seen all day.
---
u blind?
---
“worthless pieces of shit” damn you are one salty motherfucker

That's cute

The entire point of Classic is to get away from what they have in retail.
---
Bonus healing is better. Holy Paladins don't run out of mana when they cast Flash of Light, which is all they really need to cast in raids.
---
Also maybe start with your hots (rejuv) mobs cant interrupt that
---
Horde got it an hour ago
---
Must not play on the same Herod.  If alliance don't outnumber or outlevel, they don't engage.
---
I mean once BGs are out and more than one raid, we'll have more than enough content.
---
Transferring to a dead server might be the worst possible thing to do in a long run.
---
Organize a group and fight back then lmao
---
I transferred from stalagg to heartseeker as horde. In my experience, the horde players are much more selfish and inconsiderate, and I haven't been killed by an alliance player at all since the transfer to heartseeker.
---
&gt; In a perfect world they would have waited at least another month
---
What would that have even done? Legitimately, what would waiting another month have done to the people who are now essentially unable to play due to World PvP?
---
This isn't the Classic everyone remembers. Yes there were city raids, yes there was PvP in STV and some leveling zones, but there was not so much PvP because people are meta chasing for Ranks for gear. Back then the PvP gear wasn't even as good as PvE gear until they had to buff it all.
---
There was no way they could have made this any easier unless the legitimately released WSG/AV alongside Honor, but then all the "purists" would complain that "my original Vanilla didn't have WSG/AV this early!"
---
Blizzard has shown over the last 3 months they would rather appease the purists than actually do things that make the experience better for the average user. Which is fine if that's the avenue they want to go, it's just also somewhat annoying for the 90% of the playerbase that aren't sperges.
---
&gt; alter game 
---
I don't think character transfer, something they are already doing is altering game.
---
Pvp server. I am happy to see it is not only the horde who are ganking for once.
---
&gt;blizzard hotfixed it.
---
AH!  I thought I was going crazy.  I told all my guildies that it worked, but just last week I tried and it didn't.  I assumed I had imagined it e.e
---
I thought Res sick players were worth no honor?
---
Does this include the decay you get from killing the same players over and over? Lotta folks don't realize the "Estimated Honor" is based on 0 previous kills. This stuff is only good for a few waves.
---
This is the right answer. Blizzard did not release DM early for any other reason other than another last minute boost before quarterly financial reporting was released. They will do the same for Q4.
---
I can't hear you over the sound of me Life Tapping.
---
*Seriously, I have my volume set too high, if you're telling me to stop tapping I literally cannot hear you.*
---
Very little loot competition with other classes. You're there so they didn't have to invite that second cloth or warrior.
---
But equalsthree has all the good enchants! -Defiler(warlock) -Herod
---
Easiest solution is to just re roll pve. I'm going to have to do that as well. Partly because the layering removal and ques. But if your on a crowded server you might just be able to free transfer to a pve server? Not sure I'll be trying this when I get home.
---
We will get it before they release their 4th quarter financial results.
---
Haha I saw this guy outside org earlier today. Laughed
---
Don‘t come to firemaw if you‘re a casual (no bm saying this for your sake) . Horde has a slight advantage in numbers but alliance has quality.
---
duh
---
you had me in the first half
---
then you decided to blame everything on the "toxic pirated server players" lmao
---
Aw, that's pretty sad.
---
Good luck finding a 1v1 on any PvP server atm
---
Estimated honor decays.
---
I think it's also a personality thing. I've never dealt well with the sense of being artificially disadvantaged. Even when we were in the various Kalimdor locations the imbalance was less enjoyable than it was annoying.
---
Friends: 0

Have you considered looking around yourself

&gt;attempting to quest in the newly opened battleground

No it doesn't.

Nobody types them out... You make a macro lol
---
Wenn ihr Horde seid transferiert einfach auf Heartstriker.
---
Das haben die ganzen Allis von Luci und Venoxis gemacht und jetzt sind wir schätzungsweise 40% Horde und 60% Alli.
---
Medium Population find ich persönlich auch besser als High oder Full.
---
its not even culture as much as rule setting, we didn't see this on private servers and that was very recently
---
You're my first gold ever
---
Anyone know if there is a discord for the Thunderfury server?
---
horde pretty much dominate population wise so the average players get very careless. like this druid just sprinting down a tunnel full of corpses in cat form...
---
here's another one for ya
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BadDreamyLobsterPeteZaroll
---
Ah yeah that's fair. I didn't mind it if for example 5 to 8 of us, and we vs up to double the numbers ish, but after that it gets tiring but kind of something I started accepting because a majority of the players are dumpsters and end up forming a deathball. But then that's when it's time to leave, or when you kind of foresee people starting to group.      
---
Did have to jump around a lot of zones though, but weirdly enough on Herod in some zones it feels like horde has given up and just sit in like 3 zones and that's all
---
As a hunter, I have had people ask if I can make my pet tank a few too many times for them to be joking at this point.
---
DKs don't matter the first week
---
Lots of people that I know are saying they don't enjoy the PvP and that they aren't having fun. It's already affected my guild where we lost an officer and a significant chunk of the core raiding team because a majority within the guild decided very quickly that they weren't going to waste their time.
---
Thing is pretty much everyone in our guild are PvPers, it's just that most of us found this world raid vs raid meta to be pretty unfun and now it looks like we're going to be raid logging until jan/feb...
---
Estimated Honor. In reality you do not get any Honor after the 4th kill.
---
I mean it's objectively true.  I haven't had much trouble with the camping, because I'm not a low lvl and I have stealth, but nice try.
---
lol why are you downvoted for saying hillsbrad isnt the only place to be

I went into Dire Maul North for the first time, and the goblin didn't offer me [Free Knot](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5525/free-knot) quest.  He did offer me the suit quest.  Is there a pre-requisite or should I contact a GM?
---
This is complete overreaction from you, just because you’re getting killed in the open world. 
---
&gt;	More importantly, Blizzard needs to do it and they need to do it
---
What does Blizzard need to do so this whiny sub would be content?
---
I was trading kills with a few solo ally’s last night in Azshara. Was having lots of fun.
---
The roving alliance death squads all over Felwoods? Not fun.
---
WPVP is great. Getting farmed is lame.
---
VanasKoS is what I use and it's bloody great
---
Yea, tons of skill involved 3v1’ing a guy who’s questing
---
No I mean, implement a balance queue not based on population. So if the server cap is 8000 but there has only 6000 online. If 4000 of the 6000 are horde, make some of them wait in queue to login. Never allowing the factions to get worse than like 65/35 at the worst. 
---
I know this is not some magical fix-all solution, but the current state of imbalance on many servers is going to absolutely kill one of the factions.
---
lvl 40 or 50

Your first impression might be that of meeting a potato but he has very keen social analytical skills. One example being how he discarded copyrights and let anyone and everyone make videos about him. Best streamer marketing move I've seen this decade.
---
Civilization at it's climax
---
My guild believes the theory as well, which is why we just got finished raising Ironforge
---
Tidy plates i think. not on pc to check.
---
Well put. I'm on Bigglesworth and last I checked we have a 60/40 Horde split. Its still rough as an alliance, not unmanageably so, but generally speaking any big battle becomes once sided fast as enemies fly in almost immediately and Horde tend to dominate a full zone once it does. I've put away my 35 alt for a bit until it dies down.
---
An alliance said "N O B O D Y L Y K E S Y O U" to me as he ganked me, I kinda thought that was funny
---
Wouldn't paid transfers just exacerbate the problem? They faction locked free transfers after realizing it was a mistake. People will just rush out of the servers where their faction is on the lower end.
---

---
Got like 300+ "estimated honor" from solo killing a 60 at 52. So maybe 198 is the maximum for level 60 killing a 60.
---
\~150g on russian server
---
Is he though? He mostly ignores any questions about that, if there are too many, then he will explain his reasoning (that's how I found out yesterday). People who hate his ass for that or anything else will just move on when they realize they can't force him to kick the guy.
---
Essentially he has to either stick to his own methods, or give in to the outraged reddit warriors who don't even care about SS or his stream, they just want to see him to punish Joker even more and would move on afterwards. 
---
Also I agree that Joker was an ass and don't believe in the sincerity of any apology of his after all the cocky remarks, I just don't care and don't feel entitled to judge Staysafe for buying that. It's his own guild and it's okay for him to keep Joker even just to spite all these people, assuming that's the case.
---
if someone messaged me i could spin my wow time into a positive as well but i wouldn’t mention coke till sunrise every weekend and getting blackout drunk all the time.  grass is greener boys.
---
Dont know mate. we came pushed and then raid disbanded, but could be that you oblitareted allys there, coz when we came we where pushed next to town.
---
Oh Sandra, you dumb bitch
---
what about pal ret? shaman elem? shadow priest?
---
I mean, ya the hype will die a bit, but you HAVE to gank random people to rank. The system wasn't designed to have this many people actively ranking in the open world. It just wasn't.
---
I know. That's not what 'at this rate' means.
---
Leatrix pluss addon
---
I wanted them to wait another month so that this would be at least one month closer to battle grounds being released. 
---
But in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, they rushed out phases 2. Now there will be an even longer gap than there should have been between 2 and 3 - prolonging this pandemonium. 
---
Fairbanks isn’t even one of the more imbalanced faction realms but it is still probably in excess of 70/30 horde. It doesn’t feel like pvp. It feels like a god damn zombie apocalypse, and the only safe place is South Shore (where limitless guards stomp horde). Some of my friends and I are seriously considering taking a long break from the game right now - and that is absolutely NOT how things were in vanilla. So the “purists” can fuck right off with the “no changes” mantra.
---
J. Allen Brack is the guy who originally said that line, and at BlizzCon this year, he said it turns out that yes, we did want it.   Are you disagreeing with Blizzard President J. Allen Brack, sir?
---
Hahaha it was funny man. I managed to hide in a building and hearth!
---
What gets me is that a lot of the stuff people complain about on pvp servers would be considered war crimes. And it’s really more of a Cold War with a fragile cease fire agreement. So the whole its WARcraft argument is invalid. Most of these big battles take place in or near civilian centers and killing low level players is akin to killing children.
---
Man you are dumb
---
Do you perhaps have some sort of wallhacks and means of seeing 360deg around you, above and below as well, at all times,?
---
Gonna guess that's Rap on Pagle. I made a lot of money off that guy :)
---
Your thinking of the boy who cries wolf.
---
Ah! Excellent point!
---
Yeah your bang on. There is no reason for me to ever tank strath live for a random. I do need gold though, because tanks need to spend ~3k on boi/crafted gear.
---
I get gold (orbs), you get blue upgrades, everyone wins.
---
Pretty sure somewhere it says can take between 24-48 hours. Can. Doesn’t mean it will, but there’s a chance
---
Sargeras IF crashed almost daily lmao. Sargeras was and still is the most populated server. It was always barely hanging on.
---
i'm interested aswell :)
---
Hey, speak for yourself! I've had a second chat window open showing all log data open throughout my whole WoW-career, didn't even know this kind of addon existed. Using that log is how I survived in world pvp, once lots of red text shows up, you know someone is around and based on the spell, damage and the enemy he's fighting, you can tell a lot such as level, class and location. It doesn't take much more effort than constantly monitor your original chat window with general, chat, yell and so on. You simply look to the right on your monitor instead on the left.
---
?? No they wouldn't. Unless you're saying only for new people joining the server in which case it wouldn't fix the existing issue or change it since it wouldn't be a reason to transfer to balance servers
---
Youre wrong there, only people to not give honor are people landing off a FP that havent attacked back.
---
You still get 100-300honor for a rea sick target.
---
Isnt it a ball with numbers on it at this point?
---
Zero has done 500 runs or something and he has 5pc and says that's not true.
---
Pet needs to body pull and despawn correctly and it shouldn't happen other than really randomly.
---
I know it's an innocent question. But if that *was* the case, that would make Elwynn forest questing a nightmare.
---
if every "new" streamer posted to reddit would you bother to use reddit to look through ads for twitch?
---
Huh that's kind of interesting.
---
I got silenced for 2 days for spamming " M E L O V E Y O M A M M A" worth it though
---
They are worth honor. Only players landing off a FP who havent attacked back are honorless targets.
---
How about rerolling mage and give him a heal? Would be less work, i reckon.
---
I don’t think this is the case. Those players, by and large, have been playing heavily since launch.  Most will have raided current content to the point they’d
---
Much rather world pvp. Honestly. If I had a 60 toon I would. Bgs kinda suck. The only reason most do them is because of the extra honor. The trill of world pvp is the real draw, imo.
---
Check out Kui Name plates. It has an option for that.
---
No one gives a shit about your DPS, because you can and will be replaced effortlessly (and hunters do shit damage anyway).  
---
No one spams the LFG channel for an hour trying to find a single damage dealer, so of course you don't have the same rights.
---
I was in a group of about 90+ horde last night and it was butter smooth the whole time.
---
Yesterday it was unplayable though.
---
But you can store up only 5 charges iirc
---
400 kills, 4 dishonor = about 0 honor earned :D

---
yeah, it might be a bit more difficult to get them punished, but it is indeed a rule. The bs "but you rolled on a pvp realm" doesn't matter in that case. Its the same like exploiting terrain so guards cant reach you, thats pvp, but still not allowed.
---
Writing a 5 paragraph complaint about videogame pvp, literally 2 days after said pvp was enabled. And like a lot of people here, do sweeping generalizations from their, very limited, personal experience.
---
Basically this ....
---
Is almost impossible to form a group as dps. Either the tank asks for 50g upfront, or people start reserving things.
---
When playing Classic, you are part of something bigger than yourself. This is a special time. Its not even been 48 hours since honor system was launched. Hordes of players that were waiting eagerly for it since launch are now having the time of their lifes. 
---
And there is you, going to reddit because the area with quest givers was camped. 
---
Before WotLK was launched, Blizzard introduced Scourge Invasion event. Players could transform into ghouls, become hostile to other players from their own faction, and bite them, causing them to turn into ghouls as well. This zombie apocalypse simulation is considered by many as one of the most fun events that ever happened in-game. Yet, Blizzard never again attempted something similar. Why? Because appearently many players whined on forums and in tickets that they can't quest in peace because they are attacked by ghouls. You sound exactly like this type of player. 
---
Whether transfer is paid or not doesn't matter. Such transfers would allow players to escape any inconvenience. Meanwhile, factions are hostile by default - disturbing the activities of players from other faction is the least they can do. I understand how you feel, but you need to understand that if Blizzard allowed such option for literally everybody then it would snowball out of control, creating absurd faction imbalances and causing many servers to die.
---
no, you are  bad, you need to get better,
---
What are you talking about
---
Then any penalty would address the issue. I see what you are saying. Now. Were they to make killing lower level players, or players that are eating/drinking or in combats or leaving combated with an npc  or just in uncontested areas, city’s ect, a dishonorable kill, you’d probably see less griefing. Raid and dungeon instances would still be camped. But flight paths ect wouldn’t. That’s why I rerolled pve. I’m trying to earn some extra money by running errands in the badlands, but I can’t because Rambo is going all first blood and declaring total war, trying to commit genocide, and all I’m trying to do is earn money for a mount.

If you want to argue against them, maybe form a coherent argument and dont just "hurr durr blizzard bad" the same pointless statements.
---
Depends what you want to pay for it. 
---
The blasted Lands enchant is free but unique and only available once, more you'll have to pay other people to enchant your weapons with their quest reward. It may accidentally open up sheeps but helps a bit with AOE aggro. 
---
Lifesteal and Fiery Weapon are also decent. They add a bit of aggro damage to it for a decent price. 
---
30 Spellpower will likely be the best enchant for threat/dps. But too expensive likely for that weapon.
---
Okay bye then
---
No. Tanks are not special. Neither class/spec is special
---
I don’t understand how but thorium is officially more rare than “rare” ores. At least on Thunderfury.
---
Hahahaha
---
Versus
---
10-40g in most cases. Almost nobody wants that weapon due to its speed and bad damage range at 60. Enchant I'd personally wouldn't worry about because weapon enchants that matter are expensive enough, that you could use the money for better upgrades elsewhere.
---
Horde outnumber alliance on almost every server in the world. Even if queues are crossrealm, it will probably end up being 60-40 at best in favor of horde. 
---
TL;DR: Horde will have long as fuck queues, Alliance will be instant. Don't expect ganking to stop if you're Alliance.

---
only for hunters, cause it's the only class who should see the enemies on his minimap
---
It is really boring to have an addon tell you when enemies are around. To be honest it doesn't really matter to me because as a prot warrior it is either someone I have no chance against what so ever or someone who has no chance against me in a million years so what is the point of knowing. But I still would not mind banning this addon.
---
Don't even talk to me commy scum, supporting blizzard you may as well move to China
---
Just a few hours ago I had a twink gank squad outside of Redridge, I was able to fly out when I got bored, but I couldn't go quest. We had our own mini-hillsbrad going on and it was fun for 20 minutes or so... but even after we finally managed to wipe them a few times through sheer weight of numbers they kept ganking us. No one was able to quest. 
---
Frankly speaking, I came to a PvP server to PvP, I didn't come to a PvP server to sit in perpetual stagnation whilst some jar-heads caged us in like animals. 
---
I'm actually really bothered by this, my options are quickly running out and my patience is running thin. After spending three hours last night being killed by twinks and three hours again today I'm left thinking, why do I even bother? 
---
And the worst part is, that anyone with a brain would realise that releasing P2 without BGs would ruin the game for levelers, and they did it anyway - does Blizzard even care?
---
Send me ur gold
---
The client doesn't have anything to do with respawns
---
They should have released bgs alongside pvp patch. Its no fun at 60 either. Cant farm, cant go anywhere. Cant do shit without getting gamles by gank squads over and over. What where they thinking?
---
Whose bright fucking idea was it to make this bitch immune to both fire AND frost? 
---
- Sincerely, all mages.
---
how do you see proc % and dps increase in warcraft logs?
---
The only reason I have it, is because you can put people on "kill on sight list". Those high lvl plebs who killed me while being low lvl need revenge later in the game.
---
It can be when it’s premeditated like it is now. In my experience, the premades are entirely one sided. You have equal numbers, but you have one group of coordinated, cohesive, well geared  and lead group vs a pug group of randos. It’s like pitting special forces against a bunch of poorly armed and untrained farmers.
---
Doesn't the person that drops group get hearthed? Or do you just have to do it fast?
---
Warlock is good, and so is mage for the farming/portals/food and water.
---
I will be killing your 3 year old soon enough .
---
“Welcome to earf (earth)”
---
Classic is indeed nothing like vanilla. We took no changes to far. There would have needed to be a lot of changes to make classic vanilla.
---
Or you know....Blizzard could admit they fucked up by raising the player count on a server without doing anything to compensate.
---
He didn't go over the top. He expressed a reasonable opinion.
---
Come make a new character on Bloodsail Buccaneers you won't regret it. You can move your character properly later. There's no reason to continue the torture.
---
I didn't say that.  Maybe that's your strategy, not mine.
---
The phases arent rushed. We are behind the classic schedule btw.
---
Edgy.
---
Why?
---
Youre not even a tank lol
---
If you genuinely think what I had to say is reactionary, I think it might be best for you to leave Reddit now because I can say with no false modesty that what I said is a hell of a lot more measured than most of what you'll read.
---
Now, did you take exception to anything I said or do you just want to try and flex and show everyone how cool you are for not caring about anything?
---
I guess to the people who voted for it, it is.
---
It is in fact the only PC game I care about this year.
---
You don’t have the original game, classic has many changes from vanilla.
---
If this was after the raid had been cleared, how is there a Surger alive?
---
I'm 28. Your parents are old.
---
Yeah, easy.
---
Leave hillsbrad?
---
look at all the old games being remade.
---
Theeoooooon. Greyjooooooooy!
---
Wow is not a pvp video game btw.
---
It's a pve mmo that for no real readon has two factions with random pvp thrown in.
---
I agree with a lot of what you say. To be honest a lot of the vanilla brains and gamer dads just can’t/won’t come to terms that Classic is a lot more retail like than vanilla like. Vanilla had its charm because it was one of a kind and no one knew wtf was going on. A lot of these people didn’t even have engineering and full bags of consumes when they PvPd back then. Many players nowadays from retail or who have kept playing have changed their minds on how to play WoW in regards to what they feel is a good use of their time and “It’s a pvp server” or “red is dead” really don’t mean a lot to a vast majority of players; the hardcore vanilla guys are pushing that narrative of “the spirit of vanilla” onto everyone else. Look if someone wants to transfer away, let them because these roaming death squads are going to lock down a lot of zones for weeks and potentially push out a VERY early release of BG’s. But if we do that it goes against the ever popular “no changes” even tho it’s probably the best play. Blizzard isn’t the reputable company you once knew it to be, it’s a clown fiesta.
---
Aimbots are just like aiming. All they do is help you aim!
---
By right he means correct side.
---
Yea, you just log out and the group remains
---
&gt;I mean addons like this existed back 15 years ago.
---
No they didn't.  I played Vanilla extensively.  That's just not true.
---
What kind of gear would be required for that? I just got to 60and my gear is not fully preraid bis, can I still solo him? And is a specific spec needed?
---
Start an alt and wait for a week or two. It will calm down a little and you chill lvl an alt. There is no so much ganking at lower lvl and next week there will be dishonorable kills (they will reduce honor, now everyone has 0 honor so nothing to reduce) so in lower bracket you will fight more like your lvl range and people will focus more on lvl than on ganking while being 60 lvl and bored 
---
It will be ok, just chill for a week or two :)
---
And hes doing it all for fake internet points which is even funnier
---
Since when does DPS factor in PvP?
---
only with bgs
---
Easy man, you don't have to hate on everyone enjoying pvp. 
---
I'm an avid pvp player, I enjoy world pvp way more than BGs, so much that in vanilla I was sad when BGs released because the world felt emptier after that, people had a place to pvp and blizzard stopped caring for big raids on capitals causing problems until they eventually died down. And I don't even care that much about big scale battles because I found it always a bit boring compared to games like DAoC. 
---
Yes PvP right now is clusterfuck, yes there is way more than before. I think they should have waited before implementing it. But certainly not just so they can release BGs just after. In Vanilla people raged that world pvp was a lagfest, some of the pvp communities even claimed that blizzard release BGs so they could shut down the world pvp that crashed the servers all the time... 
---
Yet as you said it's not vanilla, the hype will die and people will go back to whatever they were doing before because the grind is not worth in world pvp for most. I think blizzard thought poorly of how they were gonna release it, but please be patient it's been 2 days... 
---
I'm sorry you had a poor experience because of it but if you thought about it was totally obvious it would go like that.
---
No because the healers are still gladly spamming it for what they need, namely the shitty grind of archivist cape.
---
Tanks legitimately have no reason to go there. If you don't give them incentive to go there via money, you just won't ever find a tank.
---
You clearly care or you wouldn’t comment on him. That clearly has no basis to judge if you “know nothing about him”.  It just looks like you realize you’re wrong but you can’t actually admit you are.
---
lmao, alliance is the daddy bois faction, horde is the alpha man faction
---
how's phase 2 rushed? what's happening right now was gonna happen whenever it was released. the only issue is not having battlegrounds.
---
Sure you did.
---
no, the nochanges incels specifically asked for this.
---
Melee DPS ofc :)
---
7,400 Hks so far, about 90% in Southshore.
---
I feel like it's slightly natural though. It's kind of like how we dehumanize the opposing side during war, or more along the lines of how everyone is the hero of their own story. "I'm on this side, so this side must be great and the opposing side must be trash." Idk though, I've played both and everyone I've come across is pretty awesome. Stay classy classic
---
d c d   j o a a f
---
Will change later though. If you can reliably get over 30% spellcrit (not that hard with buffs) without sacrificing a lot of +heal it becomes a fairly strong stat. 
---
There are also shenannigans involved with mana cost reducing trinkets. Illumination gives you the full mana back that is listed on the ability. not the actual mana spent. So with enough crit and mana cost reductions you can actually create mana out of thin air. 
---
That was one of the reasons the talent was nerfed twice in TBC.
---
Not everything in Classic progresses as it naturally did in Vanilla.
---
Mara was available on release, talents were available at their 1.12 form on release, items were not the same as release,...etc.
---
The phases are to replicate a feeling of vanilla progression, not to be a literal replication.
---
&gt;Why would anyone be surprised by a non-initial release of honor?
---
Because not having a major game mode for six months is kinda unfun.
---
I enjoy phase 2 and wpvp. It's fun and wpvp was never fair. Thats part of the game and you either enjoy it or not. I mean you have the option to play pve servers, wait for BGs to release and do that. People who play on pvp servers are playing EXACTLY for what is happening right now in phase 2. The world is alive and it's dangerous and that how I feel it should be.
---
You just need to get used to being ganked, thats part of the game.
---
This is pvp bois, it was like it back then as well.
---
This is the time when pvp/pve servers actually mean something, and god i am happy with it.
---
you need to go get 65 more DHKs
---
Yeah but I'd want something for people to schedule when they are not at the computer. LFG in Discord is all good but I was hoping for a signup of some sort
---
If you're that fed up you have 3 options:  
---
\-Level by dungeons ( I did this from 50-60 anyway to ensure Pre-bis, fuck most quests.)
---
\-Reroll PvE
---
\-Quit
---
Should have researched a little bit, or knew your time constraints better that you wouldn't be 60 by this time. Everyone knew this is how it would be come phase 2.
---
Lmao.Alliance go 5vs1, horde go 1v5, we don't care, and sometimes we win too
---
Can’t you just tag along with these raids and not group with them? Just attack people of the opposite faction alongside the raids so you get honor?
---
See, that's the problem, even though they are the same exact hamsters they are 15 years older. We need those same hamsters from 15 years ago.
---
BGs will come sooner than later
---
Original servers? What? The original servers crashed way before 600 players were reached in a single zone.
---
Where you from? I'm in Oregon
---
It’s not your actions, i dont even know who you are, I dont care if you transfer or raidlog. It’s the over the top conclusions (which i’ve mentioned like 4 times now) you’ve drawn in your first post.
---
Yeah because horde is better for ganking. And who thinks killing people who cant fight back is an epic display of skill? Kids. And kids are assholes.
---
However at least on my server (Mograine) hordes are pretty cool. I actually did one quest in Southshore yday morning and all the hordes 60 (like 5-6) just ignored me. I only left the zone because it was laggy.
---
I'm 60 and in the same boat man. Getting to anywhere takes 10 times as long, and I'm getting killed and camped in 10v1's over and over whenever I leave a capital.
---
I mean, its more likely the person teabagging you is like 35
---
Haha dude beer
---
Being 24 was about as happy as I ever was. No kids and my ex wife had a life of her own leaving me alone to do everything I wanted. 
---
I was extremely fit and felt like the perfect warrior. 
---
I do miss that time. I can’t really say I want to go back since I have 3 kids that I love. But that love is hard wired just because we are humans. 
---
I never really wanted kids. And I know I could have been happy without them. But it’s too late for that. I will love and protect them as long as I live now. 
---
And I am happy I met my new wife. She is the answer to my teen dreams of meeting an absolute porn star slut. I could probably land someone like her without having a family but then I would have had to pay for it. 
---
But the age thing varies greatly from person to person. 
---
From what I have read, talked to others about and using logic and understanding the human nature I have come to a general “rule”:
---
The ones that miss younger years are the ppl that sort of lived with a notion of “my body is my temple that I worship”.  And that’s kinda hard when you grow old to live by.
---
Play DPS if you want to. Don't be forced into roles you don't want to play by sub-par casuals when it doesn't benefit you whatsoever.
---
Tank BRD as full fury in leather gear though, it's totally fine, even with a shitty 52 healer or something.
---
I sincerely hope so.
---
People think PvP is just about the ranks, which is true for some, but a lot of PvPers simply enjoy the mode even if they don't need the gear.
---
I have pulled this one off too but it's a lot less reliable. One Shadow Bolt crit while I'm feared and I'm dead.
---
But yeah, outlasting a Warlock's mana is the main goal here. Their spells are expensive and HoTs counter DoTs perfectly. You just have to survive the fear.
---
The Middle Ages knights often started at childhood to become extremely skilled warriors.
---
Your son is on his way to become “a modem knight”:)
---
hot trash words. steam be rising from that comment
---
Theoretically, could someone mod gta 5 so that you can play wow in gta5?
---
Its strange people still saying this, while so many things changed already. 
---
Auto loot, cancel flying, no Key bag, graphics, macros, server pops and even phases are questionable. Especially Phase 2 now - its feels just empty.
---
I was gonna make a main on PvE server.. are you sure?
---
Are you kidding? Addons that held your hand way to much absolutely existed in vanilla. Fuck, orginal Healbot basically played the game for you and would auto-downrank spells if less healing was needed. There were all kinds of "quality of life" addons in vanilla. I am sure there were addons that spotted people near you.
---
Dang, ok.  Thanks.  I'm just surprised I didn't get one in two runs.
---
Ok, lets say you're right about original servers. Address how private servers can achieve 600 man pvp lagless.
---
What's a good amount of mp5 to aim for in classic? I'm a resto shaman sitting at 39mp5 with about 355 hsp. Mostly using rank 5 healing wave, rank 8 healing wave, rank 1 chain heal and the occasional rank 6 lesser healing wave. I feel I'm doing ok, but I'm sure I can be more efficient. Any suggestions? Thanks boys

Since reading doesn't seem to be your strong suit, I'll help you out.

The total shutting down of entire zones is  not what why a lot of people rolled PvP servers and I can only assume that people like you are either on a dominant faction and largely immune to it, have some kind of warped buyer's remorse and have to pretend like its peachy or are trying to protect your own ego because people are saying its not fun.
---
I've been playing WoW for 14 years. I know how the game works. I know how vanilla worked. And this kind of stuff never happened on this scale. If this is your idea of fun, ok. Good for you. But its mighty telling that you and yours are the ones who feel the need to try and adjudicate how people feel about the game.
---
I think that pvp meta is soloing during the day and doin hilsbrad during prime time cuz it is more fun.
---
They like to say it when it’s convenient for them
---
thats exactly how classic pvp servers went, thats exactly how people ranked up.
---
pvp servers were always scummy, teabagging, overkill gank-squads. and you signed up for it - embrace it or leave.
---
i seriously doubt you people have the least bit of foresight. its like going to the beach and complaining about the sand.
---
"oh but i didnt expect it to be that bad" well, you are wrong. but noone wanted to listen. now we got overpopulated pvp servers with people whom dont wanna fight (but complain) and almost empty pve servers. good job.
---
I agree, I would like them to add at least WSG into the game. Although:
---
EVERYONE, I mean EVERYONE. Every post on reddit, every youtuber, everywhere you go they said this would happen. So you people crying about it should have rolled PvE.
---
My conclusions being what, exactly?
---
I would say it is indirectly nerfing.  Either you make them weaker (direct nerf) or make everyone else stronger (indirect nerf).  Either way the content is easier relative to the players.  The parry and block changes though are direct nerfs.  
---
Other direct nerfs : Onyxia's fireballs will no longer result in a confuse effect (Engulfing Flames). 
---
Lava Surgers no longer respawn once you kill Garr. (with how fast people clear MC now it wouldn't matter anyway).
---
Ragnaros now stays up 2 hours rather than 1 after being summoned.(Doesn't matter if 1-shot)
---
◾The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible (So they fixed a bug where you wouldn't get any but made them easier to deal with).
---
In general you are right.  Very few nerfs (at least listed in the patch notes).  Honestly they didn't need to nerf most of the content due to how much they buffed players.  The only raid that seems to have gotten nerfed a bit was the versions of AQ20/40 and even then it was only a few things.
---
"Go level the game in the most unfun way possible".
---
I don't really care about you, but for me a PvP server should contain SOME PvP. It definitely shouldn't dominate the server and destroy the whole questing environment.
---
AS IT WAS IN VANILLA!
---
Why
---
The opposite faction is not more an enemy on a pvp server versus a pve server. Just saying.
---
Take a break, come back in a month, things will settle down soon enough. The game will still be around next year.
---
If you want to hardcore pvp, a dozen or so different consumables of choice for your class, 100+ grenades per day, sapper charges, all kinds of engie gadgets and trinkets. All of which are going way up in price due to high demand and lessened supply
---
Why would someone on their way to do a dungeon stop and PvP? 1 HK isnt worth risk of dying and having to spend 30 minutes getting camped.
---
I saw a video of horde farming DKs in Auberdine? Whatever the alliance town is in darkshore
---
As a developer (but not at blizzard) my guess is that official servers do a lot of quality control (things like detecting hacking, preventing weird edge cases caused by your internet hiccuping, etc).
---
I'm just basing that on the rule of thumb effort required to reach a certain level of polish increases exponentially. It's easy to put together a slap dash program that does 90% of what you wanted. As an example, it wouldn't be that hard to make a search engine that crawled the web and put things into an index for searching. But if you want it to be always online, capable of auto correct, secure, "fair" (minimizing the ability for people to artificially boost their ranking), customized to each users search history... Those things require the insane scale of Google's infrastructure.
---
People are worried that BGs will take away from world PvP. But you have a good point, the big zerg battles will die off eventually. Not completely, but they will get smaller and less frequent over time.
---
This is something I am for. BGs were a good way to fill in the lost space, something to do when you were tired and bored of world pvp, questing, raiding, farming etc. Just to be able to relax and run a few BGs for a couple hours and grind honor was great. It made the game fun, at least for me.
---
Genuine curiosity, if you don't care about ranking in PvP, why choose a PvP server over a PvE one?
---
What was your tag
---
I love that idea!
---
&gt;And this kind of stuff never happened on this scale for this long.
---
Its been less than 3 days man.
---
It's just a phrase. Jfc.
---
Could someone give me the break down of how priest, druid, shaman, and paladin differ in healing playstyle? I like healing and I've played priest and druid so far. Just trying to figure out what I would like to main, I'm mostly interested in dungeons and raids.
---
Maybe you weren’t flagged?
---
I agree man, I absolutely love PvP, but this isn't PvP. The game is unplayable atm and just not worth my time. I've decided to just raidlog for a few weeks to see if it cleans up otherwise i'm just gonna unsub and find another game to play.
---
1k hk
---
22.5k honor
---
How much honor do you have?
---
Still need to finish my staff of Jordan 39 Enh shaman. Super excited for that one
---
The timing of p2 has nothing to do with excessive murdering.
---
This would have happened just the same if it was released a month ago.
---
Yeah it’s like killing a lowbie who’s fishing.
---
It started last weekend on Whitemane.
---
No they wont. People will fall off the grind train fast once they realize they aren't getting purples any time soon.
---
You are completely wrong
---
Thats a lot of honor you got buddy
---
I'm a night elf hunter so the definition of a new player
---
Way too late to implement this. Where are the excess horde supposed to go? Reroll alliance?
---
Imagine playing so much and be so bad at the game, its amazing
---
If it makes you feel better. In my guild the officers already stated bindings would go to MT despite the other OT and I being better geared, hit capped, and actually doing call outs and trying to lead and being active on comms and having better threat generation
---
The swarm hungers!
---
This is accurate. People pick Alliance to either be a gnome or to be a pretty female.
---
Dads pick tauren/orc, dudeweedbros play troll.
---
I was flagged as I had fought an ally group with the party I had done SM with. Even if for some reason the flag disappeared when I switched from SM to Tirsfal Glades, I would be flagged after killing the first one.
---
First of all, private servers use reverse engineered servers because they only have the clients to use freely. That's why private servers had really shitty pve scripts for a very long time. Secondly, the private servers probably use way less runtime checks and logs compared to the Blizzard servers. Also, the servers that are running classic are using the same technologies as newer versions of WoW and are optimized for things like sharding and phasing, both of which aren't used in classic (anymore atleast).
---
Quest runs = get the key then I would hope. I read of it being too parts, impressive as to how long it takes to do both parts in one sitting. Don't see stuff like that anymore
---
Except manyp players choose it for the power they get to wield over pixels
---
Found the horde player.
---
Their loss in that case. I got a couple of free HKs, they got a couple of free corpse runs.
---
Even as a 60 it turns out most other 60s are not running around alone. They run around in groups meaning you “almost” never get a 1v1. The people out in the open are normally lv 50-59s that are questing. 
---
So either I farm lv 50-59s, or get farmed by groups of 2-5 60s.. neither I would consider “fair”.
---
On occasions I have a group of 5-10 and find another 5-10 group, that’s been the funnest pvp
---
Heh. I (and many other priests on my server) never got any group to get devout shoulders, so yes, this was a thing in vanilla.
---
This!
---
World PVP is just gank squads.
---
It's great if you're in the 15-3.
---
This you did notice how?
---
It is technically feasible. They just need to spend quite a bit more on servers then they do now. But we're talking about quite an investment here. Planetside shows this for example. 300 vs 300 is not a problem there but they have an infrastructure thats specifically designed for this while WoW is not and never was. No reason for it as BGs and later layering removed the issue for most situations.
---
Just use arcane then.... /s
---
Killing lowbies can be used to bait them to bring main or ask guildies for help, now you have something worth points.
---
I'm on a PvP server and my Warlock is level 52, but I quit playing weeks ago. Just too much going on in real life. I mostly went to a PvP server to play with my boyfriend but he's a lot more hardcore than me. Based on everything I'm reading, I'm kinda tempted to just start over on a PvE server and chill. PvP can be fun but maybe there's a little too much PvP for my tastes, haha. People on PvE servers can still queue for BGs.
---
I mean there's no real discussion man. You rolled on a PvP server and are upset that you're encountering PvP, re roll on a pve server or power through it.
---
Being on a pvp server myself. It’s not about that I want open world pvp. I generally don’t. It’s about the danger. And that’s all. And it’s about feeling good when I spare someone I could have killed.
---
You can use z-"&lt;zone&gt;", c-"&lt;class&gt;", r-"&lt;race&gt;", g-"guild", and a-z to only include names who start/include(? Unsure) those letters i.e:  
---
/who c-"shaman" r-"tauren" g-"the milk man" z-"durotar" a-d
---
You're delusional if you think vanilla was like this.
---
my favorite is "LF heal arena+anger runs" for like half an hour in chat. They didn't understand why no healer wants to join...
---
&gt; Its been less than 3 days man.
---
What? Horde have been camping Searing Gorge\Everlook\Tanaris\Fellwood for 2 weeks already on my server.  
---
Right after P2 announcement.
---
This one gave me a chuckle
---
ok rouge horde boomer on 70/30 horde server
---
Honestly the number of holy pallies that turn up to a pvp group that was looking for a paladin and don’t have a plate healing set is way too high.
---
I say this as a holy paladin myself.
---
For gods sake pallies don’t throw away your plate just because you got some cloth or leather that’s better for pve!
---
Yea, that's the best part.
---
Even if they don't attack you, just imagine how fucking mad they are
---
That's one of those self driving cars. Wave of the future.
---
This was always large scale world PvP. Two big groups looking at each other for an hour.
---
The APES guys already have 58k honor.
---
This may be out of left field but check out if there are any lan gaming centers where you are staying if you can't get the laptop working. You may get surprised and find one, and it's usually pretty entertaining walking into one of those places for a gaming session.
---
I joined an MC pug with my friends, the raid never happened because we were murdered every time on spawn from Thorium Point to the entrance.
---
Quite a few people left instead of just bothering with the death runs, hes not hyperbolic.

---
Lol rly? How did they do it?
---
If you classify combat as within 5 seconds of casting last spell, is that a universally accepted definition?
---
Such condescending attitudes from horde players lol. You don't understand shit. Adding transfers would be an inconvenience to YOU, not to them. And we dont give a fuck about your desire to gank players who dont have the numbers to fight back.
---
I think op means they don't know how to pvp. You can be really good at lvling and questing and just get rolled when fighting another person.
---
Low level Players are not counted as dishonorable kills.
---
..... in pve
---
because it's not. People just don't want to waste their time. There is no age restriction for that. Honestly, it's more likely the older ones who don't want to waste their time because they don't have that much in the first place. If you can only play so many hours per week, you are not going to waste them on a dungeon that drops nothing for you.
---
.... in pve
---
This is such a fucking mess, it wasnt like this at all in vanilla and the one "fix" we had with the guid was clean and efficent for the fight, it felt ike a mechanic. Now it feels like " flail wildly, hope you get noticed".
---
Thrash or Krol Blade MH - Mirahs Song OH
---
Most shamans I've played with don't use any ML5 gear unless the gear is good without it. Fights atm are so short that MP5 can't really shine. I say just stack healing power and spam mana pots and runes.
---
Equivalent of early 10s “go play tetris”
---
Whats the addon on right that shows ur stats m8?
---
No they can’t.  You’re thinking about TBC shockadins, after they buffed holy shock by 300%
---
A crit holy shock right now does fuck all damage and has a terrible coefficient
---
if they respond back like that, waste their time. Join the group like you're really going to tank for them but just keep comming up with excuses why you aren't ready yet. "turning in quest" "plugging in laptop" and see how long they last lol
---
Honestly, you're best off buying a cheap-ish laptop yourself, for Wow.  Yes you could probably get Wow on your work laptop, but that might be audited (even if you're not connected to the company network), even if you remove it after - but then it depends on how chill your IT department.  Do you have any buddies in your IT department?  Shit, maybe they play Wow...  you could ask them ahead of time and explain it, have \*them\* install the wow client for you (so, no malware risk, etc).
---
Best to be honest and up-front.
---
DejaCharacterStats
---
Some ppl live for and enjoy serving others. You don’t. I don’t either and it’s perfectly fine. 
---
You are probably best served choosing a guild where your not depended upon like you are in the one you are in atm.
---
I have a feeling bg’s will come early at this rate
---
I did over 50 runs trying to get both, didn’t see the Rend MH drop once so now using Sword of Zeal in MH and Mirah’s Song in OH. Got the sword for round 350 at AH but it’s worth it not to have to do another 50 ubrs runs, at least for the time being!
---
yeah, OP should've known not to roll alliance.
---
There are no real alternatives than Mirah's/Thrash or paying up for a Krol Blade.
---
Exactly the reason I changed to daggers having not even seen a Dal Rend drop, let alone get to roll on one.
---
Even with a guild, expectation should be MS &gt; OS. Would tell an officer about it, even still you should have raised the issue with them though.
---
Unfortunately it really won’t even 1 shot a level 30 priest :(
---
Sadly with 45 sec timer it’s pretty useless as far as I can tell, used it a little bit in hillsbrad the other night is about it
---
Dude stop talking you’re making people think that all paladins are idiots
---
No changes
---
If you dont even know what Classic is supposed to be why are you complaining about what it isnt?
---
Alliance, the faction imbalance makes it almost unplayable.
---
&gt;Also have you considered that they were more open about it? "Baron cape reserved!" and "Only looking for caster DPS!" is basically the same and happened all the time as well.
---
It's mindblowing to me how some people here don't realize this. They read "LF caster dps" and are fine with that. But if they read "LF dps (melee item locked)" they lose their shit because how dare people lock items. It's the same thing, except it's even better. You don't limit yourself to casters because you might get a melee dps who already has that item...
---
Don’t flag 4Head
---
Then group up and play smarter. You will get more honor per kill than horde.
---
Yea I know what you mean. I don’t have any buddies there. I was thinking it’s just wow.....not porn....how hard would they “hit me” sort of. 
---
A cheepish laptop could be an option but it’s still a substantial amount of money if can’t really defend spending for a little work trip but hmm.
---
I believe this was allowed back in the day. No pve-pvp transfer but pvp-pve was allowed, correct me if I am wrong though
---
That doesn't much resemble my experience on a PvP server in vanilla. Sure the was ganging, corpse camping, occasional raids shutting down questing areas. But 95% of the time you could quest just fine and make decent progress.
---
Still went on a PvE server this time around
---
Bussy means boy beaver ?
---
I dont get it.
---
I got this tip from another too. Seems like a plan. 
---
So I don’t download battlenet to work pc? Just run wow.exe from my external hard drive ? When it’s connected to my work pc at hotel?
---
Mind me asking how did that work out for you one month later? I've leveled a pally to 45 and got burned out with the monotony of basically auto-attack levelling. So I now just re-rolled a druid. Must say so far it's been lots of fun with all the diversity the class offers but I wonder if that will keep up up to 60.
---
What kind of server do you play on??? This is the third Boomkin I saw on this subreddit, never saw one on my server.
---
For PvE it's Barman Shanker &amp; the +6 dagger skill off-hand dagger from Dire Maul (begins with D iirc, can't quite remember it).
---
Yea, I think they're assuming that the run will go smoother if I tank but I just feel like everyone is wasting everyone's time. The lower levels come for the experience and the 60's come for the gear but we go so slow and wipe so often with so much downtime between pulls we survive that it makes me want to rip my hair out.
---
I see what you mean. But. I don’t mind too fool the system but I am a bit reluctant to do that based on that I think I would feel bad about it.
---
And if people stop playing, that doenst matter shit.
---
Its a game, if its unfun. Players will leave, get enough Alliance to quit and enjoy those 30 min bg ques :)
---
As people have said, go check out fight club. Ignore most of the people here. Some of the best tank pieces are LH, Edgemasters, SGC. Threat is best in classic because you need to hold aggro, and you need to be able to hit to use abilities and generate rage/more threat
---
cloud gaming service? (nvidia geforce now)
---
just an idea, maybe there are some services live, and not in beta or smth.
---
Nice guy, makes boomer feel better about himself.
---
Druids track humanoids saved my ass a couple of times in STV
---
HUMAN?!? ORC SMASH HUMAN! LOK'TAR OGAR?
---
Lol.  Eve Online.  They have issues because they have 10k vs 10k battles.
---
Collage age students with a shoestring budget can run 1.12 servers out of some Eastern European basement.
---
[The last minutes of Nostalrius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-JMqNTn-M).  Something like 10k concurrent in 1 zone.
---
The internet connection itself should be fine as it’s a hotel used heavily by business ppl that are mostly workaholics;)
---
I understand your frustration but those items are also BiS for those classes you listed. Sucks, but it is what it is!
---
Pally/Warlock is the ultimate in Vanilla.
---
Nope my dude. Insure, ensure, assure and reassure could be used in that situation.
---
Meanwhile I'm like "I'm 29 and now I finally get to play this game!"
---
Instances are your friend. The opposite faction is not.
---
I would rather see server transfers, but they need to be made more attractive.
---
1. Make them non-permant. No one wants to get stuck on a dead server. If you give people the option to transfer back most of them aren't going to take it, but you'll attract far, far more people if you give them that safety net.
---
1. Make queues faction specific. Pretty self explanatory way to encourage faction balance.
---
1. Cut the population limits in half.
---
The outer worlds and Disco Elysium, as two recently released games, would like a word with you.
---
While I get they're niche games and won't ever get such an award, they definitely deserve it more than wow classic.
---
Neither of insure's dictionary definitions fit here.
---
1. arrange for compensation in the event of damage to or loss of (property), or injury to or the death of (someone), in exchange for regular advance payments to a company or government agency.
---
"the table should be insured for $2,500"
---
2. secure or protect someone against (a possible contingency).
---
"by appeasing Celia they might insure themselves against further misfortune"
---
I don't think insure works here at all.
---
I've had a few runs where the 5pc bonus has fucked it and have done 150 runs so feel its enough to notice the difference. Never had a single issue before 5pc!
---
I just did. I don't give a fuck about being nice on the internet to get internet points. That server is filled with narcisist piece of shit streamers.
---
&gt; I'm sure Blizzard will kill wpvp for good with bgs in just a couple of weeks.  
---
Man I sure hope they do.
---
Because you get honor whilst you're levelling and can unlock things faster at 60 (if not before). Getting a PvP trinket and 10% off repairs/vendors is amazing to have.
---
Priorities.
---
I would imagine so
---
Server transfers began in Vanilla.
---
PvP servers went away in BfA.
---
You have a really shitty sense of time.
---
I don't look at damage because I don't wanna cry. Mana management is the real game with Boomies, mp5 is a friend, as is any extra int. Bring potions and Runes.
---
You forgot point 3. when you googled.
---
"3.
---
another term for ensure."
---
Next time copy everything ;)
---
I feel it
---
truesilver is shit
---
It's not gonna help you rank at the high end but you can still quite easily get yourself on your way to a PvP trinket or 10% discount on your mount/repairs etc.
---
Heartstone time
---
Big elasticy balls then
---
Servers are already hopelessly imbalanced and paid transfers from PvP to PvE existed in vanilla.
---
You're a pretentious, elitist tool and the worst part is that almost none of your BS is rooted in reality.
---
IIRC, there was no option to auto-loot with right click, you had to shift-click every time. It wasn't until later when the option to have auto-loot be the default action was added.
---
Yea I might have been able to used a laptop in holiday too hmm. 
---
I am A bit reluctant to ask the IT department. It’s a big company and I expect them to be forced to not do anything they are not supposed to do in this time and age with companies being paranoid about phishing etc.
---
Wat
---
So I'm in the process of leveling a rg, but have a question now that PvP is out and is a potential focus: my latency on the server I am on sits between 160ms to 200ms. Will that impact my ability to raid and PvP?
---
I'm considering rerolling to a warlock instead of my rg. I play retail rg, and have always mained a rg, so warlock would be something new for me. How viable is lock in classic for raiding, end-game, and PvP/wPvP?
---
[I think you're confused man.](https://imgur.com/a/MpQBaUO)
---
Google specifically warns against confusing the two words as you have
---
You are right, it is going to murder one of the factions, but as much as i hate to point it out, unless you can flawlessly solve this issue across all servers, at most you can do band-aid level treatment that don't fix the issue, just extends the time it will take for it to reach critical mass.
---
hey, you all bitch and moaned about layers until blizzard finally gave into the casuals demands... reap what you sow  
---
you wanted people to stop "abusing" black lotus and thorium veins (le lolz, because they werent anymore by the time layering was phased out) well get used to never finding a lotus or thorium vein ever again.. get used to essences, elementals, felcloth ETC be perpetually farmed, get used to higher priced items and lower gold per hour rates, get used to heavily lowered XP per hour rates, get used to living in dungeons... blame the casuals that had no grasp on how good for the population balance that layering actually was  
---
it sucks, but its what the bulk of the players wanted... its unlikely anyone who has cleared MC wanted this, but the majority did
---
I have heard about it. But is it a thing yet? I can google it. Thanks.
---
World PvP might end but ganking never will
---
Yup, I was there. It became unplayable and I fairly quickly quit. Bliz needs to get infront of this fast. I wouldn't leave the no BGs for anything more than a week.
---
But there are no easy to get pre-bis daggers either.
---
well, depends on your goals, if you want farming rep for factions, lot of them are better off buying (runecloth, shendralar pristine diamonds), also consumables is probably the only reasonable one, though i think you dont need it in this phase yet, then for example getting all recipes, gearing up alts, getting best enchants on pve/pvp, other spec gears
---
I think gold in classic does have a lot of meaning
---
I have considered the same - and pretty much came to the conclusion that if I were to start having to travel with work quite often, I'd buy a cheapish gaming laptop.
---
ty did not know about it! might be the reasons why some ppl dominate dps meters even tough they do not have the best equip
---
I love how many people insisted those saying playing on a PVP server would result in shit like this were wrong and now we have:
---
"WTF I KEEP GETTING GANKED ON A PVP SERVER"
---
I originally played on a PVP server in vanilla and it was great for world PVP until BG came out and then all it meant was you would get ganked a lot. Given we know BG is a thing I don't exactly know what people were expecting to happen this time around.
---
I'm sure people wiil try and argue around it saying things will be fine once BG releases. Well perhaps, but you are still playing on servers where you can get ganked and the actual structured PVP activity can be done on any server without compelling gameplay such as being jumped by a group of 5 people or killed by a rogue whilst gathering materials.
---
Never use Barman Shanker in a raid.
---
Except they haven't, we get at least 1-3 awesome games each year. They might not be to your liking, but something else entirely.
---
AAA publishers and developers have gone down the drain. But there are still plenty of passionate people developing games on small budgets and teams.
---
3 melee mobs vs. mage btw
---
I "feel bad" for all the people I "have to slaughter" for my honor points, thus I agree with releasing bgs early.
---
Compared to robe of the exalted? It's expensive as shit, requires 300 tailoring, and all it does is reduce fade cd lmao.
---
No one runs starth live for archivist cape when they have hide of the wild.
---
Awesome! I’m in the first few seconds of the video (:
---
Were you playing on a pvp server at 48-60 lvl range before bg:s were released though? It wont be as bad when most of pvpers go to bg:s
---
That's Hillsbrad for ya, some mage on my server has double that.
---
They do groups of 10 man roaming around the world. They’re fast, efficient, and play a lot.
---
Level 50 mage here.  Is it worth getting Robe of Winter Night if I’m eventually going to be getting Robe of the Archmage, or would the money be better spent levelling tailoring so I can craft RotA?
---
Given that the level req is 52 for RoWN and 57 for RotA is it a good idea to own both?
---
If bgs take away from world pvp that's a good thing. Yesterday I went hunting for alliance on a relatively 50/50ish server and I couldn't find a single alliance for hours (multiple zones), only raid groups of either horde or alliance. It's definitely not fun for a solo player either way tbh.
---
But in raids, you might have to find something other than barman due to debuff slots
---
Or in PVP, but in general it's good. Heartseeker is the next option.
---
Nice, thank you :)
---
poor rogue
---
You don’t really have higher damage as a rogue. The warrior is almost rage pumped most fights and can spam
---
Total war three kingdoms
---
Shadowfoot Stabber is a cheap AH buy. Daggerspine is an easy quest reward. Distracting dagger is BiS OH and is a simple DM West farm with a significantly higher than drop rate than Dal Rend.
---
Other options include Barmans Shanker, Scarlet Kriss, Bonescraper. 
---
Having decided to go combat daggers I was set within a few hours.
---
&gt; Faction. Based. Login. Queues. Fixes everything.
---
Worst thing implemented in WotLK to "balance PvP":  
---
"You can't enter the Lake because there's only 11 Hordes present".
---
Okay, and when a supply of healers start being an issue for Strat Live, I'm sure you can reserve them as well. 
---
Until then, I can literally find a healer in less than a minute.
---
I was honestly shocked they did not alter ranking. I remember thinking "theres no way blizzard won't understand things are different now and the hwl grind is insanely worse than ever"
---
Oh well!
---
They probable aren’t. Likely just went to go get a drink and take a piss. Probably called you a twat then forgot about you.
---
The real reason J Allan Idiot should have said "you think you want it, but you don't."
---
Yes, that's 100% TukUI, the little (and cleaner) brother of ElvUI.
---
And minus the cheating on his wife
---
&gt;people complaining had no idea
---
Standard
---
Not if he’s rolling horde. Most pvp servers are horde dominant... alliance don’t want to fight because they are always getting ganked and always outnumber. You want the real  world pvp experience, role alliance on 70/30 server.
---
Which one do you prefer if you have time for another 60 - same faction alt for farming etc or opposite faction on another server
---
Why not play on a pve server if you feel that way?
---
None of those are bis. All those daggers are comparable to Thrash Blade + Mirah’s Song which are easy to get.
---
Oh no, someone in America wants to pay bills doing something they enjoy instead of being washed out and working at Walmart, fuck him!!!!
---
Pve server
---
I will not travel much with work. I used to and I hate it lol. But I might still try to get wow to work on my wife Facebook computer that is a cheap 3-4 year old laptop.
---
No way we are all way to old an would love to be younger again
---
I think your expectation of a 30min clear of high level dungeons with sub 60 players is a bit skewed.
---
Wait, how is this not the players fault? The players wanted vanilla, Blizzard gave them vanilla. It's the players camping brm, not Blizzard
---
You seem to have missed my latest picture. I did expand the 'all definitions' and it is still missing the incorrect definition that yours has. 
---
My results are from Oxford. I'm trying to figure out what source is providing you those results. Oxford and Meriam-Webster seem to agree that Insure/Ensure are not interchangeable. 
---
My best guess is that maybe your source is pulling British-English instead of American-English since it appears you are european. The game is all based on American-English, making this use of insure still incorrect.
---
They are cheap as hell these days.  I recently got a 64 gb USB drive at microcenter for &lt;10$
---
Seriously, I'm *already* recognizing several alliance players on my servers.
---
That one mage who keeps blinking into the zerg, using frost nova. 
---
That Paladin who overextends and dies every time without bubble or Blessing of freedom
---
That one gnome warrior tank who refuses to engage and mostly peels for his healers
---
I *love* that. Warmode being all about fighting random people from all around the world makes it *too* random IMO.
---
Not having to worry about water just speeds up the run for me. I just sit no matter what after each pull.
---
Also, it's okay to have some spare water in the end of the run if you ask me for future stuff.
---
Ive heard a lot of stories about how DK's work, can someone explain what impact they have now and in the future?
---
There are ghosts there, level 17 if i recall correct.  Get a lock to cast detect invisible and you can see them.
---
On top of actually being informative concerning details of the game. Most WoW streamers just sit silently, or half ass answer questions because google exist.
---
That's just blatent nonsense. Nobody gets Heartseeker as it's basically on par with Barmans from a pure AEP point of view (ignoring Barmans naff proc) and only slightly ahead of Shadowfoot Stabber.
---
The latter you can spend 30g on and still equal or outpace sword DPS.
---
The options given all produce solid raid DPS if you want to move away from swords.
---
guild wars does it really well
---
Get Detect Greater Invisibility buff from Warlocks, it might answer to your question.
---
I should have elaborated on that - most dungeons take 2 hours minimum and sometimes we call it halfway through because people who are 50-51 pull extra enemies that are 56+ and the level difference is so big that all they get are glancing blows.
---
An Arena/Angerforge run in BRD takes an hour.
---
LBRS took 4 hours with 10 people to clear.
---
I support this, and i play on the heavy side of a 57/43 server.
---
ugly pet
---
I kept my sorta crappy +20sp robes all the way until I recently crafted robe of the archmage and I think it was a good decision. If you get good dungeon robes that's great, but Archmage is so good it's worth being your primary focus.
---
I'm not sure how expensive Winter Night is but I wouldn't pay more than 50 gold for it- If I did that, I could focus on other gear, bags, and epic mount before crafting Archmage.
---
Keep in mind that including the plans, archmage is going to be 500-700g or more to craft and unless you are on a pve server, it's only going to get more expensive as it gets more difficult to farm water, earth, and air essences. 
---
That's about 25-35 hours of my gameplay which is mixed zf and dungeon runs, so if you don't have that kind of time you might look at a lesser robe for now.
---
Man, I'm 33 and have 3 kids. I remember fondly playing wow with my friends more than I slept. Drinking, eating like shit and having a blast. But the joy I get from hanging out with my kids? Wouldn't trade it for anything.
---
I've said for a long time that part of being an adult is about giving up things you want for things you want more. And man, I want to hang out with my kids more than I play wow. (Until they go to bed, then it's wow time with my wife.)
---
Not quite as bad as thinking you found a Black Lotus and it' something else
---
Same faction/server, since I can send myself some bags and having 4 professions is nice. Ability to ask guildmates to help is great too.
---
That's not how it works, the lag is completely separate in different zones. There could be a 500v500 fight in tarren mill and chill wind camp would be completely lag free. You had lag because of fighting going on in wpl.
---
Sounds like ppl are stepping outside their lane. Shouldn't rly be running lbrs for example til 57ish.
---
You're not sorry to break it to him, you're fully torqued on the edge of your seat lmao
---
still isn't the servers you vegetable.

---
But..... I only want pvp in bgs..,,,
---
I knew who asmon was, wasnt too interested in him until me and my friend watched "Asmon Goes Outside" by catdany and it was just fucking hilarious.
---
Your point checks out
---
Point is that you traded your Thrash + Mirah’s for equally poor daggers. Not to mention that dagger spec does mathematically way less dps than sword spec until you have Perdi and a bunch of tier gear.
---
I see a person that bought 40g :p
---
Maybe not and you just met a kind stranger :)
---
Why iron grenades instead of thorium?
---
Culture and meta changes were obvious fro m the start with aoe cleave and reserve runs, BiS lists, etc.
---
I've been playing Classic since day 1 on Whitemane so if you really think my sudden disinterest in the game is solely the result of getting ganked, no offense but you aren't very bright because that rodeo started months ago.
---
Horde players in particular are already running scared about PvP servers dying because the faction imbalance is making Alliance players want to transfer due to the imbalance. That's not me being hysterical, that's a real concern for a lot of people because servers that end up being 90/10 for one faction are effectively dead for the 10 and become PvE servers for the 90.
---
I'm sure people are impressed by what a cool PvP purist you are but unless you have some substantive ideas or input on the matter, kindly piss up a rope because I'm not among those impressed. You have nothing to say besides the same tired garbage and I'd be genuinely shocked if you didn't play Horde. Its the only explanation for your absolute failure to understand that the game has been borderline (or totally) unplayable for several days now.
---
Uh oh, lotta paragraphs
---
“Occupied!”
---
&gt; I would consider a "great" Rogue decent
---
There's the problem.
---
I want bgs though, ranking from wpvp alone is aids if you are going for higher ranks.
---
Fuck I am sucking at killing the demons.
---
I have killed ONE  WS demon so far - so, my question is, can I get another hunter to kill the demons and I just sit around and do nada?
---
That's patently false and you don't see casters reserving items in groups chat. There is only 1 reason to run strat live for 99% of people and that's either quests or because it's the best gold making instance with common orb drops that sell for a lot.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwssh9/world_pvp_the_honor_system_and_you_a_quick_primer/
---
Alliance are so used to trying to sneak into zones they forget they can actually fight back. Had a raid of 7 people chasing 15 horde last nite, I guess they weren't expecting us to fight them and we looked bigger than we were.
---
I get you, bro. Strange world we are living in.
---
"YO Ur An Evil Ko RE an" gets me every time
---
I don't really see what your argument is. Other than rogues, what other class really needs to be using faps? It covers a warriors weaknesses best, whereas a mage gets a lot less out of it. Warrior without fap is useless against a mage, with it they can kill one much easier
---
For undercity the horde gaveyard is in the courtyard in the ruins above and the alliance graveyard is the SM graveyard to the north. For thunderbluff the horde graveyard is slightly west of the lifts and south of the spirit rise. Ironforge alliance graveyard is right out front where people tend to duel while the horde graveyard is the graveyard in khronos. 
---
Indirectly you might be interested by knowing that while the horde has no graveyard in the alterac mountains the alliance has no graveyard is silverpine forest if you die as alliance in anywhere south of Sepulcher you need to run from Southshore and anywhere north of Sepulcher requires you to run from the SM graveyard.
---
Desolace sucks for alliance, most just want to get out as quick as possible. Most of the quests force you to cross the whole zone and grind a stupid amount of mobs. Sm is the same, it’s a pain in the ass just to get to it. Same with stv,  badlands and anywhere you have horde only or neutral flight paths. Go start shit near south shore or arathi or ashenvale. Horde in that area horde runs too unless you’re right outside hammerfall or tm or you’re outnumbered, mid fight or low on hp/mana.
---
It will most definitely not be couple of months. A month at best, at least for partial P3 content. This situation is untenable, on majority of servers game is very close to unplayable. P2 without BG's would be sorta fine, if servers weren't so overpopulated and had amounts they should have (or some alternative like faction queues).
---
Not being able to move more than 200y in any 45+ zone without a raid behind you is not really fun, but most importantly, is NOT vanilla.
---
"Group up and play smarter" is that gonna make it so that me and 39 others can kill 150 people? No? Thats what I thought
---
it's a song.. and a quite good one at that. check it out sometime.
---
And you know this because you are a dev at Blizzard? 
---
We don't do assumptions.
---
Same here brother!
---
I think this is what I'm going to have to do. The small number of times I've been allowed to DPS have gone smoothly because I know exactly what I'm doing and I enjoy doing it, so I have more motivation to play the role well.
---
I always assume the people who Insta whisper 5 people at once are also people who won't feel bad for declining one person in case two say yes.
---
Dagger spec performs on par with or exceeds swords when you itemise correctly, even before perditions and tier 1/2.
---
Get 6/8 Tier 0 (Ideally) , spec accordingly and the raid DPS is solid, not at all 'way less'.
---
Given how strong 6/8 Tier 0 is it let's you focus on other itemisation in the first instance.
---
You do know there's a MASSIVE decay each week right? Me getting 500 kills this week wont mean SHIT when I wont be 60 for another 2-3 weeks.
---
Oversupply compared to demand, since many other people had your same mindset.
---
As with all markets never follow the obvious trend.
---
if barnes hut works for n-body i think there is a way to make it work in wow
---
%20 of your accumulated weeks honour per kill this doesn’t show up without addons though.
---
I swear to god im not a fanboy but 1 Rog like pshero would already stomp his ass even if both go full tryhard
---
Even ven is a great mage btw
---
I think you'd need to install battlenet + wow on the external drive. Test it at home before you go :)
---
Sit on your materials and all still.
---
Give the market time to decrease its current supply.
---
For anyone who doesn't know what happened on Kronos: There was a system that allowed players to queue for bgs from anywhere in the world (and then reappear in their previous spot after the bg). It resulted in horde rankers sitting at flight points etc. between bgs (usually 10-30 minutes or so wait) and killing all alliance levellers. On other servers without this feature, horde rankers would usually still do this but they needed to travel for 3 minutes or so after each bg.  
---
The thing that perplexes me to this day is how it could become that bad. The horde only had a tiny population advantage, the server was very close to 50-50. I guess all people interested in pvp rolled horde but still kinda weird. One thing I noticed while herbing in duskwood etc. was that there were huge numbers of alliance levellers from the classic hype, but only few 60s.
---
It got so bad that many alliance quit. Others resorted for the last few levels to farming weird spots like the troll village in the cliffside between Felwood and Darkshore.  
---
I fully expect it to be even worse this time.
---
I don’t think it’s fixable. Retail lags even worse than Classic and it’s been this way for years and years.
---
Unless you really want the power spike now, archmage.
---
Mats for archmage are expensive and you really want to be getting that and epic mount asap (order is up to you)
---
Archmage is bis until phase 4, so the sooner you have it, the longer you're gonna get value out of it. I'd recommend checking elementals to see if you could grind xp and essences at the same time and get started now(eles in silithis are 55ish iirc, not sure if there's eles at level 50ish) but with phase 2 release I'm not sure if that's gonna be better than grinding gold and buying them. It's gonna be server dependent. If you can find a spot and grind for a few hours without getting ganked much, it doesn't take an insane time to grind the essences.
---
I'm not complaining. That's not to say it doesn't piss me off to get killed every 10 meters when trying to pass through any high level zone. But I'll just play other games, it's fine.
---
So you're DUI'ing? shame!
---
13 hk's at lvl 40 because sometimes you run into someone in the SM waiting room who isn't a lvl 60 who's just there to farm noobs lol...
---
I'm pretty much just meat for level 60s at this point.
---
What server is this?
---
Venoxis-eu
---
Great argument you really backed that up
---
you dont understand the game and how the developers allow the use of addons, you want the game your way, even though the people who made the game allows it.
---
Because lot of people had the same idea. Prices were shooting up weeks before P2 even launched and now everyone’s dumping it.
---
My first post on Reddit! You the Druid kiting it? I killed you when you were nearing UC coming from EPL still kiting it. Should have just watched you. Sorry for that. -I was the huntaard. There was a mage too.  14 honor points from ya. :)
---
Herbalism is more useful for a priest tbh. Especially if you plan to farm DM:E. You don't need to mine the ore for engineering yourself.
---
Two choices:
---
1. Roll with a team. Group and quest together.
---
2. Run dungeons.
---
One of the cringiest posts I've ever read.
---
2 characters in the group, one is in the instance the other is not. The one who is not in the instance is group leader. Log off on the character that is in the instance, then leader resets instances. Now when logging in the character that was in the instance will be at the entrance inside the instance and it will be reset.
---
You can of course have more people in the group too, everyone in the instance just needs to log off.
---
You can even do this with your alt on the same account. Make someone else invite two of your characters into a group, then when you want to reset the instance you log onto the alt and due to the main being offline it gets promoted to leader in a couple of minutes. Now reset instances and log onto the main and you'll be at the start again.
---
1-2 hours before the time you want to raid and have a chat with people see if there are groups/pugs/guilds in need of the role you wanna fill etc etc,
---
?????
---
Servers wont get fixed, adding BGs is the best solution
---
I will thanks. If i cant find my wife’s old laptop.

Currently level 42 feral druid thinking of respeccing to balance. Can anyone either sell the idea of balance or tell me how god awful it is that I stay feral?
---
raid consumables and respecs are a pretty big weekly expense.

Yes, eventually all the alliance will be dead.
---
Haha what the fuck dude. Are you from india by any chance?

But ... #nochanges right? right? /s

Glad om on PVE. Alot of pvp at hillsbrad here for those of like it
---
this is why R14 is going to be impossible unless you play 14 hours+ a day.
---
it isn't how good you are, or how well geared you are, its how much time you can spend grinding it.
---
Just want jump in on this, as someone who strongly dislikes the fact the game is written in American rather than English. 
---
The results posted showing insure as another word for ensure, is entirely wrong and I noticed the default language of the search was not English and so I’m chalking that up as a poor translation error. 
---
Insure is most definitely not a synonym for ensure, and ensure would have been the correct word for Tirion to use.
---
If you are talking DM E jump runs then no. The first lasher will probably kill you and you would have no chance on the final boss.
---
Whoever Down-voted this rolled a 1 IRL and hates the world.

Start doing rend/Jed runs at 57 and just do nothing but those runs until you have both dal rends , the eye patch, and true strike shoulders. Get your black hands breadth and ring from Ubrs if you can. That I think is priority. Once you get all that reall just take whatever you can get. Strath for back, scholo for chest, brd angerforge runs for hand of justice, dm north tribute runs for ring. Get your devilsaur ASAP. Also do the chain quest for your neck mark of Fordring .
---
But yea do ubrs non stop once your 57-58 until you have that gear. That I think is priority. After that just kinda take what you can get. I love doing strat live side for crusader orbs and runecloth.
---
Unfortunately there is no hooters where I am going. If it had I would not be playing wow;)
---
Give it time.
---
No but I did martial arts for ages when I was fit:)
---
His name is Pog-Champ thus he's a Twitch-beta so no, he's not intelligent enough to know how a d100 works.
---
Don’t blame this on English, in English they are different words. In American I’m sure they’re different too but if either were to butcher words it’s American.
---
It is what it is. Little you can do to change your genes :)
---
It most definitely will because BG's aren't everything in P3, and as such my statement remains true. Pretty much everyone agrees BG's need to come out before the release of BWL, but that wasn't what I replied to, nor was it the argument.
---
Have you rolled a druid eventually? If yes, how has it been so far?

Just wanted to note that this page is run by the Oxford University Press itself, and even there you can find that.
---
No matter how good you are, you are just an easy replaceable DPS and will never have value in a dungeon group as a tank. It's just how the game is, DPSs are dime a dozen.
---
No shit.  How it always was.
---
LMFAO wtf?
---
Why did that one rogue walk away and start shooting him with a bow?
---
I am rolling Horde. Wanted to do Ally this time around (Shadowmeld+Aimed Shor rocks) but my RL buddy wanted to roll a Warlock and understandably loathed being at the receiving end of WotF.
---
Hey don't you dare trash talk Stormlight Archive
---
As anyone who played retail will remember, the warmode for alliance were a problem for many months. Plus there really wasn't much of an incentive to PvPing in warmode, it just let you use your PvP talents to do WQs faster. In classic, at least until P3, there is a huge incentive to kill as many people as possible, whether they want to fight you or now, whether it's a fair fight or not.
---
I hope it will die down, but I really feel like it won't until P3 makes honor farming in BGs more lucrative than roaming gank squads.
---
Oh get fucked. I was enjoying the PVP aspect of the game just fine before honor. 
---
Now roaming death squads are encouraged and rewarded; it has made the other critically important aspects of the game -questing, levelling and exploring- practically impossible.
---
If you think that just because as server is PVP means that ALL other aspects of the game should be totally disregarded then you’re a fool. 
---
Let’s not forget also that the majority of servers are PVP, so anyone newer to the game could be forgiven for not being totally in-the-loop before investing days of their life into a character. 
---
If blizzard aren’t careful, the game will go the way of fortnite, where casuals totally abandon it because they’re sick of getting totally shit on from the get go.
---
we bgd for 15 years man can we have a world pvp meta for a lil bit plz
---
I agreed to tank a few times because our server is tiny and recruiting people on our faction is hard.
---
At first it wasn't too bad - it was me and some other 58+ doing runs for BIS items. Then as more casual players approached their early 50's we started bringing them in for runs. 
---
One run lead to a few runs. Then a few runs lead to every single dungeon.
---
Pretty sure the reason this kind of thing stopped is because battlegrounds were introduced that have far better rewards and no risk of dhks.
---
Alliance is a running simulator.
---
So horde.
---
Lvl 60 Orc Hunter.
---
Lvl 60 NE Hunter.
---
I prefer Alliance though after experiencing both.
---
Horde look like a 7 year old Drew them...
---
I partly disagree. Here is why:  
---
I played on a private server that did just that. They implemented a queue that would limit the faction balance to 60-40. The server was a TBC server (nobody wants to play alliance in TBC, it is just worse).
---
All this did was kill the server because now horde couldn't play the game at all. Try raiding with 4 hour queues and not even the option to transfer to another server.
---
What is actually needed is a queue-skip for the lower faction if the faction imbalance is too great. This has way smaller impact. Yes the horde will have slightly longer queues but they won't have impossibly long queues like they'd have from an enforced faction-balance queue.
---
It’s by far my favorite series, but I still think everyone using it as an excuse as to why they’re still lv 10 is quite dumb. You’re not enjoying the journey more than others because you have 5 hours of /played in 3 months, you’re just not playing the game.
---
I would say Domo is still pretty easy to PUG.  Rag is probably the only one that might be harder with a complete PUG due to maybe not having enough FR on the tanks and people not having consumables/spread out properly.
---
Follow the link to ensure, and read the definitions there. They’re not the same, not interchangeable, and not synonyms. 
---
Note they say particular North American, it’s highly likely this is another case of words being misused to such extent that it has just become accepted, many words in North America have formed this way, or particularly expressions. 
---
But ensure and insure are not interchangeable, at least not in English English and not by their original and intended meanings.
---
Yeah, but that's just it. You can empathize with people who can't play the game they love because of shitty design. I'm not waiting for Blizz to do anything, I don't really care that much myself. But at least you can avoid being a dick saying stuff like "So many people rolled on PVP servers because "gangster" and are crying right now because that shit came home to roost."
---
I know you're not the person I originally replied to btw. But I just kinda wanted to defend op because honestly, I'm 100% with him. And it pisses me off to see people spouting nonsense at him for having normal feelings.
---
100% op did not roll on a pvp server because "gangser" or whatever fucking nonsense. And 100% op or anyone else does not deserve to get camped while trying to enjoy the game. And I don't think *everyone* saw it coming. I certainly didn't, I knew there would be a lot of pvp, but not entire zones getting camped and having to die 30 times to get into a dungeon.
---
zerg pvp isnt the best way to get honor or rank in the first place.
---
People who worry about shit like this are not good hunters.
---
No offense.
---
It's a waste of money man...
---
Play PlanetSide 2 if you just wanna logon and do gnarly PvP.
---
Play WoW if you want to be an adventurer.

I can only imagine how many punches to the head you took.

yeah pretty much if it was the old way we would have some world pvp around the hubs
---
i recall fighting in ashenwale while waiting que
---
Thanks for free honor. I need it and don't worry, I'll stop when I reach rank 10
---
You never played vanilla if you think this is how it was.
---
Exactly, North American. Which is completely debunking what the OP of the comment I initially reponded too wrote, namely that the definition I found is british english and therefore has no place in WoW which is entirely american english. 
---
But this says otherwise. And yes, I truly believe that misusing the word to such an extent is the culprit here. We have the same thing in german with the word "to look" - "gucken", but because so many people wrote "kucken" instead, it is now officially (in the Duden, our main dictionary for a lack of a better word) approved as a correct way of writing the word, even though it is technically completely wrong.
---
If they have 4 raid groups roaming in a zone, then maybe pick another zone?
---
you lie
---
a lot of people are triggered by a hat because they attribute meaning to it that is completely false. Basically they are idiot simpletons.
---
maybe in full raid BIS and popping consumables,  but other than that no lol
---
So PvP players had to wait 4 months until they can start properly playing their game, but you can’t wait like a week because you want to finish some quest?
---
"for this long"

Playing "wow" for 2 minutes. Aw yeah its wow time."
---
Ok.  I did exactly the same thing.
---
Work laptop.  No admin rights.  Cant install games on it.
---
Solution:  Copy your bnet folder directly from your desktop PC on to an external HDD.  Plug in to your work laptop and load bnet via the HDD.   Once it connects (it should with no issue), find go to the games&gt;wow tab and click "find installed game".  Direct it to the external HDD folder with your copy of WoW in it.  Viola.   Game will play.
---
I did this with Diablo3 when i worked abroad so I could play in the evenings when not on site.  Works a charm, and nothing gets installed on the work laptop so no one will even be aware.
---
Just remember to turn ALL settings down to a minimum so it runs ok.   As a note, D3 cause my work laptop to get very hot (I think i eventually cooked it tbh).
---
Because suggesting what someone is doing is inferior could be interpreted as offensive

I completely agree with you, dont get me wrong. I was just playing devil's advocate here, but I really dont agree with the way this is handled, whether it is concerning kucken/gucken or insure/ensure because this is just confusing.
---
true :)
---
I'd value cheap shot over garrote any day, even against a mage. Combo points!
---
Familiarity breeds contempt.
---
Could be pagle. But no Kim in the chat or nadox looking to buy cloudkeepers or stats +4.
---
"ooOOO he fled"
---
Ppl that reserve loot in pugs are childish
---
Did you actually watch the video? Those rogues are not playing like decent players.
---
Balance isn't bad damage wise the problem is that it uses a lot of mana.
---
You will basically have to drink to full after every 1 or 2 mobs which will make leveling a lot slower since feral basically never needs to stop killing things.
---
You mean the 15 horde spamming "go tore tail" 5 times per second aren't just the world's fastest typists?
---
You could back in original vanilla.  My brother used to sell kills of the demons and made a lot of money doing it.
---
But no idea if they changed it for the current version of  classic.
---
* Old god stuff
---
* Giants and Iron Dwarves
---
* refreshing and colourful (relative to the other zones) atmosphere and background music, especially if you didn't start with Howling Fjord
---
Considering the only other zones that are not (completely) scourge infested shitholes are Scholazar Basin and Howling Fjord. All the other zones' story arcs are basically one direct storyline fitting together, Grizzly Hills is especially a nice change of pace.
---
Hardly justification for it being so vastly inferior. Could easily be a case for it being better.
---
Here's the thing about helping (low level) guild members:  
---
You should help them with something that they are incapable of doing due to external factors. You are not responsible for them limiting themselves or required to help them with something that they should be able to accomplish on their own.
---
If they for example just don't want to tank or heal despite playing a class capable of it, they are limiting themselves. It is not your responsibility to help them at every turn. Sure you can run dungeons with them but you should run dungeons for yourself as well.
---
It is not your responsibility to make them level up via dungeons. They can just do that on their own. Farming xp is something even the worst bots can do so they should be able to level up as well.  
---
Even worse, their slow levelling speed is holding you back because you can't even take them to the dungeons that you want to run. And their low online time means even when you finally get them to 60 they won't have time to help you with it.
---
Ultimately the goal in helping people should be to teach them to become self-sufficient so they can eventually help others. If they can't ever get past needing your help or towards being able to help others, investing time into carrying them just holds back everyone: Yourself and people that could flourish with some help.
---
Another thing is the "couple of people feeling like carrying the whole guild":  
---
Yes that is nearly always the case in guilds that aren't specifically going for a hardcore push. It is fine to a certain regard but if it is too bad then you and the other active people are better off joining/forming another guild because otherwise you will always be held back.
---
dont blow your load on me, i play on pve server, i know what was gonna happen and i didnt wanna be in that environment,
---
and because of this, its unreasonable to assume billion dollar companies can do better in 2019? That's just ridiculous.
---
\&gt;It was hard to find alliance in world pvp after 10pm last night because most alliance were probably tucked into bed by their parents by then.
---
Ah, yes, that's how kids imagine adult life - world pvping all night.
---
Spy. I love it because it helps avoid large raid parties. Invaluable to life.
---
&gt;You quoted my examples and then ask for examples. You are absolutely hopeless.
---
Yes for actual cultural and meta changes. All of your examples were happening in 2006.
---
&gt;Also all we have is "anecdotal" evidence about faction balance and none of it suggests any server is balanced at all. 
---
lol, american schooling has failed you. When you only have anecdotal evidence, you don't make sweeping generalizations or conclusions from it, you wait for actual data. Yes your experience is bad and it sucks and you have to take actions for it, but it doesn't make for substance or actual evidence.
---
I want to pour coffee directly into your open asshole
---
undead
---
But should be imo, where is the fun killing people who cant even react?
---
These are all minor t.o the overall impact the game. Including talents is a no brainier. Including pvp later into the game was vital to build up the tension that led to the massive wars we are seeing now. Of course it isn't a facsimile. They chose(more or less) the 6 biggest changes to the game to be the major release points, with honor being one of them. IDK about you but of the top 6 biggest changes in wow classic honor would definitely be up there
---
The point is to keep the populations roughly similar size during playtime.
---
Lmgd has more than 93k honor and he's duo farming (2 rogues).
---
You're so fucking dumb lol.
---
The Stick Figure Raid video?
---
Nah it works, from either side of that spot where he jumped.  Other side you use the ledge to turn around.
---
This isn't an unpopular opinion among decent or good players. Unfortunately bad players are far too common.
---
There are two issues. 
---
The first is that you'd need a very good healer. The bosses will crit you and chunk you routinely for more than half of your health. 
---
The second is that you actually don't do more damage than the warrior. One reason is because the warrior will be fed rage because they are tanking and the second is that you will do shit damage always attacking from the front no matter your gear.
---
youre shattering their inflated egos
---
It will. I see more and more people having more normal pace with game (like not playing every single day). It doesn't mean game is going to die but most people just don't want to sit every single day doing world pvp. They do it know because it's new and fund and hot. But after couple of weeks it will settle down.
---
They work exactly the same dude, it's just displaying information differently, that's why banning Spy is difficult without banning other add-ons. Recount reads the combat log to display your dps etc, spy does the same and instead of showing dps it shows you just the player name. 
---
They have to rework how combat log works if they are gonna remove the spy addon.
---
Nah, you don't just understand doing like 100 HK weekly for a month will earn you way more rank points than doing 1000 of them in a single week.
---
So?
---
why are there so many pvp haters on pvp servers? even on my server so many alliance players who say that they don't like pvp. why choose a server which you know you won't like? it isn't fun for you and it isn't fun for your faction if you don't like the open world pvp. every one who quits about this "issue" is to blame. not blizzard or classic wow. if it is that bad then reroll on a pve server or quit for a few months
---
Are you for real? They aren't comparable in the slightest because they do different things. Damage meters do not give you an advantage in PvP. Think before you speak please.
---
but nochange duh
---
Lmaoooo
---
Dios mio
---
DH dont start till the honor is banked on tues, this week is a freebie on DH

Yes. Open up cheap shot, into SS, Kidney shot, adrenaline rush, SS, SS, Eviscerate. If they try and CC you break it with improved sprint. GG.
---
your on to something
---
Hello mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know why I know that; I took 3 years of Spanish
---
Then theres me level 54 warrior cant solo 2 mobs at a time since changing to fury spec.... fml
---
r/BetterEveryLoop
---
It's a spell batching issue. The first vanish you weren't far enough away and the second vanish it was either the cleave or you got hit immediately by the gun/bow from the ranged mob. 
---
Vanish isn't bugged, it requires timing because of spell batching. They're not going to change that.
---
Anyone have suggestions for making gold on PVE server? Fishing doesn't do as well here as pvp...
---
No. Why would it?
---
This isn’t a bug, you have to be far enough away from the mobs they don’t auto attack you straight out like they did here. Trust me as a rogue with 40 days played, many many hours farming BRD. The mobs also can resist your vanish, happened again if you are too close when vanishing, best thing to do is jump over a corner so mobs have to path around and vanish, it’ll work almost every time.
---
I need this addon for nearby because the amount of times I've been jumped by 10+ alliance all at once is crazy
---
Don't accept it then stop giving them your money,,. Vote with your wallet
---
If you don't force the blink with a cheap shot the mage is just gonna walk away from you lol. Then he still has blink AND block.
---
As a sword spec pve rogue? Yes, you can but you won't be as effective 100% 1v1 solo. If you are with a group and even have a healer then you will be just fine.
---
As a rogue that just uses swords? 100% you will be effective as a pvp spec'd hemo rogue. It's an amazing spec.
---
Grenades are more about the stun than damage. Iron is cheap
---
Ashbringer seems pretty decent. I don't think one side massively outnumbers the other and alliance has a good mix of hardcore and casual guilds who consistently clear raids and a lot of regular pugs that seem to perform quite solidly.
---
It's not a toomah!
---
I've been doing 5-10 man groups with my guild on both days. We camp dire maul and kill all alliance trying to get to the dungeon. We start at the entrance, kill people, then pull back around the next corner, so that they cant rez behind us. we do this 4 times over to get full honor off each person, then reset back to the start. The great thing is that DM isnt just a zone, people spent the time to get a group together for it, so they're not likely to just give up, and since its a dungeon, many people are going to be going to it over the course of hours, so you aren't just farming the same people over and over like you would at TM vs SS. Go on twitch and watch the guys from Apes stream, they're all in groups of under 10, roaming different zones.
---
1. Meet stranger.
---
2. Incentivise him to murder for personal gain.
---
Rogue with prep is a 50/50 skill matchup
---
I did it on cata release, it may have changed since then.
---
Thx :)
---
Cant tell if you are joking about my generalization on the matter or you dont know what cringe means and tried to be edgy like the other person. Either way it's been accurate on Stalagg.
---
It worked durring wotlk!
---
Move on,  raiding should only take up 2-4 hours one day a week right now.  It is not your responsibility to support others as they level.  It may be a nice thing to do but if a guild leader is mandating that you do it they are being selfish.  Most guilds dissolve anyways and if they arent raiding at this point odds are pretty good they wont be anytimes soon.  Your biggest challenge now will be finding a guild that needs a fury warrior.  Awesome DPS but all those tanks while leveling have shifted to DPS since you only need a few tanks.

Private servers were often very balanced. Nost and LH also started the servers with Honor and BGs available. I feel Blizz should have done the same.
---

---
https://www.kronos-wow.com/
---
Private server duh. Had me perplexed there for a bit. Yes, ofc, any and all game mechanics will see the players attempt to abuse them for personal gain.
---
If your combat log was properly set, you would be able to see the same thing Spy shows you. The combat log isn't just a massive spamfest of combat actions, it has settings.
---
Sorry man.  They didn't give normal people enough time to prepare, instead catering to the crowd who was complaining about being bored because they play 24/7.
---
Now they are not bored.  They are having a blast ruining the game for you.
---
I hate to say it, but just quit.  The pace for this is never going to accommodate the amount of time you are *responsibly* putting into the game.
---
My entire group of friends has already quit because of this.  I enjoy PVP, I wanted PVP.  I just would have enjoyed a sporting chance to participate in it. (Being required to play 20+ hours a week and/or follow step by step efficiency guides doesn't qualify as participating)
---
Blizzard found a way to screw even this up.
---
And layers.  Blizzard facilitated layers for people who abused it to level and get gear, and now that people like me, who did not, are going to be thrust into PVP, layers are gone.  Worst of both worlds.  They have the extra leveling and gear AND get to repeatedly kill and camp me.  I swear they sit around plotting how to make all their projects fail in the most efficient manner.
---
You'll get downvoted and insulted here, but the people here don't understand that most players are like you and I.  The reddit community is a splinter of the subscriptions.  I would imagine population will start dwindling very quickly.
---
I cancelled immediately after the announcement at blizzcon because this was obviously going to happen.  I was told it wouldn't, but here we are.
---
Just quit.
---
OOTL: what is RG?
---
What. If. There. Are. Just. More horde then alliance. Now blizzard is punishing paying customers lol?  Suck it up and deal with the 60-40 Jesus.

That's great to hear! Definitely pumped to be apart of it.
---
Can someone explain why my honor tab shows as 0 honor even though i have 443 hks. about 350 of them were in raid but that along with solo kills should give me some sort of honor? 
---
i also had 6 dishonourable kills the first day and it shows me as having 6 dks today as well. Like the dks are carrying over everyday for some reason.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dx56iz/3_rogues_vs_1_venruki/ That's some pvp.
---
Yes, most is ganking and killing people with no chance to turn the tables. That's how anger and hate builds into a desire to get back at people.
---
Steam link works way better to actually move/play from your phone. Issue is it takes a lot of data lol
---
It's funny how you think the guild is the asshole, when you are the asshole.
---
Put +mining enchant on your shit. Should find more.
---
Anyway, heres wonderwall
---
Yikes. I wouldn't want to be in a guild like that anyway.
---
I’m glad there’s horde transferring there. You are the best of the horde and you make the game a better place.
---
I still shift click to auto loot. I tried to make the switch, but I wind up just holding shift every single time I try to loot I just keep the setting off
---
I mained a rogue on retail for 8 years. Hit 40 on him last night, ALL I did was Pvp &gt;:D
---
Sounds like they're not respecting your wishes at all. I'm a fury warrior but I made the mistake in my previous guild of offering to tank in a pinch, say late at night when finding a tank is tough (I'm on high pop though). After that it was always just assumed I would tank. I get it, it's so much easier to just fill DPS and assume the warrior will tank but I absolutely hate tanking. I occasionally do it as a favour, definitely not out of joy. After that I just flat out refuse to tank if I don't want to. I don't pay €10 a month to pander to others.
---
Did you tried to calculate? I think it's can be just visual bug.
---
The average player is quite bad though.
---
Generally speaking when you have a "good group" in a dungeon you just have 4 other people that are playing their roles correctly and not regularly making stupid mistakes. This would in theory be the baseline for a competent group, as opposed to something that stands out as above average.
---
they have to change what is written to the combat log, the best fix would be to one of two options, filter it heavily while outdoors; detailed information only in raids/instances; or reduce range at which you get any information from.  
---
blizzard is sending your client the information of who/what is around you so this add on does nothing but present it.
---
Don't worry about dhks for this week honestly. DHKs are applied immediately, and since we have no rank yet (because it updates every tueday) there is no rank to decrease from.
---
Why? Because that’s the best pvp content game ever made (arguably with lineage). It’s all pvp focused...
---
It would ruin immurshunnn...or something. Using updated model packs was my favorite thing about private servers. Would it really have hurt to high Rez the game for the rerelease
---
The transfer option only speeds the death up though.
---
Let's say you limit the faction balance to 2 horde per 1 alliance via an artificial login queue. So if you got 1000 alliance online only 2000 horde players can play. The server could fit 5000 or so players and it would easily be filled to full if the horde could get in, but they're stuck in a 4 hour queue.  
---
They transfer off the server, now what do you have? 1000 alliance and 2000 horde. By classic standards that "full" server is now suddenly a "low" server. No new players roll on a low server. Now 50 alliance stop playing due to various reasons like people tend to do. Now suddenly only 1900 horde fit on the server. What happens to the 100 that are too much? Transfer off too?
---
So that's what happened on the private server: The faction balance-enforcing queue system only ever got rid of players while discouraging new players from coming to the server. Over time  it killed the server harder than any other dumb measure I've seen private server hosts try.  
---
And you're making leaving the server even easier with the transfer.
---
No, it's not a visual bug unfortunately. It adds up in the honor window exactly as in chat log.
---
What server are you on? If I want a Mara group it takes me maybe 15 minutes as a dps most of the time ( non normal work hours)
---
Running around in Azshara and getting a small heart attack when you read «Lotus» but it’s purple
---
How do you enable this on ItemRack?
---
I also feel like people won’t use consumables while they lag to death
---
3 rogues vs 1 mage*
---
Vanilla balance.
---
That works fine by me.  I can’t be bothered with all
---
This generational blame.  Let the boomers / Zoomers fight it out - I’ll get some popcorn.
---
sorry! Rogue!
---
It evens it out so that faction getting camped can at least defend itself. I am Ally on a horde dominated server (65:35), there is groups of 10-20 horde in nearly every contested zone wiping everyone. Every boat, every Ally city in a contested zone, everywhere.
---
We have enough Ally to fight back at some of the places, but we end up being spread to thin to be effective across the board.
---
The boat from Menethil to Theramore has been continuously camped since 11am Thursday and has not stopped.
---
Iirc Alt click on item in your character window.
---
Increased devilsaur spawns
---
BG's should have been here at the same time as whatever the fuck they released now. The game is unplayable as it is.
---
What's the point of this thread? This is literally just humblebrag.
---
Activision paying to improve their services is obviously a laughable proposition
---
Yep this exactly. Ally typically go to SM for a singular purpose. To level or gear. Just because some one is on a PvP server dosnt mean they want PvP every second of the day. Otherwise they would be playing retail or fortnight
---
You would have to be an idiot as an alli in such a horde dense area to start a fight unless u don't mind losing the long game.
---
It takes 20minutea to get to SM for most ally. If you camp some one it'll take them all of 2minutes to either get back up from SM or from undercity or even worse they could just log their main and TP to undercity and fuck you.
---
Why run that risk when U can just leg it in to SM get your gear LVL up and slay some PvP at max LVL
---
Probably the best thing to do is buy now since it is getting even cheaper. Eventually it may come back to a higher price but everyone realised it was going to happen lmao
---
Even people who doesnt know shit about pvp consumables have prepared for it because of all the youtube vids
---
Yeah these guys are actually braindead.

What did you expect? You were warned. All the information was available to you.

The Fire Ward needs to be SHIFT + Hotkey and the Frost Ward needs to be CTRL + Hotkey.
---
I never played private servers, but I've always heard that they were mainly PvP with few PvE options. Is that true? If so, I bet that's why they were balanced. If the best or only populated servers are PvP, that is where you'll play even if you'd prefer PvE.
---
I'm not sure why it's happening, but it's that way for me as well, and a lot of people in my guild. It is weird though because it's showing up for some people but not for others.
---
I'd say give it time. But I can say with absolute certainty that dhks will not affect your ranking this week. Next week is a different story.
---
Bro....
---
I really do not know how some of you rogues can actually pickpocket BRD for hours.I tried doing it and just actually fucking hated how soul crushingly boring it is.
---
Absolutly. I've never said that world PvP doesnt work. Im saying that the rest of the game isnt. You cant quest because of ganksquads. You cant get to dungeons because of people camping the entrance. You cant level proffesions, grind rep or do anything really because the server caps are to big for the content available. 5000 people running around in 10 zones. Ggwp
---
could be the case. but if they are the players who are complaining now about the open world pvp then it makes no sense. they rolled on a pvp server to play with theyr friends and that is fine but what is the point in complaining about phase 2 if you allready knew that you gonna hate the world pvp on a pvp server
---
Since they (unconfirmed) nerfed the drop of the orb, you're dumb to go there for gold. So no, there's still only one "good" reason to do strat live as anything other than a c a s t e r. There's a reason you only see casters LFG for it and never any melee dps who's not just doing the quests.
---
Google it. Im not going to spoonfeed you dummy
---
It's honestly surprising how little documentation they seem have for their different versions of their game, based on what I've seen and what they have said  They made it sound like a feat of strength when they "reached into the vault and got the 1.13 files"..... You guys made the damn game. Do they not archive each version before /after relaseing any patch / update/ expansion? Crazy
---
Why does this keep being repeated? Blizzard could simply disable the log showing actions performed by the opposite faction. This would have 0 % effect on threatmeters or DPS meters.
---
Most people don't like spending 2 hours a day dueling.
---
Well first off if you arent smart enough to move to the safety of dungeons I cant help you and have zero sympathy for you.  I agree you will get ganked some but once you are at the zone at worst you get killed once while outside of the instance. 
---
Leveling without a doubt will be slower until they introduce BGs if you cant commit to a few runs of instances but maybe that means a reduced play time.  I dunno but I still cant have alot of sympathy for people that joined a pvp server not expecting chaos when P2 started.
---
I'd say most people in their early 20s are still kids too lol

---
The most amazing part of that video is that he didn’t get wrecked by a wandering Devilsaur.
---
I think it’s going to come down to what you have available during your leveling process. Early on, your only 2H weapon you can use is a staff. Eventually in the enhancement tree, there’ll be a talent to learn 2H axes and maces. Using a shield is also good because it has a lot of damage mitigation. Using one weapon type your whole leveling process simply won’t be practical. Just have fun with the class, you’ll find what you like and that’s what’s important.
---
I think you mean the silly side.
---
Exactly
---
MAKE BELIOVE NOT WAR
---
I said the same thing and got downvoted. Oh well. It should get better when BGs come out.
---
I mean, yeah. That's true. But the servers were balanced and we didn't see this kind of openworld PvP behavior because the servers launched with BGs and Honor from the gate.
---
It was a lot healthier for the playerbase the way Nost &amp; LH did it.
---
Alexa, play fortunate son.
---
Spoken truly like a whinny child who has no idea how the tech works.
---
Also because tanks have less means to farm gold but I still gotta pay for repairs.

You say that as if the kind of people to camp lowbies are smart enough to know this.
---
no they shouldn't. you chose to roll on a pvp server and should have done your research. get good or get rekt scrublord.

Can someone please confirm if paladin +int/crit coefficient is 28 per crit, or 54 per crit....
---
With my classic character stats addon it appears that its 54 int per 1 crit (I'm taking my Padres trousers on and off - which have 20 int), 20 int/54 = .37% crit...
---
Is my addon incorrect though? I keep hearing mixed responses for this question and I'd really like to know with certainty - thanks.
---
Well it seems to make sense given damage share, if I do 80% of someone's health, but an entire raid of 40 does the remaining 20%, it's probably giving me the lion's share (160ish) and spllitting the 39 between whoever's eligible on the other end. Seems consistent with the honour I'm getting. (25-120, with some 150 spikes).
---
Ambush vanish ambush??????? Wtf No one actually does this.Do not listen to this guy.If you want to open up with ambush that's fine but don't waste a vanish hoping you kill him.It's better to ambush cold blood Backstab if you really want to try something this bursty then you could vanish Into another ambush of he's not dead yet.
---
I've definitely had friends (2 specifically) who have been let go for installing games on their work laptops. They both travel for work and their respective employers, used it as like _you're underperforming because you're tired_, and other stuff. 
---
They basically used it as an excuse to unload them. Don't give your employer any cause to cut you loose. Buy and bring your own stuff.
---
well if you woulve watched the whole videos it was 2v3 vs lvl 60 rogue etc, in the end 1v2 and 2v3 so yeah ok:)

Cancer the rogue should be embarrassed. 🤣

Pull-ups, planks, squats, maybe even banded rows can help immensely!

Handing in tokens qives xp, participating adn winning does not

I think it has been normalized for Classic.

I think blizzard patched being able to kill plugger Everytime I aggro him He walks off to aggro more mobs no matter how I pull him.And he won't stop running away from me till he pulls more mobs.
---
not necessary asshole but it seems they cant communicante between guildmates so its pretty whatever.

So why DID they roll on A PvP server instead of a PvE? High populations? They liked the server name? Maybe a warning by the WoW Client saying 'open world combat can be trying' may have helped? In no way can you excuse a lack of research, either.
---
Alright set me straight here.  Is it 10 levels above your level that it appears a s a skull?  Is it possible that the person in this screen shot is level 49 or lower?
---
People need to understand this. There has been a tendency where a lot of people automatically went ”you chose a pvp server, you have to live with it - that‘s world pvp for you“ while completely ignoring the scale it reached now. 
---
Long story short: if you‘re on a pvp server now with phase 2, where you’re in the minority and don‘t have a strong community to support you (or aren’t even 60 yet), you can‘t play the game.
---
Yes it changed. It doesn't work like this anymore.
---
Same with resource nodes and such.
---
A lot of people were suprised/upset when they learned that the water essence pools don't respawn in Azshara with a hard server reset.
---
They ban in waves all at the same time
---
You go enh. Until level 40 and then change to elemental.
---
Tangible reason: You dont have mana for shit in the beginning and your spells are too weak. The last few elemental talents however are extremely good and at level 40 you will also have enough mana to kill several mobs with spells. Meanwhile your AA by this point is so bad, it would take ages to kill anything.
---
At level 60 (or slightly before that) you skill to restoration. This is because elemental shamans and enh shamans both deal essentially no damage compared to actual dps speccs when it comes to dungeons and even more so, raiding.
---
However, restoration shamans are extremely powerful tools in raids and always welcome in dungeons. So restoration is the way to go.
---
No I get reduced lol I farm ally in burning steps In the morning trust me .
---
This is wrong. Rares existed on multiple layers.
---
Why are you parroting shit you obviously don't understand? 
---
The decay is only massive at later ranks as it's tied to your TOTAL ranking points. At lower ranks it's basically nonexistent.
---
Phase 2 is just a massive disaster. What a terrible idea to release the honor system without BGs.
---
Just watch the video lmao.You could be naked and still solo him.
---
Not very entertaining. Bad ncs music and low level movement (unintended back pedaling etc). Would work on that :) also the scenes are kinda boring nothing stands out.
---
Implying he already had some when writing run out and then this gif with him driving....
---
Don't drink and drives adults... Don't drink and drive....
---
Awesome man thank you
---
What classes do you play.
---
Wait, are you telling me I can do this CB Hemo build, use swords and PvE and PvP? everyone’s always just said 19/32 is best at pve and daggers is the only way to pvp. If what you’re saying is true it’s time to respec
---
It's because it doesn't work like this anymore.
---
Not this shit theory again...
---
&gt;troll village in the cliffside between Felwood and Darkshore
---
Wait what?!??
---
I stand corrected then. Somebody who claimed to be in the beta said there was a key ring, and I believed him. If it wasn't, then let's hope there's no deeper issue implementing it.
---
For all of us that played the game a decent amount and got 60.. we’re rewarded with PvP.
---
The problem is the realms are capped at 10k people like private servers, the population of level 60s is large enough to impact everyone in their level range. It's not players fault they want to PvP and finally get honor for it, it's Blizzard's fault. Overpopulation fucks everything up, not just PvP/leveling.
---
I read this as "Look at what an irresponsible moron I am. I ran out of beer implying I've been drinking already. Now I'm driving despite having been drinking and I'm such an irresponsible dumbass that I decided to play a PC game while I'm driving under the influence. 
---
You're just too fucking cool, bro. I really aspire to be as cool as you someday.
---
That's awesome. And hilarious!
---
Never go full Asmon
---
I was thinking about this recently.  The way we play the game now is different, and I don't think that even with the old AV that we would have those epicly long games again.  Everybody has now been conditioned on how to do the 5 minute AV race, and everyone now knows what's got to happen in order to win.  Back in Vanilla there were lots of people playing who had no clue how to win that BG...  
---
The toothpaste is out of the tube, and most AV games  will be quick races.  Since there will be no "resources" though, there will be an ability to turtle effectively which I expect to happen occasionally.
---
Sure, if you want to make left turns even more dangerous.

---
Yeah, this is more typical of my pvp experience.
---
Yeah, I think mostly rogues are bitching about this. Stealth in WoW PvP is already basically uninteractive, spy helps that problem considerably.
---
I'm not sure what layering means, but I'll give Pagle a try. I like the little dwarves so I have no alliance problems :D thanks!
---
47 and up is the range that a tank should be using a shield, more likely proc spec because it is just harder to hold threat from dps, especially if they are not cultured on LETTING THE TANK GAIN AGGRO for a second before bombing the mobs... and also, making the healer drink more cause they have to either heal you a shit ton since no shield = more health loss to you and or heal the whole party cause everyone and their mother is getting aggro. 
---
Rant done
---
I cant keep all the versions of this game straight. At what point did it silence?  BC?
---
&gt; Is it ok to laugh?"
---
I hate how accurate this is. Of course its ok to laugh, if you live in a free country... and if you find yourself thinking this, you might not be.
---
So actors who play bad guys in movies are bad guys in real life?
---
Given we're all paying retail to play classic.
---
&gt; Software does not stand on a pedestal above hardware.
---
We're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one! I've always held the opinion that software is the most important part of the experience and that hardware takes a back seat. 
---
Most things can be optimized at a software level to run on very basic hardware. Conversely code can be so horrible that it will choke on a state of the art system. 
---
Further, almost nobody on the product/service side of an organization ever wants to worry or even think about hardware. They want to be able to create the experience for their users and let other people worry about where it's hosted typically. 
---
I agree that there is a relationship to the 2, I just disagree that the one is not more important than the other when it comes to a users experience.
---
Because we are IMMER angry.
---
I'll make a character here and give it a shot. Is it horde or alliance primarily?
---
It’s called spy and is 100% allowed and will not be removed unless blizzard reworks the way combat works. The addon reads the combat log and is able to work based on that, so 100% legal.
---
Also Slay the Spire, Devil May Cry 5, Sekiro...just the next 3 examples that came to mind.
---
How is honor actually calculated? its like said above the diference between level and rank, but what determines the number of points you receive when you share the kill with some1 else? lets say im a solo 60 player and a party of 5 also helps me get the kill. How is the available number of honor points distributed? i get 50% the party the other 50%? or our damages to the target influence the number of honor points you get?
---
Sadly it still shows 0 for a lot of us
---
Ive relogges, restarted, went on an alt, deleted cache etc. and it is still at 0.
---
Depends where you're at. Faerlinas the best server in NA i'd say. Always pugs for raids and dungeons going on in chat.
---
From the first night to the second was a big dropoff in it on my server. That said faction imbalance has always been an issue,  I could have told them that months/years ago. Private servers  gave bonuses to the lower pop faction to get people to create characters there, it's an old problem that blizz ignored
---
Alliance furries. Ok.
---
In horde you've got plenty more furry races, but okay.
---
What makes you think he’s from India?
---
guys, it is a small, indie developer with limited resources...what do you expect? It isn't like they are owned by a mega billion dollar entertainment corporation that can afford modern and new servers.
---
 Repost, due to my previous being removed for no tag.
---
I was doing a treasure map quest in Tanaris, failed the quest and had to abandon it and collect the map pieces again. In my frustration I went on to explore the coast of Tanaris, going west. I stumbled across this cool easter egg Tauren looking village. It is inaccessible other than swimming and hugging the coast. I took some screenshots and showed how to get there in imgur. Check it out! Pretty cool and creepy area that must have been designed and later scrapped to be forgotten about.
---
Fix combat bug please, just had a regular mob chase me for 5 minutes straight, not an elite, not any quest mob, just a regular ass mob
---
https://youtu.be/DG7_oREm6Q8?t=108
---
I would have to agree. There were giant death balls of horde and alliance clashing all over Alterac Mountains, nearly 100 on each faction. I was underleveled so I had to split but it really felt like escaping a war zone. I only made it out alive bc of an invisibility potion a friend made for me.
---
The naked rogue video was life changing as a freshman high schooler haha
---
It's just people justifying why they're behind in-game instead of shutting the fuck up because literally no one cares.
---
Not nearly as much as people think it will. There are no big updates between now and... Another big PvP update in BGs. There's literally no incentive to stop PvPing the way it's happening now until BGs are released.
---
I just might. This shit is fucking unplayable.
---
Yes but do you see the target box in the Bott right corner of each picture? The classic one says ?? (Boss). If the guy in the photo was 49 or lower it would just say ??
---
If someone goes sleep after 10pm he is a kids. Confirmed info. No sarcasm no joking. Its not like somebody has to wake up tomorrow to go to work. Naahh. Game is your only life.
---
Realised so, stopped farming Azshara after Dreamfoil price fell hard due to DM
---
What's the best PvP spec and is it daggers or swords?
---
Cheers
---
Good player (Good moves) against 3 players with poor choices. Everything was very telegraphed on their end.
---
you may not believe this, but this sub isn't a hive mind and everyone have different opinions
---
No one knows what their honor is until next week. Are you talking about kills?
---
Visual error, i've had these plenty of times in retail even.
---
I like the idea of not having cross faction BGs affect people coming to the server. It could help balance the ratio.
---
They got cocky, simple.
---
They run the same in classic. It was changed midway through Vanilla
---
I haven't noticed much difference other than the occasional zerg group from either faction. If you've been sheltered in safe zones until now then you wouldn't know.
---
join the world chat, on most servers thats where people look for groups
---
/join world

The less sense it makes, the better it is.

Just to clarify, I did not drink and drive. As you can see (or can't see) I am in the passenger seat, not the drivers seat! (right hand side driving in Straya).

nice.

Also join the LookingForGroup channel. I think that’s what you’re doing wrong

The backpedallin perditions rogue is my favourite
---
Burn you, blasted gamer!
---
The eyes are wrong, should glow gold. Sweet hat either way.
---
Yeah, no excuse. Except honor and fairplay.  Which are both kinda important. So maybe some excuses eh?
---
I'm playing daggers, are sharpening stones, or any kind of stone, better than poisons in raids?
---
Not surprising though
---
I had a theory that they nerfed the drop rate of arcane crystals because I had literally gone a couple of weeks and probably 100+ rich veins and only got 1 crystal.  Then did some DME jump runs and got 4.  The arcane crystal gods giveth and taketh at their own discretion, it is not for us mere mortals to wonder why.
---
I've given up on fishing, I think its usefulness has been vastly overstated.  Nighfin soup's MP5 buff only lasts for 10 minutes, it would be worth it for 30 minutes but 10!?!?  I fish for 30 minutes and get like 3 or 4 nightfins.  I fish for 30 minutes in Aszhara and get 2 or 3 winter squid.  I'd make more money doing basically anything else as long as I'm killing mobs.  
---
This is my first time on a PvE realm and I've got to say it's different making money.  Alchemy, herbalism, mining, and high level mob skinning are the only profitable professions IMO.  Now that we're down to one layer, its sooooo hard to find mining nodes.  I have to go to silithus into the hives where nobody wants to go just to find some thorium.
---
&gt; roaming ally death squads in STV
---
That’s the difference mate. If you play horde, you have to look out for alliance banking squats. If you play alliance in p2, you’re constantly finding yourself outnumbered by people more keen to do pvp. It’s not fun.
---
ty for a constructive comment:) I think the ending was pretty nice tho with those WF procs :)
---
I hate you both. Plz, don't ruin world pvp AGAIN.
---
Mages = 0 skill to play. Faceroll class against mele.
---
&gt; Blizzard should really disclose information about server populations so that people will know what they are getting into and make more informed decisions. I think that's something we can all agree on. 
---
Knowing the faction population is what causes imbalances in the first place.  People are idiots.  They won't self-select and try to balance, they'll all rush to the server that their faction dominates.
---
Phase 2 has made me regret not going Mage instead of Rogue. I need Phase 3 so badly.
---
Idk, I'm enjoying the large scale and mob pvp. It's a short phase and we won't see anything like it again. There's alternative ways to keep leveling if you aren't 60 yet, and people have been warning that this was going to be *exactly like this* since the game came out.
---
And this is as someone with maybe two dozen HKs tops? I'm not out there camping spots, but I'm joining up with counter groups to push into dungeons and re-take FPs. It's been a blast for me.
---
Throwback to when Venruki died with Ice Block off CD.
---
What would be the right action as a combat rogue then?
---
We're not getting the version with reinforcements.
---
You want to stop a rush, do it :)
---
I have always been there
---
Damn these rogues are all in my guild lmao..
---
Good tip!!  Will try
---
Nah allies scream “O K B O O M E R”
---
&gt; Also owning most classes in 1v1.
---
Rogues is "most classes"? &gt;.&gt;
---
especially on pvp servers
---
tbh just uninstall if you lose 3vs1
---
Phase 2 has been terrible. I had a full group for LBRS and then BRD but they gave up after 45 minutes of trying to corpse hop to the instance. #NoChanges is fucking stupid, they should of released BGs in P2. They had a death squad at base of throium point, another at the doors, another on the circle, another on the chains and balcony. I can only play on weekends and if I can't run instance I might as well give up and go back to xbox. I dont' have a question I just need to vent.
---
We have a geared boomkin in our guild and as a rogue I fought him in a duel. I was just fucking around duel one and got rolled. 2 and 3 I had to fight him pretty hard and use lots of disables to win. 4/8 nightslayer gutgore and aged core leather gauntlets. 
---
I've had an easier time with some mages
---
Sorry, I was adressing the OP's claims that 300/vs 300 was a thing in vanilla back in 2005.
---
It's one raid boss reset. That guild is ran by a dickhead. Be glad you're not there anymore and dealing with that stupid BS.
---
There's people with way more honor than me, it isn't really special compared to them.
---
Have a healer with you.
---
&gt;  but I don't think those servers had to handle this kind of population.
---
Private server had /more/ people than classic in many cases, especially in the pvp battles. Private servers could handle at least two or three times the amount of ppl in a pvp fight than classic, while still supporting 10k+ people in other zones.
---
Just play Sub and ambush for 1,5k, instantly grenade and hope he blinks it, otherwise backstab, that genuinely seems like the best option to me.
---
Aw yeah, it’s [It’s business time](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AqZcYPEszN8) 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AqZcYPEszN8
---
It would be better if it just showed you who was around and not let you actually target the player. It ruins a lot of fun of hiding and sneaking in pvp situations. When a hunter can just effortlessly target you and mark you or a priest can target you and mind vision you or anyone can target you and just use spell range to find you.... it really takes a lot away from wpvp.
---
He didn't say they were decent, he said they were average. A decent player in your eyes is probably a top 5% player.
---
^This, it's still a 3 v 1 scenario!
---
Yea the rogues were clearly not the best, but I'm sure 95% of the people brushing off how bad the rogues were would have died themselves in this scenario. 
---
*The minimum system requirements for a down vote is to have an invulnerability potion hotkeyed on your mage.
---
Feel the same as a horde player opening ally. It just feels so empty, unsatisfied and boring. Before I saved some recordings of my PVP encounters and even added people to my kill on sight list. Now the kill on sight list is obsolete as everyone is attacking everyone and the recordings are worth nothing. This is not PvP this is some shit from retail....
---
Reddit taking a joke literally for the sake of argument? Likely.
---
This. I like to be among like minded people. For me that means ppl who don't mind the fact they're lvl 30 like me while we do a dungeon that offers us no benefits just bcoz our buddy just started out and we wanna wait for him to continue together.
---
Like the above post said. We've grown up.
---
Seems like a really bad strategy. Doing dungeons for gear before 60 is a good idea, but they shouldn't 10 man instances since you get so little xp from that.
---
So how would you catch the blink? I thought it was essentially an instant cast?
---
As soon as honor was announced I respecced my holy priest to SPriest PvP. I'm only level 40 but PvP is my jam.
---
Preach on brother. Took me 16 hours, /played to get from 53-54 due to the amount of corpse running
---
I hope he just did it to style on him
---
seems to me the best honor farming in game right now is lame shit like camping the ships and getting free respawns both for you and victims every loading screen 
---
endless no effort pvp 
---
someone comes and camps you, just let them kill you 4 times and they stop getting honor for the day
---
Lets sit down and have a chat.
---
Ashbringer is one of the balanced ones. It's clear to see that during primetime with Hillsbrad. Horde have more numbers, alliance has more organized PvP.
---
This is what you're going to find on balanced servers. People who went alliance knew what they were getting into, so a bunch of plebs/RPers/race enthusiasts went there, but so did a concentration of WPvP oriented players who intended to be organized and then get lower BG timers. Alliance dominate off hours (harder core pvpers) while horde dominates primetime in peak concentration areas.
---
You don't want a balanced server, they will all be ~ like this. You want a horde dominated server.
---
Same realm bgs will fix that. If you have to spend over 2 hours in queue to get into a bg and blizzard offers a free character move to another server which has instant queues, I'll bet you many pvpers will jump at that opportunity.
---
Lmao what a bunch of scrubs. 
---
Like they share like 10 total honor. 
---
I really don't see the point.
---
Should have lvled faster scrub
---

---
&gt;Your server is 70/30 horde/alliance. Right now, the hordes in your server are having a blast: roaming around in giant death-balls killing everyone in their sight.
---
Yea, not finding anyone to kill is most likely "a blast"
---
Hey as long as you're working towards those goals you'll be fine in the end. It's just the wait that can be excruciating.
---
You can have another hunter do then for you.  But if you have already done WS, you should at least be able to do BS.  What problems are you having with the others?
---
I started in BC and the games used to last an hour or so pretty easily. WotLK is when I noticed the 10ish minute zerg games. The NPC's were just so weak the group didn't really need to worry about dealing with them and as a holy pally healing the tank was effortless vs raids and even some dungeons.
---
It silences in retail I believe
---
Sadly haven't touched classic in a while. But I have a 42 spriest and a 53 fmage waiting for some pvp action!
---
Spy is fucking bullshit and it shouldn't be a thing. But to each their own.
---
That came in TBC right?
---
&gt;I'm a Warlock
---
All you had to do was say that part. Warlocks are super super strong against every class it seems.
---
I can't get past female dwarf though
---
I’ve been dealing with this for a few months now as an alliance on Stalagg. The consensus response for my complaining has been everyone telling me to fuck off (predominately horde players, as they perpetuate the griefing) I had to buy a bot to level me overnight because I work 80 hour weeks and would log in only to be corpse camped from 45-60. I used the bot, didn’t loot anything (as to not impact the economy cmon guys ya know) and let him afk kill mobs. This is how I got to level 60. Did I cheat? Fuck yes I did, would I still be playing right now if I hadn’t? Fuck no. Just to reiterate, I have not looted a single thing using the bot and have only used it for XP purposes because some people literally have the time and energy in 2019 to make sure other people cannot and will not enjoy something.
---
As others have mentioned, you're a bit shit out of luck against a frost mage as a combat rogue. Your best bet is to cheap shot in front of him and gouge when he panic blinks. Or to pop imp sprint the moment they frost nova because most frost mages don't try to run too far away after that as they want the shatter crits. Better yet grab a free action potion and just go to town on them.
---
You think the value in 'yesterday' is calculated once a week? How would that make sense.
---
At any rate, there's a blue post about it and many people can see their honor.
---
unless i missed something, looks like he was shooting him because he was stuck in nova.
---
This is why I trap all chokepoints and backcap GYs - to force a respawn and epic clash.
---
Should have lvled faster scrub now just lvl in dungs or get gankd or go back to retail
---
Anticipating when the mage will use it.
---
Ok Zoomer
---
For that drop, maybe. But ever since I saw this one thread on Reddit, I haven't considered myself that unlucky.
---
This guy took over 670 arena runs to get his savage gladiator chest. I haven't got mine yet, but I'm only up around 55-60 runs. Made me think maybe I don't need chat chest that bad, haha.
---
How would disabling enemy abilities in the combat log stress the servers? Mr Armchair Engineer.
---
Strap on tight, a fall from a horse that high will break your neck.
---
Is there anything to prevent someone staying stealthed in a starting area (exactly where new characters spawn) and killing them on arrival? Or is pvp not enabled for a certain amount of time, even on PVP servers?
---
My beautiful wife took me away from pvp to have a nice meal and drinks (lots of drinks) with an old friend. I’m stupid lucky, it’s hard to remember it’s just a game.
---
Note I was a GM back in the day and leaving pvp was hard.
---
Ok, boomer! There is no one who doesn't get that "ok, XYZ." means dismissal, and people defining the generations doesn't prove anything, because all they do not get is an oddly specific framework within which that's an insult. 
---
It's like "nerd" but with extra steps. 
---
&gt;Will I have to explain why the connotation is associated with the baby boom generation next, or can you take it from here?
---
Sure, if you want to.
---
What do you get at rank 14?
---
i love the mage class in vanilla, especially the frost specc, you can always counter everything or take the first move. awesome class design
---
I'm glad I rolled on a "pussy pve server" as reddit puts it.

Hearing all these horror stories from pvp server players just sounds awful, and I feel for you op
---
can someone help me with two things?
---
1. what is a good unit frame addon? ive been using elvui but i am having trouble configuring raid frames the way i want.
---
2. how can i use that unit frame and disable that on elvui, but keep everything else elvui? 
---
thanks, yall the best
---
I understand the way they process information is the Same. But the implication of what they do are not and how that information affects the players are not. 
---
I get it it can't be banned and what not. I'm just saying it's kind of a crock of shit add on. If people disagree ok, to each their own.
---
Moonfire(rank 1), travel form, repeat for a really long time. Once you get inside BRM, you might use some bear forms, heals, innervates, cat form dashes.
---
???
---
When farming for gloves,  my guild can usually get lbrs done in about 45-50 minutes. 4.5 hours is just insane. Even when we ran as a 57/58 group while leveling it didn't take that long.
---
Didn't other private servers do what Classic does, release honor before BGs? What happened there then?
---
This, but also extended to include warriors and mages
---
Fuck the average user youre fucking scrubs that led the game to bfa, get fucked if you didn’t lvl go lvl in dungs or go back to retail fucking carebear
---
Nice, thanks!
---
I don't understand signing up to be on a pvp server and not expecting this to happen.
---
Like saying you signed up for a martial arts class with sparring, so don't complain that 20 black belts are punching you unconscious every time you wake up.
---
The game is broken and largely unplayable for those of us on substantially unbalanced servers.
---
PvPers don't make up the majority of the population. Plenty of people on PvP servers are PvP lite players. And even then, you have to remember honour is same faction/server only. PvPers who play 0 timer BG factions have to grind harder since there's less downtime between BGs.
---
The advantages of being on the dominating side outweigh BG timers for the vast majority of players. And even then, why would you move before BGs open?
---
I mean you should be shadow for leveling anyway but yeah spriest pvp almost feels like cheating.
---
Nope, not if I log out for more than a while..
---
it does. but it puts you at a severe disadvantage against anyone who does have it. more so than any other addon by far. if you're trying to be at all competitive and think it's not that important to have then you may well not be very intelligent.
---
Female dwarf is the patrician choice.

The helicopter hair..

But I put the keyboard on my left. Ideally, if you want to touch-type chat, you put a keyboard on your left AND in front of you -- you can have multiple keyboards connected to your PC though the magic of USB ports.
---
I felt this one.  I’m in a pretty casual guild myself and while it “feels great” to help them lvl from 50’s-60, I can’t help but feel it’s all a wash when they quit inevitably.  The attrition rates are getting higher, people just aren’t as in love with the game as we are.
---
Unless you are educated in statistics then you know one faction will have the probability of hav bf more of one age then the other... because that’s how probability works
---
Everyone salty since wpvp lol
---
They absolutely fucking did.
---
Ok yeah let me just delete all the gear and gold I've earned on my character and switch to alliance. My bad about being lazy
---
Should be fine if you’re not sharing an account. It’s pretty obvious when that’s happening I think. But a one off or occasional thing shouldn’t be a problem.
---
Rich Thorium and a Black Lotus
---
If he also got an arcane crystal in the thorium vein that would be about 100g on my server between the two items.
---
i was going to  downvote when i saw the text
---
after reading i was going to upvote 
---
BUT then i had to check wiki on hamster life expectancy .... a roller coaster  of emotions
---
I’m on Benediction horde, one of the largest PVP servers in the game, and i’m thriving?
---
Shamans are the strongest group healers if they stand together and are usually used for melee groups. This is because of chainheal. They are good for supporting with totems and have massive many issues
---
Priests are the strongest all around healers. In dungeons they have insane group heal with prayer of healing. Which is also useful in alliance groups where there are no shamans.
---
Druids have trouble keeping their overheal low but are quite good tank healers. They also have a ton of extra mana for themselves or another healer with innvervate.
---
~160
---
i have 1 HK and i didnt even have to leave IF to get it
---
I've already explained it. If you didn't understand it thats your problem not mine.
---
Yeah, holy made it easy because if the tank was bad or specced fury (read: all of them)  you could hold it together no problem and if they were good and specced right you just throw a renew on them every once in a while.
---
SM Cath with 2 fury warriors as an spriest was hell though, couldn't hold aggro and just spread the damage amongst the party so my healing pulled all the threat even though my fade was 100%on cool down. Absolutely awful.
---
You played vanilla but knew nobody who kept their combat log out? Suuureee.
---
And in BFA it hasn't existed at all, not even when it was "new". So there's that.
---
Can you link the faction balance report? I thought they dissbled the census addon like 2 weeks after launch
---
But when you use aoe under SS , all the landed hits are doubled. So I don't know if 2 MS are worth 4 cleave or 8 WW hits
---
jelly boi
---
Maybe not DK since that's just asking to be griefed by some low level butthole running into you while flagged for pvp. Having to check the level of every single enemy player you come across is a bit mundane.
---
I think it would be enough to make it so killing someone green level or below doesn't grant any honor. Maybe repeatedly killing them would eventually start granting DK (like after the 4th time, the way players stop giving HK after the 4th kill).
---
So go PvE
---
Shuuush
---
We were having 80vs80 pvp battle in hillsbrad at 1a.m on a pve server yesterday
---
yea still happens in retail
---
happens to my salt shaker all the time in classic, it will reset normally
---
Fucking where? I never played wow before. Besides, the scale of the issue is game breaking. If anyone expected this, no ally player would have rolled a pvp server.
---
Gonna power level me and gear me in my T1 and buy my epic mount?
---
I feel like we are in the hype phase of it and soon it will die off. Some areas are gonna get wild for a while but I feel once people get over the initial hype the giant raids and shit will calm down a lot
---
Nice find. Love reading this stuff. Upvoted!
---
When it is about now. I would tell you to kill the dragonlings in Azshara. They have a small chance to drop "small flame sac" which sell for ca. 1g on most servers.
---
On level 60 I would tell you to do DM North Tribute runs solo and sell chest loot
---
I use grid2 and IceHUD. Check them out if you like that style of addon.
---
One spawned next to me while I was killing furbolgs in winterapeong I didnt even have track herbs on I just popped up right next to me, I got it but within seconds there was 2 more people jumping on it.. literally seconds after it spawned
---
So you have something. We only have a few offspec pieces that aren't even BIS.
---
I just think that the reddit community was easily manipulated by the original poster into witch hunting him. Was taking the staff wrong and did he get what he deserved? Sure but anyone taking the speech afterwards seriously just doesn’t understand his stream persona he always plays up the egotistical world first 60 meme, but calling him a sociopath and saying he needs psychological help for taking an item in a video game? OP greatly exaggerated what happened previously in the raid and then linked the twitch clips that would make him look as worse as possible. I think it’s hilarious that you would think I’m his reddit account but this is just coming from someone that actually watched the entire stream that night not someone who just saw a reddit post on the front page the next morning.
---
BUR
---
Its all good, I was just kiting it around until horde regrouped in hillsbrad. I only cried a few minutes!
---
Lol
---
It cant be broken without neutering the combat log and any add-ons that use it like damage meters.
---
It's part of DBM. Just type /range 30 (or whatever value)
---
They do find people to kill. Morgan's Vigil, Thorium Point, Chillwind camp, Feathermoon Stronghold, hell even Wetlands (yesterday I hearthed to Feathermoon Stronghold and had 3 stealthed horde who killed the flight master and I couldn't even get out!). People will corpse rez multiple times in order to get to brd or get the ship to get to Kalimdor. Maybe it's not fun to camp people like that, but I bet you it's way less fun for the players who spend an hour and a half just to GET to brd.
---
not to mention the click to target. before this addon you would have to scan the combat log, then manually type in the name of anyone you wanted to target.
---
Every single player i've encountered so far has wanted to engage and there are tons of 60s runming around each zone checking every quest spot 
---
Before p2 being attacked was very rare, I think i died once in pvp from 1-50, People were literally competing for tags with the enemy faction and would not attack them if they didn't get the tag 
---
I've gotten 4 bars in the past 2,5 hours now at 53 for reference, Sometimes you go 1 mob between deaths
---
I mean think about it, being in a group killing 1 person is much easier than solo killing someone in most scenarios and therefore less rewarding.
---
Yeah the Southshore 100v100 novelty has worn off, too. Most people probably also don't realize that zerg pvp is actually bad honor per hour. Sure, a few people are in it for the fun, but I'm sure a big part also thinks they're making huge amounts of honor, even though you'd have to kill like 40 people in a raid group to equal a single 1v1 kill.
---
Why did you cut it in half? Why not just have it going all the way across? Also what do you mean by rank points? Do you mean Honor kills? or Honor?
---
Wand spec is no joke
---
This is the time we live in, like it or not.  
---
I'm not a fan of it either.
---
Thank you for the replies.   Excellent summarization.  So it won't affect me for this week then is what I'm understanding?  Will it affect once I actually have a rank?  Like, does it carry over from week to week when you have a DK on ur permanent record?  Sry for all the questions....and thanks again for the clarification.
---
‘somehow’
---
I sure hope English isn't your first language.
---
Horde teaming up against lowbies big surprise
---
There is a mage spell to make them seen. There are also some addons that show it. But only if the buff was applied while you were near the target.
---
It really was a massacre lol
---
"realize you didn't think your server choice through at all, admit your mistake and keep it in mind for future choices"
---
This shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone, it has but it shouldn't.
---
Have a Mage cast Detect Magic on the enemy  [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2855/detect-magic](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2855/detect-magic) 
---
WoW was inspired by roleplaying games, where such information was hidden and you needed deeper knowledge of your enemy to counter them.
---
As far as i'm aware this was changed a few years back, i've personally tried this multiple times on a really low pop RP server and i've never been able to find a rare in this way. The moment a server comes up, not even the poop rares are up
---
anyone else just not motivated to play anymore? ally is roaming in deathsquads of 10-20 dominating all over the world meanwhile 90% of the horde is in tarren mill too braindead to back off for the ally to let the alliance out and actually fight.
---
Well kill it then?
---
And they won't transfer off en masse to solve queue issues and empty servers at the same time
---
Lol’d and upvoted
---
Kiss me eu
---
Otherguy was more entertaining.
---
Are you willing to reroll a character to help address balance issues? Most people arent going to give up on 10 days played time just to help out the balance. You could call it selfishness but ultimately we dont have the time for that. I understand the theory that people will hate queues but would they hate losing their character progression more?
---
Lol except there are like 70/30 to 80/20 A/H on most servers
---
It should’ve just been a picture lmao 
---
Thanks for the +karma and interest in my post though - don’t forget to sub to my user name
---
To be fair. The Martian did look dumb.
---
Yeah, leveling is quite ass right now. I enjoyed leveling my main, but leveling an alt is just dumb atm. I will just play it early mornings for a couple of weeks until things cool down.
---
You can't even get to the dungeon.
---
that actually takes some skill however, and is more interesting and fun than everyone having to use an addon to be competitive. also spy lets you click on any name that pops up to target them making it even easier to find enemy players. as you can run around clicking their name until you target them to narrow down where they are. you're not going to achieve a similar effect reading the combat manually.
---
So how's it going? Still no difference?
---
Wouldnt that mean that on a 60/40 realm, a third of all horde players wouldnt be able to log in at any time?
---
&gt;Grind up to 7 to 9 with casual play. Then go hard for two weeks, voila.
---
I mean it takes a minimum of 5 weeks to go from rank 9 to rank 13.
---
Not it a few players stay behind, recapture towers, etc.
---
You'll probably delete this comment like most of your comment history lmao
---
Easier to read for mobile users too
---
They are insanely different, spellcasting animations are horrible in retail

If you get your gear at 8-9 rank, is there any reason to keep it maintained once you achieve it?
---
ITT: People who are gonna be super dissappointed Tuesday because estimated honor is WAY off. We dealt with this in beta it's massively off.
---
Do you know what a boomer is ?
---
cloak of shadow is a rogue skill added on TBC!!
---
Honestly - I just make this the game...  imagine the world is at war and it’s it’s dangerous everywhere.
---
Finally we can’t just go somewhere. IMO anyway. You can always make a new character.
---
For the majority of servers, the faction balance is somewhere around 60/40 in favor of horde or even more skewed. So if you're playing alliance, you are getting ganked no matter where you go. If you're playing horde, you're basically playing a slightly more dangerous PvE server. This isn't how it was back in the day, this is new to classic.
---
That's how you get a banhammer.
---
ya, as a mage I could have taken any one of those rogues without thinking, maybe two.  But... I panic and the blinds and stuns are pretty disruptive. 
---
Venruki makes it look easy, but he did a lot of clever stuff.  No matter how bad those rogues are, if he lets them get close for too long, they're still gonna fuck him up.
---
Pve doesn’t exactly let you do it on your terms, it’s mutual consent.
---
:(
---
I got a [Bow of Searing Arrows](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2825/bow-of-searing-arrows#comments).  Is this something I should sit on and sell later, or just try to sell it now?
---
What's that add-on for stats on the side?
---
High 40s low 50s is the absolute pits for dungeon crawling. The population is stratified such that Mara and ST have the lowest number of eligible players at any given point in time. In my classic experience I was able to only run Mara successfully *once* (and even then it was only a princess run) before I leveled out of it. My advice is don't bother. Just mob grind until you are eligible for endgame dungeons.
---
Have a link handy for the blue post?
---
Seemed to me like it was all jokes until this comment. You good?
---
thats why you gotta play a rogue and stunlock them to death.
---
As a suggestion, try to resort to dungeon farming. Or farm on secluded places.
---
Not the bes toption, but it's chill to just unwind after a day to kill stuff and make progress slowly but steadly. Thought i can understand if you don't like it.
---
Would any of this info exist in places like the original CDs? What about the original data mining sites? Really just curious about it.
---
Dwarf spriest ftw.
---
If the server cand handle 120 people casting and buffing at the same time then it needs to be recycled for a comodor ... Maybe it would have a little more power ...
---
Uhh, no you can still rush.
---
The AV we're getting is the one where you can pull the bunker bosses out of the generals room.  
---
All you have to do is rush to the last GY, wait out the cap, and then pull the tower bosses out of the room and then kill the general.
---
Stop talking, you have no idea what you're even talking about child
---
For some reason this key point gets lost. The information is in the combat log. No one needs spy  to get this. Eliminate spy, and all of this stays the same. I play a stealth character and I move out of log range to stealth. I do not use spy, but I color code key log messages. Healing/over healing, stealth for everyone. There is no advantage. Remember people can HEAR the stealth sound too. People need to adjust their game play to be a bit more tactical instead of riding up, jumping off their mount and instant stealthing, then screaming ZOMG spy!!!! Its so broken .... not fair!!!
---
Also, ZOMG this is the first of the 15 times people will freak out and post about spy today .....

Sure. Only make the disclaimer towards players who choose alliance though, because this doesn't apply to horde on 95% of servers. There is no "danger around the corner" when you're outnumbering the other faction 2:1 in every zone.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/news=296239/classic-wow-honor-system-and-pvp-rewards-for-phase-2](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=296239/classic-wow-honor-system-and-pvp-rewards-for-phase-2)
---
Except that's not what your first comment was about at all, You made it seem like allies have some superiority complex and would never do this
---
Faction imbalances or not there will always be enough people to outnumber a few, You wern't talking about the whole server fighting each other
---
"Lmaoo"
---
For one thing if someone actually falls for this they deserved it. Anyone who has ever talked to GM knows it pops up in a separate chat window and that they would also settle this through email not in game. Really if someone falls for this I will laugh. A lot. For the horde.
---
This is why taking things in moderation is so important. Not only does it keep you healthy, it means you can enjoy many different pleasures of life.
---
The BGs are cross realm so queues won’t be bad for horde since PvE servers will most likely balance the queues. 
---
And I wouldn’t exactly call them death squads, it’s pretty much raids of 20+ horde sitting in front of instance portals for literal hours on end. There’s no way they could maintain those numbers while going back and forth between their battle masters.
---
You will lose the rank that everybody sees if you stop grinding honor, but otherwise not really. You wont lose items you already got.
---
I'd rather have some racial that are useful in PvP and not have to be a 2 ft. tall midget for that thank you :)
---
Answer the question.  If you're an actual engineer and can't answer this question...or can't see how it's very easily possible to break this addon, then you should be fucking embarrassed
---
that was satisfying
---
Yes this is what I've suspected. Non-accurate internet memes. Makes sense.
---
So many people are about to get hacked. Idk how people fall for this stuff but it happens constantly on OSRS.
---
This classic honor shit is sooo convoluted. Really bad system that encourages just having no life.
---
Thats not really the same thing. an HK doesnt mean Honor. Like a solo HK is around 200 honor.
---
Got it. Going to get 666 DKs this week just send a message.
---
Well here's the literal definition so why don't you tell us what the meme means then
---
There are plenty of people over 40 whose ideal woman isn’t a “porn star slut” and don’t regret having their children.
---
&gt; This is what you wanted, danger around the corner, unexpected fights that you may not win (or can't win). Sometimes you gank, sometimes you get ganked, it's the way it is.
---
Phase 1 WPVP was distinctly different to phase 2. WPVP in phase 1 was pretty enjoyable and the ganking wasn't as extreme or as pervasive.
---
But pvp doesn't happen on pve servers! reddit told me so!
---
Casual is both time played and mindset.
---
That said, 2-3 hours a day game time is fairly casual compared to a great many of the turbo nerds out there, but semi-hardcore compared to “3 hours a week” crowd. Depends where he puts his benchmark.
---
yeah they said that about classic too...   
---
The only way classic dies down if WPVP situation won't get better.
---
Gen X are boomers they are the same.
---
Wait that's westfall, I see 2 of my guildies in this screen shot
---
oh man you must have missed the first month of release on reddit. people made 60 and got their epics in 3 weeks or so after release and talked about "how casual they are and this is a great casual accomplishment" lmao. id say 2-3 hours is fairly casual. you can pull that off by staying up a little late after the family heads to bed.
---
For some reason, none yet. I have over 2k honorable kills Lifetime, but it says 1k Today, and 0 yesterday. It hasn't told me how much honor i've gotten yet, only how many honorable kills...
---
More people in a fac means more death squads in that fac. More death squads means you're more likely to get gangbanged as a lowbie.
---
You literally extrapolated what you wanted to in my comment and attacked it. I feel like there's a name for that....
---
All this would do is lead all the hardcore pvpers into the world to farm hk's whilst they wait for the queue. No one is going to transfer or reroll server.
---
Queue bg, hs to kargath, camp tp for an hour until queue pops. Rinse, repeat for 12 hours+ for 12 weeks.
---
It was like this on pservers and it was a total shit show for ally side. All the ally pvpers got insta queues so never left the city leaving only low lvl and casual ally's in world facing all the hardcore, well geared horde rankers
---
Log off for like 10 minutes when that happens, people like that usually have very short attention span.
---
Jesus, you DON'T understand, and here's the proof of that: "We all want every item, some to wear, some for gold!" That's not true at all. Not everybody wants every item, some want - or need - an item more than others. I'd explain how reservations are simply the acknowledgement of that simple fact of distribution amongst varied classes, but you'd probably get offended and think I'm attacking you for trying to explain such a simple concept.
---
This is why I rolled PvE, I like the idea of world PvP but not all the time. I honestly wish there was such a thing as alternating realms, where one day is a PvP enabled day, the other is not, or do it every other day. Something to that effect. Would suit me perfectly.
---
I've had 0 fun pvp since the update (I did have quite a bit fun pvp before the update), despite playing a pretty unhealthy amount and looking for good pvp.
---
Fights are either stomping the enemy or getting stomped, I've not seen anything in-between.  How is it fun running over 3 people with your 10 man?  I'm just spamming moonfire.  Equally, how is the reverse fun?  If I go solo or as a small group looking for smaller scale, fair fights, that give more honour, I get absolutely shit on by every mass raid in the zone.  When I do find fair fights they get overrun by a friendly or enemy raid within 5 seconds 
---
How is it fun in 40v40 when the time it takes for you to die is shorter than the time it takes for the game to register an input?
---
Calling this shit system "pvp" is a joke, they need to release BGs ASAP.
---
I rolled a PvE alt for this little while.
---
O k B o o M e R
---
Yeah I rolled on a pve to play a game and loot items. Not to get corpse camped and corpse camp someone else. Did it, it was a waste of time in regards to both back in 2006.
---
That's like homeowners not considering if certain areas are sunfacing then blaming the developer that the afternoon sun torches their living room with heat. Sure you can go in on a coin toss but the sun, like human nature, is going to rise in the east and set in the west no matter how much you beat your chest about it.
---
The zerg behaviour isn't going to change for you, so the next house you buy or server you roll, you will probably be better advised. The information is also readily available by asking around or Googling 'PvP vs PvE server wow'.
---
As for faction imbalances and honour day launch? Happened before, its happening again. I don't know where this mega sense of entitlement came from, nor am I suggesting that the situation you're in is in any way fun, but it was going to happen, its unfolding exactly the way it did and the way people expect it to, and all this shouting into the sun trying to lambast Blizz and other players is really not going to change the fact that the situation was avoidable by rolling PvE.
---
I think I saw mention that even APES are being camped occasionally.

---
Imagine being a warrior specced prot and refusing to respec into fury for raid and unable to find raid at all because this.
---
Shoulda dubbed in “Flight of the Valkyries” but awesome nonetheless
---
I'm out of the loop on streamers so I didn't know what class Venruki is. But the moment I saw 3 rogues vs _____, I knew he had to be a mage
---
lol
---
If it is not rude then it’s ridiculous (to not clarify something that is straightforward). They could make a blanket statement about all remote devices and ban them or creat a position on it as they should. If you are banned from doing this because of blizzards failure to clarify i find that rude/ridiculous. Also, I find nothing wrong with the steam link  so I  get to do it and you can’t? That’s ridiculous!
---
Feel like it does higher Crit but Thrash is still pretty good and I’ve seen a lot of people still with it, I bought Sword of Zeal and about an hour later saw Krol on AH for almost the same price. Going to stick it out for now and probably will put the crusader enchant on it, eventually when all the pvp’s died down around BRM slightly might be worth doing more UBRS rend runs occasionally and see if you get lucky, they are really good swords in the pair
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were
---
Before classic came out there was an awesome private server that broke down all the classes so that you could make any class you could also Loop somebody's corpse when they died. It was both amazing and terrifying. You could go acquire epics rares you can get that sweet weapon that you've been trying to get. Then you could die in the world somewhere and you would drop a chest when you died if you died to PVP. This chest contained about 50% of what you were wearing on your character armour or weapons, and about 50% of what was in your inventory. You don't have to think too hard to figure out that farming other players is the best way to make money.
---
So take solace in the fact that at least you still have the bow to go sell later :)
---
In 40s and 50s areas I am seeing a bunch of PvP with non 60s. You're prob just at a lvl most people are cruzing.
---
I left Fairbanks for Anathema and I love my decision. 
---
It's a much smaller pop and because it was a transfer destination, we're actually slightly outnumbered by alliance.
---
&gt;Of course the odds of it happening are bigger if the enemy faction is larger
---
So of course it's horde
---
&gt;But that doesn't mean your own faction doesn't do it as you made it out to seem
---
Yeah except I didn't that's just how you interpreted it. Ally would do it too with this kind of number superiority. 
---
&gt;They're more like 60-40 with a ton being around 50-50 and some even 60-40 for the alliance
---
Yeah so remember how they broke census addons? The only proper census has those numbers - sure. Unfortunately that's from before even the first wave of transfers. Fairbanks was like 66/33 and that was fine. After open transfers things got reaaally bad.
---
The ratios are even worse now due to the snowballing fro. Not being able to farm or level anywhere and roving deathsquads causing ally to quit.
---
But transfers wont fix this issue it will just move it around. There are more horde players than alliance players across the board. It might make certain servers more balance but it's not gonna change overall.
---
Dumb, stubborn, players like you are why the servers wont be populated.
---
THICC
---
If you catch them off guard I said its risky but it's a fun combo, sorry dude for playing the game the way I find fun.
---
Wtf is this?  This is completely wrong information.  54 crit is the cap for 2h.  I have 24 unbuffed crit and get about 70% vengeance uptime.  Stop confusing the noobs
---
Thus is why you play pve, no world pvp bullshit from nolifers and play horde side you will have instant bg queues later on
---
I'm only a tauren warrior lvl 24 on herod, and my friend lead me to hillsbrad, saying it'll be a fun place to watch fights and kill some bears and stuff. Now, to my knowledge herod's massively in favour of the horde population wise, but wow there's tons of lvl 60s killing me as I'm just fishing behind the big fights xD
---
Then you must be fantastic at pvp, but unfortunately not representative of your average player - thus, I’m not sure your opinion is relevant here.
---

Yeah my buddy took the standard flight to menethil in order to travel to theramore. But menethil was hopeless, the docks was getting camped by a raid of 60s. After 15 mins he went to take the boat to auberdine instead, and flew all the way down. When he finally landed at gadget he was instantly sniped by a group of mages camping the flight point. So he rezzed in gadget, instantly killed again. There were so many horde in the city that the guards couldn't stop them. Every time he rezzed he was either fireblasted or ambushed.
---
Everything that you can afford to buy that is atleast 30% below market average. i went from 100g to 700g in auctions in the last week just from buying cheep things and putting them right back on the ah then reinvesting the profits to buy more things

Beyond using the term as a dismissal based on age, there’s also a generational political subtext. A lot of people associate boomers with what’s wrong in politics today, i.e. believing fake news on Facebook, climate change denial, relentless and wasteful deficit spending, lack of action on gun safety, etc.
---
So aside from the “shut up old man” basic principle, some might interpret it as a comment on the political failings of the last generation.

From the talk they did at last year's Blizzcon, they were able to find the data from 1.12 (and some from other versions) on some backup that was just sitting somewhere they didn't expect it to be.

it is. but people want to be efficient and fast.

i just mourn for the people wanting icebarbed spear or the wand :X
---
You can run improved sprint spec when gear starts getting better and you have more reliable crit. 
---
I've ran both specs recently and it's just not as good imo without better crit stats. 
---
Cold blood gives you reliable burst and puts a crit where you need it when you need it.
---
I love how idiots think 2h tanking is a thing, but it's not.
---
LOL
---
I have a wife, kids, the job, and the gold.....and what I hate is the Mr. Rogers neighborhood feel-gooders on Pagle...I  just want to take all your gold and murder you all in PVP! #ShouldHaveRolledPVP #PVPServerGreenGrass
---
I believe you mean Activision. Blizzard in it's true form hasn't existed in 5 years.
---
This is why I really feel we need Classsic+ more than anything else.
---
There's still a ton of content in the "Vanilla world" which has been probably scraped due to time constraints.
---
If we put the entirety of those empty places and we fill them with NPCs, quests and new lore we might have enough content to make an entire expansion, without the need of new continents/islands/etc.
---
You also need to kill people
---
This post is hardly a humblebrag in my eyes. I think it was a moment of perspective realization and a post to share a message of remembering the good things we might have in life instead of wishing we had more. I don’t have a wife and kids and I didn’t read it the way you did at all.
---
This just looks to me like you’re projecting your insecurities and getting angry. There are people of all walks playing wow. Wow players shouldn’t be labeled with  “failures at life who will never marry or have children” cause there are tons of different types of people playing the game. It’s just a game at the end of the day.
---
Maybe you should ask yourself why you actually believe that you’re a “failure at life who will never marry or have children” and figure out what you could do to better yourself and make that happen? Believing in that and not moving past it will only make that more true
---
It's not better on a balanced server
---
Everyone's scared toesve the capitals on mograin horde and alliance
---
But stm it seems like alliance owns more of the world but horde always controls Blackrock and surroundings
---
&gt; , but you HAVE to gank random people to rank
---
Ganking lower levels is pretty poor honor though.
---
Level 48s get 1/20th the honor of a level 60. Its not really worth it until 55+
---
Dwarf priest never seen one of those.
---
I got more honour from picking off hordies 1 by 1 as they zoned into Scholomance while waiting 20 minutes for my group to show up than I did for nearly 2 hours doing the SS/TM zerg fuckfest.
---
Instead of looking at life through your lenses only, try to expand your mind and you will get angry less often. Ganking on a pvp server is 90% of the type of pvp.  If you want "fair" pvp wait for the battlegrounds.  
---
It's nothing personal, you are an easy target being solo and a lower lvl.  There are groups looking for points and you fit the criteria.  
---
Good luck,
---
Fette nice, gutta
---
Thread full of QQ. It's just like good ol' Vanilla.
---
Every single item is the 1.12 version.
---
Title should be 3 trash rogues vs Venruki. No ways he's beating 3 competent rogues at once lol.
---
what is the go to retail macro? it speaks in common?
---
Professions. Specifically mining and herbalism.
---
You mean after spending hours inside the inn? so afraid to pvp? XD    
---
Good job mate.
---
He can be mage/shaman/priest. Mage is best for speedruns because you can ignore him completely, the other 2 can heal boss
---
No idea, I play Alliance and it's the Hordies spamming it at me, not sure if Alliance can do it.
---
This is a broken record at this point but this is Blizzard's fault.
---
They rushed out phase 2 when they should have waited until casuals reached 60. By casual, I mean people with 40+ hour work weeks who devote less than 10 hours a week to a game.
---
They didn't implement and still hasn't implemented FACTION BASED queues to enforce a certain level of population balance. Even on factions that don't need queues, there should be queues for the faction that out number the other faction by more than 60/40. 
---
And now, instead of having a fun phase 2, they're going to destroy it in a couple of weeks max and release bgs.
---
I always put two points in holy to reduce spell pushback while I'm leveling. It delays some of the more important talents by two levels, but it allows me to heal dungeons and is actually really useful while soloing.
---
People don’t run Mara much because they’re all farming ZF for easy XP until they can do BRD.
---
&gt; You can also just buy them. They are like 30-50 silver each.
---
I guess this is my point.  For 6-10g I can buy what I'd gain with an hours worth of fishing.  My time would be much better spent just grinding on level 50+ mobs.
---
I know this isn't layering then, but what exactly is happening here? It's happened to me a couple times too, and has gotten me killed once. Is it just some server-side shit we have to accept?
---
Only need r10 for full blue though?
---
Got it today :)
---
Yes, if they released the honor system at the corresponding time in vanilla, then at least casuals would be level 60.
---
Sounds a bit shite tbh
---
It can really help to pick up a non-gaming hobby and dedicate some time to it, that you stick to every week. I picked up electric guitar in my early 20s and practiced every  day for at least half an hour (and wouldn't game before having finished that) and it really helped me.
---
typical &lt;Sovereign&gt; players btw. Worst guild on Faerlina.
---
This is going to give me nightmares.
---
Oh cool more people splooging over a streamer beating people who are horrific at this 15 year old video game please take all my money daddy streamer!!!!
---
wow,they are equal to aq 40 gear or near isnt it?that is some sick gear
---
You chose hardmode, gotta man up and resist.
---
Yep I agree with that. I said 2 rogues  :p
---
1.12 AV can be over in [less than 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnnodvQgpI).
---
Sick, grats
---
SHH MY FARM
---
what items do u aim for
---
How do we feel about hybrids and looting in dungeons pre-60? Just had a druid healer roll on everything in deadmines
---
http://wow-translator.net
---
sadly no, I just gave up on it
---
That is what happened to my lil bro. Only wants to aoe farm huge pulls. Stuck at level 31 for like 6 weeks. Comes on, tries to do massive pulls for like 1 hr. Dies repeatedly, rages and doesn't come back for 2 weeks.
---
Correct.
---
Actually, Venruki absolutely became Venruki one day. The day he named himself.
---
It's called phishing and it's a form of social engineering which is a form of hacking.
---
It's why I am not worried about 1v1s while leveling the rest of the way to 60: most people are awful at this game in PvE, so they're gonna be even worse at PvP.
---
If i hadn't taken those few more steps up the mountain first i would have revived inside that alliance raid.. this shouldn't happen.
---
I agree. I loved the landmines and tower bosses. Without those, it's going to be pretty dull. I'll still play it because I love AV and large battles, but I don't know why they wouldn't add those two things back in along with even the NPCs
---
Oh man the caves. I would hang out in caves and just sap people. They would panic.
---
&gt; what do you think is in the data center
---
"See, the servers are in the datacenter". Then there's lots of networking as well. Both of which I covered. 
---
&gt; this level of pedantry
---
Because Blizzard can't do shit about the DCs networking problem, and if that's the case, your anger is misplaced.  I straight up provided you a real world business situation where things seemed like "the server" and really it was "the DC networking". This is a real possibility, and it seems most of the people raging about "hurr durr thr servers" dont understand shit about the topology, and where the problems actually reside.
---
Get help.
---
Not really.
---
Yeah I know Dwarf priests have fear ward but is it worth looking like....
---
***THAT***
---
Your enjoyment is antithetical to theirs, how is this not obvious?
---
What would your solution be? Allow one faction to massively overwhelm the other in Wintergrasp by sheer numbers? How do you think the smaller faction would handle that? You think they’d ever come back? You can’t have faction imbalance in a BG LOL. Absolute idiocy.
---
i find it annoying, but the people who want to need for offspec has always asked before in my experience.
---
Fair point. I reacted without thinking :)
---
Aye, I meant it in agreement, probably should have phrased it better!
---
It is much easier then driving and playing on your laptop bro.
---
Yes.
---
Dude you’re on a WoW sub....you’re a nerd too
---
You want what you don’t have the most.
---
I hate world pvp and dont enjoy any of it. Too bad my friends rolled on a pvp server and leveled to 60 way before me...
---
I will do that during the work day ofc. As I will not be in my hotel room during the day:)
---
Yup, we need a FAP, frost deflector, nades and that charge helmet to maaaaybe draw against a mage. Maybe.
---
If the mage is bad of course.
---
But usually they mount up on their epic mount after the 4th nova and just ride away, while me as a poor ass fury can't even afford one after I bought edgemasters, Lionheart and a shitload of consumes every raid day to not get kicked out of the guild because I'm not performing like that one hunter does that always gets all worldbuffs and consumes and never fucking loses them to aggro.
---
I love warrior life man
---
TLDR: PvP on a PvP server.
---
It's calculated at the end of the week
---
Yep, me all day.  I actually rerolled on another server where the balance is in my favor so I can at least level when I want to with little interruption.
---
Shudda picked a balanced server
---
Sorry mate, I'm really not.
---
This isn't a fixable problem at this point, this always happened on private servers too. It's an inherent game design flaw present in classic that could only be fixed day one with faction limits.
---
And that would have caused an incredible amount of bitching of people not getting to play with their friends. Lord knows people wouldn't do "what's good for them" like with early proactive server moves.
---
All the presented solutions cause huge problems, swapping the unhappy players from alliance to horde. That's not fixing things.
---
Black lotus are over 100g ea on stalagg and arcane Crystal's around 45g lol
---
Would you rather get camped at a low level city on a server that has a 10-1 imbalance? With no hope of reprisal? 
---
A faction balance would at least give you a chance for reinforcements.
---
I heard it got changed later down the line though. Like during Naxx or something.
---
That may or may not be true, but the fact is you will win most fights anyway, because people are extremely bad. I've been playing warrior since vanilla, and it was like this then, and it's like that now. As a warrior you can often 1v2 as well.
---
If you aren't doing that, you're failing.
---
[Didn't know that.](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/244160)
---
Here, you need this https://m.imgur.com/U7Ghu2s
---
Blizzard's not going to keep tabs on every single guild and who they attack, and they can barely keep their servers from lagging during mass world PVP, you really think they'd write some automated system that checks to see if guilds are attacking only certain people...?
---
Spoken like a overconfident idiot who has no vision.
---
I see small thorium nodes and rich thorium more often than black lotuses, and i dont have mining
---
Well, I got 250 HK on thursday night when the P2 came in. Weird that some of my friends already see their Honor but not me
---
Depends on the fight. Onyxia and Rag you want to stack MP5. Anything else is HP.
---
ehh what
---
I laughed but im still downvoting you &lt;3
---
Seems buggy tbh.
---
Finally? I'm literally getting whispers every other day asking if I want to come heal Onyxia and telling me I'd be the only druid in their raid so helm is mine. Pugging MC? I think I could've gathered full tier 5 times. (Which is quite shitty for resto anyway).
---
I am having the same issue. The issue is that it’s clear that a day has passed, he has less kills today than lifetime but there is no information in the yesterday tab. Some people have this info others do not. I have no clue why this is the case but it is certainly a problem.
---
He should have rolled mage for the blue font, common mistake...
---
I'm not sure I follow your point here. I'm aware of who the Baby Boomers are. Are you aware of who Generation X is?
---
Reported for account sharing.
---
We knew from just after blizzcon 2018 that honor and bgs were separated. 
---
We knew servers would hold many more players. 
---
We knew players fully understand vanilla and its intricacies. 
---
This was mentioned anytime pvp vs pve server choice came up except the very demographic you described downvoted it as fear mongering.
---
A basic grasp of cause and effect would've told you all this. It's a 15 year old game, it's been studied with a microscope at this point. If you chose to sub at launch and go in blind that's on you, the research has been readily available
---
Dont want you to forget anyone. That and it shows ur serious
---
&gt;“Force developers to alter game for player complaining about PvP on day 2 after phase 2 release”
---
...due to a conscious choice I made after being warned repeatedly about PvP servers
---
Yes, each ID has one of three Cho'Rush classes, Priest, Shaman and Mage, priest &amp; shaman has heal spells, mage does not, so you dont need to OOM the mage with viper sting
---
"a N a l lo ve boy" is my go to
---
I joined a pvp server because it sounded fun. It can be...but when your faction is outnumbered you get it forced on you constantly and eventually it just kills it for you. Now when I get ganked by higher levels/groups I just refuse to fight back out of spite. It’s not fun for me, so I’m not gonna make it interesting or give them practice. If they want to just delete me on sight then that’s all they’re gonna get from me lol. Makes them a bit less likely to camp to in my experience.
---
Loot council is trash.
---
Pre Classic Release: OMG guys vanilla raiding was so hard 90% of the players won't even get to see ragnaros haha.
---
Release: APES and many other guilds has cleared MC and ONY a week after release.
---
Fuck that, stop punishing me because alliance fled my server wtf.
---
Thorium and Truesilver are actually reasonably close in value on my server due to how farmed Thorium is at this point. Not quite equal but I grab every Truesilver node I see and it sells pretty fast.
---
&gt;There's still a ton of content in the "Vanilla world" which has been probably scraped due to time constraints.
---
Like the entire zone of Azshara.
---
Imagine unironically believing this.
---
Meanwhile: me vs lag
---
Cut blizzard some slack, it only cost about 5% of your mana bar to cast it and it makes you a lot of gold aoe farming
---
cross realm, and way more allies on PvE realms to make up for it
---
I'm having a BLAST on a PvE realm. I don't know why you guys are complaining...
---
You and everyone else. Which is why none of the alliance feel like putting up with your shit when we just want to level lol
---
You're bad.
---
I don’t think blizzard is putting their eggs in the wpvp-rank14 basket for releasing phases that would be suicide for 80% of their subscribers. I bet bgs are released at least by January and phase 3 my maybe March. Or sooner..
---
The slippery slope is real and literally why classic WoW exists.  We all watched it happen to WoW as the game slowly got watered down as people cried about it not being fair
---
Is the keybind bound to a mouse click? Try binding it to a keyboard button instead.
---
You’re clearly missing the point. 
---
It would not be considered a penalty, but a welcome change to many that would GLADLY wait in a queue to fix wpvp. 
---
I want to wpvp. My server is 4-1 Horde. The Alliance don’t ever come out to play.
---
And that's strange, because the boomer generation is known for all the opposite extremes on those stances just as well, like all the political movements of the 60s/70s. It's so absurd to regard it as a monolith.
---
Maybe he's just shooting it out there to remind some people, be fucking happy dammit.
---
Get gathermate add-on hit it and it will forever be known to you.
---
If by that you mean Classic-ify the expansions, I don't think there's a way to preserve the Classic feel as long as flying exists.
---
/humblebrag
---
Unless you also drive on the correct side.
---
Boomers RISE UP!
---
No it is a Boss (??) in vanilla.
---
#nochanges bro. You think you do but you dont i guess
---
As a balance druid, you will still be able to kill more mobs per minute as a cat in feral gear than as a moonkin.
---
So if you care about efficiency and time, balance is definitely worse.
---
If you like the fantasy, go for it. But you will want improved Starfire so probably want to wait until level 45 or 46.
---
No private server, it is an old screenshot from me playing back in 2005.
---
That doesn't sound anymore fun, the questing experience is boring as fuck regardless after your first time
---
ACHTUALLY
---
The way it has been playing out is a bit annoying, however. Hillsbrad is two zergs running back and forth between SS and TM picking off the other side's slow people. There's never an actual engamement. Actual fights seem to be reserved for small groups roaming around, but then you still need to encounter another small group to have a good encounter, while in reality you're either picking off solo players or getting wrecked by sudden swarm of 15-20 who happen to coalesce. 
---
I thought I'd enjoy world pvp, but now I'm just waiting for battlegrounds.
---
God that shit is so annoying. Teabagged and go to retail after getting 7 v 1. Shit most of these guys cant take ANYONE 1v1. That atm is the core of the frustration. Seems like every battle is slanted one way or the other.
---
Super immersive having 20man horde squads in T1/T2 camping every possible zone, city, flight path. Hella fun really!
---
Thing that irks me is that PvP was great fun before phase 2. Obviously you'd get wiped out or camped occasionally and got a little grumpy...but at least there was a chance to get back at them. Current gameplay as alliance is literally just corpse runs and waiting for the revive timer. No thanks.
---
Yes, it is.  Now move along, bench rider.
---
Awesome, I'm enjoying this server a lot. We may be outnumbered but it's super fun.
---
delete this
---
Winning and losing are concepts that dont exist in wpvp
---
Ahaha yeah, that's evil
---
He's 100% correct. I've quit as well at this point. Enjoy your dead servers you are ruining
---
You dont want answers you just want to be mad. Vanilla and classic are nowhere near the same thing. This was always going to be what happened. Go play a pve server they are made for you.
---
You're clearly entitled and the horde camping has broke your ability to think logically. 
---
The majority of wow players don't want more queues or smaller servers.
---
You suggesting it, is comical.
---
You just picked a bad server.
---
Transfer or deal with it.
---
AND STONE FORM!
---
So if I’m rank 0 can I get anywhere but rank 1 after week 1?
---
If you joined UFC 1 (an open weight tournament), then you don't get to complain when someone bigger than you kicks you in the face.  
---
PvP servers are the the real fights, PvE servers are for sparring
---
LOWER PRICES THAN MAFIA
---
Check out Xaryus youtube. He analyzes what he does and should do in fights and duels really well.
---
He literally said combat rogues, haha
---
Look cool dead or look ugly alive. No different then the horde being a dwarf. And you got actual useful racials!
---
Last I checked looking pretty wasn't keeping the MT alive.
---
Anybody complaining of lag in 40v40 are on some garbage internet.
---
Had absolutely zero issue last night with over 150 people in tm/ss.
---
This was definitely not the prevalent opinion before release. Stop making shit up.
---
Digging the music. So much better hearing the coordination and thematic music than all the other stuff people put on their videos. Keep it up!
---
That class stack tho
---
Maybe! Pretty cool spot to see, just wish it was easier to get to. But at the same time, you'll know that no one else is there.
---
Shouldn't that be for all players not just one class?
---
I would be very surprised to learn that it’s mostly kids playing a relaunch of a 16 year old game.
---
Honestly at 60 with a geared Warrior and opener it isn't 100% mage every single time. 
---
If you either play gnome ally for EA or horde to skip wotf you have much stronger kit than you would have otherwise. On top of that it also depends on whether or not you are allowed opener or not.
---
With opener you have a decent shot vs Mage. If he gets to cs open then yeah, warr needs to play *really well* while the mage doesn't.
---
I know exactly who this is. Genre of music. Pagle.
---
 Maybe! Pretty cool spot to see, just wish it was easier to get to. But at the same time, you'll know that no one else is there.
---
If that was the case i really wonder why on Firemaw EU, wherever i go ive been seeing grps of alliance that kills me on sight and 1-2 hordes who dont even care and grinding around.  The server is close to 50/50 ,but who is more honor horny is different story.  Im level 58 , i sure give juicy honor ,but cmon 7-8 ppl racing whos gonna attack me first every 5 mins , then "chicken " or sitting on my face lol , like i can do any sort of resistance against them.
---
Thank you kind redditor!
---
How are you supposed to grind dungeons when you can't even get there?
---
BRD? camped
---
sunken temple? camped
---
Paladins &gt; Shamans.
---
Anything a shaman can do, a paladin can do more efficiently.
---
World PvP is the most braindead  waste of time  for actual pvper that don't need 10 ppl to kill 2
---
It has nothing to do with skill only with numbers but whatever it takes to makes keyboard Turner feel good about themself I guess 
---
all the  reddit casuals are gonne be mad but fuck world PvP
---
Not if you water your grass tho :D
---
I want classic+ so bad even if it mean't paying for an "expansion"

at one point it looked like a rogue was trying to drop combat to re-stealth

And how many people on PvE servers will be trying to rank?  There will be some but not near as many tryhards as on all the vastly horde overpopulated PvP servers.  Come back and tell me about your instant ques in phase 3.
---
All those people you listed are not just players you fight, but consistent personalities. You could turn them into comic strip characters and they'd be so endearing.

LOL implying your thread has any traction or merit

Same here but I'm alliance on a horde dominated realm. I'm at least cutting my wow time down a lot and I'm trying to figure out what class to level on a more balanced/alliance friendly server. But even if I decided on another character I would only leveling it very casually.
---
Because they respawned every 12-20 minutes and now they respawn sometimes every 5 minutes. Search this reddit for devilsaur posts and you will see other ppl noticed it too. And it's not in patch notes either so pretty much bullshit
---
Very accurate. People see things like this and they might assume it means family &gt; free time, but the truth is we as people are very likely to be envious of people with things we don't have regardless of if they are or aren't better.
---
If you afk between long ques you won’t make the top brackets.  The hardcore rankers will que in UC and fly straight to BRM to farm honor in wpvp.
---
Right now you should be thinking of phase 3 items. People have been hording p2 items since launch.
---
If you don't blink the cheap shot, you die before the kidney though so its lose lose... 1.8k eviscerates are like 80% of my hp

You dreamt a whole decade for that? Man...

Elixir of poison resistance &gt; stoneform and it has no CD. role human and get an ability that you cant get with a potion AND have more spirit and thus more healing.

They're casters with the same armor buff as dire bear form. They should excel vs melee.
---
Garrote doesn’t even silence lol
---
I think this did exist. But only from people that remembered MC from 15 years ago when they were shit and the game was constant broken. I think anyone who did any pserver content knew what the difficulty would be like.
---
isn't the blue set locked untill phase 6
---
What server is this? 200g for felcloth gloves? On blameaux they sell for only 70-80g.
---
This might blow your whole world view. But maybe people knew it was coming, and still think it was a bad thing.
---
Zandalar Tribe? RP-PvP, high population, Horde is the underdog but still active and competitive
---
Useless? What about when you're silenced and the mob is immune to the magic damage from your wand? You will want to melee the mob.
---
You can PvP on a PvE server just by flagging. Hillsbrad is filled with people, with flags on, slaughtering each other.
---
If those rogues knew what they were doing, you'd be stunlocked the whole time
---
People sleep on combat/hemo but they shouldn't. It's a pretty fun build, and quite capable in dungeons too.
---
I sadly got a DHK earlier today. then 1v1'd someone and got 199 honor
---
Fair, I have sympathy for the Alliance but I didn’t choose my server nor faction and neither of them were based on PvP or balancing by my friends.
---
It sucks, I leave unfair fights alone cause I get they deal with enough
---
Can't really tell you that. Give it a few weeks of doing pvp for the fun of it, and see what brackets you get. This first zergweek shouldn't be taken as a representative of your future brackets.
---
Then refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dx7meh/table_of_how_many_weeks_it_takes_to_reach_a/) to see if that bracket lets you get the pvp set.
---
Plus that /dance /wand or whatever macro that makes you dance while wanding is just pure joy.
---
You finish the blue set at rank 10. Rank 11 is an epic mount which sounds pretty neat (but from what I've heard rank 11 is already pretty tough) and there is an epic set for rk 12+13 and epic weapon for rk14
---
Funny you're getting downvotes for this, as it's exactly what Bliz did the first time around, except in reverse.
---
PVP players were the vocal minority screaming on the forums, so Bliz patched and patched trying to balance abilities that were great in PVE to calm the PVP folks.
---
The 1.12 client has an option to make auto loot the default. First thing I did when playing on a private server was turn that on.
---
I would not call a class that can do amazing in a lot of things "awesome class desing" compared to the rest of the bunch tbh
---
warlock and mage dismount*
---
A solo warrior is the worst thing to be, you always need a healer before you can actually shine.
---
Artificially creating or extending login queues is the best way to kill a game.
---
Your example literally states that we should prevent almost two third of all horde players from playing the game, either making them quit or forcing them to transfer away from a realm where they have their guild and all their friends.
---
Seemed like there was at least a bit of skill there to me
---
actually if the combat log reads anything about them it blips so its pretty much a cheat.
---
&gt;could just transfer to a server that is heavy on the opposing faction.
---
....the lack...of self awareness.... I can't....
---
It can also happen if you are online during night when the honor calculation is happening, iirc. Its just a display issue though.
---
DejaClassicStats
---
His idea isn’t that bad though, and you’re just kind of an asshole. 
---
Blizzard should have done something about this but it doesn’t really make logical sense to have the same queue time. Doing this queue in this way would create more balance which leads to a better game. 
---
And seriously gtfo with that bs, “shoulda picked a more balanced server”. It’s an ignorant statement only made by ignorant folks.
---
If you're not happy, leave.  It's your time and money.
---
This dudes on my server. He's been posting for hours every day since launch. People are starting to get pissy with him.
---
Say what you will about spam, but he's been busting his ass from near day 1, dudes probably rich as hell.
---
I just rerolled on a PvE server. Screw it.
---
&gt;Balance is objectively a better scenario for all.
---
Balance means nothing to people who can't log in.
---
You can tell you’re a horde player. Honey, it doesn’t work like that. You can’t get to dungeons on 80% of the PvP servers due to shit like 60/40 and 70/30 splits. Last night it took me 45 minutes to get to Stratholme. 25 horde just sitting at Lights Hope and 10 in WPL. I’ve never seen less Alliance online as I did last night either. A Zerg mentality is not PvP tootsie. Being so out numbered you can’t look outside the gates of IF is not fun nor interactive, and servers shouldn’t have had their population caps increased from actually real vanilla. Blizzard has never and will never care about faction imbalance until *coughs* all the horde whined they can’t farm an alliance corpse for 24 hours, and then they implemented not being able to transfer off certain miserable servers. So I guess Blizzard is listening with an obvious and inherent bias.
---
Most likely they are PvE rogues who are out farming and saw Venruki and tried to go for it.   But combat rogues are notoriously weak against mages.
---
Walk in and die a couple of times. It's a pvp server, you chose this.
---
No? Just because one extreme is a bad solution doesn't make an other extreme a good solution. Are you okay?
---
And what if transfers aren't offered?
---
K
---
Fair point, looking at the limited view we have into server population I believe Heartseeker is one of if not the only alliance favored PVP server. I can see how the quick fix is cross realm BGs, but horde will still have longer queue times. 
---
On another note I personally really like the community aspect of single realm BGs, this really falls apart when you do cross realm BGs. There is something about learning and recognizing the names/guilds of my enemies in BGs and them being the same people that you fought out in the open world for quests mobs and resources. Now you can also try deny that jerk that ganked you before you could pick that purple lotus from capturing the flag. You also learn who is good at PVP. I remember knowing who was skilled and who not at PVP. There were definitely skilled players I avoided engaging 1v1 and waiting for backup or the other way around where 1v2 was not a problem because recognizing the names of the players lets you know if they are unskilled or ungeared. 
---
/endrant
---
Alliance: "We can hold them off!"
---
Horde: *Spoils of War starts playing.*
---
Right now people are farming HKs in the open world with large gank squads.  This is the most efficient method to get HKs currently.  After BGs are released this method is much less optimal.
---
While ganking will still be a thing, there won’t be dedicated gank squads roaming the country side.
---

The point in improved expose armor can go anywhere you wish, except imp slice n dice really, its the last point you need to get cold blood.  You can also do 4 camoflauge and 2 elusiveness or 5:1. 
---
Other than that the dagger pvp spec right now is pretty much spot on this.
---
Perfect, welcome to the club
---
As someone on a PvE server because I KNEW this would be the exact situation: I DID want it.
---
this post would make more sense if realms were 3k pop capped like vanilla, but #NoChanges failed and realms are 10k capped.
---
How do you control your pet to make him run back towards the entrance in the start or run and hide in the corner during last boss?
---
Reroll  elsewhere or influence your server community to have the desired enviorment you want
---
I changed to fury spec and cant kill more than 1 at a time, in arms spec i could take on 2. I already paid 5g to change to fury i think it will go up quite a lot to change back to arms?
---
Haha wow. I’ve been stealth running it and being super confused how sometimes he’ll get a shield off and sometimes not. TIL!
---
lol all the horde players getting mad
---
You might not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
What about the cozy airport in ironforge?
---
So your solution is to make the server even more unbalanced by suggesting the minority reroll elsewhere. Makes sense.
---
No transfers, just reroll. We don't deserve to be swamped with high levels that had no foresight to see the problems of PvP realms ahead of time.
---
I mean the way honor works it's pretty clear the designers wanted you to kill people up to 10 levels below you. If you don't like they way classic was designed you can go back to retail.
---
Get you a life that does both!
---
It just wasnt that bad for me, but maybe i got lucky. I got ganked here and there but nothing game breaking like it is now. icould level no problem until honour hit and i became every lvl 60's wet dream
---
Never... its more like 65/35 completely depending on Frostbite proccs
---
Yes you are a dismissive asshole. Plain and simple. No one feelings are hurt you childish simpleton. Grow up. 
---
It’s not about having perfect balance but having a 70/30 is a big problem and you’re an incredibly daft person if you don’t understand that. 
---
There are tons of people who picked a server early and then picked a new server because of the high volume / projected imbalance only to be stuck in bad situations. 
---
Also the OP admitted he’s the one who benefits from the imbalance making you look even dumber. 
---
Maybe get your head out of the sand once in a while and start using your brain a bit more.
---
cool, never knew that existed
---
Popular opinion is that there will be a phase 2.5 release of one or both BGs similar to how Dire Maul was released prior to Phase 2
---
So this is what it is to be “self aware?”
---
You have resorted to ad hominem at every turn of our discussion, making it pretty clear that, yes, I have a bigger brain.
---
Tbf, it's also stupid to think people wouldn't bitch.
---
No OP is part of the majority and has an issue.
---
Dreadmist feels quite balanced to me. Sometimes alliance dominate a zone, sometimes horde. In any case I don't regret rolling here.
---
I totally agree. Nothing wrong with TBC but there was so much more potential left in vanilla. Fill out places like OP found. Create Karazahn, use Hyjal, maybe add another BG, etc...
---
"BUT GANKING ISNT PVP!!!!" Wow, almost like this isn't a 15 year old game with ganking being very VERY well documented. I'll say it again: you made the decision to pick a PvP server. If you didn't know what that would entail, you should have looked it up. It is not Blizzards fault. The rules do not need changed. You chose it, on purpose, knowing what it would entail, and now you're bitching about it.
---
So... not one of those rogues has improved sprint or knows how to vanish roots? ... amazing players.
---
Yes it was going on, but not nearly to the extent it is now. Yes it was common to get killed while doing a quest or running down the road. But when you fly into a zone and the flight path is being farmed by a group of 15 people and you literally can’t even spawn without dying. That’s a bit much.
---
Help downvote it to invisibility
---
&gt; Are you so lazy you cant take 1 second to untrack a quest after you've accepted it?
---
Leaving aside the cunt-ish nature of the question.
---
1. If I have quests in multiple zones and move between them, I have to manually untrack all the question from the previous zone and track the quests in the new zone. 
---
2. Yes, [I *am* lazy, and I'm a developer](http://threevirtues.com/), so it bothers me perhaps more than it would you that I'm being asked to do manually do something that is trivial for the *machine* to do. It's such an obvious and easily implemented feature to have in an otherwise pretty comprehensive app.
---
Transfer servers. It’s free and if u go medium or low pop u won’t have to deal with as many pvp encounters. BGs should drop soon and the world pvp will die down as a result.
---
Free time won’t wipe your bum when you soil yourself at 87.
---
Not good = bad
---
The opposite of bad = good
---
What MH are you running? It seems there are not a lot of good MH maces (besides Ironfoe).
---
He actually started has ven an then worked is way up.
---
Those are just bad rogues.
---
Then reroll, and do something for your new PvE home, instead of dropping a high level to compete with existing users. You shouldn't be able to drop in and disrupt our home just because you weren't smart enough to recognize PvP realms as being cesspools before now.
---
Dude you're dumb as rocks
---
Are they really bitching about PvP or are the bitching about server issues during large scale fighting or about them thinking they had 3 more months or so to hit 60 before phase 2?
---
Spend a lot of time in STV? Please call a suicide hotline immediately, it's not too late. Please stop the self harm.
---
On a more serious note, there is at least 10x fewer people there now than when I was levelling 1st toon. Today it was a walk in the park. Nobody contested any of the Mastery bosses.
---
If you enjoy leveling and don't care about raids or have a lot of time to invest, go with classic.
---
If you want to level fast and raid without time investment, play retail.
---
Found that guy.
---
Keep dreaming bubble boy. You can't slow anybody, when your opponent throws up a shield you can't purge it or have enough damage to get through it and you're only ever good in a group setting spamming flash of light and casting blessings on others.
---
No one signed up for a 70/30 split you absolute moron. That's the enemy having OVER DOUBLE what you do. Very few people would find that fun.
---
Or even Zalashji's Den in Tanaris. God damnit, what's that about?!!
---
Oh dear god the irony 
---
This is delicious
---
So what if we leave OP out of this, since they are only a singular player after all. If we don't endorse the majority to transfer or reroll, how would the problem go away?
---
In before "faction login queues aren't level controlled, so it's a bunch of 60 horde vs. low level alliance."
---
It's two surprisingly entirely different games.
---
The irony is that I am Horde, and fully endorse waiting in a balance queue or transferring to a more balanced server.
---
I disagree. The game has been out for 3 months. I would be happy to see phase 3 come out in 3 months and BGs sooner.
---
Have fun being a horrible human being with no intelligence!
---
Pssst. Go on youtube, search for secret jump entrance. However I believe that's how you were going there in the 1st place.
---
But all of that IS PvP. We've known how people do this shit for more than a decade. Pservers have shown this is exactly what will happen 100% of the time. People warned others to not go to PVP servers if they didn't want this to happen.
---
People ignored the advice they were given, and now regret it.
---
Sorry, but suck it up.
---
lmao "anyone who is ganking people on the pvp server has no life. Unlike ME a person with almost 2 60s who is considering leveling another one!"
---
My only problem with ganking is that people are rewared for it. 60s should only get honor from other 60s, under that it should be a dishonoable kill. Them getting honor from 48s is just way too much of a range.
---
Ad hominem. 
---
Still waiting for 1 logical argument from this one.
---
You need mental help lol
---
This is a reddit thread about a video game
---
Still.. you do realise that full server nowadays have 10x the population a full server had 2004 right ? 
---
Also this thing u felt back then happened to that extend ONLY cause u happened to be on a server with so unfair ratio! For 80% of vanilla players who played on more balanced servers with so much less population than servers NOW this wasnt the truth! 
---
Yes ive experienced the MC entrance and BWL entrance  endless warr but this now happens at the same time , with more players per square inch in EVERY ZONE , i repeat at the same time u have world war at BRD u have the same everywhere on my server. U cant even hide in a "remote " zone to try to ding ur last levels without any quest just by killing mobs even thou its frustrating way to do so. 
---
Now cause u played on super unfair ratio server ur memories are close to present days and then again now we have 10x the players u had back then.
---
Go to any thread about PvP right now and there will be people screaming at the top of their lungs about getting ganked. 
---
Server shit is entirely on Blizz and needs fixed. 
---
Whether they hit 60 or not is up to them. Content doesn't need to be full halted so that others have a chance to catch up; how would that be fair to the people who have actually put the time in?
---
That's the most underexplained area. On the map, Grim Batol is in huge letters the same size as Blackrock Mountain. BRM has 2 raids and 2 huge dungeons. Only other similarly important areas, like where the Dragons of Nightmare spawn and AQ have lettering like that. I think even Capitol cities are less pronounced on the map.
---
Bruh dead thread is dead 
---
You should be thanking me for entetaining your nonsense
---
yup. It's far too early to release BWL, but most people are ready for BG's because this world pvp shit sucks
---
Spell pushback to delay your casts as much as they can.
---
Stop it, my body can only handle so much hype.
---
Same bro, its unfortunate not being able to play the game my strat is to do something else for a bit and stack that sweet sweet rested, log in and try to find a dungeon with rested and hopefully make some progress that way
---
I did fall for this shit got a sms on my Phone aswell. Woke up The day after naked and on a spanish server
---
The second your cheap shot runs out you gouge the mage- the blink goes through but they are stunned if you do it right
---
Yeah, but the thing is... im also a rogue
---
r/hiddenwow would love this
---
All very good points
---
Oh I agree. I’m not complaining. When there’s hankers in an area I just go do something else. Not a huge deal higher levels when you have farming and quests all over the world. Sucks when ur a lv 20 tho and ur limited to fewer areas. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can you please expand on that a bit?
---
thought boomers gave birth to millenials?
---
And when is first week finishing?
---
dont believe atlas loot
---
Just went through a similar thing, although not the tank/dps issue as I'm a warlock.
---
Was in a smaller casual guild, started late and I was the 2nd 60 in the guild. Was constantly pugging to get in the dungeon runs I needed which was a PITA.
---
After a bit of discussion, a couple of the others and I left the guild for one of the largest most active guilds on our server (3 raid teams).
---
I was a hardcore player for many years and want to stay pretty casual in classic. They convinced me to raid despite my better judgement and we cleared MC in 3 hours and will do Ony on Monday. I've been able to chain run any dungeons I want with full guild groups damn near anytime I want.
---
We're all having more fun now and still don't feel pressured to play given raiding only takes 4-5 hours a week.
---
IMO: Time for a new guild.
---
I read that as something else..
---
Everyone complaining here about Horde having numbers. On Ashbringer while levelling there is at least 2x more alliance usually 7 levels higher and I swear they are struggling even with the mobs. Might stop at lvl 39 and farm my PvP set soon :P
---
Heck i nearly spat out my drink
---
It's fun when a rogue opens up on me expecting me to die quickly. I don't think people realize that Moonkins have basically plate armor.
---
Does that exist? An alliance server?
---
Dungeon grind then. Go level somewhere else. Hearth and log for a bit. /1. /3. Go to a major city and /2. /g. Hell, some people in /lfg may help as well. /w.
---
Yeah that’s exactly how I remember it man lol. Lots of hoofing it around due to FP camping, or having to wait to do Nesingwary quests until the wee hours of the morning because no one was going to let you within 100 yards of the quest givers. 
---
Only thing that ever really bothered me was getting ganked while fishing. Don’t mind being sat on for a while because someone is salty, but damn you’re gonna roll up on me when I essentially have my dick out? That’s cold.
---
He said "go hard for two weeks, voila", which might get you to 11-12
---
By using Pet Stay and Pet Passive, pressing Pet Passive will return your pet to its Stay location (few exceptions to this, like f orced moved or feared, then you need to send attack command first then passive after)
---
Nah bro you were an asshole for absolutely no reason. Your attitude was entirely unwarranted. You can disagree with people without being a dick about it. 
---
You deserve to be called out for it.
---
I am on a hard college course and I don't have too much time to invest, that is true. But u do enjoy leveling and questing, following story is the best part of RPGs for me
---
Cus classic is more an rpg than the diablo clone we have on retail
---
This is so spot on. I was nostalgic about the pvp experience I remember from Vanilla to Wotlk, so I rolled on a pvp server for classic. I've definitely had a small handful of fun, fair encounters while leveling my 2 characters to 50 and 52 so far, but if I'm being honest, the vast, *vast* majority of "pvp" has just been ganks. And most of the time it's not fun. It's just hard mode leveling where certain zones are a waste of time at certain times. So either you don't play, or spam dungeons all the way up.
---
Honestly people just laugh it off. It's completely unplayable for alliance on Mograinne. Felwood, winterspring, all levling areas are off the table.
---
BRD everyone says? I died 9 times from the FP in searing gorge and I haven't even stepped a foot behind the big doors. It would have seriously taken me 15-20 corpse run to get into BRD.
---
Honestly just going to play an alt because it's not playable at all.
---
Oh shut up. Yea sorry for trying to 1v1 other 60’s on a pvp server. Should’ve known that when ally can’t 5v1 it’s unfair for me to fight them. Should wait around for the inevitable party of alliance trash cans that will kill you without hesitation. 
---
It’s never the opposing factions fault that people quit, it’s literally your job to kill them. It’s what the fucking game is about. Stop whining, if you’re disproportionately populated go to isolated zones like a normal person, you’ll find way more people to fame honor off of.
---
The system to be r14 means you have to outgrind everyone else on your server.  Everytime you go to bed or take a break you have to ask yourself if you think #2 is taking a break.
---
You expertly missed the point of this post. Well done.
---
Never typed the word Majority 
---
The pseudo intellectuals of reddit are hilarious
---
California
---
It’s not a twink item.
---
This is the one I'm referring too, thought it might be a special PvP item or something?
---
Classic wow is an old school MMO, with long grinds, simple-ish mechanics that rewards dedication and team work.
---
Retail is a modern MMO which streamlines the grindy parts and has more intense high focus challenge, with less community and social aspects.
---
Most players didn’t even hit 60 by the end of Vanilla. You forget how clueless and dogshit people were at this game.
---
Ten Storms Alliance? That's the exact message I got from a warrior with that exact name, 1 minute before your time.
---
Interesting, thanks for the reply!
---
Photos Taken Moments Before Disaster
---
well yea? they are also immensely more rare?
---
It's the third day.  Stop being dramatic.
---
People were waiting for this for a while.  They will get their fill and go back to farming BiS, gold, and materials in a few days.
---
Ganking means you can't farm, for you and the gankers.  So while they camp your lowbie corpse, they aren't grinding gold for the raid on Tuesday.
---
Not to mention that BRM is a better honor farm with a full raid group, opposed to a 5 man squad roaming Tanaris.
---
And since you are a rogue, stop bitching about spy.  It just makes you look like trash because you can't gank other players as easily.
---
5 person group. How do you invite the alt?
---
I've said this somewhere else and I'll say it again. As a warrior you'll win 8/10 fights in WPvP easily, because people are bad. Mages will mostly beat you. *Mostly*. That's how bad people are.
---
If you're dying a lot as a warrior, it's because you suck.
---
reserving orbs is fine to incentivize tanks to join a group (like how I let healers take all drops that aren’t SGC in arena spam). But let’s not pretend that warriors are uniquely the only class that can’t farm. Shamans and pallies kinda suck too. Druids can farm Mara and priests can farm lashers I guess.
---
I played horde on a pve realm at at a 35 to 65 h to a ratio for the quicker bgs qs. I was disappointed to be lumped into the leet pvp server fest
---
I've only had one rogue kill me and that was because without a trinket I literally can't get out of a stunlock.
---
Hell, I played pvp servers for 15 years and I STILL didnt know classic pvp servers would be so shitty.
---
It's nothing like vanilla pvp servers were. No life twitch wannabes have ruined this game. Theres no respect or culture left in wpvp, just endless griefing that the pserver crowd applauds.
---
Should have leveled a mage...
---
cute!
---
I was going to basically post this same thing. I guess most of played 15 years ago, and were about 16 years old then.
---
At the end of TBC there was a guy that ran continuous AV premades on my server (dragonmaw).  At any given point of the day you could join his group (he'd log off and pass lead to another person), and it was usually more than 25 people.  I recall having to use a mod to all queue together, I don't remember 100% but we would win games in less than 6 minutes most of the time.  There was a huge zerg straight up to vandar, 1 team to cap each tower, and one of those tower capping teams would back track and back cap.  It was an amazingly fun farm.  Up until that point, allies had won 90% of AV games and they weren't used to losing the games - so they'd fall apart with some actual opposition.
---
It's fine at 1080p. Have one of the aspires with a video card as work laptop. Plays great, but it's one of the ones with a m2e sad, so load times are super fast
---
You think telling someone they picked a bad server makes me a terrible human being and an asshole.
---
Jesus Christ you need help you sensitive little man.
---
1. If I pick up skinning and herbalism, and pick up everything I can, will I be able to afford all my skills and buy a mount by lvl 40?
---
2. What does the human +5 speciality in swords/maces translate to in terms of a weapon stat? I heard some one say it was essentially +3% hit, but idk if that's true.
---
You didn't spend months preparing to play the video game, therefore you must have been lazy or stupid is the general attitude around here.
---
I knew this would happen, but it just happened to happen right when I was level 48.  The next 12 levels would have been horrible, so I just quit.  I'm not about reroll on a PVP and honestly, I'm not going to reward blizzard with $$ for executing all this in such a shitty way.  I'm just done.
---
Well I mean, it's new content, I can guarantee op weren't the only one advertising.
---
actual idiot
---
Canitnerd 🤣
---
In other news, apparently there’s room in the market for a translator website that doesn’t look like garbage.
---
Welp, better get a shadow priest on it.
---
False, it goes based off Ilv so best you can put on 19 bow is +3 regardless.
---
With low enough standards you can achieve anything.
---
This sums up the skill level of your average classic player.
---
It's not about honor bro
---
Im super offended by your advice
---
Yes, OP certainly is.
---
Because my best friend wanted to play on a PVP server and I wanted to play with my best friend.
---
There was undoubtedly dozens of not hundreds more doing this anyway.
---
Prevent possibility for a restealth?
---
no it's definitely you
---
Damn man why you calling me out like that
---
Mage is literally the only class you can do this with. But it still takes skill and composure to succeed with this.
---
Thats the some op gear then for this early in the games life.
---
Humans &gt; Dorf
---
It's worth whatever you can get somebody to pay for it.  I'd advertise it in trade to see what kind of offers you can get.
---
welcome. been here since the start basically. We are outnumbered, and it shows in P2 battles, but only when they really have time to mass.
---
Its been fun so far
---
No ones being dramatic here my dude. but your constructive response does shed some light on the situation but only time will tell i guess as you say.
---
also Im not a rogue. It doesnt just fuck up rogues, it fucks up people trying to escape corpse campers. As if its not bad enough someone spawn camps you, they can auto wall hack lock you when you try and sneaky rez round a corner or off a ledge to escape.
---
Hey thanks mate!
---
I had no idea that what he was talking about was an apparently commonly known private server, thought "why the f would Blizz have a special mechanic for just one server?"...
---
Reroll, trust me. Lots of us saw a long long time ago that PvP realms were terrible, but everyone ignored us. We are having lots of fun over here, though.
---
Says the guy trying to start an argument on the internet. Your actions show you lack good judgement
---
I feel the same way.  I am 37 and can't do any quests without getting ganked.
---
Ikr whats this guys deal? im also good at the pushups its just less impressive then the buses smh
---
I remember for the first duel tournament, cdew would do a live commentary kind of thing. He also had a video that went up on his YouTube channel later where he explained the duels. One of the reasons why I love him even though I don't quite enjoy PvP as I used to.
---
I understood that reference!
---
Its about being a stone cold slayer of the opposite faction?
---
Or just... wait a week for it to die down.
---
Ratingpoints does not equal honorpoints.
---
No
---
Have an upvote lol
---
That was a sad day, along with my t5 set
---
aight yeah it's my lack of judgement, not the guy flaming someone for a DUI while in passenger seat
---
Why do PvE realms have to suffer a bunch of high level transfers ruining our economies and culture?
---
Dude your horribly dismissive attitude that basically said “shut the fuck up you’re dumb because I don’t agree with you” is what makes you an asshole. 
---
It’s not about being sensitive, you just were being an asshole and got mad because you got called out on it. 
---
Seriously you should go back and read your dismissive attitude to easily understand how you were a dick. 
---
People don’t have to agree but you did not for a single second respect his right to an opinion. Jesus just treat people with some common decency. You weren’t able to do that at all and so I have treated you  accordingly - feels kind of shitty doesn’t it?
---
Does anyone remember this place being discovered in vanilla? I was pretty addicted to exploring the map back then and been damn near everywhere including places that required wall jumping ect to access and cannot recall this place being known at all.
---
I'm jealous you can do multiple buses, I'm stuck at one bus because I'm a druid so I have stealth and can escape roots so my deaths are that little bit lower.
---
2-3 hours a day won't sniff top 10%. ATM aim for the 3rd rank to get the PvP trinket.  Then just kind of play it by ear to see where you can end up. Its all relative to each server, so do yee best the see where you can manage to hit I say
---
Could be.. but why dont he just deal more dmg to me instead of shooting at me. Doesnt make any sense tbh. Thanks for the reply :p
---
Cool story bro, but you forgot stoneform removes bleeds,  which that potion does not remove.
---
This is why there are PvE servers.
---
Mirage raceway
---
yeah its going to die down, but its still going to be even worse than it was before honour.
---
Reported a dude with the same exact name including the I last week.  Glad to see blizz is on top of getting rid of these.
---
Talked to a guy that did NA-&gt;EU and he said that he always have around 150 latency. And he complained about this internet provider a lil bit, but it worked out fine to play he said.
---
My suggestion is to look at the Asus laptops on Newegg.  Had to buy laptops the past two years for kids going to college and each time I did a ton of research and ended up with an Asus.  They have various versions that are slim, have good battery life, use good but not op graphics chips and even touchscreen if needed.  
---

---
I think the zen book is their slimmest and highest price line, so they have slightly larger and cheaper lines also.  A lot of times they have deals on the previous model too.  Worth checking out.
---
Also, had bought MSI in the past too and seemed solid also.
---
Tbh if you just enjoy leveling, questing and playing on your own pace classic is very nice. It can get very grindy and time consuming if you want to be one of the top players. But if you just want to play and chill it’s very casual
---
I think the neon power range vibe plays a sizeable part of why TBC isn't very popular for private servers compared with WotLK and Vanilla.
---
And you keep on even though you know it's futile. Again, your lack of good judgement makes your opinion worthless.
---
Streamers don't own the server dude. Its still the most popular server overall.
---
You can watch coverage on:  [https://www.twitch.tv/espvptv](https://www.twitch.tv/espvptv)
---
It's not a fallacy, it comes true more often than not.
---
You don't seem to understand either. Jeez.
---
lol, when its 70/30 you cant kill the opposing faction, srsly, go on a extremely horde favored server as an ally, as soon as u hit lvl 18 the camping will start, and dont give me the bs ''im just trying to 1v1'' if you are on a horde favored pvp server as a horde player, you will never ever 1v1 unless you set up a fucking duel. and are you suprised that ally 5v1 when they spent every lvl since lvl fucking 20 getting hard camped in questing zones by pvp deprived horde players that pushed off the few alliance that rolled on the server at launch? gtfo you idiot you are the reason ally quit ur server noob
---
Yeah i think so too. But its akward that he as excatly the amount of honorpoints...listed for the rank he has in the pic
---
just as you keep going on, can't even admit you were wrong smh
---
Idk for me it’s more about the fact that wPVP in this state isn’t fun. A less laggy honor trade doesn’t sound more fun.
---
Thanks. I might give it a try so
---
Funny you say that, I just started leveling a warlock alt level 14 currently.
---
20v20? Nice
---
I’m perfectly fine with DM releases. However I feel Phase 2 should have been mid Dec to Jan with warsong gulch. This way people with normal lives would have plenty of time to get to 60 nab some gear and prep for PvP. 
---
At the moment nobody can level from 48 to 60 outside of dungeons. They also stand no chance against the 60s swarming them. Its going to cause new players to leave and isn’t healthy for the game.
---
Satyrs bow is exactly the same. It’s just easier to farm. If you already have blackcrow, don’t worry about replacing it.
---
It is pvp though.
---
What add-on puts the class color on the enemy name plates?
---
In racials yeah
---
People who aren't wrong don't admit they're wrong.
---
You really need to calm down and seek mental help.
---
The fact you feel the need to chime in on another person's thread and project all of this is really disturbing.
---
You are really underestimating the players in this game.
---
These are people who will run UBRS fifty times for Truestrike Shoulders, a 24 AP upgrade over a comparable +2% hit quest green.
---
Give them their own, new PvE realm they can transfer to, not an existing one. No need to ruin a realm's economy and culture just because some people made the mistake of rolling PvP early on.
---
Did *you* watch the same clip? After the rogue you're talking about dies, one on the right is not nova'd yet insists on shooting instead of moving closer.
---
I find as a combat rogue it is best to open with a CS, mages often blink out of it. I than catch them with a kidney after their blink. Force the Ice Block, gouge out of ice Block than go to town. I still lose to good ones, but most bad ones I own.
---
Lol do you wake up in the morning just to complain?
---
Underrated comment
---
Nah. Paladin can’t burst every class  100-0 in a second. But I agree id rather have a paladin over a shaman as pocket. Bubble and free heals while I recklessness and fap 5 people is fun
---
You forgot about gen x and millenials but ok
---
Hmmm I did quickly explore it, it seemed like there was nothing in there. Unless the cave continues to go down further.. Dammit do I have to go back to make sure there isnt a dragon?
---
What's all the addons you use? Love the look of it
---
Gen x was before millenials
---
Pretty sure you only need the party leader to queue you up while the rest can roam, though they'll have to re-deploy after BG ends, it's not far to Winterspring, Dire Maul etc.
---
I actually get a kick out of hearing both sides. I wrote my comment in jest hoping to get some fun replies. Sometimes it's worth the downvotes if it makes for a fun conversation which is what Reddit is missing these days. Personally, I think Horde and Alliance should be friends.
---
Anyway, I enjoyed your comment and laughed out loud at  (like the trolls movie!) haha
---
Just mage stuff. They were really bad and it wasn't that impressive.
---
I got 20 oily black mouth per hour off the skittering coast near the sepulcher. Its not impossible.
---
And/or he could he one of those auctionhouse players that finds fun in manipulating the economy, and bought everything up beforehand.
---
You have to predict it. Your cheap shot "runs out" the instant the mage casts blink. It ends stuns.
---
I'm having trouble with my macros. I'm trying to set up a macro that has me dismount before trying to cast.
---
 &gt;!#showtooltip Renew
---
/dismount
---
/Cast [@mouseover,help,nodead] Renew!&lt;
---
The problem I'm having is that I have to press the button twice: once to dismount and once to cast renew. Am I setting this up wrong?
---
I did a quick search of this subreddit to see if anyone posted it. I didn't see anything. Now, if anyone has discovered it in vanilla? Maybe?? I haven't done research into it, I'm sure I'm not the first to discover but maybe one of the few to document it.
---
Are you being fully serious right now? You think a substantial percentage of the game’s population were either toddlers or not yet born when vanilla was released?
---
Leveling is the biggest reason to play the game, though...
---
You seem to think this is the same as it was ?
---
1: 10x population
---
2: Streamers and followers already influence it to another level
---
3: No one in Vanilla was that geared in just 2 months of release so i wasnt one shoted that easily while im level 59 from a 60 lv player who atill have greens and 1 epic at the most
---
4: Yea i was and many were pvp lovers back then but usually it was to an extend at which we all knew where the ganking is, BRD doors a d everyone knew he had to die while trying to get in , but not raids RAIDS OF 10x server population AT THE SAME TIME IN EACH 50+ ZONE  crippling the levelers so often that the average death is 10-15 times per quest! 
---
5 : PVP gear was not that strong when first released either! 
---
So tell me boy, why would they have to 100% release the content in phases the exact way it was ?? When the whole game starts from the end patch of vanilla ?? With that many more player base and influencers and arrogance than it ever was 2004 ?
---
Good to know I guess, replace +7 with +3 and everything else is still the same.
---
They called that expansion "Cataclysm"
---
I don't, you're right. I think it's a complete over reaction. BUT that is just my opinion 😊.
---
I am not going to disagree. The troll women are the hottest females in the game from the ankles up.
---
&gt;I mean, ya the hype will die a bit, but you HAVE to gank random people to rank. The system wasn't designed to have this many people actively ranking in the open world. It just wasn't.
---
You're right about that. We have much more people playing in each server now than in Vanilla.
---
Falafel brigands
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Exactly. I've gotta admit, that if we get some kind of "Classic expansion", call that Classic+ or what have you, I'd be perfectly fine going onwards with TBC as long as the Classic vibe (ie: with all its restraints, no flying mounts, no dailies, level cap still at 60, etc.) remain.
---
We were getting fire buffs for rag. I got the "teleport to graveyard" death. Every single step of the entire zone was camped by alliance from the graveyard all the way to kargath, the entrance, down to MC entrance.
---
It was a ride, a couple of very organized alliance raids were doing it.
---
It's fine. But you will miss a few spell interrupts in pvp. I played a mage from EU to na and getting counterspell off when people fake casted was more difficult than it is now that I play on EU servers. Besides that it's perfectly fine. And I have crap internet
---
This thread has a fuckton of "everyone is bad at the game except me". Which is weird.
---
You can get exalted the first weekend if queues are quick. I've done it on every pserver I've played so far.
---
I've gotten to that one back in vanilla, I remember I had to jump up a mountain a particular way to get up there. Haven't tried in classic Im sure the same strat works
---
Well you shoulda bought epic mount first to be fair.  
---
It is funny the average warrior complains like this, then warriors in Apes like Mn, Tribe, etc have memes about how frost mages are EZ class, and they win most the time vs them
---
Looks like it's working, damn
---
Yes it's not a bug. It's how the system was designed. It wont show you the reduced honor gain and still show that you receive full honor while you get 0 after the 4th kill. It's working the way it should.
---
Learn something new every day.
---
But these weren't prep rogues.
---
Go back to HKIA
---
Cozy? Level 30 dwarves are ganking level 10 trolls in that place. It's shameful massacre of low levels for sport.
---
Guy doesn't want to do something.
---
Does it anyway.
---
Complains.
---
How does it feel being the sole cause of your own misery?
---
not in pve combat builds, there are literally no points for those
---
See how much I learn when I make silly comments? I appreciated this rebuttable. Even if it costed me my imaginary internet points. :)
---
These guys are from my guild, I am ashamed.
---
Just gets tiring hearing people like you be jerks to others because you think your opinion holds more weight. Toxic folks such as yourself need to be called out at every chance do you can understand what you are doing is not ok and it should not be supported in any way, shape, or form. 
---
If you don’t want to get called out for being an asshole, maybe you shouldn’t post such drivel on reddit. 
---
Be disturbed all you want, I’m not angry - I just wish toxic people like you didn’t exist. 
---
And I chimed in because it’s a message board and I agreed with him. It’s the entire point of reddit.
---
We transferred servers and some people had to change names. Do I need to update that in the WTF file then broadcast or is there another way?
---
Awesome thanks for the info!
---
This was Hillsbrad?? How many hours did it take for you to accrue the pictured honor? Were you part of a large raid, fighting solo on the margins, or something else? I'm trying to get an idea of honor/hour in the TM/SS zerg.
---
For example, I spent 4.5 hours on Thursday with a 4-8 man gank squad in Kalimdor, got 205 kills, and earned 7900 honor. On Friday I spent 9 hours solo in Kalimdor, got 211 kills, and earned 12000 honor.
---
I wonder whether I should just jump in the zerg.
---
They're not combat rogues lol. They all have prep (I fought them yesterday). They're just bad.
---
The dragon, named Andrestrasz, was added in Mists.  [http://hiddenazeroth.com/2018/01/17/andrestrasz-sleeping-drake/](http://hiddenazeroth.com/2018/01/17/andrestrasz-sleeping-drake/)
---
Just a random thought that passed through my mind right now: what if you could cast spells just as if you weren't mounted and your spells won't dismount other people with flying mounts?
---
Huge aerial battles. Don't know if that could work, just randomly thought about this as I read your comment.
---
Just send your wife forehead
---
Who uses consumables in pvp... Embarassing
---
There is a ton of such stuff and I find it col that there are still people who didn't see those
---
Man must be crazy to always be a victim. Poor zarzalu getting camped since lvl 18 I’m sure you’re not just over exaggerating and being over dramatic about a 15 year old video game. 
---
Stop being a crybaby it’s vanilla wow. Both factions are filled with shitty players who have to group as 5 to get anything done. Both factions get camped at low levels. It’s the fucking game.
---
Wait, how do you set roles in Discord?
---
Everybody knows that Blizzard is a Paladin anyways....

---
He sells 100+ stacks a day and has been for over a month now while staying level 10. You really think his somehow is buying to resell when he undercuts others by 1g lol also his name is random letters, dfghfv
---
What?
---
I'm honestly curious what I did that caused that?
---
Also I'm curious why playing the game means I should be punished?
---
People already have to wait on my server (Herod), it would just change who.
---
Auction house/bank alts are really a thing, so the lvl doesn't make any difference. About the amount, it's possible but hard to know.
---
Thanks done that no replies yet, have you seen it on ah or trade chat?
---
Come with me and you'll be in post of pure speculation. Take a look and you'll see someone ignorant of the whole economy.
---
Hard to tell there, but looks like they are all crap PVE spec. I also see them using improper openers in a few situations.
---
Yeah - go shame them.
---
I think everyone knows 98% of the suggestions made here will never happen - but who cares? Why can’t you let someone have an opinion? Why is yours more important? 
---
Faction imbalance is a real issue and the OP thinks this might be a solution of sorts, doesn’t matter if it likely won’t ever happen. And no one is saying you can’t disagree but basically calling someone an idiot for suggesting it is what makes you an asshole. I don’t understand how you still don’t get it. 
---
Had you been respectful for even half a second we wouldn’t be here.
---
I keep it to make myself major healing pots, but i think thats the only recipe it's in
---
I won it on my server, water sells for 25g a piece on my server, easy 24g profit a day. 700-750g a month guaranteed. It should sell for easy 500-1k gold. I’d learn it if you plan to play long term. I picked up alchemy just so I could learn this tbh.
---
lmao what a terribly romanticized version of what PVP is.
---
They most likely know
---
He's literally a millionaire. Do you have any idea how much you make with 30-50k viewer daily? It's insane.
---
What about the people who can only devote 2 hours a week to the game? Blizz should have delayed phase 2 until at least January 2022
---
Any realm that has faction based server transfers open should 100% have faction based realm queues also. Should even make the balance favor the less populated faction until enough people transfer off.
---
If you're going to try and fix a problem, then actually try and fix the problem.
---
Twelve seconds later he was wiped by a 20 man raid.

---
This was added in version 0.6.0, the very first public Beta of WoW - it's also when they defined the zone borders with the sea. The last internal alpha, 0.5.5, didn't have borders for the zones - in this case, AQ. 
---
https://wow.tools/maps/Kalimdor/6/9/-104.269/55.346
---
They should add a feature similar to hunters where priests could mind control dwarves to learn fear ward and then abandon them and the dwarf will disappear forever.
---
Jesus Christ it's been 2 days. Looks like you made a mistake choosing a PvP server... the 'Golden Age' is over, what melodramatic nonsense, rofl.
---
Omg it's the famous Joel from ZT! Did you finally manage to get on Skype?
---
It's not the honor kills that bother people, it's the hordes of 60s wiping out guys in their 30s that they don't even get honor for just to be douchebags.
---
It sells for 1k+ dont sell it for less.
---
You can heal most if not all dungeons as an spriest though so...kind of a waste to respec until you actually HAVE to.
---
Anyway, here's Wonderwall.
---
Doesn't seem to be a problem for realms with faction specific transfers, shouldn't be a problem here right?
---
I mean it kinda sucks but I do get a kick out of meeting my guild before a raid in IF and then all flying to thorium at once in a line and just running 40 deep w/ an Ony buff into MC wiping all the shitters that are camping BRM. It sucks when your the ganker but I can't say I haven't mobbed people 40 deep before en route to a raid...
---
IMO "Game of the Year" doesn't necessarily have to mean "**Best** Game of the Year."  It can be the most important game, or the most successful, or the one that had the biggest cultural impact.
---
Yup
---
well it would be pretty pointless to spend 3-6 months doing something for shit gear

Thanks guys for all the answers! Have a great game ;)!

Sorry I forgot the /s.
---
I’m ally, and it’s a common idea on here that the only reason ally is leaving is because horde is driving them off the server with merciless ganking.
---
Yes
---
Yes, I think the average age of a classic player is 18-20 years.
---
been stuck staring at "Logging in to game server" for about 15 minutes, was in the middle of flying to heal UBRS
---
Netherwind server
---
Do you remember how the mod worked?  I just remember that I had it, don't remember any functionality.
---
It’s a useless addon. What are they going to do if they spot me? I’m not going to attack them if they are PvP flagged.
---
Who fights someone over a purple lotus? Hopefully you meant a black lotus.
---
Except you don't get to stop fighting.  Every time you get back up and try to do your own thing, someone kicks you in the face again.
---
Casual will have easier access to the pvp gear once BGs are out.  Then they can all afk AV while doing their chores around the house.
---
you couldnt be further from the truth. druids become the best MT healers on horde side. druids make fantastic healers in ab and wsg if you dont want to fc.
---
I back up everything. Anything that belongs to a project of any sort. All I do is zip the files I have used with a notepad description lol.
---
And your suggestion is?
---
You realize they shouldn’t allow transfers off servers for the smaller faction, only the larger one? Otherwise servers would be even more fucked.
---
Stupid people who actually think that’s real absolutely deserve.
---
https://memeshappen.com/media/created/well-yeah-what-did-you-expect -meme-49284.jpg
---
You rolled on a PvP realm. It isn't about spending months preparing, it's about looking at history (private servers, Vanilla), and seeing what happened: faction imbalance (PvP realm tend to skew horde pretty badly, PvE realms tend to skew alliance pretty badly), ganking galore, griefing (killing flight path NPCs and quest givers, etc), bug abuse, ganging up to control the market on many rare items, and much much worse.
---
The fact that you didn't look to history isn't Blizzard's fault, the community asked for things to be exactly this way. This isn't Blizzard's problem, it's inherent in the game and in gaming culture/human nature. You should have listened to us, and rolled on a PvE realm from the beginning.
---
Can someone make a cross faction macro for all the sweaty no lifers that they need 13 consecutive weeks in the top 0.03% to get 13000 points every week to be hwl... Would really cut down my travel times to dungeons
---
No. U can technically get 1 in each mine from now and until u die. Rng is rng My G
---
I'm not the guy promoting defense gearing. Maybe try looking up how to gear a tank.
---
You wanted to look like a fat lesbian? Accomplished.
---
It’s clear you don’t get what you say. You were acting dismissive from the first sentence you made. It was very evident. 
---
Yes, he called you a moron first. But acting as if your innocent is quite hysterical. 
---
Bro you really need to learn how to interact with people better.
---
It's only a temp phase of wow enjoy the love hate relation with open world pvp while it's this crazy
---
But their hair floats when you cast holy spells!!
---
Classic warriors aren't going to be as kiteable as vanilla/pserver warriors because of the way leeway is working. You just don't see it yet because we don't have our trinkets available.
---
Though it is a rare item its level 25 and there are better weapons in that level bracket. However when you equip it you are wielding a fish so that is the biggest draw to this item. That being said you're gonna have to find somebody lower level with expendable gold who just wants to wield a fish. With honor out now I bet there would be some draw for this but I think if you want any real gold out of it you're gonna have to hold it until battlegrounds come out. All in all I doubt you're getting hundreds for thousands of gold for this Item
---
Could be a person still. Either a gold seller or a farmer. Believe it or not there are services where you can pay someone to farm for you - this is separate and different from the gold selling services. And it's pretty cheap because it's usually someone from a disadvantaged country.
---
You're not even listening.
---
not really, idk why youd call it rank points instead of honor if its simply honor. Like why go through extra steps?
---
What weapon is that?
---
Exactly that’s what I was getting at a few more months of MC is expected but BGs I expect will come sooner
---
One FAP evens it up more
---
Small fleet pvp in Eve online is the only thing I've ever enjoyed for pvp
---
Too many players* starting a LFM group for UBRS by himself then claiming "Dal'Rends/Shadowcraft Reserved." The culture of entitlement these days is crazy.
---
You need to run a Steam game, which WoW isn't
---
Nah I'm good, thanks for being triggered with OP and projecting your frustrations to someone who doesn't give a fuck. You can keep going, clearly this is something you feel passionate about. Fight those rude reddit comments big boi.
---
What is 1.12 gear ?
---
Sure as hell felt like it. Air is such an odd one after that ordeal. It's like the NPC went "Thabls for dropping by. Sorry about Steve. He's a real dick and griefs all the newbies. Here, take this totem and 40% run speed plus 30% attack speed for an hour as an apology."
---
Saw a 60 mage bot yesterday on herod leveling 4 other mages all had names like that. Blizzard is terrible at spotting and stopping bots.
---
We've been screaming from the mountain tops since name reservations that 95% of PvP on PvP realms is ganking and griefing, but no one believed us. Now that you're understanding that PvP realms are just gankfests, you're suddenly wanting to bring over your high level onto an existing PvE realm, which will ruin the economies and cultures of those realms.

Fun thread. Got here from Pilav's new video.
---
"finally"? Geh the competition must be hard with all those druids. We sold 2 so far to guest raiders and one was sharded.
---
If you like playing solo with big numbers that don't mean anything go retail 
---
If you want a feeling of accomplishment at every hilltop and a sense of community go classic
---
I play horde on grobb and at 60 alliance are relentless. There was a raid of 20 people camping the entrance to blackrock spire for who knows how long. Our warrior died 13 times trying to get from thorium point to BRD. I died 6 times trying to get in from burning steppes.
---
Welcome to the normal servers, where the biggest problem that *could even exist* is someone ninjaing loot that you'll see time and time again.
---
If you act like an asshole, then you are an asshole. Just because you're streaming while doing it doesn't change the end result. 
---
I don't understand the mental gymnastics people do to justify their adoration for some fucking loser.
---
raiding MC isnt hard either, still has good loot
---
I read that in the tone of Willy Wonka/Gene Wilder. Thank you.
---
Briefly make it a raid.
---
Yeah that's right, based on how many people got the correct queue, the raid leader would tell you to join or requeue.
---
u must be rich cause there is literally no downside to being rich over not being rich
---
Thanks for the good laugh. 
---
You got triggered and started whining after I called you an asshole for being an asshole. You can pretend it’s a simple as “name calling” but it’s simply attributing an appropriate label with the infantile attitude. 
---
Pretending anyone is an idiot simply because they don’t agree with you makes you the asshole every single time. Maybe you’ll grow up one day but I highly doubt. Good attempt little boy.
---
Best thing you can do is protect your team. Too many rogues go balls deep trying to be a hero and get shit on. Easier to sit back and let your casters/healers live by peeling for them
---
Yeah, dude. you sound extremely negative. Like it's almost embarrassing how judgemental you're being. Just because someone likes to gank, doesn't mean they have "nothing in their pathetic life." I get that you're annoyed, but its weird how much negativity you put onto others, while ironically saying that they are the pathetic ones.
---
I’m getting some pretty decent advice. I think I will sell it in one shot
---
A lot of lambasting in this thread. For what it’s worth I think your toon looks great OP. Congrats!!
---
with design I mean that the whole "FROST" theme fits so perfectly to the way you play a frost mage. slows from everyone, freezes, ice block, ice barrier etc. its just the perfect theme specc.
---
i have to agree that blizz couldve designed other speccs the same...
---
I was killing Simone for my hunter quest and got ganked by a Devilsaur. No Alliance to be seen. Just a lone Devilsaur.
---
Warrior, you have to eat fairly often
---
But you only really need 1-2 buttons to level
---
These days you can claim anything is "hacking", since normies use it as an umbrella term for "doing illicit things that involve a computer".
---
Jesus christ i thought I had it bad as 6'1
---
This world was not built for us
---
Nice
---
Ssshhhhhh
---
Indeed, and most people are terrible at PvP in Wow, including mages. You'll be surprised how many of them you can actually beat. 
---
I don't know how people are still so bad, but they are.
---
They used their CDs killing him once before the clip. Context makes this video a lot more understandable.
---
I sold a few for ~120-150 in the first week. Mats cost 60, and farming runes can sometimes take forever. If the price was below 100 it wouldn't be worth the time at all.
---
I mean. It's not really free honor homie. Of they're just on their way yeah sure. But if they're just camping there the opportunity cost of doing literally anything else is greater. 
---
So in reality they are losing out on honor.
---
But if they're just doing it for the lulz then yeah nothing is lost and it's just miniscule honor is a bonus.
---
Whatever feeds your sick ego kid
---
Is this what the alliance on my server is doing while the horde are actually playing the game?
---
You’d think each side would’ve gotten a graveyard at their respective AV entrances
---
A warrior with a healbot or 2 in a roaming/flank group is really strong though. Not every kill has to happen in blob vs blob
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
Transcendence germany pvp server. Atleast on ally there is a boomkin that raids. Also while leveling I saw atleast 3.
---
I think this guy might be the fish on tinder. Considering his user name!
---
You're not fooling us anymore, fish.
---
That's a creative way to say that I thought there was a reasonable chance the company behind this might not want to chase away half of their playerbase within a couple months.
---
Well, that ended abruptly.
---
a bit like idiots

KuiNameplates is one:

Should I use or sell the freezing band I just got? I am a 60 mage. Just dropped herbalism for engineering so I don't have a gathering profession anymore. I'm just kinda conflicted. Any input is appreciated.
---
Warrior/rogues do fine in small scale. But you're right, they have very little utility in large fights.
---
Honestly, I don't care what happens to PvP servers, just don't send them all to my realm. Fix the shit over there, but don't "fix" it by pushing them to PvE realms, because that's not fixing the real problems, it's just making their problem someone else's problem.
---
To be quite honest it's about ruining the day of people like yourself. They do it because they know it's ruining your enjoyment of playing and they take joy in that.
---
Cheapshotting a mage isn't a bad idea. at all. I dunno what you're talking about.
---
It was just a figure of speech. I was more referring to how people say "when I was leveling, I got ganked repeatedly by higher levels, 2 or 3 or 4v1, once I hit 60 I'm looking forward to doing the same myself". 
---
I don't see that behaviour as honorable and so I don't want to perpetuate it.
---
on my server the first large raid group in hillsbrad the day honor was released racked up 5 DKS due to idiots in the raid
---
needless to say I have okay 3k honor off of my 1.1k kills
---
You can get the basics and some gear, I sucked back in the day and that's what I could get.  Don't suck and you can get more
---
Wish there was a way to know you're in the good old times before you leave them.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxa453/important_psa/). 
---
Yes. Alliance is here waiting for you.
---
Your average white collar job is 40-50 hours a week. 160 hours spent on a hobby over the span of three months is hardly out of reach for an adult with a full time job. Not to mention the stay-at-home parents I’ve met in the community. Never heard a kid’s voice in Discord for Classic WoW that wasn’t in the background of a gamer parent  
---
I guess, unless someone can point us toward authoritative census data, we’ll just have to disagree on this one.
---
PvP is NEVER a fair fight. No one goes into a fight thinking there's a 50/50 chance they could lose... They go into it trying to maximize their advantage. Just reroll on a PvE realm and start enjoying the game properly.
---
After 4 kills it isn't.
---
Yeah, it is in no way normal to have 10g worth of drops by level 14.
---
Ye, spell power and healing barely existed pre raid content before 1.12. Many dungeon drops were greens that sucked.
---
Also strat and scholo were 10 man dungeons.
---
god frost mages are too op
---
if you’re lazy and want efficiency DO NOT level a warrior lol. go mage
---
Normal PvP servers in Vanilla were generally more balanced, and had far less population crammed into the same space.
---
Looks like you should've gone with a PvE server from the start like the other snowflakes.
---
No, because Vanilla realms weren't this populated. Vanilla realms had this problem, but not this scale. There's a difference, but what can be done to solve it that doesn't involve ruining a PvE server by allowing transfers?
---
It Will die anyway when the minority faction just quit.
---
Not the worst idea. If the have imp blizz then it could slow down the horde enough for their friends to escape
---
But why even bother asking that if you don't know who he is? You could google it and not come off like a smug neckbeard
---
i believe JUST heartseeker. and the horde there cry as if every other server isnt in their favor lol.
---
Head on over to the Blasted Lands, you guys got that place on lockdown.
---
Paladin, lol
---
Atleast you guys are the best at 2 roles in pve and unstoppable with a pocket healer in pvp.
---
Don't forget that they're also trying to bait lvl 60s by hoping these players get frustrated and ask general chat for help. 
---
So yeah, while they're waiting to find 60s it is free honor honor homie. Not everyone (especially smaller groups) wants to jump into the clusterfuck that is BlackRock mountain for their honor.
---
I think they’re going to add WSG early
---
FREE WIFE AND KIDS OPEN TRADE IF BRIDGE
---
If you are already actively raid clearing and you are in good equipment, while not having an epic mount, I'd sell it. If you are new to level 60, I'd use it. If you already have an epic mount, I'd use it as well.
---
Mileage on the wife varies per month, sometimes she revs up great..other times she's a bloody mess.
---
Kid is 12, super-defiant but good hearted.  Mornings normally consist of telling her to get ready for school followed by 93638526 excuses as to why she's running late for the bus.
---
Sold as is.  No refunds.  ;)
---
Literally half of the posts in the sub since P2 dropped are people complaining about PvP happening on PvP servers.  I would feel bad for you if there weren't multiple warnings about how it will be since before the game even released, but literally every "how to" resource I've seen for classic has warned of the PvP horrors to come in phase 2.
---
So you're fine with high level PvPers transferring to PvE realms and ruining their economies and cultures?
---
Xaryu has done the same for his mage duels
---
My name's bishop Bulwinkle from the First Church of Nothing But the True..
---
"Hero class takes down 3 idiots."
---
Option 1 is not viable. The combat log must work the same everywhere or it’s just a shitty feature. 
---
Option 2 is viable, but you won’t see it happen. There is no bug driving the combat log distance. It won’t be fixed. It won’t be changed. This is how it worked in vanilla, and there were addons for this back then too. 
---
The moral high ground will always be a popular opinion on /r/classicwow, even in cases where it’s silly, such as this one. Our recourse is to laugh, downvote, and move on.
---
you have really no clue, dont you. the extra spirit is a joke compared to fear ward.
---
Any suggestions for someone that is serious about running a more casual guild that raids, as it stands it would be loot council of 3 that give gear to anyone who contributes to the guild, there is no relationships umong leaders and the loot council cares more about raid progression and having fun than just getting their own upgrades? 
---
Red flags? Sounds like it could work, any thought?
---
This sub is filled to the brim with casuals who barely play, and post wanting virtual pat on the backs
---
What is the nerfed av? The one with timelimit?!?!?
---
Multi boxing. One player controlling multiple accounts
---
Multiboxer.
---
Nothing like a good Schattenblitz crit I say.
---
Yooooo I fucking love Acres, that band needs to get much bigger
---
Yeah, because the kids dont speak. I raided from Karazhan to Catacylsm and I was 13 on TBC release and 15 in Wotlk. But I was 18+ on every guild application on the forums.
---
Exactly.
---
Oh man I have roughly the same HKs as you but a third of the honor, shows how good I am at getting hits in during hillsbrad fights!
---
Multi boxing.  They have the others on follow in party so the can level several toons themselves.
---
The trick is to spend 1 minute talking about how you don't think you'll last for 2 minutes.
---
Is there anywhere I can find the relationship between percentile each week and the rating points you get for that week? Like if I am 50th percentile, how many RP will I get? Seems like an important number to know...
---
Nobody is braindead enough to not figure out vanilla rag in 80 days.
---
Expect WSG in 3-6 weeks.  It will give pvp and won’t add a bunch of gear since the rep rewards aren’t beyond what’s already available unlike the stuff from AV.
---
I just took my first more than 8 hour break from classic since launch due to it being forced on me by my water pump dying in my loop on P2 release day...it's been a few days now, maybe for the best.
---
I got myself back in the gym and am aiming to have a better play/work/exercise balance going forward.
---
C'moonnnnnnn Arcane Crystal!
---
Time to go tell them about the clip and show them all the comments about how garbage they are
---
And I don’t care what happens to PvE servers, just don’t change PvP servers.  It’s a feature, not a bug.  
---
Accept PvP, quit, or reroll.
---
Nah I'm Gucci
---
were you able to get in?
---
well  said . Also Can you talk    to anyone like this in real life or show ? beside the internet ?  no!  So  Shut  UP streamer or whatever you  are (but they are roleplaying isn't it ? (my ass ))
---
You can’t get into bear if you are stunned.
---
Horde racials are the best in pvp
---
Wait for BGs.
---
Only do wPvP if you're having fun.
---
Blizzard, there are too many people on the servers at once time, increasing world PvP to way higher than it was in Vanilla! That is the issue! The community was talking about pop cap since Classic was announced, and many people would prefer servers with popcaps closer to Vanilla.
---
They run like 3g on my server, hard to justify spending that much for each encounter for a war just for a chance against someone...besides, this patch is all about winning with numbers, very few if any “fair” open world encounters.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla even still play him on retail. No crippling poison for pvp is the epitome of badness, yeah.
---
Same but for Feathermoon side, took me about 25 mins longer to get into DM:E than it normally would.   
---
Boat = camped.    
---
Docks = camped.   
---
Open road = surprisingly was safe.    
---
Entrance to DM = camped from the ramp all the way through to the portal.
---
Imaginary internet points make people do strange things. Welcome to Reddit.

Not anymore work than setting up a mobile hotspot on your phone so you can actually use your laptop.

Anyone know what the UI and map addons are here?
---
This whole video is a mess. I have no clue where to start with this pilav guy. XD
---
Just sit in ZF until you’re 52 then go to BRD. You’ll die getting in but better than trying to get a quest done and dying 50 times.
---
Yep! And Spy can’t see rogues/druids that are stealthed, so basically if you want to be a sneaky ganker you just gotta sneak more. All Spy does is stop rogues from hunting for targets on an epic mount and stealthing only when it’s convenient.
---
If population goes down though, then there will be less PvP.
---
Could be some dudes bank toon
---
You misspelled the word wrong.
---
The bigger the level difference, the less honor you get. Killing the same player more than once yields less honor each time. Killing a player 30 seconds after they've rez'ed gives no honor. Killing a player splits the honor between all members of your party.
---
 There're a lot of mechanics discouraging 5x lvl 60s roaming lvl 48 zones, griefing endlessly, etc. my guess is after a few weeks people will begin optimizing how they gank honor. If it's just one lvl 60 roaming the zone, guess what they're just trying to earn honor without getting ganked by a group themselves.
---
*laughs in demonic* oh boi, good luck.
---
People who complain about PvP are rapists.  If you disagree, it’s because it hits too close to home.
---
Lal talking of peak performance wearing t1 head
---
I mean, it's his group? Don't join it if you have a problem? He will most likely have to wait longer to get a group maybe he would rather do this than have to roll vs 5 other people
---
So anything past 10,000 honor which is the requirement for rank 4 (I think) is pointless? or do they carry over?
---
im not a fan of him either. 
---
But I can see nothing wrong in a man saying the obvious truth.
---
that was my first guess as well, thats why Ven switched to him with a r1 froatbolt, to keep in combat
---
What's the crit cap?
---
Don't let the nerds bring you down man. Anyone who takes a GAME that seriously is probably not worth hanging around
---
You can see my thread from yesterday:

---
7 civilians at Zoram Strand. Great DK/hour!
---
What happens in phase 4?
---
Those are rookie numbers you gotta pump those numbers up
---
Not even T2 head and talking about peak performance lol
---
This horde player is basically done killing until BGs come out.  If all the alliance quit before the BGs even get here the queues will be horrible.
---
Basically yes. 
---
It's one of the reasons that many private server players are "no changes". There has been so many different vanilla servers and they have all tried different customisations and we've come to learn that even the smallest changes can change the game in unforeseen ways.
---
They were impressed by the balancing skills
---
Preform AV Enabler, I used to run a lot of AV premades back in TBC too. Amazing addon, not sure if there is a classic version
---
Actors are interacting with other actors. If an actor does something shitty to another actor in a scene, that's part of the play. 
---
Asmon is shitty to people just playing the game, who *aren't* part of his stream. 
---
It's the same with people who pull "pranks" and just act like dickheads to random people on the street. If you can't grasp the difference, then I don't know what to say.
---
The maddest
---
Yes, but I would still skip not essentially spells. Focus on picking briarthorn and stormkelp at your level. Those herbs have a nice price, but the rest are nearly worthless. For those I would go out of my way to collect.
---
2h is way better than shield imho. I leveled a warrior alt a bit and if you buy a cheap green 2hander every 3-4 levels it really helps.
---
And skill basically does that at max level I believe l, not sure.
---
bg queues are going to be cross-server sooooo
---
Debatable. Wolf and boar meat sell for like 6-7s each
---
&gt; P.ss. if you use spy addon, fuck you. you are actually aids and probably couldnt win a 1v1 with a dead fish. Trash. 
---
Spy is OP, it's stupid, I hope it gets removed via preventing the combat log from seeing enemy players gain a buff until they're within a certain distance of you. But I use it, why? If I don't use it, i'll get killed by those that do use it. It's a situation where *because* so many people use it, you kinda *have* to use it to compete. It ruins many aspects of being in the world such as hiding in bushes, hiding in water, and sneaking around people. I want to LOOK for people, not SEARCH, but at the same time, I don't want to be caught unaware of people coming up to me using the same addon.
---
yes
---
What server is this? I used to be in &lt;Vanguard&gt; with Throsk on another server!
---
It’s almost as if those constant warnings blizzard said about overpopulation a million times were actually right
---
Must have been real fun typing that out
---
Hunter imo, you just click Mark, sting and pet attack and you easily take down a mob.
---
uh i really shouldn't of comment since I hate talking on platforms on this and rather talk on discord or voice coms about this.
---
Haha that was just my first, happened to be a random 1v1 he attacked first but I drew last blood!
---
Noob mage here, how is the freezing the rogues without using nova? I think that's the case
---
That's why I'll use this free time to make enough money so I can afford a nanny. Plus family also won't be waiting with their tongues out till I die so they can inherit my stuff.
---
You're forgetting that honor farm is relative. It doesn't matter if you can't get into BG's because you just need more honor than others, who equally cannot get into their BG's. For no lifers, it's actually an advantage that most of their competition physically can't wait long enough (before having to log off) in order to get into easy honor farms. 
---
What happens is you queue for BGs then go and farm the world some more. 
---
Now there's the argument that being on a faction dominated server means you have more competition, but again it doesn't matter as long as you are better than average. If anything it means that your competition can't get too ahead of you due to a band limit of honor per hour.
---
Rogue, at least early on it is basically sinister strive and eviscerate. Possibly a gouge and bandage.  
---
Mage,  if you do frost single target. Frost bolt, fire blast. Frost nova. Later maybe a cone of cold.  If you do aoe flamestrike, blizzard, frost nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion maybe. 
---
Paladin, keep up seal and judge. Auto attack. You can get through most things. Situationally you may have to seal twist, heal yourself or DI, LoH. 
---
Hunter, mostly send pet. Serpent sting. Arcane shot. Auto shot. If you’re BM bestial wrath. If your MM aimed shot. 
---
Priest. Swp, mind blast, wand. Shield and renew as necessary.
---
I buy mats for Shadow Reflectors, craft them and sell on the AH. On Bendiction/Alliance, the item sells for around 200g and takes about 50g in mats to craft (if I smelt the Dark Iron myself which takes an easy lava run and 2 Fireguards to kill). 
---
I also have a deal with a Horde guy who buys Elixir of Giant Growth recipes for about 4g on his side and I sell for 20-25g on my side.
---
This exactly.
---
Wish my wife would do that
---
Good job on your post dude it ended really well.
---
Is that what makes someone who they are? Just the day they were given a name?
---
I thought about including those in the picture, but I was afraid having too many numbers would make it hard to read.
---
Anyway, if you are in the 50th precentile of people who get +15 HK, you get about 2500 Ranking Points.
---
Here is a table. The 1.12 values are used in Classic.
---

---
Wow man
---
Do bank toons fish 24/7
---
Tbf, rogues are supposed to be the gankers in WPvP, not the large scale blob fighters. Avoid hillsbrad and go to areas where people are farming or fighting small fights like Eastern Plaguelands/Felwood.
---
Also find a team to work with :)
---
I am studying European studies with political sciences at university (not the hardest course but requires a bit) and a semi-hardcore raider.
---
Classic is super easy, a bit of grinding for pre-BiS gear once you ding 60 and then raidlogging once a week is all you need to do to keep up.
---
Basically, it is very much time invested in the beginning, but once you ding 60 PvE is at an absolute faceroll difficulty if you’re coming from retail.
---
PvP is a whole other story and requires quite a lot of grinding to keep up.
---
Okay, then have fun with another game.
---
Ashbringer is nice. It feels very balanced, has very high pop with a short queue every now and then.
---
OPie Classic (if you mean trackings, I dont have aspects on any specific addon/keybind)
---
Agreed. 90% of the time my shit gets resisted.
---
Blind, bandage, not shoot bow to restealth, use prep to imp sprint or vanish
---
You seem really tilted. 
---
Never said they should do the exact same thing, I even told you that I thought the timing wasn't very smart. I for one would like to experience vanilla again, as starting at patch 1.0 but I'm sure not everyone would like that and that would bring a lot of problems, but anyway it's not the point. 
---
So yeah, sorry you're so mad about it man but it won't change anything, the more classic goes the more it looks like a quick cash grab from blizzard to me too. 
---
Maybe take a break, wait for the hype to die off a bit and I'm sure you'll have a much better experience, it's just a game.
---
I didn’t.  I figured out all I care to know about the guy from reading in this thread. I won’t be looking to learn anything more about him.
---
Calling people a “smug neck beard” is such an ironic insult.
---
Not sure why any form of blizzard is allowed for names.  Seems to be an easy fix
---
That's what the other guy was talking about. You either have severely underdeveloped sense of empathy where you don't give a shit about anyone else or a sadist that enjoys causing pain and misery. Either way not good. A normal person would look at this and think "hey, that's a real person whose life I'm making miserable maybe I should stop or do it once and move on". To go "oh, yeah, I'm gonna harrass you until you quit the game" just makes you a genuine piece of shit. And I mean that in complete sincerity, no meming or hyperbole.
---
Nah it's pathetic. You can tell theyre trash players.
---
Yeah, what happened to Newman's Landing? I swam all the way around Dun Morogh and found this abandoned fishing shack and a dock...and skeletons.  It was eery and there was nothing to click or do but they clearly developed this for NPCs and instead...
---
Just a multiboxer loser.
---
Just watched, i've seen most of the clips used in the video before and majority are out of context or Pilav literally just misunderstands the situation like the Asmon clip with jokerd which was an obvious joke.
---
Also isn't this against the rules? No witch hunts or brigading etc.
---
Yeah, that would be bad. I know many servers are even worse than mine, but it's still pretty bad. It kind of kills the mood when you can't even go into the Wetlands without getting camped at the gryphon. Forget farming for herbs, doing a quest, or fishing. It wasn't like this in vanilla, probably due to server caps and slow leveling back then.
---
Just don't compare the poops
---
10/10 troll
---
Frost mage is universally the easiest class to level in the game by a very wide margin, warrior before whirlwind/40 talents is one of the biggest slogs and it gets marginally better after 40
---
Didnt know you could pop elixirs while blinded.
---
Height cannot be improved, learning information is something someone can entirely do. Intelligence isn't even the requirement to avoid these anyways, it's knowledge about scammers and phishers
---
Estimate I've been ganked 30 times. 0 HKs so far.
---
Great job exposing the fakes
---
How would they not die to random mobs or ganking
---
Nothing wrong with it. Rogues always cheese
---
&gt;
---
&gt;No need when you have all the answers.
---
&gt;Transfer, like you suggested big brain.
---
.......they can't you dipshit.  Only horde can transfer right now on the unbalanced realms.
---
If that is true, then what is this:  [https://imgur.com/a/zWUGP3K](https://imgur.com/a/zWUGP3K) Screenshot taken just now

I had the same issue as OP, just had to relog to fix it today

My dumb ass 12 yr old self got the buff and fell off the cliff and died.

At least I got to test out reincarnation..

Needs more gurl beard.
---
I think I like the 3 set bonus for pvp. Them fast flash heals man
---
He is doing more for the game than you think he is organizing events and keeping it alive. The only scummy thing he has done is looting gear which  he said he would do anyway and when you go into adungeon or raid with him its your own fault. I also dont have time to argue with haters.
---
So if you hate him dont talk about him or you advertise and boost him. Over and out.
---
Pretty sure you maintain the title no?
---
But the shoe doesn't fit lmao. You're jiust being a complete ass, and then saying that THEY are the ones who are pathetic. 
---
I'm not even subbed to the game dude so it doesn't hit close at all.
---
Kids are getting old enough now that they will be join ing in wow, we will have a ready made 4 person party!  We are all ptetty excited.
---
52.5 when phase 2 hit. Im not 53.5 Having spent 4+ hours a day spamming for groups only to have either the groups fall apart before they happen (Many deaths leading to dungeon = no fun) or its not a full clear so we do 1 or 2 bosses and quit. HOURS wasted in this game.  
---
I just want 60 but my 'Friends' wont stop pvping to help me and my guildies wont stop either. I cant blame them as PvP on a PvP server is... probably fun. But... They cant blame me when I quit due to a complete waste of time.
---
really well done man. i just spent the last week doing these myself, and can improve my times a bit by watching some of the pulls on the way.
---
i always kill that 3 pack of hyenas though before gordok (which is like the most time consuming part of the run if i miss the pat), do they ever pat back around and make things difficult for you or do you always ignore them?
---
Is this patch after the nerfs to fishing and farming wolves for exp?
---
I think you're the on who doesn't have a clue. This isn't progression. Nothing is hard and your class don't matter. I can solo heal 10 man ubrs as a Boomkin spec druid. Literally means nothing unless you're a complete shitter.
---
It's because the talents for many classes have been reworked from original release by 1.12. Also, gear was boosted up stat wise.
---
Yep.
---
I was saying a month ago "WSG 2 weeks after honor released". It was clear to anyone with a brain that the world would become full of deathsquads. If you are 48-59 the game basically is impossible, 60's are flooding mid-high level zones.
---
No idea if its the same now but in vanilla there was a guy in deeprun tram who would respawn instantly
---
Streamer called Guzu plays from EU to east coast and he's doing just fine even participating in that tournament thing. Seems like it's not a big deal at all.
---
The general meta for rogues is slow mainhead fast offhand. 
---
The reason is your skills like SS and backstab etc proc off the damage of the mainhand (not the dps, the raw damage). So the higher the damage the more they do. 
---
For your offhand, slow vs fast is meaningless damage wise. Except when you factor in poisons. Every swing has the same chance to proc a poison regardless of speed. So if you’re running instant or deadly poison offhand, with a faster weapon you’ll get more poison price and thus more damage.
---
Do people have nothing better to do than obsess over people they don't like?
---
Oh wait, drama channel. Scuffed Leafy etc
---
I was mostly joking, but to give you genuine answers:
---
1. I'm not doing PVP right now as all the heals got snapped by Thanos on my server, hence 0 premates anyway
---
2. I'm usually pulling aggro on trashpacks, doesn't matter when during the fight, but it happens so often that I've become a walking meme in the guild
---
3. talking about the guild, they advertise as semi-hardcore, with the idea to adapt to the situation. They say the only requirements are GFP, but don't stop the insane peer-pressure that is given if you put a bunch of former world top 100+ players together who want to play a little more hardcore.
---
What I actually did was trying to talk with the GM / officers about it (as classlead), and as they didn't have time for it I have now started a sort of protest, where I take their announcement about requirements by the word and just go to raid with greater fire protection potions and literally nothing else. They saw me perform. I've had some 97% parses, even though the guild setup didn't allow for it. Now they can suck my clit.
---
Re: weapon skill, basically you are a level 61 in damage calculations. This translates to 3% hit but also means your glancing blows will have their damage reduced less, which is also a nice damage increase.
---
The weapon skill cannot be understated in how strong it is.
---
yeah i agree with mad_maddin. if epic mount then yes, else no.
---
Frostbite talent in frost tree gives a 5/10/15% chance to freeze target on any chill effect.
---
Go suck a cock cunt
---
No, busy with scan &amp; repair. This was Pagle.
---
There was a rogue that got me that way in felwood. When I resurrected I /waved and started /dancing furiously. He un-stealthed and danced with me before leaving.  
---
The moonkin dance, it's magical.
---
You knew it was coming if you'd done any form of research, you literally have no one to blame except yourself.
---
Hell this was prophecized the moment the 6 phase plan was revealed right after blizzcon 2018.
---
Plenty people on Golemagg, btw.
---
And the talents for some classes when MC launched were hella bad and were later fixed by 1.12.
---
Now - DKs have 0 impact since you are rank 1.
---
After Tuesday - each DK will lower your rank in real-time, all the way to Rank 1 if you get enough DKs. Assuming you are trying to reach a rank higher than 1, DKs will screw you badly.
---
Rank 11 probably won't be attainable without playing every day with a dedicated group.
---
Sry to tell ya but you never level your ah character
---
Well, people warned you about pvp servers. 
---
You can actually pvp on pve servers at your discretion. 
---
Learn from your mistake and move on or just move on.
---
&gt; You cant escape
---
~you can just quit the game!~ Or reroll to PvE server.
---
Bloodfang went from 50-50 to 60-40 in 2 days of transfers, it's only going to get worse.
---
I welcome you to join us on a PvE realm. The game is a lot more fun when the community is less competitive. You'll find a community of players that love to play and share the game with others, as opposed to PvPers that love fighting others. Yes, you'll have to reroll, but you'll want to experience PvE realms from the very start.
---
No, it just turns into a pve server.
---
I've been using it for years and have used it all of classic. I knew it was going to be a problem. I would love for it to be removed but it's simply not possible. I miss the days of being able to gank in orgrimmar and not have a squad of people spam aoe searching for me before I even begin to attempt to gank because they saw my stealth go off with spy. I've accepted it though there truly is nothing they can do aside from break the functionality of it and many many many other useful addons. It would be the equivalent of amputating an entire arm to get rid of a tiny spot of cancer.
---
no he's saying that if you used the original schedule now, because people are better at the game overall, they would be 60. even though people weren't 60 on time originally
---
It has become a must have addon like DBM . Please remove this addon twitch, creater of spy, or even blizzard this shit doesnt belong.
---
How is massive battles in retail?
---
Learn this recipe even if it means leveling a second character to 35. The passive income will better in the long run
---
Played on Thurs and today was raid day, which direction? Favor to Horde?
---
I am guessing they will make transfers faction specific to adjust, regardless..
---
Holy yikes.
---
Retail is less time consuming and more rewarding for the amount of time. Classic is easier and more chill but everything require a loads of time.
---
I've heard paladin leveling solo is super slow. I don't have a consistent schedule so I can't really find a duo partner. If I decide to dungeon-grind to 60, should I spec primarily as holy and heal, or should i just go ret and do a hybrid dps-heal role?
---
The island you’re thinking of south of Tanarisn is part of the AQ quest chain, it’s uncharted but definitely accessible.
---
The actual GM island is instanced, or used to be. Used to be able to /who GM during retail TBC/Vanilla and catch them chilling on the island if they didn’t have their GM tag on.
---

---
Warrior is objectively the easiest class to level, yes, way easier than even Warlock and Priest
---
You’re right in that our old logs didn’t show core rat as the caster. Either that means wcl changed something or the game log did. However the amount of lava bursts and amount of damage we took since our first MC is the same, it’s just that in the logs we now see it being cast instead of just having the damage. Compare your damage taken to lava burst from your earlier kills and it should be the same.
---
Just like in fighting, you're welcome to tap out any time you want.
---
I thought I was the only one that said this :o
---
I'm just glad I got it out of my system back then. 8/8 T6 and Vengeful Gladiator. Literally beat the game. Now I can be casual as fuck and not care.
---
Lmao
---
Besides the racial mounts I believe the only one you can get from a drop as if now is the one from strat, I could be wrong though.
---

---
massive thighs though. I know some people are into that THICC stuff but miss me with that.
---
The standard racial mounts, and the mount from Baron Rivendare
---
im gonna ask why the perds if you are not gonna be daggers?
---
if you are staying swords kroll/song 
---
How much hit % do I need to never miss yellow attacks (Sinister Strike/Backstab/etc.) vs raid bosses?
---
300 Weapon Skill: 9%
---
305 Weapon Skill: 6%
---
315 Weapon Skill: 5% (but you generally should not aim for 315+ Weapon Skill)
---
This is total hit % required, so if you are playing a regular Combat raiding spec with 5/5 Precision and 2/2 Weapon Expertise, you will not miss yellow attacks with just 1% hit from gear.
---
Then all hit % beyond those values is useless?
---
No. This only applies to yellow attacks. Your white hits will still have a large miss % due to the Dual Wield penalty applied from wielding 2 weapons. What people commonly refer to as a "hit cap" is more accurately the absolute minimum amount of hit % you want to have. Hit % above that still improves your overall damage since it will cause more white hits to land, and white hits tend to be ~50% of your overall damage (depending on gear/fight length/and so on).
---
6 PC SC is very nice but NS is better once you get enough of it to offset 6pc SC + DS
---
Base race mounts, 3 normal mounts 3 epic mounts each. You need exalted with different factions in order to use their mounts. Baron mount in stratholme is epic. Winterspring mount for alliance. Paladin questline and warlock questline mounts.
---
The difference between that and spy is you don't know the name of the person sneaking up on you or hiding until you see them and then create your macro. Spy instantly targets people you haven't even seen yet or know the name of. Completely unfair. 
---
It takes away the need of reading someone's name up close and having time to create the macro. Which is cheating as far as I'm concerned.
---
I find it’s a decent balance between pve and pvp, it’s best in groups for pve and you can gang certain classes very easily
---
If. He. Was. On. Phone. It's. Just. A. Double. Space.
---
it wasnt necessary until it exploded in popularity and boomers caught wind of it
---
I guess not
---
Not just rogues ha. Most locks I’m encountering just try and chain fear giving me 10s berserker rage to kill them which is enough.  
---
Most classes are ok as long as I get the charge in. Except Druids. Hunters usually ok if my crits are good and I get the charge. 
---
I just find that on my server most people are raid specced and that really helps.
---
It’s not like they split dire maul and world pvp which was also supposed to be in the same phase .... oh wait.
---
WURK WURKKK
---
Honor has been out for less than a week, people are excited for new content and going hard af. With that being said it will calm down, but WoW is a chaotic world of war and Wpvp is a huge part of the game being alive and ever changing
---
I heard a student say it yesterday and I’m gonna run with it lol
---
You don't, at least you didn't in vanilla
---
Should be in Anathema form for max #Aesthetic, but I'm happy you achieved your goal, OP :)
---
If you're determined to be swords, Krol MH, Mirahs OH is your best dps setup. With Perdition's though, I'd suggest going Daggers. You can grab a shadowfoot stabber for cheap off the AH if you want. Distracting Dagger would probably be the best OH option if you don't have it, decent drop rate. Perds/DD is a much better dps setup than the swords you have. 
---
If you have 305 weapon skill, you need 6% hit total to make sure you never miss a special attack. 5% of which you'll get from the precision talent, so only 1% on gear to get to that cap. Hit still is a good stat after the 1% so don't worry about getting more on other pieces of gear. As far as crit goes, after the special cap it tends to be your best stat, but there's no magic number that you need to reach, just wear the best gear you have essentially.
---
The six piece bonus on Shadowcraft is very, very good. You usually need about 5 pieces of Nightslayer (depending on which 5 or so pieces it is) to warrant breaking the SC6 set. Eventually the higher stats on tier 1 and 2 will be worth more damage than the proc.
---
Because some people have nothing better to do than to put other people down.
---
Bis strat LOL awesome
---
How am I greedy when I didn't demand any money? I've given away stacks of food and water for less than 1g and even free and never said a word to the recipient.
---
Not everyone was for no changes. There was alot about early wow I didn't like

Congratulations, looks great.

And that is honorable...how?

In favor of horde: [https://ironforge.pro/servers](https://ironforge.pro/servers).
---
It was 80:20 before the transfers opened, we got an influx of a few guilds. If we can get 3-400 more hordies to xfer in before they close it, Hearseeker will be amazing through all phases.
---
I was a brutal gladiator s4 and merc glad s2. I still don't think I'm that good.

Wow, another one of these threads.
---
In contrast, air totem was too easy
---
How do rogue fight that
---
I didn't see a thing, no. But I know what you're talking about; I've seen mob nameplates showing through solid objects when I have them turned on.
---
Can you send them to me after you're done? I fail at pvp, I need the trash talk!
---
this just nullifies your argument that +spirit matters at
---
all.
---
What’s a chata? 😉
---
This.
---
its vanilla :) for that I don't have any add-ons (weirdly)
---
Not really. Sit at the ramp from the lava in BRD and kill everyone trying to get up after jumping. Bonus points for frost nova’ing them in the lava.
---
Sit at the DME exit and kill the people 2 man jumping. You can just leave and go gank other DM entrances and relatively easy escape because you can zone into an instance when you know they’re sending reinforcements.
---
Sit on the road to DM somewhere and intercept people solo traveling or in small groups.
---
Sit outside ZF and kill people trying to solo farm or spell cleave. Easy escape if you’re overrun, just zone in and wait.
---
Sit at BRD entrance with rogue scout, come out and kill people. Come out again when rogue says small inc.
---
There’s so many ways to get honor outside of lag fest aoe spamming it’s just that as usual the players will always take the easiest and safest way then complain there’s no alternative.
---
Your corpse has to be in the instance to run in.
---
agreed
---
Send your pet passed Kromcrush to the mobs on the left and then send your pet back to the mobs in front of Kromcrush. Pet can still die there, but I've had it survive plenty of times doing that.
---
Can we stop with this everyday this is posted. Yes majority would like to see it banned or nerfed to where it’s useless
---
I'm the only person who sees a problem? Do you even have the internet or play wow? My post was in response to the many many "Solution" posts and comments i've seen around about people who also see 40 lvl 60's ganking in a lvl 50 zone for  example.
---
He helps ninja/funnel loot and acts like an entitled prick.
---
He boasts hard about "we own this server, we'll camp horde until they quit", but when a single shadowpriest forms a PUG raid to keep him out of his raid, he whines and cries about not being able to do anything.
---
His only interest is leeching gold and items from the 12 year olds that subscribe to his bullshit stream.
---
Is essence of water really that cheap for you? It's been 23-25+ for over a month on Sulfuras, and the last 2 days the price has gone up a bit because of pvp
---
I think 18g is a real low end price, and not a rough average. Essence of air is 18g, maybe... so the recipe is significantly more profitable than your estimate
---
It's fun, once.
---
Because they aren't the same thing.
---
&gt; Hit still is a good stat after the 1% so don't worry about getting more on other pieces of gear
---
What does hit do for you after 6%?
---
That’s a thicc jawn rite ther
---
That's a coincidence then, because Venruki says it all the time.
---
Instant Poison will generally always be better than anything else besides Windfury. On enemies immune to your Poison, elemental sharpening stones are going to be the next best thing. 
---
Shadow Oil is also an option, but to make it effective you need to use a greater arcane elixir and flask of supreme power, and the possible increase is not worth the cost.
---
Rogue is absolutely not a good class for thr lazy. If you get lazy on your rotation you drop too much on health and will end up regging a lot.
---
I'd say pala or hunter
---
Grown men crying on reddit about an unfair addon.... l fucking o l
---
I would personally go with Mirah's Song in yhe offhand with Krol Blade MH because it is a fast speed and the +9 strength and agility is a very nice stat line if you dont have the dal'rend set bonus.
---
Hit cap for a boss is 9%, as long as you maintain that you are good. Im not sure what a good crit% is but im sitting around 21% while being hit capped.
---
Can't comment on Shadowcraft being better than Nightslayer tho unfortunately, I'm at work and can't crunch numbers.
---
As a normal human I struggle to see the fun in that but I guess that's the way the internet is now. Shame.
---
Here is a multiboxer fishing with 10chars at the same time. Not botting, not illegal. https://youtu.be/N0SRK3l4tRk

Draenor/Outland existed in Warcraft and Warcraft II. Vanilla WoW is already quite far removed from "western high fantasy" and I certainly can't agree with the insinuation that the main reason people stopped playing WoW because they couldn't handle the existence of Asian elements in the game.
---
Honestly that cringe, image sitting there because you're so concerned what randoms think of you.
---
I only lost 100s of gold from mr random letters mass botting oily black mouth. I ain’t expecting much to happen tho as I understand blizzard bans in cycle to keep that Chinese money incoming so they will cycle the bots in tune with blizzard.
---
That's how being a ghost works...
---
Mounts in classic aren't like they are in retail, in the way that there are only racial mounts + a couple extremely rare drops.  Here are the racial mounts available:
---
Dwarf: ram
---
Human: horse
---
Night elf: cat
---
Gnome: mechanostrider
---
Tauren: kodo
---
Orc: wolf
---
Troll: raptor
---
Undead: Skelly horse
---
In order to get a mount from another faction, you must become exalted in reputation with that factions capital city.  If you're a human and you want the night elf cat, you'll have to become exalted with darnassus just to BUY it.  
---
There is a black PvP version of each mount type that will be available through PvP ranking - I believe at rank 11 although you still have to pay money for it.  The mount is just UNLOCKED at the rank.  
---
Additionally there are 4 other mounts that may be obtained via boss drop/other mechanic.  Baron Rivendares warhorse - drop from UD strat last boss Baron Rivendare.  Swift raptor, and Zulian tiger (coolest mount in the game) are drops from the Zul Gurub raid that is not available yet.  And then there's the AQ 40 mount that you won't get.    
---
I bet I missed something in there, but that's most of it.
---
No issues on end games zones for lag.   
---
Hillsbrad has some. Took 3.2s to cast a 2.5s spell. I wouldn't say literally unplayable. And that was on Thursday afternoon. 
---
No complaints here.
---
Hi, /u/MBPyro
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxatbl/playing_on_a_horde_dominated_server_as_alliance/). 
---
Is it weird? The vast majority of classic players are legitimately shit at the game PvP wise.
---
Assuming you have Perd's MH? They both sim closely, you'll be more consistent with CHT, but Felstriker proccing at opportune times would be an increase.
---
1 day of ranking is a stupid metric to go on, honestly. You've got ages, unless you're going for a high rank there's no point in rushing it and burning yourself out. Yeah, it's nice to enjoy the event of everyone doing big raids, but then what? Like you've found out, nadda.
---
Plus AV Frostwolf/ Dwarfen Mount and the Rank 11 PVP mounts.
---
The problem is you don’t really know your rank points as it depends on other players.
---
I’m not able to troubleshoot for you, but it works for me and others here too, so it’s prob something your doing wrong on your end.
---
It doesn't matter what the overall balance is. If the overall balance is 60/40, then each server in an ideal scenario would be 60/40. Just cause there's not a perfect split doesn't mean we shouldn't try to get each server as close to the overall balance as possible. Yes we can't fix the overall balance but we can fix each server to closely reflect the overall balance
---
Thats exactly what I was looking for, thanks so much!
---
I despised when AV changed to a race instead of a war... I'm going to be very sad if that's what it is again... I've been craving the orginally way since people started just passing up each other....
---
I’ll look and link on my desktop.  The elvui one just really adds background integration but is functionally the same.
---
It is the same code the Alliance uses. The algorithm from Gutterspeak to Common is the same as Common to Orcish.
---
In my opinion, classic feels much more rewarding to play.  You can feel the progress with every single item -even white items at the beginning while leveling.  At 60, I don't have a single epic but I'm pretty proud of my gear, and I feel pretty powerful too.
---
So you're suggesting to be a pre-meditated dick head? Why would you ever suggest someone plans to fuck over a guild? 
---
Be an adult and discuss issues you have with the guild leadership. If you're in a guild where you can't have these types of conversations openly, you're in the wrong guild and/or you and the guild are a bunch of children.
---
Have 420 kills across all dm bosses trying to hunt down forors compendium atm
---
Lol yeah i bet you are. Im taking a break until bgs come out, im not gana corpse hop 10 times for a single BRD run, let alone trying to farm or quest while outnumbered 2:1.
---
I helped a rogue in guild farm HOJ. We did 72 runs.. outrageous
---
Sounds like dunning-kreuger. Skilled people underestimate themselves while unskilled people overestimate themselves
---
You keep the title, I had Blood Guard title for the entirety of Vanilla, despite only doing a single week of PvP more or less, So once you unlock a title, such as High Warlord, you can keep it, even if you drop below rank 14.
---
it's something like 26-29% + your hit chance
---
If your server has 10k players that's hundreds of players each week.
---
I don’t get feedback, you use more mana casting it than you will burn from attacking enemies
---
Yes you did
---
\&gt; If you're in Strath Live to farm gold, you're in the wrong place.   
---
Then how do I farm gold?  
---
\&gt; you can reserve the first orb that drops in Strath Live   
---
Great. Fukken great. GENIUS.
---
I’m sorry ... what?
---
I’d recommend a holy/prot build if ur planning to dungeon grind. Most of the time groups will be looking for a tank rather than heals for dungeons. Personally I went holy until concentration, prot until improved righteous fury, then the rest into ret. Just keep different gear sets and you will be able to heal, tank, and dps up through BRD and quest efficiently during slow times. Respec to your preferred spec once you hit 58-60.
---
a rogue in my previous guild had it on his 161st run. It then proceded to drop 3 more times in the runs after
---
Try reading my post next time. Slower perhaps.
---
I'm starting to wonder if _you_ ever had any hobby besides video games, because I promise you professional athletes or carpenters don't spend 18 hours a day on their hobbies. "Pro gamers" are the only ones that do cause it's easy to sit your fat acnea ridden ass on a chair all day and forget all about anything else partaining to real life.
---
Yeah but Humans aesthetically look better than dwarves imo
---
I'd rather enjoy how my how my character looks if I'm gonna be playing for a long time
---
Can you reroll on a pve server?
---
azshara isn't just inhabited though, it's blatantly unfinished content
---
there's a quest at the bottom of some of the cliffs that involves you defending a group of NPCs from naga. after you do the captain tells you the others have quests for you to do if they survived. it's obviously meant to be a quest hub that just never got developed.
---
there's a timbermaw presence in the zone but nothing to do with them.
---
there's a dead/passed out named night elf in the satyr ruins that serves no purpose
---
there's an entire area of elite mobs east of the flight point that serve no purpose
---
the mountain east of the flight point has two caves at the top, one with an alliance flag and the other with a horde flag. Again, there's no actual content,
---
Nice footage from buggy pirate servers
---
Thank you for explaining!
---
20ish kills for HoJ.
---
Me, another warrior and a druid all knew each other needed it going into the run. When it finally dropped we all hit need. Then the hunter needed on it "for pvp".
---
Thankfully I won it. If the hunter got it I probably would have uninstalled. They already need on every weapon, now they're after melee trinkets :/
---
Our server was slightly imbalanced, favoring horde on launch when the census addons were active.
---
Now its overwhelming amounts of horde at every flight path. 
---
Its not a fight, its a slaughter at Southshore. Horde camp the entire town.
---
I remember back in the day the battle used to tip back and forth but now it just swings wildly in one direction.
---
Ziq &gt; Ven
---
Do shamans need to be super geared like warriors to be good?
---
Not sure if it is actually much because of the arena diversity, but bashiok sash dropped in my 63th arena
---
jelly bean
---
Where have you seen Alliance dominate? I have to corpse hop ~10 times to get to BRD, and EPL is just as bad. Plus the boat to menethel has been horde controlled all 5 times ive tried to use it. Only way alliance can get to the west is darnasus port.
---
lots of jealous ass people in here XD
---
Believe it or not, not everyone plays Mage.
---
Do they work against lvl 60s?
---
Oh my god that was you lol
---
Didn't you just post this 2hrs ago?
---
Even his proposed solution still involves cheap shot.  It's not that cheap shot is bad, it's just a mage has a good ability to kite and create instant space.  
---
Honestly as a rogue you should always be using your best tool...the ability to pick your fights.
---
does your bank alt have to be certain lv enchanting to DE that high?
---
HoJ: 15
---
Savage Glad Chain: 97
---
You’re saying every day you solo heal ubrs in a ten man? Like I legit do not believe you could do that without a bunch of wipes and a bunch of pots being used.
---
Lvl 54 undead priest is the loot in BRD worth it? Full runs are very long and I don’t think I get anything from arena runs
---
I would suggest you do ret spec to level 29, healing or dpsing as you go, then start dungeons seriously with SM. You can focus on healing, but you should collect decent cloth gear in gy and lib and with the ret gear you have saved up that's 2 sets so you can dps as needed. You can tank too if you grab consecration from holy fine at that point with half-intelligent teammates, and that should really help you save time by eliminating time spent finding groups
---
That's not one of the options.
---
I imagine they think the world should conform to their every win
---
Well yeah, but its also 9230 players who get less than 8000 RP per week. And all of those are people with +15HK, others dont count.
---
Get up an hour earlier to quest and go to bed at hour earlier
---
I'm just kind of laughing because of your title and the fact you have 0 upvotes lol
---
Does the XP party/raid buff/penalities affect honor? 
---
Example: I'm alone and do 20% of an lv60 alliances health, with 4 others did 80% out of my party. I expect to earn 40 honor. If I had been in their party, would I have earned 40 honor, or would there be a party bonus like with XP? If there is, is there a raid bonus, or a raid penalty? 
---
I'm trying to get the tooltip to show properly for this macro. It doesn't seem like the #showtooltip is smart enough even though it properly casts the abilities in sequence. Is there anyway to tell the #showtooltip to expect a castsequence?
---
&gt; /castsequence reset=target [noexists] Mage Armor, Arcane Intellect, Amplify Magic
---
&gt; /castsequence reset=target [exists] Arcane Intellect, Amplify Magic
---
The best I've been able to come up with is:
---
&gt; \#showtooltip [noexists] Mage Armor; [exists] Arcane Intellect
---
Kungen
---
No, it fills up the bar on your honor pane like an xp bar.  The bar is empty right now but next week you'll achieve a rank and see your progress to the next rank.  So yes the points carry over.
---
There used to be but they were removed in vanilla.
---
How is your server pop?
---
What if they max range and he turns right before the cheap shot and blinks somewhere else not in the direction of the max range rogue? Then he has double the distance to cover
---
I think you are wrong on your P.S. there are TONS of players who sub just to stomp on others 10 levels below them or stay in a small roaming death ball. Just because you dont or wouldnt do these things, doesn not mean other players find their in game enjoyment doing these things.
---
pss is also way off, you dont like it dont use it, i am guessing you dont use or read your combat log while you play either do you?
---
And hundreds of players a week are going to spend 30+ hours sitting in hillsbrad zergs.
---
You talk out your ass. Fact.
---
I really think the biggest reason I want kids is so I'll have people to spend time with that hopefully care about me when I'm too old to be useful to anyone or do the things I enjoy anymore.
---
Fuck, I wish I had engineering. Alas, I'm stuck with Princess farming like a pleb.
---
Excellent hunting.
---
guess a big part of alliance moved to Judgement when we had an option to go there. Right now it's ~59% in favor of horde, and it's very visible in the world - atm almost all alliance flight paths of any relevance are camped 24/7
---
147 runs for savage chain, havent seen it yet.
---
He said currently available so no frost wolf
---
I can only hope so :) in any case, PvP seems to be pretty healthy at 6 on my server, so just a bit longer to go :)
---
I did get forors compendium day 1 boss 1 of diremaul release. Felt pretty dirty after that
---
Ok lets Look at the facts the dude has random letters for a name and his level 10 what the Only level needed to advance fishing. His on 24/7 fishing in ashenvale so how do you explain it being his alt? What he doing in ashenvale lol I explained in previous messages I have been buying up blackmouth as an investment for months and noticed him selling but so many people bought them up his stacks did not stand out.
---
Good?  That's terrible honor per hour.
---
While the Rank 11 mount may be available now, Rank 11 will not be available now. AV will not be out until Phase 3. I just listed the possible mounts *at this time.*
---
Lol.   You're being foolish.
---
If you go to release the essence from the hidden questgiver in SoS, you lose the trinket and gain, well, nothing. It gives you a bit of XP, maybe. But basically it looks like it was supposed to be a long quest chain that led you to Moonglade or the Emerald Dream portals or something, and in reality it just abruptly ends. No more dialogue, no extra clues. Just a lost trinket.
---
I show 0 kills this week and nothing for yesterday and I did engage in pvp yesterday...
---
I think 97 for the glad chain is fine
---
I saw gorosh maybe 5 or 6 times in my 45 runs
---
In what universe it's healthier?
---
If you want more xp and lose the trinket turn it in. If you want to keep the trinket don't do it
---
Look at the name of the post. OP is admitting that they made a mistake. I share the sentiment. 
---
But no one could have known how overpopulated the realms would be and while I expected there to be more Horde due to the exaggerated mythos around them, I didn't expect it to be as lopsided as it is.
---
No, it makes no sense, they are there to level for sure

Priests have a bis chest? From a boss near the vaults. And maybe something from golem lord angrelmach?
---
well sorry to say but this happens, that is why a lot of people who played on pvp servers back in the day, are now on pve servers, dont have time for that shit
---
Did that happen to you?
---
[This one](https://youtu.be/d7JYsuRD0nY)? I vaguely remember watching this a long while back. Though, I mostly stuck to [Druid videos](https://youtu.be/uh_qyPsE_54).
---
Whats sobcrazy about twitch app?
---
what? that's absolutely not why lol, tbc pservers arent as popular because there was never really a well-made tbc server.
---
the "best" server was gummy's tbc servers but he randomly shuts down every project he ran after a few months so it never caught on.
---
Thats just what rng does, but i can soon afford to buy it instead even tho they are 1-1.2k on my server atm some guildies are willing to help me out :)
---
But everyone here is so good!
---
So what is the major difference between BRD, UBRS, and LBRS?  From my understanding, BRD is an expansive lvl 55 dungeon with tons of quests, UBRS is kinda the last stop before raids, with good pre raid gear, and im not sure what LBRS is.  Is LBRS an instance even?  I think I have a few quests for that location, but not even sure.  Thanks.
---
You sound like an idiot. People aren’t out there pvping to display their skills lol. It’s honor farming. If you are lvl 48-60 you should expect to be camped.
---
The fact is, I can have the stance that I don’t like reservations and I won’t tank when that’s on the table. You DONT understand that simple concept or the next, that I’m not saying reserves can’t exist, I’m saying I personally don’t like em and acting as if only a single way is the way is what is irritating about the few reservist apologist seem to say.
---
Working as intended. Roll PvE
---
Indeed. When this was obtainable I was already over 30 years old and up until today we had Naxxranas reprisal v2, weird time travels, the weapon resurfacing as primary legendary in Legion and lots of time passing. 
---
I did remember people during vanilla making lots of effort to obtain this weapon and there were lots of wild speculations around including something to do with nat pagles book that now drops again in DM as trash drop. 
---
I do know now again however that the weapon was utterly inconsequential as it was too rare and the timewondow to obtain it until tbc changed everything was too small. 
---
So here you have it. I remembered it wrong and probably shouldn’t have answered when riding the train home from work. I keep persisting though that adding a ‚you don‘t add anything to the discussion‘ framed in any way or shape when not doing so either is just as dumb as what is being criticized. My memory is imperfect yes but at least I got to enjoy all that content when it was relevant and not pushover due to perfect knowledge.
---
Thanks should be MS or Fury while leveling
---
I fucking suck at this game.. Phase 2 tore my anus apart, but I got 10 kills in STV yesterday, 7 of them we not self initiated because I wanted to quest and not pvp.. Didn't die once. I fucking hate pvp and suck at it.. But hey.. It's the name of the game.
---
Damn 1k is much. Are you sure its worth it? I rarely use it nowadays as I'm fury prot and run perditions blade + DM dagger which gives +5 skill
---
Maybe they’re shooting a new south park episode lol. 
---
Though I have seen bugged spawns you can farm for XP as long as your sanity holds.
---
Calling a fool a fool is heartless thinking? Are you serious? Ignorance is the greatest sin.
---
The lack of talents did me in at that point
---
It's sad the guard spawn mechanics are different too. I saw between 5-10 guards spawn in 2 different location no more than 10yds apart. Thats 2 groups of 5-10...that's not classic.
---
Every other class can use a FAP to run away from the Warrior, wait out the Warrior's FAP, and then simply kill him normally after the 30 seconds are up.
---
To be fair I didn't play BfA, but in legion you could roll a new character and have them decked out in high level gear in half the time it took most players to hit 60 in classic.
---
Honour points are counted daily, but they're compared Tue night with MC reset.
---
That's the impression I've been getting.
---
And the winter spring frost sabre for alliance only
---
Dont taunt me with those shoulders!!!!!! Keep loosing it to priests that never come back to raid, breaks my heart every time, then Benediction cuddles me and tells me it will be alright.
---
So you change his numbers and call him out for being wrong? No dude, you're wrong
---
How did you fit anything else in like washing/food shopping etc?
---
Back capping is one of the reasons I rolled rogue
---
UBRS and LBRS are actually in the same instance.  for UBRS you take a left turn and proceed through the locked door, for LBRS you take a right and drop down.  Your synopsis is pretty spot on, except that all of the dungeons mentioned have pre-raid BiS gear that drops.  You can make  a go at BRD starting around level 52 or 53 for partial runs, but shouldnt try to clear it until you can get a group closer to 60.  
---
LBRS is an important part of the onyxia attunement chain, you'll need to go in there once for that.  Also the pieces of the key to UBRS drop in LBRS.
---
Winterspring Frostsabre.
---
Completely doable to solo heal UBRS as boomkin spec so long as you have enough +healing you're good. Anyone who is in disbelief is just playing the game too cautiously.
---
Woo I'm special lol
---
Druid 1v1s are fun as hell as a mage even though you’re guaranteed to lose.
---
So your HKs will give you a certain a mount of honor. How much honor you've gained puts you at a specific standing for the week to receive rank points. 
---
Hk's dictate your honor, which dictates your rank for the week, which dictates how many points you get. 
---
Given that's it's percentage based, it's not a specific amount of HKs or honor for a specific amount of rank points, you talk about rank points since they're what matters.
---
What is it about Horde that attracts so many smooth-brained edgelords?
---
In my honest opinion, BRD is such a long instance that you should just run to get your quests done, and move on with your life.
---
Negative
---
I didnt see it, but i may have not fully explored it
---
Depends when they attacked him, assume it’s probably spell batching working as intended.
---
Bragging about being bad, the cornerstone of your generation
---
Following the logic of this, most pvp servers are 70/30 sided, if everyone rerolls because of the asshats on the dominating faction, we'll only have essentially pve servers.
---
Nah. I know what i'm talking about. Game's 15 years old. Thanks for your input though!
---
 But once you've bought the items you can always equip them too, correct?
---
Nah, Warlocks definitely have the upper hand vs Mages in a 1v1, if that's what you mean. But Mages feel really powerful in other areas.
---
Uh huh I'm sure with enough skill and preparation a 48 warrior leveling in Searing Gorge would easily take down 3 geared level 60 rogues that have nothing better to do than farm for honor. Give me a break.
---
I think if you can afford thunder fury mats that 1k won't matter lol
---
Seems like your the odd one out here mate, Everyone disagrees with you, and hence why your post has been buried.
---
Oh well, You are wrong.
---
Suck it up?
---
What's the difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?
---
I got a partial list currently.
---
Idk if it was instanced actually, only got there on p-servers where they had portals there heh :) so you're prob right
---
That's either a blatant lie, or completely ignorant. First of all, most servers were not as heavily favored towards horde as they are now. Secondly, back in the day when everything was new you didn't have the same focus on world pvp. You had some zoned which was basically an open BG, not like it is now.
---
Ok, we just killed 2 of the elites, which hit fairly hard.
---
I'd really just like some protections for the graveyard or rez sickness. It's really dumb when I can acknowledge, "okay I'm totally fucked in this spot and this guy will wreck me again. I'll just rez and call it." Only to get killed by 2-3 rogues chilling in the graveyard. 
---
At that point all I wanna do is hearth and regroup but I can't even do that. I might as well just log out since it's clear I'm just free honor points for half a dozen Horde players per spot on the map.
---
I bet a healer could solo heal UBRS without even talenting assuming they have good enough gear.
---
Wow. I mean, those sound like amazing modifications but I'd never survive in a game like that. I think the 27th time I lost all my stuff, I'd uninstall and go buy a colossal amount of beer to console myself.
---
Well once they level to 60 they will be able to farm gold more efficiently.
---
Late nights always make things more funny than they probably are
---
Random PvP encounters after dungeon runs is magic
---
Even if the difference is significant it will not necessarily allow you to make an edicated guess on the level of individuals.
---
Certain Statistics are great for some things but bad for others. And generalisations are often a missunderstanding of a statistics explanation value.

They is a difference between random names and random letter names. Bill bob bank vs gbcfgbvr

I bet the feel great about it too. "Yeah, we owned that guy!"

Get tallied weekly
---
Lolol all these comments saying otherwise are hilarious. I guess I forget how bad the internet is sometimes. Not like the game came out 15 years ago or anything.
---
ah I see. how much crit % is good? I have 31% crit with no buffs/talents
---
why would we give a fuck about any other server
---
Pixels are all that a "gaming organization" has.

Its a guild effort :) people are always happy to donate to the gbank

You. Are. Wrong.

And. Your. Post. Is. Buried. Because. Of. How. Wrong. You. Are.
---
&gt; garrote is PURELY better than cheap shot.
---
It awards less combo points, so not it isn't.
---
I wish there was a server type that was PvE 1-59 and PvP at max level. Otherwise I'll just stick with PvE.
---
Venruki pops a limited invuln pot here which is more expensive than a FAP.  
---
If you want to win you do what you you gotta do.
---
so all the players on pve servers have nothing to do in game because the only aspect of the game right now is pvp right? 
---
If you die to another player that is player vs player combat which is one of the allowed types of combat  on a pvp server, not sure why you are crying about that happening?
---
You’re welcome (:
---
Ah yes, name calling toward people who state facts.  
---
If you look at the servers that exist, it's not one of the options
---
So nothing got it
---
217 Mara runs no dagger.
---
Check: https://wowpop.appspot.com
---
Maybe the mak'gora thing is a good idea. Roam around looking for people level 60 or at least close to 60. Then /point and emote and shit to warn them, wait for them to heal back up. Then attack. It wouldn't be peaceful, but still way more honorable than normal and still reasonably effective at gaining honor.
---
This is sort of interesting, but it is kinda pointless right now for priests right? Just spamming the correct sized (as in the largest that wont overheal) heal in dungeons and Flash Heal in raids seems to be the best way to do things right?
---
Now this is quality content.
---
This was my favorite definition and factual part of CEH and security. A huge part of breaching can happen via social engineering and physical access.
---
And you're the idiot who doesn't see the skull on their nameplates
---
Thanks for the reply!  Great info.  Is LBRS AND UBRS both lvl 60 unlike BRD?  And you think it will take 5 60s to clear BRD?  thanks again.
---
I've never played a alliance warrior on vanilla, but DAMN can I imagine it must be fucking SEXY to have a paladin or two besides you. Fuck you mages, I got freedom for DAYS now...unless you run away, then I can't do shit. But still.
---
then let them quit, they should not have invested time into a pvp sever to start with.
---
It might have existed but not to this extent because people were clueless about the game and didnt specifically roll gnome for the 5%int, or horde only for the pvp racials.
---
A level 48 warrior should probably learn he's not ready to not be in searing gorge, but some people are slow learners
---
Yes. All rewards are permanent
---
I agree. 6 weeks ago I would of said it is dead but the transfers and people beginning to gain levels has really helped
---
I agree with everything you just said.
---
So.. whats his item flipping strat though?
---
When someone tells me
---
 "i'd kill for what you have" 
---
I get a little uncomfortable.
---
we wont have kids comming here to complain about wpvp on a pvp server if all you faction balance cry babies quit
---
An average player does not have engineering. Let's start there. 
---
I'm sure you know how vital that profession is to PvP and 1vX.
---
Looks like he wants to go fury in the end, so he wouldn’t be able to get the chest piece over the neck.
---
Isn’t NS a Druid spell though?
---
I still remember when I first rolled a mage and particulary Frost mage. It was in TBC and that swedish(?) mage named "Noone" playing on was it bg9? Holy SHIT was he good in wpvp and duels in general for that time. I dare to say he was prolly one of the top 5 best mages in the world at that time, not judging by arena rating though.
---
He also popped a limited invulnerability pot.
---
You chose to play on a PvP server.
---
You made your bed, now lie in it.
---
I think people here way overplay the "people picked Horde for pvp". I'm sure there are a small group of try hards that have done that, but have you ever thought that maybe, just maybe, more people just dislike Alliance?
---
I could never play Alliance and never have. Humans are boring. Night elves look like douches. Gnomes, do I even need to say anything else? Only 1 I could see myself playing in a fantasy game is Dwarf. But then I'd be surrounded by humans, NE's, and gnomes and that'd ruin my experience.
---
&gt; why would you Cheap Shot a mage with blink ready?
---
Is this a joke? If you don't force him to blink on the cheap shot then he's going to blink the kidney shot after. 
---
Besides, what other opener is there? Garrote is trash against mages with ice barrier and ice block, and only dagger rogues can even use ambush. Even if a sword rogue swapped his MH to a dagger, the ambush would hit abysmally low without the talents for it.
---
New flash, someone successful in WOW has zero life outside of basic responsibilities.
---
No joke my guild leader is on until 4am est and was one of the first to reach 60. I always wonder why and he never gives reasons but it’s pretty obvious.
---
It just happened to me this morning. I could hardly believe it myself.
---
What addon/addons is he using to:  
---
1. Show the buff/debuff timers under his target's frame
---
2. Show the debuff timer on his target's portait?
---
why do we need a suggestion, WHY do things have to change, why cant you accept this is how it is?
---
Ask him if he wants to, instead.
---
Were there ever queues on saturday? All the queues on my server were just at raid days.
---
Is this the same Venruki that used to play on Detheroc in vanilla?
---
it was never said this was going to be "authentic vanilla". as to the warping its probably just server lag,it happens...its been happening for over a decade.
---
People seem to be getting ~2.5k honor an hour out of it. Sure some stuff rogues can do might be more but for most people it's difficult to do better.
---
No, you still have to wait for the GCD. That's one full second for the mage to blink.
---
Yeah the rat guy, does spawn instantly in classic as well.
---
should i assume those camping my 47 warlock just cant do simple math, then? idk.
---
Yeah, guess it was bugged yesterday.
---
That makes things much nicer.
---
I can only play for 10 minutes per month, Blizz should have delayed phase 2 until 2030, I'm unsubbing
---
Its because of the importance of people's name. Like if you got that name you want which is highly sought after. Hell yeah people going to care about that level 16. Sunk cost has nothing to do with it at that point.
---
All you can do really is cheap shot, start bashing gouge and hope it works
---
Helicopter hair is the hidden OP racial
---
This response is redundant and doesn't offer any thing to the discussion. 
---
Just because it's "PVP" It doesn't mean that people don't have a right to discuss the zerg honor farming issues that is hardly PVP by the way. And because of a great faction inbalance between horde and alliance on most servers, It is beyond a joke. 
---
Most people who don't have a problem with it, are either delusional or Horde.
---
Extended Character Stats add-on is what I use.
---
That’s why bear tanks farm manual crowd pummelers.
---
Goooo venruki!!
---
I love wholesome WoW.
---
Just a guess but I'd imagine to discourage farming quest givers.
---
It gives AP too so...
---
As a warrior, the problem is the fact that he'll be rage starved
---
I'm personally playing spellpower ret (with Mcp), and my guild prefer giving 2 nightfalls to the offtanks
---
It really depends on if you want to dedicate someone to the job or not, but I think the offtanks having a decent Fury Gear would probably contribute more to the dps than giving them nightfall (and nightfall users don't stack well at all)
---
Also, playing paladin as a hybrid class worked very well for me during progress, for example, this week in mc, I dpsed on almost all bosses, taking the role of a mage when Magic effect was needed, and healing on ragnaros (melee + mana doesn't work well there :p), even if I don't have the dps of a Fury/rogue/mage, I bring nice things to the table that most guilds would benefit from (maybe not the top 1% who try to Speedrun MC in 20 minutes
---
For healer the only BiS is hammer of grace, the bracers from incendius and second bis are the gloves from princess because the atal al gloves are a bitch to get. And hammer of grace is a bitch to get so the staff from Emperor is nice.
---
He has a video of his specs on his YouTube channel, hes 17/0/34 I believe

Well, I've never had a garbanzo bean on my face.

Female undead here. Thresholds (flat semi-stairs between rooms) are the only really issue I've had, SM in particular. Once you get onto the first step, stairs aren't a problem. I don't PvP, so I can't help you there.

This is something I've just always thought was my clumsiness, lol, so it's nice to know it's not just me!

He's just biased, bro.

He's more than likely on a server with a great faction in balance and he is a horde more then likely.

No cross-realm BGs? Enjoy your 2 hour queues.

Well yes but am I really gonna use manual crowd pummeler running say DM east for instance of course not. That would be wasteful. So am looking to do whatever I can.

Ill check them out.  Cheers!!

You can do them all prior to 60, but for UBRS and LBRS 60 makes things a lot better.  As for BRD, the first few bosses are pretty easily farmable, but the last half is not so much (yes of course it's possible, but not like arena or angerforge farm).  To get through the last half it just helps for everyone sanity if you don't have any lower level players with you.  The last room before the emperor (the lyceum) can be pretty rough and you need AOE.  It gives me a headache just thinking about BRD honestly, a lot of people really love that place but it's always a beatdown to me.  You need to loot an item towards the end of BRD for MC attunement too btw.

In mid scale PvP I'v made the same experience as warrior with BRE.
---
I just charge and before anyone else can touch the target I've tunneled 2-3k damage into them, so they are left with 10% health. Now the other may pick him up but I secured the 85-95 honor for me and my shaman buddy who I need often enough once the alliance fights back and we have to actually do something for our honor.
---
Also worth mentioning that once you reach a rank, and buy the rewards, even if you stop PVPing and decay down to scout/private, you can equip the PVP gear you've bought. And you keep your title.
---
mages are abominable easy to play
---
Ah, you're right, there!  
---
Even so, I'd say that Garrote damage is worth 1 CP
---
Does baby need a diaper change?
---
I reached rank 11 in vanilla without a dedicated group (although I did run WSG with a dedicated group 2-3 nights a week at rank 10). I just played alot. Hit 60 in December 2005, started pvp'ing mid january at rank 2-3 or so and hit rank 11 somewhere in early april.
---
Helped being 15 years old and being able to pvp 40-50 hours a week, plus 6-8 hours raiding. Sadly im finding myself unable to put in 8 hours on average each day every day now... 2 months before BC hit I had like 140d played on my warrior and 20~ on my druid within a 16 month time (including around 3 month breaks/vacations/school trips).

No Blizzard should Not have done anything to offer some players a balanced server because the majority of players went horde because they knew they would find a numbers advantage on open world pvp. (if this was a "classic Wotlk" server it would be alliance having the numbers advantage and cry baby horde would be here bitching like you guys)
---
On my first UBRS run, we had Jed, and Briarwood Reed dropped. I won the roll against 3 other mages.
---
So.... one.
---
&gt;level on a more balanced/alliance friendly server
---
Balance doesn't have much to do it. I'm alliance on heartseeker (was something like 83:17 alliance to horde a week ago before transfers) and horde are still just roaming around ganking lowbies in quest areas. There is some even play wPVP going on but the majority I come across is still 60's camping quest NPC's and the like. It'll die down in a couple weeks once everyone realizes they aren't going to be some pvp champion.
---
Never leave home without PW:S on

Wow. No. Not at all.

my rogue farm alt got it with 53  in a quest run  first  time nobody needed it

my warrior  took 7 trys

the warrior i helped farm took 96 trys
---
Unfortunately, it is how PvP has been on private servers, and there isn't really anything that can be done about that.
---
I played Pservers for the last 5 years, all PvP since there were no other options. It was a ganking hell, likely even worse than Classic since guards seem to have better vision than pservers had. I remember getting camped by rogues inside towns, and just having to log off because I couldn't leave a town while they were playing. You'd maybe get a lucky kill off on one player, and suddenly a guild has shown up to push your face into the dirt. It only takes a few assholes to completely ruin your night or even your week. When Classic came out, I breathed a sigh of relief that I could finally roll on a PvE server, and haven't had any problems since.
---
No this data would not be in the original cd:s, because its server side, not client.

You can do lasher farms as a priest using holy nova. You need about 6400 mana. It's really easy and you can make pretty good gold doing it.

Sounds like a SHIT communist realm to me, fuck that.

Plus the zg tiger + raptor mounts, aswell as the elusive scarab lord battle tank.

such a redundant biased response from a horde.
---
You easily dont run out of mana spaming Flash Heal in MC.
---
Unless you are a mage, what class would even need to do that
---
Not sure what people use. My server Smolderwebb seems to be pretty balanced. I see bigger groups of both horde and alliance.
---
ITT: Rogues who are shit
---
Yeah open world pvp, you run into one horde you might kill him once, next time he gets you.
---
Thats fun!

Having an open orgy where the only hole getting stretched is your anus by 50 hordes. Is . Not. Fun.
---
Amazing, thanks for sharing! This is a community !
---
I only vaguely know the different versions of AV. 
---
Can someone describe what this version will include or how does one find the info?

I got remote desktop to avoid login queues, so I too support this.

What is the name of the addon that shows the arrows to target? I need that in my life!
---
Same to you, my filthy Horde friend.
---
I believe it's best to have a 60 not in your group, killing the mobs that you do damage to first. But someone else will need to confirm.
---
I did Jed/Rend 6man runs as healer at lvl 58-59 and that was okay exp imho.
---
Why wouldnt he just alt f4?
---
Camp him with guards and you can ransom him.
---
Is there another dps trinket besides HOJ, blackhand's breadth, and rune of the guard captain?   I took the armor trinket, and farming HOJ is cancer.
---
I don't think people sign up on a pvp server just to be ganked constantly. I did it because I like the idea of PVP happening more regularly. Having a random quest NPC camped for hours on end isn't entertaining at all and isn't what PVP is suppose to be.
---
My nose might've rotted off but that smells like a load of baloney.
---
I've heard that there is a way to do it with tagging and good mob density but I don't know the details.
---
This so fucking much. Against a good mage you know there will be a blink after the opener. So gouge. 
---
Shouldn't be a thing, but thanks to glorious Blizzard tech the mage _can_ blink and will stand gouged at his destination. 
---
WoW doesn't follow a logical "either the blink is first, thus the gouge is out of range or the gouge is first, thus the mage cannot blink".
---
LUL
---
All skull level horde rogues imagine my shock lmao
---
Hoj: 77, then b2b at 124 and 125 for 2 mates i helped out
---
SGC: stopped counting after 150...
---
you cant think out of the box it seems, go back to your books
---
Twink items! A lot of the popular ones are oversaturated and stay pretty expensive but some of the lesser known ones will get posted for a couple gold when they can sell for a lot more. A week ago there were a handful of Thorbia’s gloves going for 5-6g, i bought them all and resposted them for 25-30g. They all sold within a few days. Easy gold.
---
Ita not, there is something funky in that name , probably some cirilic letter that looks the same or smthing
---
This is bugged. When i equip valor bracers my hit stays at 4%, when i requip my bracers with 1% hit stat it shows my totat hit at 3%.
---
Because it's a pvp server and the game has war in its name.
---
I play rogue because I couldn’t get pas level 25 ten years ago :-)
---
This problem applies to both factions as I stated in the post. There are just more horde dominant PvP servers and I can only talk from the perspective of alliance
---
Change your name to kidtheaverage, there’s video recording of it having been done by a 44 mage
---
Venruki frequently says this
---
Just ignore these people. Don't repost videos like this showing them and their sponsors, don't write about them on the internet for upvotes, don't virtue signal about how you think this guy is bad and ninja'ing is wrong as if you have some hot take about the incident.
---
Being toxic on the internet is today's evolution of the early 2000's trash reality TV, and every time you spread awareness about them they just get more popular and make more money.
---
This is actually one of the main reasons ive been thinking of switching to a RPPvE server, so that i can actually play the fucking game in peace.
---
Also remember that we have 1.12 talents . Id like to see a full mc raid with the first patch. Probably not that fucking easy
---
Actually I played vanilla, South Shore kill trading was a thing back then.
---
But if the OP got the recipe as a drop your entire point is moot.
---
gluck you are the man, my guild uses this now. thanks for your hard work :D also it has eu incase anyone is wondering
---
because that wouldn't be fun
---
Definitely not worth killing the death lashers as you said they kinda smash and take a while to kill for not really any benefit.
---
AAP Azeroth auto pilot.  Helps if you are leveling a character really fast.  Can be a bit weird at times.  It is very good for lvl 1-30
---
Do alliance have any sort of benefit over horde in PVP? Seems incredibly unfair
---
people post it for 600-1000 all the time, but i dont think it sells for more than 500
---
Frost Reflector?
---
If you're gonna PvP as a warrior engineering is a must imo
---
Ah gotcha!  I usually get lost as soon as the PVP starts and have no idea what happened when its all over.
---
Paladin.  
---
There's even a guide for porno-paladin that explain how you could play pala with one hand, while watching porn :)
---
Hunter trying to beat casters by melee 
---
????????????
---
Here's the worst part about it. Redridge is a contested zone... barrens isn't :( Stonetalon is near impossible to even get to as alliance and has no quests, horde have a free ride in comparison for a long while.
---
Yeah I've been calling for BG's since launch. I knew phase 2 honor system without BG's would be a disaster.
---
As the others mentioned you don’t have to put in the rank. Sometimes you will want to though. Lower ranks cost less for casters so they use multiple ranks. 
---
Hope you are getting by by now. I don’t tank much. People tend to be rude and always in a hurry. :(
---
From what I have read on a few different sites , it does slightly increase the attack speed in bear form . I haven’t tried it personally .
---
True true. If the warrior can get the jump initially and burst down immediately that’s the only reliable play. We can stack a few stuns and interrupts and if you’re geared out well, guaranteed to crit and burst a couple k. Of course when you add potions and grenades to both sides it gets tricky
---
I remember old scholo basement and Rattlegore one-shotting tanks
---
southern entrance is camped, horde FP is closer than alliance FP
---
Can you suggest me a good warlock streamer where I can learn how to pvp?
---
yes the counterweight works. my cat form attack speed is 0.97 on the character sheet. i've read a couple places that weightstones also work, but i haven't tested it myself. i use them all the time lol... just not sure if they do anything. 
---
also don't forget gift of arthas pots: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9088/gift-of-arthas
---
165 was our guildie rogue's attempt if I remember correctly.
---
Probably huh, I figure by then warlocks and shadow priests will be scarier than rogues. Ofc mage instant fireballs 1 shot too.
---
? You know you aren't expected to write back every time right. If I'm whispering a tank I don't get offended if they don't reply... I just take that as a no.
---
Awesome.  Thanks!
---
Alright if I changed what I wrote to spec instead of class my point still stands.
---
Mama potions, plain and simple.
---
Bruh moment
---
Run nothing but mages, priests, and paladins...claim to be good.   /facepalm.

That's right, Totally slipped my mind. Thanks fam.
---
It's beautiful! The way the moon reflects of the sand is brilliant.
---
Married with 1 kid and Im 34 years old I just log in during raid time then never log in agaim until next raid
---
Why flash heal in raids? I only use flash heal if there is chance of death, otherwise I stick with heal/greater heal.
---
Here's the thing, I chose a PVE server from the very beginning because PvP in WoW is terrible. It's completely imbalanced, as the game was designed to be balanced around PvE. Congratulations, you made the terrible decision to participate in a structure the game was not designed for. The way I see it, you either make the intelligent decision to move to a PvE server, or you quit. Either way, quit whining about PvP destroying PvE content. You all made the decision, now either live with it, or bend yourself and move/quit. I have no sympathy.
---
I'm not being emotional about this, and I don't really care about being disagreed with. I was able to make an informed decision that PVP servers would be hell after Honor was released. Everyone could've as well.
---
Those kind of people exist in both factions but I agree with you that it's more prevalent in horde players.
---
[Who would have thought that people attracted to "savage" races would behave like savages?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.png)
---
Thats dumb as fuck, play on zandalar tribe.
---
You've made it clear you want it harder for me to play to "balance" the game. You aren't going to want to try to have this discussion because you haven't thought about it for half a second. All you care about is your experience, you don't give a damn about mine.
---
So yes make it so I can't play so I have to transfer and then I still can't play because they're more Horde and great you get to have a better experience while I'm forced to wait in queues, join shithole Alliance, or quit.
---
So no thanks, I'd rather keep killing you until you quit since my options seem to be me or you quit and right now you quitting is on the table while your "solution" is me quitting.
---
I only say it because I remember just battling my way past elites as a mage only to find nothing there and wondering what the point of it was
---
&gt; If I pick up skinning and herbalism, and pick up everything I can, will I be able to afford all my skills and buy a mount by lvl 40?
---
Prices of noob-items are very low. You will be selling herbs/skins to vendor.  
---
Don't worry about getting mount at level 40, you will get it around 42-43. Past level 40 gold become plenty.  
---
At 42 there's 5 quests in Uldaman, each give 2-3 gold reward and an item that you could sell for 1-2 gold.
---
Because healing is mega boring and easy atm. So to not fall asleep you try to top the healing meters and Flash Heal is the best way to do that.
---
Yor best bet is to advertise in game, more people I’ll see it there then on reddit.
---
I personally love PvP but I don't enjoy 90% of world PvP. The only joys I'd get were from ganking which I'd rarely do and having larger fights near a dungeon or something. I have never experienced Tauren Mill vs Southshore, that might be fun, but I am only level 56 right now and still just leveling and getting bis gear. Anyway after playing on a private server I got sooooooo tired of world pvp. Gank squads and campers and what not really killed how much fun I had playing in the open world. I like PvPing on my time and doing battlegrounds, so thats why I decided to play on a PvE server.
---
I've ran it twice. Seen the Reed. 5 rolled on it lmao.
---
only in australia
---
Warmode=Hordemode, the faction imbalance is just fucking enormous. Also because of sharding it's essentially a faction based Queue. If you are alliance oyu are ALWAYS in a shard wit horde, period. Horde? there's so many of you it puts you into shards without alliance at all because the rest all have their horde pop limit.
---
No.. not all kills are the same
---
There no reason to be snarky, I'm aware you aren't the person I was directly referring to. I guess 'THEY' would've been a better choice of word.
---
People wanted the quasi vanilla release schedule. Honor came before BG :(
---
I'm feeling the same way. Looking at doing a paladin alt and doing tanking / healing dungeon spam to level up. 
---
I think that should be totally possible. And if doing any tanking I think rushing for Consecration is the way to go. 
---
I'm just a tad worried Im going to be jealous of warriors and I don't want to regret it.
---
It is cheating
---
Oh wauw that looks soooo much like my vanilla prirst!
---
Touché
---
It's called Discipline priest for a reason
---
Probably wanted to see what they were doing
---
I am in a 50/50 server tbh
---
&gt;The horde only had a tiny population advantage
---
No, it STARTED with a tiny population advantage. Just like retail, it snowballed to a shitshow.
---
But alas, I'm a female night elf hunter.  I believe horde like to kill them more than most, I chose this by design
---
&gt; mind numbing
---
Does that even exist in classic?
---
Don’t blame me because you wan’t to play the game on easy mode.
---
Druid Healer, rings available to me are Fordring's Seal, Rosewine Circle, and Seal of the Archmagus. What 2 should I use?
---
Also, is the 5 piece T1 set worth replacing gear with more +healing with Cenarion pieces?
---
The single life may be tempting, but trust me when i say that it's get lonely super quick
---
Snutz
---
Only half useful. If using the most efficient spell means you have to cast it 4 times to heal someone, that means you get to mp5 a lot later and waste mana.
---
My rule of thumb is:
---
No +heal means higher rank is more efficient between ranks of the same spell
---
\+heal means lower rank is more efficient between ranks of the same spell
---
Always use the higher rank as long as you dont overheal.
---
pvp was the only reason i even play classic, its just before honor i didnt really care to focus as much energy as i do now
---
instead of just saying no?
---
It's worth it if you give her ponytails because of the healing animation
---
Once someone buys the recipe it goes on cooldown and will respawn after x amount of time. Winterspring is infamous for having a bunch of people using macro and timers to buy up recipes wanted by alchemist/tailorers and reselling on AH for a profit.
---
You'd be better off just buying it from AH.
---
The r10 gear is equal to the stuff you can already acquire.
---
Compare savage gladiator chain vs blue pvp chest
---
Cloudkeeper Legplates vs blue pvp legs.
---
Lionheart or T2 head vs blue pvp head.
---
Flameguard gauntlets vs blue pvp hands.
---
It's more a sidegrade sacrificing damage to gain survivability like savage gladiator chain giving more crit, but blue PvP chest giving more health and armor.
---
They're just as guilty.
---
Lvl it to 5 so you can disenchant
---
The deadmines secret "was likely a level designer fooling around" according to John Staats, former 3d artist for classic. 
---
He also stated that it was probably created within 3-5 minutes and forgotten about.
---
Let's not forget about this zone above Dire Maul and below Desolace, which is actually drawn on some of the early promotional maps of the zones, but lied dormant until the Cataclysm when it was essentially sunk and an island created in the middle - https://wow.tools/maps/Kalimdor/6/8/-74.322/59.875
---
Your entire argument is "But Vanilla was like this! They should have known! Everyone told them!"
---
But Vanilla wasn't like this, and there's been no precedent for this.
---
Thanks for being willing to answer questions!
---
I am a 55 Sub/As Rogue (hemo). I’m also a huge noob - never played before this release. 
---
I have Gut Ripper now but want to know when I should abandon it and what I should be looking to trade it for?
---
Yeah I'm on kromkrush alliance and it feels like horde are overpowering 10:1
---
&gt; Go on twitch and watch the guys from Apes stream
---
Actually, they're being fed HK's by viewers pretty heavily.
---
So they could have implemented a BG aswell or something? 
---
Its stupid the whole world is big gank zone right now.
---
The game runs on modern client and server infrastructure. What you are seeing are the shards. Zones are on different shards to spread the load. When you cross from one to the next there is a bit of lag. Try crossing into BRM when there are a few raids battling and you really notice the stutter.
---
People have been trying to sell for 1k on my server for like 2 weeks, nothing. It’s worth around 500-750

---
Not in my wildest dreams was that even going to be a thing : entire zones camped so hard that you can't go 15 seconds without getting ganked 10v1. Entire raids of people camping so hard you can't even take a step after ressing before you die again. And this going on for entire days, maybe months ? I suppose we'll see.
---
It was just common sense to me that this wasn't ever going to be a thing. How would Blizzard let their players get camped like this ? Where's the fun in that ? Who would even design something like this ? I know, it's a 15 year old game, and it's nochanges, but I'd never played vanilla before, so I had no idea.
---
I don't think it's that unbelievable that some people might just be going in blind and assuming that the game is not going to punish them so much for deciding to go on a pvp realm that they are **literally going to get killed *hundreds of times* in unfair, hopeless fights just for trying to travel around the world**. I'd say it's almost common sense that a game wouldn't do this to you. Hence there was no need to make sure that this wouldn't happen. Do you follow my logic ?
---
The recipe is not listed on the ah though ...
---
Depends on whether or not it breaks through the ice barrier
---
I would have trolled them and DCed once we arrived in Iron Forge.  :P
---
You are putting words in my mouth. Do better.
---
No they won’t. Keep dreaming
---
Facts.
---
Outland existing isn't the problem.
---
Its stuff like Draenia and their spaceships that felt out of place.
---
I made a pretty extreme example with the 1/3rd queue. It’s likely be much much less than that on most servers.
---
Your server clearly isn’t very out of balance if you think it comes down to simply “feeling safe questing.” 
---
I’m talking about every single alliance outpost and town being 100% camped by Horde. 
---
-I’m talking about them not leaving capitol cities. 
---
-Dying 20+ times to get from thorium point to MC.
---
-Literally ever Square inch of all contested zones swarmed with Horde gankers.
---
-Gadzetzan and Booty Bay so overwhelmed by Horde pvpers that the goblin guards can’t even put a dent in their numbers.
---
-None is this happened on this scale during actually vanilla. Hindsight gave us the ability to know the value and longevity of the PVP Rewards.
---
Tons of alliance already left when they opened transfers, making the imbalance worse. Sooner or later they will all quit or change realms, and the Horde are starting to realize this. I love actual pvp but this is just genocide. And I don’t want to see my server pvp completely die when the Alliance is completely gone (this phenomena is WELL documented on retail realms).
---
So yes, I’d wait in a queue and avoid all of this, and I dare say it would be a massive improvement.
---
It’s almost as if some of you guys trust Blizzard’s judgement.
---
They dont neccesary have to be bots. I dont fight back, i dont hide or move when i get attacked by an enemy player. I play on a pvp realm because of friends and i certainly dont care if i get ganked or not. I just relieve my spirit, run to my corpse and revive, just to continue fighting mobs. If you camp me, i log off. Simple as that, maybe these 'bots' just have the same mindset.
---
World PVP would be so much nicer if 60s only gained honor from ganking other 60s. Let everybody else quest for fuck sake.
---
Yes “ALLIANCE IS SHIT AND UGLY LOL” is a fantastic discussion how could I be so dumb. Sorry about that
---
Have fun in your massive raid groups getting 5 honor per kill and wondering why you’re still rank 3 five months after the honor system came out.
---
It wasnt that bad as an orc. It had nothing on the water totem
---
Here's a fact, you're a toxic cunt hiding behind a keyboard, getting brave because anonymity. Now fuck off.
---
Oh yea and the post has 20k upvotes. And a derail thread in the comments about Asmongold
---
as of right now there is nothing better for alliance to do that is remotely reliable for the majority of pvp servers.  we wont know what is best for at least a week.
---
What about people wearing leveling greens vs people in raid gear? The difference between them is much higher than between a fresh 60 and a 59.
---
"Literally a riot"
---
You don't know what "literally"  nor "riot" means.
---
I’m horde on netherwind, syndicate is so shit I don’t even think they’ve cleared MC. Leave and let their failure be your revenge
---
Isnt it like that? If you stealth the whole time spy will only pop up if you were targetable.
---
This isn't even remotely correct.
---
I thought I was pretty lucky getting the Eye of Divinity off my first Majordomo kill at level 57 and my Eye of Shadow off the first elite mob my party killed in Winterspring. I got Benediction around the same time I got rid of Belt of Arugal.
---
The "didn't research" argument is pretty ridiculous. Of course I didn't research, because I played on pvp servers from Vanilla to wrath! I was there. And um, yeah, it wasn't like this. No, I never played on private servers, but I think it was perfectly reasonable for me to assume I knew what to expect based on years and years of playing the normal game.
---
He won't even kill his subscription for that so its just empty words.
---
&gt;Fucking where?
---
You probably never saw our posts because we all got downvoted to shit for pointing this out.
---
&gt;If anyone expected this, no ally player would have rolled a pvp server.
---
I'm Alliance, I did expect this, therefore I rolled a PvE server.
---
Mald man bad
---
This is what you wanted, danger around the corner, unexpected fights that you may not win (or can't win). Sometimes you gank, sometimes you get ganked, it's the way it is.
---
&gt;danger around the corner, 
---
Every corner every time.
---
&gt;fights that you may not win (or can't win)
---
What? You are getting ganked, you cant win
---
&gt;sometimes you get ganked
---
Nope, 11 corpse run and not even outside searing gorge.
---
There is a difference between world pvp and gay orgy.
---
By how much you think? Because I’m horde Incendius and it seems pretty damn even in my eyes.
---
Same! Last night post Ragnaros we flagged up and poked the guards in Tauren Mill until they came and fought us for about an hour
---
Posts like these should get you perma banned in game.
---
Reroll when you don't feel like playing PvP. That's the point of PvP servers, you're committing yourself to FFA open PvP without getting to back out when you want.
---
buy high sell low I think.
---
BRD loot:
---
When you need them: ~70-200 runs.
---
After you get them: the next run as well, for someone’s first run. And then the 3rd run down the line for DE.
---
Vid has to be staged there's no explanation to how bad these rogues are.
---
I think he meant to say Angwe
---
Frost nova - cone of cold dead. Such skill! Many Wow!
---
&gt;This is the equivalent of saying you signed up for a martial arts class with sparring, so don't complain that 20 black belts are punching you unconscious every time you wake up.
---
&gt;The game is broken and largely unplayable for those of us on substantially unbalanced servers.
---
This is how PvP servers have been since forever... that's why I rolled PvE.
---
The complaints are obviously assuming a PVP scenario.
---
R.I.P. brethren, for your ancestors will remember this day.
---
For the horde!
---
I said this for two years prior to release hoping in vain that someone from Blizzard might see that little bit of support for the idea and talk it up in the planning sessions. 
---
Unfortunately it is now too late to implement queues. Blizzard chose to mandate massive unfairness for Alliance by not preemptively balancing factions but that doesn't mean that Horde players deserve to not be able to log in anymore.
---
They're just trash. 3v1 a lvl 48 for Honor?
---
Yikes.
---
Thats assuming it is always going for 800g.
---
You seem to still not get it. At all. There are more Horde overally because they are unappeal, NO WHERE did I even say ugly. What is the point of you pretending you care about this "discussion" when you clearly don't care at all?
---
All you care about is your personal experience. You'd make an entire faction be physically unable to play or have to join a side they don't want to or quit just so you don't have to quit.
---
No thanks, I shouldn't be punished for your bad tastes.
---
Oh yeah just keep trusting Blizzards judgement, see where that gets you. 
---
Oh wait we already know! Cata, MoP, WoD and BFA!
---
I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you'll have a much easier life just healing off-spec and then rerolling in your 50s. My Shadow Priest has healed everything through ZF with absolutely no issues. You wouldn't even know I'm not specced to heal except for the lack of disc/holy talent-specific abilities.
---
They are also a lot easier to spot by a glance..
---
This is great, made me smile irl
---
There's tons of alliance doing the same thing. Groups of mages sitting at FPs in tanaris and winterspring that chain sheep you until honorless goes away and insta killing you. Large zerg groups roaming EPL and ungoro. To say that horde does it more is misguided, it's just that there's more of us, same percentages I'd be willing to bet.
---
That’s a stupid assumption, though. *Every bank alt must have bank in the name or it’s some kind of bot!* like I said, many people have ageahahjavs bank alts.
---
Agreed.
---
True ^^
---
Yeh i don't take it literally, just a weird sentence to me.
---
Couldnt have said it better
---
I told my friends no way would I come to a pvp server since they'd all quit anyway. Guess what my friends all quit before 60 and I'm all nice and cozy on my pve server.
---
Nope, it can detect youre close even if you cant see or target the player, we've tried.
---
Armorsmith for sure, you have many armor slots but 1 weapon slot
---
Did you not read the rules of the sub reddit, this whole thread is toxic
---
Lol, should have rolled on a pve server
---
NEVER EVER take a spirit healer res either. You /will/ be immediately killed. Every single gy has been camped on a large majority of servers by about 10-15 people. Usually mages ready to spam AE.
---
Can a mind controlled player take a mage portal from the faction that mind controlled him?
---
PvP is like sex, it's better with mutual consent.
---
I mean, your whole argument is moot. Paying customers already wait in artificial queues of 1000+ regularly. I waited in queues of over 20,000 at one point. Completely artificial queues made for the betterment of the game - you know, exactly like what I’m arguing for.
---
Try again.
---
I've never once said this happened in vanilla because it didn't. I said it's happened on PRIVATE SERVERS for more than a decade. Roaming gank squads have been a thing on those servers since I could remember. To say there's no precedent for this is completely false.
---
Half your server can no longer log in because there aren't enough alliance!
---
I'm getting absolutely dumpstered by anybody who attacks me while playing holy paladin unless I have people with me. While leveling I had 31 points into Ret and it wasn't too bad but it's not like I had a lot of success either.
---
 I think i enjoy playing with that 5% spell crit and improved auras in PvE more than I enjoy a bit faster kill times on mobs out in the world and the maybe 50/50 chance at winning a 1v1 in world PvP.(plus I didn't take engineering, I like herbalism/alchemy)
---
I just want to know what I can do as holy to defend myself better. Is there a shield that's especially good for me? All this cloth healing gear I've been collecting is worth crap outside an instance but plate armor is hard to come by especially if I have to collect an entire other set of armor.
---
Any advice from other paladin players would be appreciated and I know i should have prob expected this when I rolled a healer but it's what I like:(
---
I used to just mass fear people coming out of dungeons so they couldn't get back in. I never thought to use MC before. Thanks for the tip!
---
Activison does not know good game design. Classic+ would without a doubt, inevitably fail.
---
*yanks braid* LANGUAGE
---
Can mind controlled players equip or unequip any items, such as weapons?
---
raid log/ swap servers ? blizz couldn't care more since they stay subbed , only thing that would hurt them is people unsubscribing
---
Consumes, bis gear, epic mount, engi consumes are expensive, arcanite reaper for pvp

Too many 8th graders playing fury war and refusing to tank

Like I said, I am Horde and would rather wait in a long queue that exist in the current state of WPvP. 
---
I think all of these detractors play one PVE servers, or they are forever lvl 46 rogues that just camp newbs in STV.
---
You seem like the type of person that has genuine hate for alliance and thinks the horde vs alliance war is real. Thats why I don’t want this discussion. You’re biased beyond any neutral discussion about this so why even have it?
---
I mean, you know all of these things. Why would you not re-roll on a PvE server or the better question is why didn’t you do that from the beginning? I genuinely don’t get why people are so salty about all of this, it’s what they signed up for whether it be knowingly or unknowingly. There was plenty of time and more than enough information out there for people to understand that this WOULD happen.
---
It sucks. It does suck, but you can’t just complain until you get your way when there was adequate time, information, and other options at your disposal to avoid this. 
---
PvP is happening on a PvP server, suck it up hire down and keep trucking or do something else. Easy.
---
Searing gorge, brm at times,  and hillsbrad after 1am
---
They rushed everything except for our key rings!
---
clockwork
---
Srsly. South shore is like 20v100 everyday.
---
To be clear I HAD a plan to hit 60 before phase 2 and then get better at pvping but then they announced it to release earlier than expected and I knew I was fucked.
---
Cause you have no need. As someone who dives I can tell you that it is not an impossible task to be underwater.
---
Now maybe some people were dropped on their heads as children and are forever damaged. To that I cant say
---
Is there any way to see a list of all the people and their spot on the rank point ladder?
---
This is amazing
---
I dunno man if any furried characters are cute. If u think some of them are sexy than yo ushould visit some specialist, because you might have bestiality and acts of it are illegal in most of countries.
---
Does having players in rp servers mean they're furries ? As far as I know hordes are repeating that:"Imagine playing rpg game and choosing human". So I am concerned there is some lack of consistency in your logic. You play rpg, but not on rp server, but you choose horde character, becaue it is rpg.
---
And is there something wrong with older guys that  want to feel the game they're playing ? Is somethinh wrong with rp ?
---
How do you balance factions?
---
Are you one of the dozens of alliance who I've jumped into the far side of the lava in BRM?
---
I don't know any good guilds for pvp, most are raiding but you can always ask in /join world.  If you want a really great pvp experience from alliance side grobbulus is fairly even faction wise but alliance favored because they're vastly more organized
---
You can't compare vanilla to classic.  Classic is a whole different beast. In vanilla, you were up against mostly scrubs and people that had no clue about the game and didn't grind their butts off.  In classic, the majority of the playerbase is hardcore nerds that know the game in and out.
---
Yah, you might as well have just rolled a druid and prayed you found a group that was willing to take you.
---
Yeah that's what I'm talking about.
---
That said, it's come to my understanding that when the honor system was released in vanilla, the same kind of thing might've happened. Blizz might have released battlegrounds for the express purpose of dragging pvp enthusiasts out of zones and into instances where they could slaughter each other and get their pvp ranks without having to shit on everyone else.
---
But I don't know how true that claim is. In any case, for me who started playing in tbc, I've never seen anything like this, and I could've never imagined I was signing up for it when I rolled on a pvp realm. I visited this subreddit a lot and took in a lot of info from youtube vids etc... and I didn't see anyone talk about this. But maybe the only explanation I need is that I'm mega entitled ?
---
Because people like you can’t grasp the concept of griefing vs PvP
---
Swedish king once again. "Kungen" making lots of nice meme pictures on this sub lately
---
That seems so dull, what’s even the point of playing if you’re not even playing
---
Okay :)
---
Thanks nostalrius and their fanboys for making Blizzard think we wanted supermassive servers that totally skew the balance of the game. Thanks J.A.B for still assuming people wanting Classic was just a fad so the population would've dwindled to next to nothing by the time P2 hits, so merging of layers would've happened ages before P2 because of a lack of people. I'm loving Classic but tbh also hoping for a sort of seasonal system so we can have a bit of a do-over and not repeat these mistakes that have tainted the game.
---
I use 4 and 8. Never run out on all the short fights. Only on rag at the end I start using efficient heals.
---
Very little gear for tanks, its a shit show with pugs as they all seem to be blind and clicking their spells
---
There's a term for this
---
Even BFA had tons of ideas better than the one you suggested
---
Couldn't you look like this in retail?
---
Ya very true.

sorry, but I reserved that strat.
---
I was replying to the OP regarding world pvp.
---
You say that as if you don't understand that being physically disoriented means having lost your sense of direction. That doesn't happen to you in these situations. Great. Not everyone has the same experience.
---
:)
---
same. still at 0.
---
Would it surprise you that some of these things aren't actually wrong. There are 'boss level monsters' that get skulls and monsters that just had a skull to obscure their level back in vanilla. Some of them are correct level but no longer have the obfuscation.
---
Arcanite transmutes only go for 5g.
---
Transmuting undeath to water is a profit of 15g at least.
---
Point is, it's a much better moneymaker than arcanite transmute
---
I’ve been leveling my Paladin as retribution. I use a 2H. Questing is decent, and I win most of my 1v1 unless I’m ganged up on. Unless you want to spend all your time in dungeons, You might want to wait till 60 to go holy.
---
In groups yes. But not for random people you're not in a group with.
---
I’ve never realised this, is it a rank 1 frostbolt opener because it’s a shorter cast time to get the chilling effect on them for easier kiting?
---
It’s such a minor increase really.. youre not there to dps anyways. Maul produces so much threat it only take one or two per mob to hold aggro. 
---
Maul everyone and spam swipe. Faerie fire every time it’s up.
---
I definitely think they'll do a seasonal style with Classic. Even if they do Classic+ or TBC as well. 
---
Fresh servers going from Phase 1 every now and again is a nice way to keep it fresh for people who like vanilla the best and would also be good for people who joined late and missed the original first crazy weeks.
---
Looks like Dina from the show Superstore
---
don't be whipped
---
Also the number of people that think you're a cool guy.
---
Still does not solve the issue
---
I really recommend grabbing pieces for tank or ret spec. Stamina/strength or agi plate or mail gear. Just roll need on stuff in dungeons or solo and you'll collect good pieces over time.
---
I have 2 sets of gear for all 3 of my characters (heal/tank gear for my paladin and druid, and raid/pvp gear for my mage). You gear your primary first, and then usually people are chill about you needing on gear for an off spec. If it's a cranky group I'll offer to pay vendor price for it to whoever wins a seperate roll
---
I am 60 that's why I went full holy. Ideally I'd like to make it work outside of dungeon/raid too so I dont have to have wasted points in ret that only are useful on the off chance i get attacked by only one person(often times its roaming death squads)
---
I assure you it's real. If I wanted to fake it I could just get a guildmate or friend to trade me 70g and take a screenshot of that, so it's not like a screenshot proves anything.
---
The Asmonrogues
---
Standard opener against mage is to run in from behind and CS and just keep running ahead of them to gouge them where they blink to.  Then you get into the game of good mages learning to save their blink.
---
There isn't sharding in classic lmao, they replace shards with layers which are now gone
---
reminder that AQ40 event exists
---
Yo dick hard when you see someone who doesn't click his spells kid
---
How the fuck do people ask the same questions 900 times. Jesus.
---
I’m at like 550 from an hour or two of hillsbrad vs south shore. Probably not much honor points because it’s split between full raid but it’s not hard to get the number up there.
---
Travel in groups, run BRD, bring everything you need for a few runs (don't worry about bagspace, there's a vendor in the guzzler).
---
If you're a stealth class, stealth everywhere, it will likely actually be faster than corpse hopping.
---
Because it is.  Nobody be payin 70g.
---
honestly yea unless your some poor kid who wouldn't know any better you should have enough common sense not to fall for this
---
I hope they allow refugee transfers to PvE. I never played vanilla, and I had no idea it would be this ridiculous. Game is straight up, not fun.
---
The I guess we played indifferent private servers. People knew to avoid even being near flight paths because you'd be camped until you managed to corpse crawl far enough away to avoid the gankers.
---
I lived it. It sucked, that's why I chose PvE.
---
I would pay 1k for this
---
pvp server get good or stay bad. thanks for the honor alliance pissant
---
From the WoW Manual:
---
&gt;Dishonor Points
---
&gt;Even among enemies as bitter as the Horde and the Alliance, there is honor. If you flaunt this honor and engage in objectionable PvP play, such as killing new players vastly inferior to you in level, or killing essential non-combat NPCs such as flight masters or quest givers, you will earn dishonor. If you accumulate enough dishonor through your criminal actions, you will be branded an outlaw. As a consequence, you'll suffer experience penalties, lose access to your own faction cities, and become so hated even by your own kind that every faction NPC will attack you on sight.
---
&gt;sucks having no girl in your life with no chance because you never leave your house and online dating is toxic as fuck
---
I feel this so much. My friends parents in highschool called me an "old soul". I eventually got so sick of the social media facebook twitter life that I deleted it. It just wasn't doing me any favors and actually had a negative impact on my mental health because I always compared my life with my friend's fake lives they posted to social media. 
---
So here I'm at 25 years old with no social media and when I ask my friends to help me meet someone their responses to me are always "try tinder".
---
Why would I try Tinder when it's all the same fake crap I just got away from?
---
Me - Decided to quit playing a game because the timeline is rushed and I ha e several other games to play.
---
Blizzard - Setting up to a majority of their subscribers and lose hundreds of thousands of potential profit.
---
Yeah, I really screwed the pooch on this one.
---
I'm a herbie and I've never seen a black lotus, don't even know where they spawn
---
bro the real reward are the memories we make along the way. \^\^\^\^\^ohh and btw greens and boe are res as well
---
Honor system should have shipped with the game. People need to stop bitching. You knew what you were getting into rolling on a pvp server, and you should have rushed to 60 if this is something you were worried about.
---
Sir do you know why I pulled you over
---
Nice, people who choose AND beg are dumb.
---
The game is absolutely unplayable at level 45 trying to level in any contested zone dude i'm all about pvp but why can't anybody seem to go after players their own levels this is the death of vanilla dude the average player is not even level 60 yet and this is how it's going to be to install pvp system with no battlegrounds is fucking pointless in my opinion everybody thinking they're going to be grand Marshall by ganking low levels all day long just has ruined the fun for anybody else I love pvp i love pvp servers but corpse running for an hour straight when i have about 2 hours to play with kids running around just terrible fucking idea to play wow atm if you're on a pvp server.
---
Pay a tank it’s easy to find a tank. But a geared tank won’t do it for free that’s a waste of time.
---
Thing is, Blizzard has stated that there are still hidden quests that no one ever encountered in vanilla. There very well could still be hidden secrets in Classic, including these secluded areas that few players ever wandered, let alone camped for long periods of time.
---
It's not that strange to leave a toon out there for days/weeks/months just to see if anything hidden comes to light.

I suck at PvP.
---
Very interesting, thanks!
---
Are you actually arguing that you think players being annoyed is a better predictor of people quitting than literally not letting them play?
---
Most people don't play on care bear servers and if you do then the comment clearly has no bearing on you.
---
all gomes must die
---
Yeah original MC was much harder. But you have to remember that the playerbase grew rapidly post release and it took people forever to hit 60. Not only because everyone sucked and there was no such thing as quest helper. But because queues were insane, and the game would often be unplayable for the first month/s. Also the game was first released in the EU in February.
---
So by the time most people actually hit level 60, the AV / WSG patch was out with wellfare epics and blues easily available (Ice barbed spear) for example.
---
So for the vast majority of the classic WoW playerbase, and for the majority of Vanilla Wow's lifetime MC was a complete joke.
---
Those same people complain about retail being too casual, even though they’re the reason for that lmao
---
&gt;their
---
Imagine using RP logic to talk about server imbalance
---
Nop! It's not working :)
---
Trying to restealth but yeah you're right, he was clearly in range of nova still...maybe he thought mages were like hunters and had a dead zone?
---
I totally know what you mean, I have had the same experience. 
---
I mostly run dungeons with friends and I'm usually the only plate wearer in the group (druid tank), so I get basically every plate or mail item that drops, if it's good for me. 
---
Now I have about 3 sets of gear, so I can put on some dps gear when I'm out and about.
---
If I had only had my healing set I'd have been in big trouble so many times, so I recommend you start gathering plate/mail items you can use for pvp or questing. Dungeons are definitely the best way to do this. Make friends with a druid tank and run high level dungeons until you're set :)
---
Wtf are you talking about..  Blizzard literally did that for a month at launch... 6 hour ques every day for playing players...

Or you can keep ressing and dying to camp, your choice.

He's beginning to believe.
---
Can't see them directly, but addons can use combat log to put a timer on them, which is what ClassicAuraDurations does.
---
it provides protection for entry level tanking, but the tank meta is all about threat production these days, and the deathbone set does not help with that.
---
Why is Brutality Blade considered BiS OH? The rhetoric is always slow MH/fast OH for poison procs. Why is BB the exception?

Of course it shouldn't lol

Guild Wars 2  has some really great environments, the open world raids were pretty cool, too.

Truesilver deposits have stolen more rich thorium nodes than any horde or ally I've come across.

Lol chillwind was camped at 6am server time on a Saturday by 10 horde on Whitemane
---
Disc priest is so nice from 1-39, but at 40 I'd respec to shadow.
---
You'll use your wand a lot, but that's what makes the questing so smooth. You'll finish fights at near-full hp/mp and not have to waste time drinking.
---
And it's not all wand. You'll be pressing other buttons too.
---
For example, before each pull I need to reapply my troll's lightning shield and holy shield. I'll pull with Holy Shock, then Mind Blast, shadow word: pain, then finish off with my wand.
---
Disc is really powerful at healing and solo questing. I'd recommend you check it out.
---
I gave a random 30g to help them with a mount, I did not even have my own epic yet. Some people can be nice.
---
I hope you get shown this kindness one-day, maybe even pay it forward yourself!
---
GLHF out there
---
That is not true though?
---
A mage needs to press frostbolt. Again and again and then he won. 
---
A warrior needa to charge, rend, sunder armor, execute, overpower, etc.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure where the genius move was to allow servers that are several times larger than classic, in an era of twitchtv and discord, have open world honor farming without BGs.  
---
I'm on a PvE server and this works.  It works great, but it's also very voluntary.  To be fair, i started characters on Fairbanks and it was fun.  Then a few weeks ago I read about this roll out and I quit them immediately and focused on the PvE server end game. Blizz didn't do a good job with this.
---
Cry now, Jesus. Just play on a PvE server, they are made for soft people like you
---
Kids shouldn't play online games without adult supervision.
---
If it wasn't for rattlegore and butcher, im not sure you'd even need a tank in there tbh.
---
u gonna get scammed almost no one has decent capital on both servers to have 100g laying around
---
Gross.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted.  Truth hurts I guess.
---
&gt;PvP server does not mean you log in to get out there and farm honor 24/7. Should people that log in to do UBRS, Maraudon, general questing, farming mats and all the other things there is to do be welcomed with a "Sorry, to many Horde/Alliance are playing. Probably only 1/5 of them is PvPing right now and the rest is doing other stuff but you will have to wait if you want to raid".
---
Yes they should. They didn't roll a PvE server they rolled PvP and blizzard should do it's best to keep the factions relatively even. Even if you want to do PvE right now you are forced to to PvP want to get into Mara or UBRS your gonna have to fight through 15 people camping the entrance for honor. Want to farm mats oh yeah your gonna be pvped, general question gtfo that isn't happening right now without being ganked and camped for hours.
---
*knugen
---
Look, a horde player!
---
A guy in my guild has over 500 arena runs and no SGC yet
---
Downvoted because you made me read slower.
---
Yeah currently playing a level 30 something female undead mage. I haven’t noticed much of anything else except the stair problem, and so far I’ve only noticed *that* in SM Library. The little steps that connect the hallways to the rooms with the pillars in them always get me stuck if I walk toward them; I have to jump at them instead.
---
I don't mind a short period of this. But I agree, WSG coming out early would be amazing.
---
I'm so tired of this "stop bitching" opinion. Blizzard messed things up and we're free to call them out on it.
---
But a Destro lock with Conflag/Soulburn on the other hand....
---
There’s the time investment of finding someone to do the transmute. Whereas doing the Undeath to Water transmute is instant and you can log anytime of the day and do this. 
---
If you wanted to take it a step further, eventually you will have to skip a day of arcanite transmutes, or you just might not be able to find anyone. 
---
On average if you spend 10 minutes trying to line up a sale, and you make 40g / hr that’s 6-7g farming. 
---
Now you have to be back in a main city in order to sell the xmute. We’ll need to account for travel time from and back to your farming spot. Add on another 10 minutes. 
---
So 13g opportunity cost in time spent away from your farming location. For the sake of rounding let’s put it at 25g, 11.5g net transmute plus 13 farming time. If the recipe sells for 750g it’s only a month to get your money back. 
---
So yes, use the recipe.
---
Are you only healing one person?
---
Doesn't make sense.
---
What a great video! This is Classic at it's very finest.
---
To go get your water totem.
---
That was amazing, what a good sport for not quitting
---
I’m actually enjoying the PvP chaos at the moment. I’m also 39 and desperate to get my mount. Thankfully the horde that successfully gank me don’t tend to corpse camp me
---
"Sharding" is when the game brings people together from different realms to the same shard. That doesn't happen in Classic but the game still runs on the same infrastructure so the shards still exist.
---
Watching him in retail made me roll a Mage &amp; a Monk. Not only is he skilled, but he's informative. Perhaps more importantly, he's very pleasant and enjoyable to watch.

&gt;the tank meta is all about threat production these days,

Oof don't remind me.
---
Yes, was running in a group with another warrior that had hoj and wanted sgc, I had sgc, priest that took all items plus tip on sgc / hoj drop, mind soothing all the mobs we could skip, and a mage that wanted belt/ring from arena. 4 man grp everyone getting something out of it, nobody contesting each other (just arena anger runs)
---
You can’t without sacrificing some other elements of the game.
---
I don't think you're registering what I'm saying.
---
this guy loves getting his ass fingered
---
Turn ins give rep, killing tower bosses give rep. The countless quests in AV give rep. Winning is one of very many ways to gain rep in original AV.
---
&gt; Before p2 being attacked was very rare
---
It really really wasn't. Alliance on my realm are rabid dogs.
---
 I have no skills so I beat on people.. that's called a bully! Lol
---
Best shield for holy paladins in PvP that is pre-raid?
---
Rogues are bad
---
Well I guess it's relative.
---
Yes you can instantly do world qs and go LFR, this is "raidgear" without effort.
---
But if you want the hardest content you pretty much have to commit to a raiding guild to start raiding mythic, much more so than classic
---
Haha nah in all seriousness it was probably around 60 vs 80
---
Don't be a disgusting combat rogue. Have some self respect.
---
I love pvp servers in general but BGs really should be been rolled out. This is so much worse than it was in vanilla. Its not even pvp, its a number count. Have more people? Congrats you win. Its not fun.
---
Props to you for not caring about conforming to traditional beauty standards
---
Aha, i see. Thanks for the clarification.
---
What is the respawn time on world bosses?
---
Fake. I don't believe Prince exists. I've camped him literally for weeks checking every hour or so I'm not at work.
---
Shit's ridiculous.
---
Free Action Potions
---
Shift +1/2 by default I think.
---
Doing nothing is a bad idea. That doesn't mean your idea is a good idea in any way. That's not how the real world works...
---
For example uf my car is won't start doing nothing is a bad idea, changing the tires (which is doing something the opposite of nothing) is still not a good idea and won't fix my car.
---
Fights in MC take like 3mins tops. You can spam high ranks of flash heal and be fine - this will only become relevant when it’s possible to run out of mana in longer/harder fights
---
On my PvE server there have been nightly Hillsbrand, voluntary PvE battles.  Each faction has a nearby graveyard that lets people get back to their corpses--though they have to wait for their side to control the area again.  It's fun.  It probably won't last because there's not too much to it, not much one on one or small group combat.  Still, it's completely voluntary and way to grind until BG's hit.
---
Sure it helps... a lil... but you don’t need it. I mt Mc every week without weight or Pummelers. Maul is soooo much threat on its own.
---
He died in a global man...
---
I've honestly had much better luck in DME then in riding around on my own, but I think it's just because you can do the run so quickly and mine so many RTNs
---
There are 3 BiS in there for feral tanks. But it’s a tricky job tanking with so many enemy casters. I’ve only managed a run of about 20% before the group dissipated.
---
Just did the Uldum stuff last week. All kinds of buildup and then ... dead end.
---
Just relog like all the other replies in other threads tells you to. If that doesnt work, its still bugged for you.
---
What doesnt make sense? Healing in MC is mega easy and fights are super short. Why would you save mana?
---
Maybe try offering an option that actually exists next time...
---
Mate my comment was sarcastic
---
It’s like stepping on ants...
---
Almost as if it was an actual war between two opposing factions.
---
So yes, I would say there are PVE servers for a reason.   
---
The GM gave the only suggestions he could. Would you rather the GM kill all them?
---
Wow that's... weird. How would that even work?
---
I feel like you just clapped at me.
---
Sadly there are a lot of quest chains like that in vanilla. Looking at the Essence of Eranikus questline here especially. These are things Blizzard really could finish in Classic+.
---
"If he dies, he dies." -Bliz
---
they will understand when their contents gone or they have hour plus bg queues
---
Hell yeah it is!
---
What a true keyboard warrior
---
I heard omnicc shows me the duration of my stuns on enemy frames so I downloaded the addon, but its not working. Can anyone help me set this up or recommend an addon that can do this.
---
Yeah, they weren’t this packed. Even the smallest servers are around where a high pop server was back in the day. It’s frustrating. My alt is level 54, and I’m not looking forward to what’s in store when I hit WS and E/WPL. 
---
The most frustrating part is getting killed by guys that are just gonna get 100hks on lowbies and then stop trying when they realize they aren’t getting anywhere near rank 10.
---
He is also streaming and probably more skilled than most people and cares much more about having good content for viewiers/making big plays
---
I was gonna say 'that sounds hard' but I guess it isn't most of the time...
---
Female undead with a lot of playtime. 
---
1) Only in SM
---
2) only in SM
---
3) no
---
4) You can take every skip route. You can even take the other route near the elf at the bottom of BRM because you're small enough to fit through. Bigger characters cannot.
---
Yea, which worked back when everything was new. Hopefully they see how it is and do what they can to fix it. For now I'm just gonna be raid logging I guess
---
It's shimmering. And also flat.
---
Stop QQ and reroll PVE server.
---
Can you have a little decency and format your post?
---
lol no it's not. go run around the world. sure you get less kills but for every kill you get 150 to 200 honor instead of 2-10 honor in the zerg pvp.
---
A majority of classic players are under 26? Everyone I talked to ingame so far was older than that lol

There is already a server cap. If there are too many players there will be people waiting in que either way

You're not going to get any sympathy here my man. Good way to get trolled, posting stuff like this. Gankers gonna gank.

Reddit in general is filled with lots of people that are horrible at the game. Luckily it also has a small amount that are really good that you can learn from or that do know their shit.
---
Troll is BIS for maintanking though...
---
&gt;here's no ability to suddenly decide you don't want it without going on a different server, which is still entirely a fine option.
---
to
---
&gt;Reroll when you don't feel like playing PvP. That's the point of PvP servers, you're committing yourself to FFA open PvP without getting to back out when you want.

just admit you want prey for your horde character.

I loved watching my dad play wow at 3 years old (I was born in 2004). What I loved the most was watching him go dance in the different Inns (idk why lmao), and I just loved watching him fly different places! Now Im 15 and just started playing! I got interested because of classic, and I haven't tried retail yet, but I will in a couple of days :)
---
We have all been there, over the past 15 years this has been going on, it will continue to happen. 
---
The life of a PvP server.
---
I found this place in vanilla, along with the south seas islands with the dancing pirates. I forgot where this one was though until I saw this post!
---
I spent more time exploring than doing progression during the original game. I never raided in vanilla, but I did find lots of spots like this.
---
I'm not sure how you can blame the players when Blizzard offers no information on faction balances. And more importantly they didn't offer said info during name reservation period or the weeks following launch, during which players might be still switching servers.
---
I feel bad for these people. Their lives must be really pathetic if they have to take satisfaction from killing an easy target.
---
welcome to wow pvp for the past 15 years,if u think anyone gives a damn about your feelings,your wrong. they don't care,pvpers LIVE to make your life and the lives of other people miserable. without it,they would just unsub.
---
but pvpers unsubbing tbh would make this game and even retail a hell of a lot better.
---
&gt; Almost as if it was an actual war between two opposing factions.
---
It's more farming a resource by a zerg than it is PvP. I really wish it felt like PvP. Was excited for this.
---
Cone of cold is very strong, good dmg and no cast time. And good slow
---
I know that but that wasn't my point here. 
---
Phase 2 isn't a week old and why do I have 383 life time kills with 0 kills this week? It doesn't make sense.
---
Is that all you’ve got? No actual arguments or facts?
---
Go back to your Garrison.
---
They talked about it a little during Blizzcon. Any 120 characters will be brought to 50, and the expansion's content will take them from 50 to 60. We don't really have more info, though leveling can now be done in any expansion, except for new players who have to go through BfA on their first character.
---
&gt;The majority of wow players don't want more queues or smaller servers.
---
I'm sorry when did we take this vote? The majority of us want servers smaller servers when then we have now, we want the size they were in vanilla not the 3x bigger servers we have now.
---
well I hope that honor won't be "forgotten" at the end of the week.
---
Because of the consequences they laid out. Doing nothing will kill the Alliance PVP population resulting in EVERYONE losing out.
---
Now I think a better approach is for Bliz to aggressively merge lower pop realms around getting them reasonably balanced. Then if those realms are at/near capacity give the minority side login preference over the majority with the option for free race change/faction transfer to the majority side available until the sides are balanced out. No artificial caps in place, but lets say out of 10K players 6k are horde and 4k alliance then a preference for login would start favoring alliance players logging in. Let's say 2 Ally per 1 Horde until the pop is reasonably balanced (Lets say 10% for arguments sake).

Classicauradurations
---
problem with fairbanks is if you have anything close to an even fight 10 minutes later a raid group of 30 horde show up and just steamroll you. so theres no point in fighting anywhere.
---
Welcome to Classic videos. Everything is "jUsT a mAyMaY bRo" filled with "ironic" music and edits. Hilarious.
---
Check the setting ActionBars -&gt; "show numbers for cooldown".
---
 I dont use omnicc but if I disable show numbers for cooldown that interferes with my addon that shows status duration on enemies.
---
Really depends on the server
---
Wahhhhhh.

I saw a devilsaur on Faerlina once, AMA.

That was awesome, good sports

Same reason that I'm exalted with the Wildhammer Clan.
---
staged for views and upvotes
---
That was my idea, but I was reading that even then, the low level will only get partial xp. I don’t know.
---
Hell yea.  Anathema is great.  Medium pop suits me just fine and the alliance to horde ratio is good.  Like you said, alliance has a slight numbers advantage but we give them a good fight.
---
Alliance: man it sucks that faction imbalance has basically made the game unplayable for a large number of people, especially after those people put several hundered hours into their characters.
---
Horde: MAN THE ALLIANCE IS JUST FULL OF WHINERS. WHINE MORE YOU WHINEY WHINERS. *forms raid to gank greys at hunters camp in stranglethorn*
---
Lame
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I want to advertise outside of game to get the attention of players outside my server as my guilds raid schedule is set based on swing shift workers, so I’m looking for others that want to raid but are confined to similar schedules. 
---
If you work different days each week I feel it’s not too much to change servers to find a guild that works for your (different than most) work schedule
---
TIL, that's crazy.
---
thats cool. there's just no other enchants you can put on a weapon that will do anything of value for a bear until, I think, p3?

may as well raise your raids dps ceiling

---
It will die out in about 2-3 weeks when the vast majority of players will have their rank 3 and the discount that comes with it. 10% of players will keep going for rank 7, 2% of players will go for rank 14.
---
I could be super off because I don’t play rogue but I’m pretty sure it’s just sinister strike and then eviscerate at 5 combo points. Don’t take my word for it
---
The hype will wear out soon,i am sure. There were not many places on azeroth that were consistently contested by the gankers back in classic. Stranglethorn vietnam always was,searing gorge too.i had no troubles leveling on a full pop pvp realm,only stv and sg,like i said. Just be persistent,resorting to dungeons only can be time consuming,in my opinion.
---
I honestly cant wait until Tuesday, to hear a million angry have a tantrum, because they cant buy the epic weapons, despite farming 60k honor.
---
these are rank points, not honor points or kills.
---
Me three
---
lol then go play runescape
---
Some guy once paid me 8g per lockbox, 3 lockboxes. Seems extremely unlikely but it could have happened.
---
yea but blizz will probably actually do somthing about their crying feels bad
---
probably not how you’re trying to play but just level up man. don’t worry about low level sets. just kills mobs and get to 60 so you can play the game. it’s not september anymore.
---
That won't happen because it's cross realm bgs.
---
*clears throat* PvP hApPeNeD oN a PvP sErVeR
---
&gt; There's literally no incentive to stop PvPing the way it's happening now until BGs are released.
---
There's no incentive to continue PvPing.
---
Have you seen the rewards? Most people willing to do hardcore grinding already have their raid BiS which is in most cases better than blue PvP items, and 99% of those who want to get epic items will burn out before they get there because larger servers mean larger competition.
---
&gt;I just want to know what I can do as holy to defend myself better.
---
You create a bubble hearth macro. Seriously as a holy paladin your not going to be winning PvP fights against anyone unless they also are a healer or have downs syndrome.
---
Come to rattlegore . 
---
Been having lots of the ring fights
---
I play alliance and all this crying on the subreddit is truly embarrassing. Alliance are massive pussies.
---
Did you just insult the fucking Hamster Dance?
---
No, it happened in vanilla. It existed. With the insane numbers packed in to the same worlds and wild faction imbalances combined with the massive shift in attitude of how people play? It’s nowhere near like vanilla was.
---
It does damage too

Rend set is his for Hunter too

I understand they make good healers but I'm not wrong, they are the worst healers out of all the resto, holy class specs. This isn't news and it's not just my opinion.... I was mainly teasing about the WSG thing... Sorry
---
Lmao forreal
---
Honestly feral druid has the easiest time levelling and getting groups since you can tank or heal. Either MoTW/NS, moonglow druid or shadow priest for easy/fun levelling. Paladin gets extremely painful to level unless you're ret.
---
Some of us saw this coming in august last year. Was all smiles and skirmishes when there was "no reason" to pvp. Now honor is in it will be absolutly toxic until battlegrounds are introduced
---
Grind humanoid mobs in remote areas is my advice
---
The people playing Classic are playing the game very differently than those in Vanilla. Gaming culture is radically different - it’s much more focused on efficiency, rushing content, and exploiting whatever you can if it means getting an advantage. This doesn’t mix well with the way world pvp works in WoW. 
---
Gamer toxicity has also changed. There were assholes on the internet in 2005, but Twitch and Youtube pushed the idea of being an asshole past the point of taboo. There are droves of people who *want* 5 v 1 scenarios so they can 
---
/sit on someone and corpse camp them. They think being the biggest shit you can is cool and the thing to do online The full anonymity and displaced aggression of the internet has been realized in, well, what is essentially 2020.
---
I'm in the same boat as you my friends drug me to a pvp server.  Once an hour I can bubble hearth lol.
---
stop answering questions in this thread
---
Do you earn less honor if you are a healer vs. If you are a damage dealer in a party (on average, per kill)
---
yes, by not paying for your sub next month, but you wont, you will whine and moan about something you dont like.
---
Then reroll PvE. I have zero sympathy for people who bitch about this. Before you made your character, did you not stop to think that maybe there's going to be faction balances and you might get constantly killed or camped? You didn't? Then it's your own damn fault and posting about it isn't going to help.
---
Still had ice block tho
---
Shift and scrolling works too.
---
What are you talking about? Now that they know about this Blizzard will take care not to push out this kind of content. So it's not an issue.
---
I read all of it. 
---
\&gt; His idea isn’t that bad though, and you’re just kind of an asshole.
---
Your first comment in the thread.
---
\&gt; Yes you are a dismissive asshole … you childish simpleton. Grow up.
---
First sentences of your next comment
---
\&gt;and you’re an incredibly daft person if you don’t understand that.
---
The next sentence
---
\&gt; making you look even dumber.
---
\&gt;get your head out of the sand once in a while and start using your brain a bit more.
---
\&gt; Have fun being a horrible human being with no intelligence!
---
So in 3 comments you insulted him 6 times. And he never once insulted you.
---
Yeah I’d call that non stop lmao.
---
The OP was the first one to insult the guy that you re insulting yourself by calling him a moron.
---
Yes you’re being a complete ass for no reason other than you disagree with him.
---
Or releases wsg.
---
Can also use rank 1 fireball against rogues to put DoT on them to break vanish.
---
Unless you’re buying your gold and never fighting rogues warriors or hunters; you put the points in for riposte
---
This will be the prevailing sentiment. People don't like being oppressed.
---
They could have had they thought about it when allowing transfers or even at launch of servers
---
We'll someone should fix the UI then.

I wanted to play on a PvP server but my friends were mixed so we voted and PvE won by 1 vote. Honestly super glad. Woulda been on either Herod or Stalagg as Alliance, instead I’m Ally on Pagle and the server is super chill, super fun, and I’ve had a blast every time I’ve logged on. 
---
Even plenty of good world PvP since Thursday and you never have to feel guilty since anyone who’s engaging in PvP on a PvE server is making the conscious effort to do so. Literally never get corpse camped, never get killed at flight paths. 
---
It’s dope as hell. I’m for sure a Normal server convert
---
&gt;right now pvp IS the only aspect of the game.
---
I guess people thought they wanted the true vanilla experience.. but they didn't? ;)
---
I dig it.
---
I resort to that often I'm not gonna lie. I have some points in protection for the stun and armor but defensive play gets me nowhere on my own. The only option is prob 31 points in Ret but damn I dont wanna play Ret lol
---
They allowed anyone to transfer from servers where there was already an imbalance without restricting it to a certain faction. Notice the quick 180 on that shit
---
Awesome fun, never heard of that being done before.
---
That's not true at all. I'm horde on a 50/50 server. (Us incendius) and Alliance are inescapable. No mater where you go, no mater how many times you wave. They. Will. Murder. You.
---
And seeing as how all but 2 realms are heavily leaning horde that wont matter. The over all balance is still heavily horde, which means they will get significantly longer queues.
---
Solo kills versus raid kills... and remember your hks are worthless after you kill someone 4 times.
---
You dont do DME jumps with randoms. You get friends or guildies, someone will have mining. Even without mining its lucrative.
---
They should get the same Answers GM's are giving allies that complain, go play a different server.
---
I'd not be so sure. People just done enjoy unbalanced PvP. They will get their PvP fix in Bgs.
---
Yeah but if a bunch of people are doing this at the same time it’s indistinguishable from Zerg pvp for the other faction if there’s a disadvantage.
---
yikes
---
Your tanking/ret/pvp gear can all the same stuff, not like you are min maxing for damage for raids
---
No reason not to need on gear though, if nobody else needs it, it would be a few g at most
---
On day 1 I did SS vs TM all day, like 10 hours.  On day two I spent like an hour killing people in Blackrock Mountain.  Based on the honor I earned ganking is like 3 times more efficient.  The only benefit to hillsbrad is you can basically afk while doing it.
---
Honestly it might be quicker just hardcore questing and killing mobs while running to quests. Maybe have a 60 for heals or elites
---
Truth
---
 it's not locked on atlas loot
---
Release BG's will NOT solve the problem, it will make it worse. Take his 2K Alliance: 7K Horde server as an example.
---
What will happen is that \~1000 Alliance go to BG queues, along with \~1000 Horde. 6000 Horde are now angrily awaiting their queues, probably at Alliance FP's. So now your server went from 3.5H:1A to 6H:1A. Even worse imbalance.
---
What needs to happen is that Alliance PvP racials need to be buffed to the point of being overpowered. This is what Blizzard did to encourage people to roll Horde. Horde was also under populated in Vanilla, and this helped facilitate (especially new people) to roll Horde.
---
I am just generally curious about the limits of Mind Control, now that it's occurred to me they exist. Taking off weapons would be a nice way to mitigate some of the inconvenience it causes in PVP, if it were possible. Hearthstones also are not always used for stuck, if they are on cooldown or not in a player's bag.
---
Other questions:
---
If a player logs out and then back in again, does the spell stay or break? What about if the player logs out, its caster logs out, and then the player returns?
---
Class reworks seem fair but I wish they would've had the itemization be pretty much what it was in the beginning. I wanted to experience this thing as it was, not an lfr version of it.
---
Actually, more kudos for not just breaking the MC by porting himself to the GY.
---
In long boss fights there is a point in which you realize you will be using your entire mana pool for that fight. Once you realize this, you will heal more using high mana efficiency heals compared to high healing per second heals.
---
Why can’t I have no kids and three money?
---
I mean 3v1 is a good fight. These rogues are awful.
---
With 0% crit, zero MP5, 5,000 base mana and one Major Mana Potion (averages 1,800 extra mana) you can cast max rank Flash of Light for nonstop for 72 seconds. The potion cooldown is 120 seconds.
---
Add Dark Runes, Whipper Root Tubers, a flask, and the base 10% crit that all Holy Paladins have, and the fact that you're not always casting non-stop?You're easily be able to stretch your mana to a second, third, or fourth potion cooldown.
---
underrated comment
---
Legit, most of the priests in my raid end up using Flash Heals, which leads to me being top in overheals.  Even with self interrupts.  I've started using rank 1 heal, and I'm still doing great.  I know rank 1 won't be realistic once people start using proper heals, but I'm just so frustrated with people more focused on topping charts.  I'm probably averaging around 760 per heal with rank 1.
---
Yeah forming the group and getting there is much more difficult than the content honestly
---
&gt; If a player logs out and then back in again, does the spell stay or break? What about if the player logs out, its caster logs out, and then the player returns?
---
Mind control would break.  It's timed so it would eventually run out, but most spells don't stick around after logout.  Obviously poisons, curses, buffs, debuffs do stick around but most player spells do not.
---
After logout the player would not be mind controlled anymore.  Even if they immediately logged in again, they wouldn't still be mind controlled.
---
agreed.  I have 2 60s on Skeram Alliance.  The crybabies need to sack the fuck up and realize what they signed up for when they rolled ally on a PVP server.
---
I wish more people were willing to admit that PvP in classic is not really PvP.
---
It's called bias, Im on Mograine aswell, on Horde.
---
Every corner I turn theres a 40 man Alliance group
---
If you're already ganking the dudes 15 v 4, playing at off peak hours means that dude is still gonna be enjoying 5v1? Wait... you're still so OVERWHELMINGLY over him in numbers it doesn't matter STILL.
---
It's clear you're horde on a horde dominated server.
---
Yes. It's a pain once bosses start MCing and 4 mages sheep the same target. They are immediately immune without getting Polymorphed.
---
I listed a few of many options. If somewhere is overcrowded go somewhere else. Even on Skeram none of those options are overcrowded 24/7.
---
I understand the complaint, and I feel the frustration. I just disagree with his main premise.  He’s saying that opposing factions shouldn’t kill each other because it makes people quit the game. I think that mindset is ridiculous and has no place in classic PvP servers. Being at a numbers disadvantage is good for everything except world bosses. 
---
Don’t know if this is considered gatekeeping but if you’re not okay with getting corpse camped or having instances blocked by the opposing faction, maybe the game isn’t for you. There’s a reason there’s a penalty for rezzing at your GY and there’s a reason your hearth goes on cooldown. If you don’t want to deal with that, then go to a PvE server.
---
What if you mind control a mage, create a portal... Can your party take it?
---
&gt; 6000 Horde are now angrily awaiting their queues, probably at Alliance FP's
---
They will spend there entire wait just getting to the FP's, just to do it again, it will really really suck for them.
---
well horde have the server balance in their favor on all but two realms so yeah they are. You can't camp the whole map as the minority faction not when WPVP has been turned into a numbers game
---
You think youre making a statement, i just see an asshole who won a bunch of epics over someone else who is now vendoring them to quit
---
Mind Control Cap isn't channeled, though.
---
Also, what happens if you Hearthstone while someone is under the effects of the cap?
---
Completely agree. I would hate to see classic zones get as busy as retail zones are.
---
What do you think actors do?
---
That's a good question
---
You queue in Orgrimmar and hearthe over to Kargath via groupleaving in RFC to get autobooted to your hearthstone.
---
Queues are absolutely NOT tied to server capacity. Servers could handle way more players. 
---
The queues are in place to combat overpopulation and problems that would pose in the world, quests, economy, gathering materials, etc. They are in place to make the game playable.
---
I presented the same logic behind faction based queues.
---
Based flair.
---
When I leveled I couldnt win any fight with my priest, but I could survive a lot of them. Renewing and shielding yourself, and scream with a potion and the instant heal if you are alliance and you can run away from most ganks.
---
No, you shouldn't have and I'm glad you didn't
---
I wholeheartedly agree, though the combat log and/or attentiveness would still give it away to a point. Spy isn't the only addon that does this either, many others have it built in such as VanasKOS
---
Magic. He’s a mage.
---
He edited his post, used to say "Then I remembered it's the nerfed base race version of AV with a time limit"
---
Thanks
---
Depends on the spec. All are capable of holding their own in a 1v1 respectively. 
---
Always start with a shield on yourself as an opener. If you’re getting the jump on someone, open with holy fire into mind blast into shadow word pain. If you get to around 25% mana I’d recommend saving it for emergency heals. It’s a case by case basis though depending on what class you’re facing, the health they’re at, etc. 
---
If you’re having trouble getting spells off also learn to fake cast people interrupts so you can cast freely. 
---
If you respond with your general spec and what match up you struggle with the most I will be able to give more insight. I have a 60 priest on a PvP server.

In a week or two things will flatten out and you will see more smaller groups of 3-5 people roaming around.
---
&gt;  It would DRASTICALLY lower the server pop immediately. 
---
So a win win?

Nah, it's missing the beard.

There will always be assholes on both sides, but I guarantee that there is definitely some revenge ganking going on from Alliance.

Lol okay kid
---
Mind control doesn't give you access to their entire spell book.
---
Hideous, glad I picked a good looking race
---
FYI, he reported them for safespotting the gadget guards. So he would rather the GM ban them.

---
Yes, boss is weird with the linking and whatnot, if you make sure both of them are proximity pulled by pet, they stay unlinked, its pretty easy to tell depending on how fast they react, they way I do the aggro this in this particular video is so that I can drain shaman cho'rush more before starting the damage, because he is a lot harder to oom than the priest is. 
---
The thing you describe is when they are linked in pull (your pet aggroes one before the other, or you hit one of them, thus aggroing one before the other again) then they have some real wonky behaviour, linked shaman is awful to play against because he randomly stops to cast totems totally getting off-sync
---
Imagine crying about PvP playing Horde l o l o l.
---
I levelled my priest as Disc all the way until 48, went shadow for two levels and specced back to disc again. Much preferred it to shadow. Granted I did run a lot of dungeons, killing mobs solo wasn't an issue at all, and the time not spent drinking probably made up for the kill speed making it as fast as shadow anyway
---
10-15g on my server already
---
Even better.
---
Got it, but where do you see the honor points? I see a msg when I get an HK that includes some points value, but I don’t see any count on the Honor tab.
---
You did, but even if it was done like pre 1.12, now days players know the fights and can even watch walkthrough videos of them, which makes a huge difference.
---
Gonna bookmark this and check his post history after paid transfers come out.
---
This clip reminded of another masterpiece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBkSoF0Kzuw
---
Yeah lol I play alli on Herod and I literally can't fly anywhere without there being at least a group of 5 or more camping the fp. Then there's several more groups roaming the entire zone looking for people who got away from the fp lol. Half the time there's horde attacking IF while 200+ alli just sit afk by the bank and ah lol
---
Have you guys had trouble getting into groups at 60?
---
Yeah, i even bummed myself out when it wrote it.
---
&gt; let there be no more than 3000 Horde online.
---
That simply won't happen. Blizz isn't going to stop active subscribers from being able to play the game just because there are too many people in that faction on that server logged in at the time.
---
Login queues are for handling server load, not faction balance. 
---
Not to mention, now you have to have server transfers available all the time to keep your "option 2" viable. Maybe eventually the entire playerbase will settle across all the servers in a reasonably balanced manner...but I imagine most people will quit from frustration before then.
---
*And*, what happens when there are only 200 alliance online? Do you scale your system, and put a 500 player cap on the entire server? Or is it just a flat +1000, because then we're back to the same issue we have now, 1200 horde vs 200 alliance. 
---
You really can't predict what is going to happen to a servers population, so putting a restriction on a players ability to login based on how many people of each faction are currently logged in is just going to end up killing servers quicker.
---
You're better off placing caps on the number of players that can exist in a certain faction per server, and growing those caps as the server population grows itself. Servers could still end up dying, but you wouldn't be preventing anyone from playing their existing character.
---
But in the end, even if you have a 50/50 server, if one faction is just significantly better in pvp than the other, the losing faction might start quitting or transferring off. Kicking off members of the winning faction to keep the server population close to a 50/50 is not a good solution.
---
💤
---
No, people have not dealt with this for 15 years.
---
"World pvp" ( all high level flight masters being camped, all cross continent boats being camped) has never been a thing.
---
No they won't, they will drop to 15g no question but doubt they will ever get lower then 13g. At least not on my server.
---
But I’m a mage also...?
---
Yeah it's tough to appease everyone. Especially with this game. There's those who had no content left come phase 2. Then there's everyone else and it seems to be 60/40. Where the 40% are getting what they want.
---
No reason at all. The only mechanical difference is that PvP servers have *nonoptional* PvP--which means ganking. You can still have pitched battles between the sides on PvE servers, with the people who don't feel like PvPing just walking by them.
---
2 months at the max.
---
Ugh, as a horde on Pagle, I am eternally grateful it's a pve server. You motherfuckers (said with love of course :D) are everywhere. Even just competing for quests against the roaming packs of alliance can be frustrating. I'm pretty sure I'd have already transferred if I was also getting ganked everytime as well.
---
Man imagine being as salty as you. I didn't read every gd post on here today.
---
Yeah and the same is happening with Horde...

Probably, I have raided onyxia with this talent spec both before and after getting 8p GS, its not terrible for onyxia, not really recommended in Molten Core because pet plays a bigger role in molten. There is obviously a few floater points here, like you don't need 5/5  Efficency if you bring Mage Water if you rather have 5/5 conq shot for pvp. Clever Traps also not really needed
---
Find a new guild?
---
It's server dependent but on every server it should be worth over 1k gold. One sold on my server last weekend for 2k.
---
Not saying there wont be queues for horde, just saying that alliance heavy servers will alleviate the overall BG queues.
---
I haven't read "all the other replies and threads", and I don't see any of them near the top.
---
Did they open up faction specific transfers though mostly for horde leaning servers? The OP could easily move to another server using that.
---
Where is the evidence if the blizzard employee suggesting this?
---
Actors do different things. Many or most are typecast, meaning they pick an actor who already has the features of the character, so they don't really have to act that hard. The most prolific and successful actors tend to take a very diverse array of roles each of which are performed for a tiny fraction of their life. In ***no*** circumstance does an actor perform the same role for 3/4 of their waking life.
---
I wish players like you would go to pve servers.
---
Good old shitty wow video with shitty music
---
Nothing like class balance
---
When did I wonder why no one around here likes me? I couldn't care less dude, I don't base my ego off losers on reddit.
---
If you're dumb I'm gonna call you dumb, and if that makes you mad then that's really your problem, not mine. Maybe next time you'll think things through and avoid this whole situation.
---
In my server I was only able to sell it for 8g :(
---
Horde need their own queue.  Don't wanna hear it but it's the truth.
---
True.
---
are u actually crying?
---
Tons of people are home from work by that time. There's more than one type of shift people work plus timezones
---
herod Is really bad man. I feel so bad sometimes
---
You can use vanillafriends or a similar website to look up someone’s username and it gives you their battle net name.
---
It’s a strategy based on denying a ganker  satisfaction, it probably works well for them
---
Fuck the horde
---
I’m using shadowed unit frames, and I can just right click the opposing factions target frame and “add to battle net”
---
Shameless ad is shameless
---
It's not really faction imbalance that is the problem (though that hurts).  Its the fact that they put sooooo many people on a world designed for far fewer.
---
How do you get around Enervate and the disease on the last boss?
---
I never understand how someone’s action bars are set up like a big square
---
Not really. People were hardcore then too.
---
I literally quit because of the faction imbalance.
---
I have alchemy very close to maxed and I don’t charge to make anything right now (except transmutes but my guild mostly ends up using Them and I def don’t charge them)  if they have mats, because it’s causing me to level and I don’t care it takes two seconds .. I had a super nice guy give me 5g just for making a few oil of Immolations for him after providing all the mats . People are really cool about stuff a lot of the time with that. I had another guy (60) offer to help me farm herbs in high level areas cause of all the ganking  when I told him I couldn’t get the sun grass for major health pots. Lol
---
He just didn’t think before he posted.
---
Why don't you play a tank then? :)
---
okay?
---
And people like you are so self-righteous that you label any sort of pvp you don't like as "griefing" as if that makes anything different.  No one is entitled to a grief-free experience on a pvp server.
---
Why not play on a PvE server? They sound more your speed
---
True, but that doesn't actually make the fight any easier from a player perspective, just a guild leader one.
---
Aren't most civilians quest givers or people you need to talk to for quests? In which case they have a definite purpose and killing them does indeed hinder people.
---
I’m alliance and I love every single bit of the wpvp, I prefer more horde then alliance. More for me to eat!!!
---
I totally agree. Honor and bgs from the start would have ment PvP would be a natural part of the game but people looking to rank would be in bgs. Also wsg would be more relevant while leveling
---
The big servers are wildly overpopulated as it is so I don't really see the problem here. I'm having a great time on my med-low server
---
At 50+ kills going for HoJ.  During the first 10 kills, seen it drop twice, lost once to a warrior, second time to a pally.
---
Started doing stealth runs with guild rogues/druids that have it.   They've helped me kill Angerforge over 40 times, still no HoJ.
---
This is bullshit. People have always min-maxed, they may be better at it now a days, but the act of min-maxing is not new. Neither is being a douche bag. Twitch and youtube didn't make people jerks on the internet, they've always been jerks. Stop blaming the kids. Shit hasn't changed. I remember being camped by 5 people all the time 10 years ago. Camping and ganking weren't made worse because of social media ffs.
---
I was unaware that you knew all of my experiences and can clearly see into my past better than I. 
---
I apologize Ms.Cleo.
---
This is an accurate video of gameplay in Hillsbrad
---
That's unlucky I've seen jed 7 times, reed dropped every single time. I won the 5th one
---
Yea ik I was hoping people would see it from the point of view of someone who has played other PvP then wow who sees how stupid the system is. Judging by the replies ive gotten some people have the IQ of a tree stump.
---
I was hanging around everlook with some guildies yesterday killing every ally we saw. It wasn't even a competition, I was the healer and the only heals I sent out were for fall damage.
---
After a good while an ally raid of about 20 rolled through my group of 5 and absolutely destroyed us. It wasn't because they were better though, they just had more numbers and this fact destroyed my fun instantly. It's just unfair.
---
You probably see the hypocrisy here and I get it. It's not fun to get destroyed just because there's a faction imbalance, blizz need to release BG's asap
---
Faction based queues are such a bad idea. Imagine telling someone who on Tuesday they could play whenever they wanted that on Wednesday they had to wait for your factions to log out while hoping that the other factions doesn't log out before they are able to play. 
---
I understand the sentiment, but the populations fluctuate together. If there are queues for one faction, then you have to hope that the other faction population stays the same all throughout the day so that the number of people actually allowed to play doesn't decrease while you are waiting. Its a ridiculous solution and will never and should never be implemented.
---
Same as they did 15 years ago, and same as they punish guilds who exploit bosses, with warnings, then short term bans, then longer and longer if not permanent bans.

[On tonight's episode of Quick Mysteries](Https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rickandmorty/images/e/ef/QuickMysteryIntro.png/revision/latest?cb=20170415214036)
---
Lol you realize my server is 50/50 right?
---
It actually was. Theorycrafting and min/maxing really started taking off right before TBC came out.
---
Love farmlog
---
Keep up the good work
---
Well he did use the soulstone they had on him so they would have another chance to mc him and finish their journey.
---
No it wasn't why do you lie? For starters these servers are 3 times larger then vanilla servers so you have 3 times the people crammed into the same world. This alone causes way more world PvP then we ever saw in vanilla.
---
Players are more than welcome to jump right in, and I would LOVE to welcome everyone to PvE servers, but we have to do it right. There are too many people that would transfer, and it'd crash the markets on basically everything.
---
So fucking true lmaooo
---
Imagine using deathbone. Garbage
---
The GM reported them to a GM? seems legit
---
&gt; Gamer toxicity has also changed. There were assholes on the internet in 2005, but Twitch and Youtube pushed the idea of being an asshole past the point of taboo. There are droves of people who want 5 v 1 scenarios so they can /sit on someone and corpse camp them.
---
Lol I don't know about this one. People were pretty fucking big dickheads in vanilla (and I was one too).
---
The main difference is that streamers are getting special attention but on most realms you don't notice streamers at all. It's just the regular assholes that are all over the place.
---
Leveling is def more expensive though with those damn Grimoires x4 pets, although you can skip some of those.
---
horde will have plenty of time to duel with their 30 min BG queues in phase 3
---
Nah, it isn’t.  Just because your server isn’t 80/20 like Stalagg doesn’t mean it’s 50/50.  If you whine about alliance and aren’t on literally the one Alliance server Heartseeker you’re a gigantic crybaby.
---
agreed. With so many newly viable classes everyone went nuts trying to work out the best way to play everything.
---
im no classic expert. but wow doesnt seem to reward skill vs raw numbers. so why play better then your opponent when you can just bring more people to fight them
---
Yeah it’s a good point
---
99% parse resto shaman tank healet here.
---
Other than spamming rank 7 healing wave on the tank, i dont find down ranking useful in raids. 
---
Where it reallllllly shines is in dungeons. I can spam rank 3 healing wave on the tank and literally never run out of mana due to my mp5 being at 102+mana spring. Rank 3 heals just enough to negate pull's damage and only have to rank 7 down heal when on bosses.
---
Dont remember the last time i full ranked a healing wave in 5mans.
---
Get good, noob.
---
you were given plenty of warning to get level 60 before phase 2
---
The overall balance according the the census mods that work RN is 51-49 on one side or the other at all times.
---
Faerlina
---
It might be different on my server (arugal Aussie) but the culture of hanging at the gates of IF and duelling is still alive and well.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The majority of people who played vanilla and didn't quit hit 60 by the end... They may not have done end game content but they certainly didn't spend 2 years getting to level 53..
---
Ok
---
You are but its rude as fuck wishing i would switch to a different server because my opinion is in disagreement with yours and shits on your view of the PvP system. You could have just said that you liked the system the way it was
---
Almost no matter what you put in it just says this can't be translated, including things that clearly can.
---
I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not...
---
2 sides to the same coin. Queues are probably an arbitrary number that they choose to both combat overpop, and server capacity. I would be shocked if it is more of the latter than the former, but both are certainly factors.
---
For instance backwoods, Russian, basement servers could run smoothly, with more players than Blizzard servers. I’m sure Blizzard could raise the server caps dramatically and still be stable. But if they did that, stability in the economy, questing, etc would crash and burn.
---
Can you show on the doll where the bad horde touched you?
---
Amazing. Can you please explain how the threat works for last boss? It looks like your pet has a single furious howl for the most part and then you can get that back after FD drinking quite easily?
---
If you can't see how the plan the OP outlined is different from queues as they currently stand (or stood at launch) I don't know how to help you understand.
---
&gt; people had to deal with this for over 15 years already,they wont put up with assholes ruining their gaming any longer then needed.
---
I wish this stopped getting repeated. It's not true.
---
You obviously don't understand the definition of "transfer." Do you mind taking your low effort shit replies somewhere else?
---
world pvp,is 90% ganking lowbies,and yes its been a thing since forever. because this has been a constant problem all throughout retails lifespawn leading up to BFA. anyone who says otherwise,is part of the ganking problem.
---
Wait what, interesting content that's not spam about pvp/want next phase/got/did this thing that everyone has done too? Have your damn upvote then.
---
The only difference between this and Vanilla Wpvp is that it's horde camping alliance now. Everyone knew this was what wpvp would be like.
---
You shouldn’t expect to be catered to is the point.
---
"Sorry no raid tonight, 15 people got locked out". Yah sounds like great idea lol.
---
this.is.the.classic.experience.
---
we all want this in the end.
---
Its between 5-7 days
---
The type of useless comment from a karma mining who're that just reaffirms my disgust for the toxic cunts that are reddit
---
If you don't want to hear the thoughts of others don't post on a forum for people to freely discuss topics....
---
It’s PvP, it’s just not fair PvP.
---
Ahhh kk
---
Sure, and while the post I responded to doesnt do this most people complain that min/maxing/rushing is brought on by retail implying it was the later expansions. I just wanted to say it was present from way earlier.
---
Boo hoo I died once in PvP despite having a 2:1 advantage on average. Yes sometimes you will die. But for every time you die, just remember your opposing faction has to, on average, win 2v1s every time they meet enemies in the open world.
---
Yeah mean like right now with the queues...ok by me
---
Exactly we have servers 3 times the size we did in vanilla, when you cram 9k people into the same world that held 3k your going to get this shit show.
---
Can’t argue against logic soz
---
Give it a couple weeks. There aren't going to be massive raids of roaming bankers on the hills forever; It's novel right now.
---
I’m gonna believe it and you can’t stop me
---
Just depends on the situation. Sometimes I can root a Warrior and set it up perfectly to beat them 100-0, but then they pop a FAP unexpectedly and immediately crit me with an auto attack + MS while I'm in caster form. I can't recover from that without consumables of my own.
---
Most of the time they don't get that lucky and I can just beat them straight up in bear.
---
Yep, Vanilla PvP didn't age that well...
---
Had a group tip me 10 gold total to summon 3 people to Dire Maul. So glad I made my warlock a pretty girl.
---
If you think that was EVER not the case your nostalgia is getting the better of you. There were no glory days of balanced and fair PvP. Ever.
---
First of all, I've never really heard about that, because if it wasn't clear, I'm a fairly casual player, so I don't read up on every bit of wow news or follow this subreddit religiously. Second of all, I'm extremely busy with studies and part time work. Last night was the first time I actually got to hang out with my mates since July.
---
It might not be worse, but I do think people now are able to see it a lot more because or social media/streaming/YouTube (which I know was around back then but in a much reduced form).
---
Back then it was a bit easier to rationalize to oneself that it wasn’t as bad as it seems. Now that people are bombarded with so many like experiences so easily, it’s much harder to frame being ganked by 5 dudes as just an unfortunate run in. 
---
So no, I don’t think the behaviors are much different, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the increased exposure across media has increased general toxicity which might make said behaviors more aggressive.
---
That's literally what PvP is in WoW. When people say "sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server" like OP mentioned it's because that's just how it is. It's always been this way even back in the day. A fair fight would require organization and communication which isn't a thing when you're out in the world.
---
Don't ever remember it being a thing tbh.
---
More likely he\`s horde on stalagg and enjoys corpsecamping lowbies.
---
You say it's a bad plan because they are paying customers and blizzard shouldn't put them in a que. Blizzard has already done this for months with paying customers so your argument doesn't have any legs to stand on...
---
Benediction brah
---
Yes. All the time. It's very common for rogues to have these issues. There are ways to try get around this, by doing sub optimal prebissing, avoiding the incredibly difficult dungeons to get invites to like UBRS and getting the best available gear from other dungeons. Also quite a few things can be 2 or 3 manned. For example 2 manning angerforge for HoJ with 2 rogues, or 3manning DM tribute with 2 rogues 1 druid(can also be 2manned as rogue+druid with good gear and proper spec, but I'd suggest 3manning)
---
You don't spec healing to level. It's just a waste. You will level slower and not heal noticeably better. No matter what healer class you pick just go with the best DPS spec for levelling and keep a seperate set with int/of healing gear on it to heal. I healed every single dungeon on my way to 60 without any points in resto except Furor, and the difficulties I faced were never healing ones.
---
This theory crafting in here is absolutely 200IQ. 
---
/Giphy popcorn
---
No doubt. Original vanilla WoW was run by private company with a reputation to uphold. Classic, and everything Warcraft forever, will be minimal effort cash grabs. Ironically this attitude has destroyed retail WoW subscriber # and reputation, but I guess publicly traded companies today like quick cash cows, no longevity, at least in this industry.   
---
I'm mostly surprised no one else cares. There are almost no posts on here or on the Blizzard boards about it. Do major streamers' guilds all cross faction collude? Is that why none of them speak of this?
---
It goes both ways, just got rolled by a 5-man twink group with a 60 to help and I'm horde.
---
Hahaha. The only toxic kid here is you.
---
This is why I say its flawed, its impossible to have a fair fight in WOW 90% of the time
---
I have yet to see a single convincing argument against Faction based queues. Just a bunch of ad hominem and nonsensical arguments. 
---
The backfire scenarios that  have been presented here are nothing compared to the dire circumstances some servers are already facing.
---
The fact is, in actual vanilla, very few really knew how the honor system worked when it came out. NO ONE knew how OP the gear was and that it would last into BC before much of it was obsolete.
---
Now we have the gift of hindsite and every unemployed neckbeard on the server is camping Gadgetzan mercilessly.
---
Your confirmation bias is so idiotic. On the other end, I lost 2 MH's to a Hunter and a level 58 warrior before I decided to farm a UBRS key and make my own groups.
---
If you think making groups (a pain in the ass in comparison to just joining and AFKing) and having a UBRS key is "bringing nothing to the table" you're a clown. 
---
&gt;while reserving everything
---
Who the fuck is talking about reserving everything? People usually reserve 1 or 2 items max lmao.
---
Servers the same general size as vanilla not 9k players crammed into the same world that was only designed to hold 3k players.
---
You aren't spamming it then.
---
Rested xp caps at 150% of a level
---
not sure why anyone is surprised. world pvp was shit 15 years ago, and still is. should have just launched BGs. my world pvp experience so far is killing 2 random people out in the world and dying 5000 times going to mc, since our 40 player raid wasnt enough to kill the hordes 90000 player raid in BRM on our 30/70 imbalanced server.
---
very exciting.
---
"Gear and skill isn't everything" - More like "gear isn't everything."
---
A skilled DPS warrior would not be pulling aggro so easily. There are many times when you can't just open with WW and instead should single target them down. 
---
But also, if he had enough plate equipped, he should have been able to take quite a few hits and you should have been able to continue focusing on the other targets.
---
Bullshit. Even at 5 AM Horde is camping everything.
---
I’m on Arcanite Reaper, a US PvP server that is at medium capacity at the most so no log in queues. The last time I looked it was about 52-54% alliance. I can’t say for certain how the economy compares to others but I haven’t seen anything on the auction house that’s ridiculously priced. Yeah some people sell things for way too much, like silk cloth for 2+ gold a stack, but it’s also always available at about 40 silver a stack.
---
And when this ever happen in pvp-realm? Pvp id never fair.
---
Its not so much the thoughts of others, its the rude fucks who cant keep their negative thoughts to themselves and lash out at others in disagreement
---
It was also PvP in phase one, you know. The only difference now are the rewards, and once people realize how much honor they need to grind to obtain mediocre rewards even by MC standards, they won't even waste the time to dismount to kill an afk player, unless they were already doing that in phase one for the sheer joy of it.
---
Let's be real honest.
---
90% of the time, the reason someone is whispering you to ask for a party, it isn't for the benefit of the person being whispered. As much as the people whispering might couch it as such, that isn't what is at the forefront of their mind. When you understand that, and that the people who routinely do this aren't actually interested in anything but paying lip service to politeness, it becomes obvious that they are just copy pasting whispers down the who list with no regard to whether or not they've already bothered someone.
---
It's the MMO equivalent of cold calling, and if you understand why it's annoying to take time out of your day when people won't stop calling you, you will understand why people aren't interested in receiving whispers when they are an in demand tank/role.
---
Take this on board or don't. I don't really care.
---
The addon is definitely not useless.
---
Being able to detect any players in range without even being able to see them is a very significant advantage*. If I know I'm outnumbered/outmatched I can stealth or try to run far away before the enemy comes close to me.
---
^(*not a game-breaking advantage, but still to the point the addon should be broken/banned somehow IMO)
---
You just proved my point. 
---
- you offered ZERO feedback
---
- and went straight to ad hominem
---
I’d love to hear your brilliant take. Please, enlighten us.
---
It won’t show under “Today” 
---
If you look at “yesterday” and “this week” it will show honor underneath honorable kills.
---
Someone else would have to give more clarity on “Standing” though
---
&gt;with plenty of Alliance player around
---
So you\`re Horde. It explains a lot.
---
There needs to be a reasonable balance of horde to alliance. To do this there needs to be an incentive to play the under represented faction.
---
Currently there is only incentive to play the dominant factions. Faction based queues will be effective. Players are quitting on both sides due to the current situation. The players who decide to quit due to faction balancing will be solving the issue. Collateral damage so to speak. I believe most people will adjust to the balancing system knowing things will be better.
---
it's not instanced but it's in fatigue range, some people manage to get there
---
This is exactly how Sony has handled faction balance in Planetside since 2003, and it works fine.
---
What's the site that shows the faction balance/imbalance again? Sorry, can't find the link
---
And here we come to the crux of the issue:  How exactly is PvP defined?  You seem to be under the assumption that a fight is only "PvP" if there are roughly similar numbers and ability levels of the player characters that square off against each other in a pitched battle.  Expecting everyone to accept this quite narrow definition of the term is naive.
---
Weightstones just increase the base damage of a weapon so it doesn't have any effect on feral DPS.
---
Oh look it's this video again
---
I literally been saying this like 6-7 years now, so I feel like my IP has been stolen. Never heard it outside of my friend group
---
your an idiot but i'll give u at least one point here,about classic's "population" but u can also blame the hype. but my point is still valaid. ganking has been in warcraft since vanilla up till BFA. i stand by that point,as i said before u have absoultely no counter to it. because ganking has been around for 14 years.
---
I signed up on PVP because its what all my friends are on, and ive been told that PVP is the "real experience" for classic wow. Besides why shouldnt I be surprised that a PVP system in one of the worlds most popular games that has been getting updated for 10+ years is still unfair and broken after all this time? Either way, you admitted that unfair PvP is how it is in WoW 90% of the time and I highly doubt its going to change since people still praise it anyway, sad that Blizzard continues to support a system that allows for these sorts of unfair fights.
---
Which server, if I may ask?
---
Isn't it heavily horde bias?
---
This is the best way to undercut someone, to keep prices from tanking.  Undercutting by 1c or 1g still means theirs is sold after yours.
---
People who get mad about this don't understand economy
---
learn to read
---
I did 1  4man UBRS Jed and emberseer run and got my reed. 
---
1 tribute run got staff and helm (for pvp)
---
1 boss kill in bed for shoulders
---
2 school runs got witchblade and wand.
---
8 strath runs for helm
---
I still don’t have gloves I’ve done school like 10 times and ones at least 10 times for either caster gloves but still no luck
---
Personally dig the way female dwarfs look.
---
It’s the running animation that kills Em for me. Looks like they pooped themselves while running.

videos are good and informative but I don't think that dude is a good mage or has any talent

Just start a new character.

Im rocking my T1 warlock set pieces with pride and give no single shit about omnicast boots. I like the additional stats and fire resi from Rend.

I'd prefer most epics over some ass shit greens with shadow wrath.

---
seems like alliance get all the good translations xD
---
transfer was aborted, instance not found
---
I’ve seen ppl selling for 1000-1300. It’s worth a lot but someone has to actually want to spend the money on it.
---
Pandaren Brewmaster is literally a recruitable hero in TFT expansion what are you even talking about.
---
I literally spent hours in trade chat offering free gold to anyone who would duel me outside of Org and couldn't get a fight. This was prime time on Incendius. Having fun in WoW is totally dead unless your fun comes from a couple very specific things.
---
I still remember the swifty video on illidan, with a 2hander and slam.  
---
Yeah. BC really started the optimization. I think it even started quite earlier, in AQ40.
---
Soon? No
---
I want to be in a guild with that priest
---
Which is stupid as fuck if you ask me. Vanilla wasnt x-realm.
---
There is nothing in the game now to spend gold on for a lot of us 60s, we have all our gear we can buy, we have consumables for months on our alts so 1000k gold now isn't that big a deal. Investing that gold into a way to make 14g a day for the rest of the lifetime of classic is worth far more then 1000g sitting in a person's bank.
---
Yeah
---
Not to mention people progressed much faster than before because everything was already known. When I was leveling in vanilla, three months after release I maybe saw one or two people with an epic mount. Now I see tons of people with epic mounts and full T1 around. Especially epic mounts make a big difference because a level 60 can always easily catch you.
---
Oops, EU.
---
No, the ones that were brought back within a day by changing the way that they worked.
---
Errr they’re okay for nightfall.
---
Hunters have the best uptime. Than Shamans/Warriors.
---
Spelladin is your best bet as ret.
---
Use distract
---
And now you’re insulting my intelligence. The guy was snarky, he wasn’t being mean. You, out of no where, insulted him. 
---
You can call that guy whatever you want. But he had a different opinion and both him and the OP were being rude to one another. You came out of the wood work and immediately insulted him and the called him a bad person.
---
You are the bad person. You literally can’t write a comment without inserting an insult. It’s incredible.
---
Did you look at the chart?  You can play less aggressively and hit 7.  Then push hard for two weeks.
---
The idea is not to race to R9 but slowly rank up til you max out at 6 or 7 then push for a bit.  Instead of pushing for 10 weeks, you are already close when you start
---
Dont have that yet :(
---
Nah I’m Canadian I heard a kiwi yell that at me once tho that’s why I said it
---
MC bosses don't last much longer than a dungeon boss on retail with a good group, you can go to town with heals there.

I would hate to play this game if I had your view of the community. This is coming from someone that tanks / heals more often than dps and use /4 and pms to group. Back in the day we had no problem conversing in pms like people to form a group, and atm Ive never had a negative lash out when pming someone to ask to form a group yet. Maybe I'm on a friendlier server, who knows.
---
When I am forming groups I try and make sure everyone benefits and I really, really doubt that I am literally the only player like this.
---
Same here on Venoxis-EU. People duelling most of the time in front of OG, especially since layer removage.
---
Wowhead has been doing census scraping, it might not be accurate, but its probably close.
---
But phase 3 has WSG and AV
---
Faction queue really not a hard concept.
---
Found this on another forum, seems to explain it well... 
---
&gt;I don’t think that will work any more. Hunter’s Mark will trigger the global cooldown, so your macro won’t be able to immediately cast any other abilities that are also affected by the global cooldown (like Aimed Shot). To get two or more abilities to fire off with a single keypress, only one can be on the global cooldown. For instance, you can have a macro that does
---
&gt;/cast Hunter’s Mark
---
&gt;/petattack
---
&gt;/cast auto shot
---
&gt;because petattack and Auto Shot aren’t affected by the global cooldown.
---
&gt;I think the best you could do would be to have a macro that casts Hunters Mark if a modifier like Control or Shift is pressed, and casts Aimed Shot if the modifier is not pressed:
---
&gt;/cast [mod:shift] Hunter’s Mark
---
&gt;/cast [nomodifier] Aimed Shot
---
&gt;You’d have to press it twice, and wait for the global cooldown to run out before pressing it the second time, but it would get both those abilities onto one key.
---
Yeah, the I has an accent on it (ì) and the small L might actually be a big i. Might already be enough to not be detected
---
Ah my mistake then, thought they were all in P4
---
Is Boston in Austrailia?
---
what are you farming in stocks? I'm wondering how to make money at 60 as my warrior is the only thing that will be there for a long time &gt;.&lt;
---
&gt;I logged onto my human rogue 
---
Lol okay guy who can avoid every unfavorable encounter besides landing at a flight path. Lost me in the first sentence.
---
It’s fun in the sense that it feels “organic” and adds to the living breathing feeling of the world.
---
But yes it Gould’s down to who has more bodies. Pretty much it.
---
Imagine being an elitist prick and looking down your nose on deathbone.
---
I agree with this advice, but they specifically asked what they should use in their OH when using Krol Blade in MH. Not really sure why I got downvoted...
---
Using science and numbers/math and calculating probabilities and actual scenarios rather than "people are snowball effecting" and such. There's no actual study or science to back up this claim, thus, a harsh theory at best. 
---
Feel free to down vote me with the same emotions that you used to calculate your assumed numbers, scenarios and solutions tho :( 
---
/Troll
---
100v100 isn't that much fun, either, tbh.
---
Always a horde player that types out a dumbass response like this lmao
---
I mean, the earlier raids in wow didnt lend good to trying out stuff. Especially cloth casters can only do shadow and frost damage, because of the fire resistance of the bosses.
---
AQ40 is the moment the min/maxing REALLY starts.
---
What are the future options besides DFT?
---
I'm on benediction what's the spread on that one cause it seems alliance heavy...or at least they seem to be winning most of the time
---
I love fully ranked healing wave in 5 mans
---
Heal, afk for half an hour, heal again
---
Without cooldowns sure but if you have improved Sprint up and a blind it's gg. Your a stealth class you can wait and fight on your terms.
---
Who said they went straight to bed?  
---
They logged off to spend time and have sex with their girlfriends / partners.  
---
Its easier for Horde. They don't have to log off to have sex with their partner, since this game can be easily played with one hand  
---
XD XD XD
---
I mean in some aspects it's fair (i.e. raid night, no different from a night out with the boys or a poker night). But if you're ignoring your family entirely, yeah, something's wrong.
---
im sure theyll enjoy their 30 minute AB queues.
---
Nope. He's right. Listen to the grown up.
---
The game can only be so immersive. as for the Lore of the game. Horde and Alliance are in fact at war.
---
My bad guys. Didn't realize hunter pets don't lose line of sight unless you vanish. That's cool to know
---
Because wpvp and getting corpse ganked for hours are 2 completelly different things...
---
I just wanna level to 60 (Currently 53) but finding a dungeon is impossible. Questing is literally impossible as 99% of FPs are being camped currently.  I dont really want to nor do I have the time to just 'Make a new character' on a PvE server. I enjoy pvp I just dont enjoy this mindless bullshit
---
Take a drink everytime someone cries about their "Classic experience"
---
Guess the saying of having your cake and eating it to applies.
---
Well, in that case it IS greener over there.  So, instead of trying to take it for yourself, ask them how they got it so green.  Then you can do that to yours!
---
Hi, /u/Coach__Mcguirk

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxdyx5/powerleveling_services_are_buying_ad_time_on/). 
---
no my wife's boyfriend told me, if i didn't make that reddit comment he would have cancelled my wow sub and limited my nintendo switch privilege to 20 minutes a night.
---
Maybe move back into your moms basement then loser?
---
is there a way to see what his gear is?  3.7k hp is A LOT.
---
I mean 10 years to look back at it and say "Hmm maybe this isnt so good" and they still left it the way it was, I can understand that somewhat because its supposed to be no changes but still I wish theyd atleast think about it. Also im not upset that people "like different things then me" im upset that they are willing to play and support something that in their own words is "unfair" or "broken" just because "thats the way it always has been" and arent willing to see it from the point of view of someone from the outside
---
i did the same today. gave a guy 30 g for his mount and 10g that he isnt broke after purchasing. he is lvl 51 and first time player :) he was super thankful. 
---
helped him with some quests beforehand :) people are nice if you let them.
---
because we knew we wanted this
---
Here’s the thing dude. You’re making all these assumptions about the dude by inferring these nefarious things from sarcastic comments.
---
You on the other hand are outright being rude.
---
The OP of this thread is a a condescending asshole. Look at all his comments to anyone who disagrees with him.  If anything HES the one who thinks only his opinion matters. Get a grip dude. Stop insulting people just because you disagree with them. 
---
You’re never going to teach someone a lesson by insulting them. Why would anyone listen to someone who in there very first interaction calls them an asshole? Like think about it.
---
You can pretend you were being benevolent but you just saw a chance to chime in and repeatedly insult someone.
---
I bet I could go die in IF too.
---
Then spend time with your family! Stop complaining about a 15 year old mmo not being created to specifcally appease parents who have 2 children and a partner lol.
---
Nah. You’re either ganking if you’re doing wrong. Shit &lt;POWER&gt; will gkick you if you’re not no-lifing the game
---
The battle never ended.
---
By all means show where they started working again, every forum post and reddit thread I can find says they stopped working around Sept 19th and never started again.
---
Did recent private servers have item/talents rework in place from the start like classic?
---
Super rough without the 100%. You're going to need to mount earlier to get away, which means you can't extend as far. It also means during a rout you can't chase down/frost shock enemies as easily.
---
Generally speaking I watch mages. They are the play makers. If you see a lot of midgets with ice shields starting to move around at the front expect a rush. Ditto goes for your mages.
---
When I'm hunting honour, I try to stay mounted during the rush and push past the initial frost novas, the enemy should be in a panic by now. Pick a target that's full health, not a mage/paladin. Frost shock and then chain lightning. If there's still targets left, second frost shock for 2-3 HKs.
---
Good answer :)
---
Your brother in law is a pussy
---
It just feels like it goes against the core idea of "classic wow"
---
Its weird enough to me that there's no keyrings, that battle.net works, that realm pop caps went from like 7k to 70k, that the "classic wow" launched using the 1.12 talent build instead of trickling out changes as they actually occured... 
---
Then to throw these kind of ideas out, actually expecting blizzard to do it... Where's it end man?
---
cross server queues so sorry buddy we get instant pop too
---
[http://ironforge.pro/](http://ironforge.pro/) is the only one I've found that seems remotely accurate
---
&gt;There were assholes on the internet in 2005, but Twitch and Youtube pushed the idea of being an asshole past the point of taboo. They think being the biggest shit you can is cool and the thing to do online. The full anonymity and displaced aggression of the internet has been realized in 2019.
---
Gimme a break.  The internet has only become less and less anonymous since 2005.  If you think any of this is true then you must not have spent any time on gaming forums/IRC channels in the early 00s.  This shit is nothing new.  You think the human condition has drastically shifted in the past 15 years?
---
Seems like a waste of time to me.
---
Why would u expect the same ex?
---
or every single player could just play horde. problem solved
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt;“My brother in law”
---
Sure mate, sure.
---
I did join a gank squad. Just roaming WPL killing solo players (how fun..) and the rare times we fought 5 vs 4-6 other, there would be 10 others joining them after 2min. I love PvP, but this is just boring imo. I waited more for the constant 2min res time then actually fighting the last 2 days.
---
Was referencing the guy telling me to switch to other servers because I had a different opinion, but sure, take 6 words out of what I said to get your comment in
---
Cool fake post for fake internet points.
---
Where can you get accurate data on server population?
---
Thanks for the tip, some random in general chat told me they had a V for detecting stealth
---
tanks dont really want much from scholo, and there aren't anything like orbs they can reserve like live strath.
---
Damn so your sister is actually a lesbian then right considering she is dating a pussy?
---
Come and get your kicks at route big ol crits.
---
As a Horde on Stalagg I’m ganked by alliance constantly.
---
Sure, there are less of them, but when farming they always farm in a group of two. Basically they’ll farm both resources and honor. High farm areas have at least three controlling the resource until enough horde overpower them. Oh and they’re all pvp spec with engineering. 
---
Why do TM when you can do world pvp as get as much if not more honor than Horde doing TM?
---
Do what my boy does and only invite clothies for aoe runs
---
Because i like pvp but I don't like to get corpse camped 7/24 without any chance to fight back. Today I went to WPL, instantly die after landing, got killed in graveyard 3 times and just logged off.
---
Look, I would sympathize with you if it weren't for how whiny you come off with your "no-lifer living in basement" statement. So sad that you BIL can't get to lvl 60 :( must be very hard for him
---
then start aggressively looking for a new one
---
But why?
---
I spent 52=&gt;60 entirely inside dungeons.
---
I suppose so, but seeing as they listed the Perd's second with a (don't ask) next to it, that sure made it seem to me like they weren't too interested in going daggers, hence why I just answered the question that they asked.
---
The problem is, many people decide to just quit after 3 days of not being able to play at all and they won't ever check back, resulting in even worse faction imbalance.
---
Lol, I use dash once Kromcrush aggros, the biggest issue I run into is unlucky stuns on my pet or his fear. Otherwise my pet will usually despawn.
---
Holy shit. I assume this is no longer in the game. Never heard of anyone ruining their character like that.
---
nah dude, didn't he tell you he's a C A S U A L?
---
I was rank 7 in high school, now i'm older with slower reflexes, a job, and bills to pay.  
---
I'll be lucky if I get rank 4
---
Welllll.... There's some buds in there and I don't kinda wanna ditch them, it's complicated
---
Omegalul
---
Rekt noob
---
intercept hamstring.  yes the mage will blink out the stun but they will be slow while you are not thanks to paladin friend assuming mage was bad and didnt sheep him.
---
You're forgiven.
---
“Can kill someone without them even pressing any keys” my class is shit
---
Because I have an unpopular opinion? And I have the logs to back it up? If people are gonna be THIS soft, I’ll just stay off this subreddit completely
---
The effect just breaks sadly
---
Just wait until the Wrath pre-launch event hits and it gets even worse.
---
I hope this doesn't come out wrong
---
but does anyone else feel like there's just not much to do right now?
---
I have all my pre-raid BiS and am attuned, like yeah I can farm and finish my professions as well as farm for gold or reps. I just don't feel like there's that much to do beyond that right now.
---
OmniCC + ClassicAuraDurations
---
I did too.  I may come back when BGs are released.
---
Do you want really refined gameplay with masterfully crafted and brutally challenging raid content? Retail.
---
Do you want a dated, yet charming game with far stronger MMORPG elements that’s more time investment/knowledge based? Classic.
---
Yes, I just said, non-lore heroes.
---
If youre not playing on pvp server; youre not playing wow right
---
Yeah man that’s the beauty of the Normal servers. You can just play your game and not worry about getting outnumbered 1:4. The 5% of the time you’re missing out on some actually enjoyable, spontaneous world PvP is not at all worth the 95% of the time you don’t even get to play the game as the minority faction
---
'Cares' said no one ever.
---
Casuals did hit 60, if you arent 60 by now you are just always going to be behind and blizzard waiting for people that play the game for \~30 mins a day would have been stupid as fuck.
---
Just spam dungeons. Lol, what a noob
---
Lmao. You don't understand what ad hominem means, dude. Saying your idea is horseshit isn't an ad hominem. Ad hominem is when you construct an argument based on a personal attack, and a personal attack is not an ad hominem in of itself.
---
Everyone has offered you the same feedback I have, but you just double down on your take. You're not here to have a discussion. You're here to feel like you're right about everything, which is fine, but don't pretend like you're listening.
---
The idea is horseshit, because it doesn't address the faction imbalance directly. It adresses a symptom with an artificial solution that locks more people out of the game, that would've been allowed to play otherwise. It also means that the servers aren't used to their full capacity if the balance always is supposed to be ~50%. 
---
Also, what about the players who *don't* PvP, and are only looking to PvE? Why should they be hit by this?
---
Assume the server cap is 10k. There are 6k Alliance and 10k Horde. Only 5k players of each faction can play at a time in order for it to be completely balanced. The last sentence isn't even strictly true. As I stated earlier, not every player is interested in PvP (especially zerging) so it could still be very unbalanced in practice.
---
No you don't understand, Alliance are champions of light and justice and therefore are literally incapable of being douchebags, and when they're the ones forming roaming death squads to 5v1 and camp whoever they can find it's a completely reasonable and justifiable response to the existence of those big ol' meanies of the evil Horde.
---
That's the one I was looking for. Thanks mate
---
It's just going to be an issue until blizz decides to implement bg's early (IMO within the next month)
---
The randomness of mobs turning around just as you get ready to do whatever it is you're doing is called 'life'. Sometimes your timing is perfect other times Mr Murphy takes a dump in your cornflakes. It adds to the game that everything doesn't work just the way you want it to, how boring if it did.
---
These posts are getting old, real fucking old.
---
60-40 won't have enormous queue times imo. Queue times shouldn't be bad since I'm pretty sure BGs are crossrealm.
---
That's really up to you. PvP out in the world will always be broken and unfair. If that's a problem to you, pick a PvE realm. If you still wanna be on a PvP realm for whatever reason, pick a realm with a big faction disparity and choose the winning faction.
---
Rolled my main on PvE server and just have a random alt on a PvP one for occasional fun. Best decision ever made.
---
Obviously I’m talking about the people online, all other people would be in the queue. This could be infinitely many people. There could be 10K alliance waiting to play, but can’t, while the alliance online can’t find a group. That’s the point. That’s why it’s unfair.
---
The percentage should be 50/50. 5k max alliance, 5k horde max on a server. This is plenty for everyone to find groups. There is no reason for horde to be able to take alliance slots on a server or vica versa.
---
You are right that it is late to implement this, but you are wrong that it is too late. This plus faction based transfers will solve a lot of the problems.
---
&gt; It’s just a shitty idea.
---
Then how come you have yet to make a single decent argument against it?
---
I assume you use NS for an instant chain lightning? Otherwise my issue is that they run out of range when my cast is done and it's cancelled.
---
World pvp has never been my thing. I mean I’ll never pass up a 1v1 or small scale group va group pvp but BGs is where it’s at. I can’t wait for that shit.
---
I'm surprised arcanite xmute only goes for 5, theres an earth to water from friendly with timbermaw that makes more than that and anyone can get is easily.
---
&gt; Op obviously didn't see this coming
---
Yes, he didn't. There were resources at his disposal and he didn't use them.
---
&gt;  I think this pvp disaster is a result of bad design
---
Yes it is.
---
&gt;  wouldn't be so stupid that it would literally turn into hell for the inferior faction to a point where it's literally unplayable
---
But it was.
---
&gt;it might die down in a few days
---
Exactly, it will.
---
&gt; Getting camped so much you can't even land from your flight path and get to your dungeon without dying 30 times 
---
This happened to entire RAID GROUPS in Vanilla. It's part and parcel of the game.
---
&gt; If you think I'm entitled because of that, then idk what to tell you
---
No, you don't know what to tell me. There is no solution to this problem aside from 1) asking for a redesign 2) making threads on reddit lamenting the solution, which *isn't a solution*. 3) Rerolling on a PvE server 4) Finding out how it was on honour launch back in the day and how camping was always a phenomenon.
---
Now which one of those four solutions are you pushing, or do you have one of your own? Too often people rant and spill emotion instead of pushing a workable agenda.
---
Everyone keeps saying that, but they also keep saying people are only doing this to hit max rank. Well someone bothered to math out the ranks it will take 12 weeks of something like 13000 honor a week to get to max rank so no, a couple of weeks is not going to change anything.
---
I would get mad I was being a well behaved player in PvP, never ganking anyone or such things, but this queue system meant that half my guild couldn't log in at the planned raid time. That would mean this artificial limitation to "fix" PvP was ruining my PvE experience.
---
That's just the first thing that springs to mind immediately, my non-PvP server doesn't have this problem, so perspectives may vary.
---
Half of Alliance leaves to Heartseeker and suddenly it's the Horde's fault.
---
this but unironically
---
Using both systems in conjunction would be ideal but only faction queues are necessary. 
---
There was a lot of noise early on predicting our current predicament but management was short sighted. 
---
Faction population caps is a system which would be most effective at the launch of a new server but still needs to be tied into an activity status. 
---
Without an active system in place, such as faction queues, faction imbalance will continue to be an issue.
---
The company stands to lose more players and more money with there current system.
---
The sooner they implement a true solution, the more players they will retain and be able to grow moving forward. Offering bandaid solutions simply antagonises the player base.
---
Pretty sure BGs will be cross realm
---
in the first vid did he get kicked ?
---
Roll on a pve server then.
---
Oh shut up
---
As a Hunter, Paladin bubble hearth is the norm; unless they’re extra bitchy and have friends.
---
Its not really randomness in my experience, its that they always go back and forth doing 180's and its legitimately impossible to sneak up behind them most of the time.
---
I noticed something funny today as a 52 warrior questing in un'goro.
---
When I was by myself every 60 would kill me on site. As soon as my 53 priest friend and I started questing and it was actually a fair fight they would run like pussies or in one case get 3 other 60s to camp.
---
This isn't pvp right now.  If there is even a chance of a fair fight I haven't seen a single engagement. The alliance on my server are only attacking when they cannot loose. It's just not fun and I love pvp.
---
No... I want to PVP with people I can actually have a fair fight with.
---
Just remember people aren't necessarily ganking you or him just to be "cancerous". They are trying to rank and unfortunately with Blizzard's decision to not introduce battlegrounds, this is the only way to do it.
---
Get them all to move, I’m sure there are tons of active guilds who would love active players
---
Pvp, what separates the men from the whiney youth
---
It took me 30 mins to even get inside BRD mate...
---
Probably not since almost all servers have more horde than alliance
---
You could invest your gold in other ways like buying items that will increase in value like heart of fire which goes for nothing now but in phase 5 will be transmuted to essence of fire on a 10m cooldown. I watches a video of a guy who spent/invested 25k gold in mats that will all go up in value
---
Guild is planning on doing Ony Wednesday and Thursday, so I assume it resets Thursday morning.  
---
If it just reset this morning for me, and I do it today, I'm guessing that it wont reset again until Thursday morning.
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
Wholesome, even in the face of opposition.
---
Just FYI that addon is buggy as hell, CharacterStatsClassic shows the same info and mimics the TBC char panel too.
---
I would say a good portion just aren't interested in pvp. Theres a good number of us who are hoping for more horde transfers so it's a bit more even as a lot of the time its 3:1.
---
I guess if you're just killing boars in the forest to level that might get you enough. But most people quest
---
Fordring + Rosewine. I can't answer your second question but I do know that the Druid T1 is especially bad for resto, there are better blues for a lot of the spots.
---
Then roll on a PvE server
---
This seems to be a server thing that is huge on some servers and very not on others.
---
Nope, 100% Alliance always have been and always will be. I’ll accept the shit storm of downvotes too because I know I’m not wrong. It really really sucks to be camped, it sucks to feel like you can’t play the game, but the fact is that is what happens on a PvP server and if you don’t want to play through that type of shit storm, you still have options they just aren’t the ones you want.
---
If the shoe fits...
---
Arcanite Reaper
---
Source?
---
Completely agree. I am raid logging and kinda leveling my alt when I dont feel like playing else after like 4 days of played at 60.
---
The only real thing to do would be farming gold for lotuses for later phases, but that is just so meh.
---
Alliance are just as bad. Firemaw have roaming gank squads of 20+ allies in every highlevel zone more or less all the time. Sure, they get no honor nor shame, but they get them kills. Lots of them.
---
don't be cringe
---
Isn't there DR on honor from same player kills? If your in the same BG for hours you cant really farm the same people over and over
---
Here was me thinking WoW was free of smug cunts.
---
It was a blizzard post that someone linked here I’ll try to find it
---
Despite the fact that these crazy high population caps are a HUGE change which dramatically alters (and worsens) world pvp.
---
As a horde player on skeram, the population is definitely not that slanted.  It is still horde dominant but i see a TON of alliance.  in fact in my 40s i thought alliance took over as the dominant faction because i saw more of them than horde.
---
Woosh
---
The horde / ally racials is enough to understand majority will be horde, proof was in the pudding years ago
---
So you're saying that "most" of a generation was born in the first couple years of said generation? So "most" of Gen Xers were born in the late 60s and gave birth in their teens to the 80s millennials (which span into the mid/late 90s) lol what?
---
And where does the 40 year boomer parents come from? A boomer from 1960 probably gave birth in the 80s (so early/mid 20s) which is millennial territory. Not all parents were teens when they gave birth lol.
---
Also dominant faction will put items on the neutral AH for coppers on the gold
---
My guess is that they CC'd him when he became immune through DR until it wore off? That would explain why they let him die while just yelling at people to not kill him instead of immediately re-casting MC.
---
You won't get your first opener Garrote until lvl 14 so opening fights isn't as important early and even then beware: You'll be unable to gouge effectively while they're bleeding which makes backstabbing difficult (especially at early levels).
---
Focus instead of using stealth early to bypass mobs to get to places/quest items that other classes need to kill to get to...distract at 22 helps a ton with this.
---
I'd recommend sword/mace and using sinister strike to build combo points and not focusing on stealth to start fights until you at least have Cheap Shot at lvl 26.
---
However...If you enjoy the ambush/backstab - daggers style of play just suck it up for a few levels til Ambush then stealth -&gt; Amb -&gt; Gouge -&gt; Backstab -&gt; Eviscerate
---
Also, get the Remorseless attacks talent as well for leveling for those juicy crits and it helps your up-time with either spec you choose.
---
Literally braindead. You might want to actually know what your class does before you complain about it on Reddit
---
Typical rogue player lul
---
I remember playing mmo in 2005. I was embarrassed to talk to people online. There was still that feeling of humbleness and social respect even online because it was new and people still obeyed the rules of social interaction and ethics. Nowadays that respect is gone in the internet because people know they are “invulnerable” so they have no precautions. Picture being so embarrassed that you felt flagging someone and attacking them in the game was rude and you couldn’t bring yourself to doing it.
---
2-4 days, or whenever the server is reset
---
Dunno why someone who was only gonna get to 35 two months into the game elected to play on a PvP server.
---
I played a rogue main all through beta and from launch of retail until the end of Cata. It is random. You get deferent levels of Stealth as you level up. Your initial one is terrible, they get better, also, if you get ranks in the subtlety skill to increase your stealth's effectiveness, it eases. It's just the life of the rogue. I get screwed by it from time to time despite all my experience. You'll get a feel for it the more you play. Keep at it.
---
Yeah there's really nothing inherently different about alliance and horde players, whoever's in the majority just makes life miserable for the minority
---
That's human nature
---
Why are you frustrated? I dont really understand.
---
He means eventually over servers will get BGs too, which gaurunteed closer level based PvP.
---
And they’ll still have a 30 minute que.
---
Don't roll on a PVP server if you know for a fact you're going to fall behind in leveling
---
Chain spam dungeons to level 60 and get gear so you can join in
---
You have no one to blame but yourself, it's not anyone else's fault that you don't have the time to play.
---
Nope we’re still the same griefers 15 years later lol
---
Welcome to WoW PvP
---
Well, what is done is done. It's already too late in that case.
---
Yeah I know it's crazy. Took me 9 deaths to get into MC on thursday. Some very well organized Alliance PvP guilds controlled most regions.
---
Wow
---
I don't know if I'd consider duels to be "fair" pvp. Some classes just have huge advantages in 1v1 situations.
---
You think you do but you don't
---
The game is designed to be fun. PvP can be a minor inconvenience and is absolutely subscribed to when you create a toon on a PvP server. This is fun and challenging to everyone. 
---
Griefing removes the challenge and fun from one player. It reaches beyond the game and becomes personal. 
---
When someone uses the PvP server argument, they aren’t understood what griefing is or are completely disregarding it
---
Hahaha
---
Me to 2006 Anu'brak server the warlock voidwalker buy following a vanished rogue all day
---
4pc T1, 2pc T2 and mageblade.
---
Lmao. Day 3. Q.Q
---
Sounds like someone didn't from launch because the moment honour was added, the exact same shitshow happened. TBH, the forums back then were just filled with stories of people having the absolute time of their lives and chaos reigning supreme. That's what I remember far more than the chaos. The posts are probably still there.
---
If you can't remember this, you may have joined a few months after launch.
---
No it isn't. At all. The gold is shit without ores. Good luck finding people who will do dm:e jump runs so you can get rtv.
---
Also strath live is waaaayy better gold run than dme. Nerfed drop rate lol? I just had 5 orbs drop in 1 run today and 4 orbs in the run prior. As well as a flask recipe and shadow reflector trinket.
---
I'm still waiting for your answer on what dungeon you would be running aside from strath live.
---
Kinda implied by the pvp bro. But it’s understandable no one expected it to be this savage. At least not the first timers
---
Holy shit, gatekeeping much?
---
You don't need to be 100% behind them. Come in 180-135 degrees and you can enter their back and do what you have to do. That's the fun of it.
---
Good to know!
---
Awesome man, thanks a lot!! I appreciate the reply! Keen to see more! Gl hf!
---
If you’re staying daggers then mainly the barmans shanker. But thrash blade/mirahs song will be better dps wise
---
Unless the damage isn't enough to break ice barrier before it comes back off CD.
---
Nope, I save NS for self healing. I usually ride up beside them before frost shock so I can get my swiftness cast off where possible. You'd really struggle to do that without 100% mount though.
---
It was fairly common 3 days ago
---
Corpse walking is a rite of passage
---
So the fastest way to get rank 14 is to get 13k rank points every week for 12 weeks right?
---
What's the thoretical floor on the number of HKs needed for 13k rank points in a given week?
---
I don't know man. I Maybe I have too much faith in people, but no ones THAT stupid.
---
Humble? I feel like I've been slapped in the face.
---
Your only good option is to reroll on a more balanced server and hope for paid xfers in a few months to bring your current character over.
---
You should have rerolled two months ago when everyone was pointing out how unbalanced the factions were on some realms.
---
I have a 60 resto Druid. Looking to make an alt. I like healing and dpsing. Currently looking at Shaman and mage. I only have the Druid which is a complex class (for pvp at least) so I’m unsure if I wanna make a shaman because it seems like another class of a lot of buttons. Any thoughts?
---
As cheeky as it sounds, *getgood.jpg?*
---
You can't expect to be competitive on a faction-competition pvp server without keeping up to date with the latest news, patch notes, and important release dates. You missed some very important news in a game you play and that has unfortunate consequences.
---
Ok.
---
That answer is trash of course, but if you are lvl 35 by now, you are already progressing at a snails pace basically. but there is nothing wrong with that i guess. The Fact that u are new to the game doesn't help with that much either. Just keep on mate, there is no rush really. Also the ganking will get better with time hopefully, now people are just way too hyped. When you get to the kill=honor range, trying to lvl in the outside world is gonna be a miserable experience though I'm afraid x(
---
Yes, this guy didn't play from launch. Honour launch (Call to War?) was one of the most memorable patches, people came out in droves and neutral towns became deathzones. Fights were longer because everyone was poorly geared and couldn't mana up as fast as people swarmed in. It was glorious. It was probably shocking to many. It will pass.
---
Ok. I don’t agree with a ton of that but this isn’t worth my time.
---
The dude was an asshole. Plain and simple. It wasn’t sarcasm it wasn’t anything he was incredibly rude and as you can see from all the downvotes it would spear many agree. He added absolutely nothing to the conversation and was dismissive and condescending from start to finish. 
---
Judged by your responses it seems like you are likely his alt account.
---
I'm 25 years younger than the youngest of boomers.
---
Ah that makes sense, cheers for clarifying. Friends are on this server so it's a tough one
---
Most people have no idea what it takes to rank up and are going to give up quickly.
---
I don't think you really can. This is just from an educated guess.
---
Same faction griefing conveniently cut out, good work.
---
World PVP and helping your friends.
---
Reroll PvE then.
---
Conquest got banned in the first two months of vanilla for exploiting molten core speed runs and boss skips. It was not that different:
---
Unlike the actual solution that is implemented now:
---
 "make it so the Alliance can't play so they quit or roll Horde" 
---
Brilliant take there, cheesecake.
---
Vanilla Warriors are solo doormats but battleground kings
---
Oh man, that sounds rough for alts.  T_T
---
What are some of biggest US pve servers for alliance?
---
If its the only thing, I suggest using the 18s invis pots, on my realm they are not much more expensive than the other ones :p
---
You’re way too late. Maybe a month ago you’d have time to quest and level up. But now, you’re gonna get ganked at every flight path, including faction cities. If you roll alliance, you’re not safe anywhere. 
---
If you do decide to roll on PvP server at least use the Spy Addon so you know how fucked you are when you’re roaming around
---
Lol you think the Horde are gonna move.
---
I am loving it.
---
I hope they don't release BGs for 3 months at least, that way someone can get High Warlord purely through world PvP.
---
Yup - I don't quite get why people bother with this
---
The Same people who say pvp happened on a pvp server are the ones who run away when they are facing a 1v1 scenario but will /spit and camp that same player when they have 3 or 4 buddies.
---
Pve servers exist
---
It takes what like a day to get to 20 ish. Just group and quest.
---
There's no way this would be bannable as griefing, I refuse to believe it
---
Doesn’t that site require that they sign up on that website first?
---
Yeah appreciated the communication!
---
Lets expand on this :D and bring a nice community to Earthshaker eu!
---
You average cs rep doesn't have the authority to make policy decisions on the fly like that.
---
Would be pretty nice if people did that
---
Not with a full squad of alliance kneeling in a corridor for you to battle the king
---
Already cancelled my subscription. I like PVP but when servers are as unbalanced as they are, it really kills it. I find no joy in being killed at flypoints, on boats, in neutral cities, corpse camped for hours. I am a 52 hunter and I cannot fight back. Ill keep my money and go back to other games. The nostalgia was good while it lasted, but I am to old for this shi...
---
I deffo have fun with enh shaman.
---
Onyxia and MC are both on fixed resets. MC is every 7 days, while Ony is every 5 days. If Ony resets on a Monday, you can kill her any time between monday and friday, and still kill her again on saturday when it resets again.
---
It resets for the entire server at the same time every 5 days.
---
you mean to tell me......they took...turns...with the prisoner?  :O
---
I expected alliance to have higher standards...
---
For sure, and I'm glad I'm not on one :)
---
&gt;They rushed out phase 2 when they should have waited until casuals reached 60. 
---
They are probably trying to time it around 8.3 release. Could be planning a December release for that, then January or February for Phase 3.
---
Nah, don't want it easy for me but the solution of making me quit or roll a faction that is awful to me isn't a solution. 
---
I love how this subreddit was all "people bitching so much is how we got retail!" And what do you all do constantly? Bitch. Seems like it's Alliance too that seem to think if they cry enough all there problems will go away.
---
Sorry you chose the wrong faction, I didn't choose Horde for ez mode I chose Horde because I didn't want to be on the side filled with carebares.
---
Jesus I am so glad I have rolled on pve.
---
Most are absolutely not imprant or even used for anything.  Peons and Civilian Novice Warriors, nearly all of the low levels civilians are decorations to make the world feel less empty.
---
Also they can suspect there is something there and suddenly turn towards you and face you.
---
Stand still and don't pickpocket them when they do this, or move back and round at them from the side.
---
Play with it. You'll soon pick it up.
---
Are you asking how to do it or are you saying you don't like to set it up that way ?
---
If you want to do it, Bartender4 is the most famous addon for that. It lets you freely move every single action bar and change how they look.
---
Yeah, considering it my man, especially since one fail = gold lost. As a matter of fact, the 18s ones were cheaper for some time on my server. Disturbing to see, but it happened!
---
Idea for your channel: the safest fastest route (11m) for beginners, a lot of them are going to try to emulate your 7.17 but that's off the rails for a newcomer.
---
I would also be very interested
---
Didnt mean to be snarky, just seen this a few times today :)
---
It doesn’t promote anything. Things like this happen. Regardless of what you believe, you scrolling down the comments telling people it’s fake, when you don’t even know, is dumb as fuck. Get over yourself.
---
Would also like to see servers with Vanilla concurrent player caps. Then those of us who do not want massive changes to the game can reroll there.
---
oh, fair enough
---
Im buying the one in the bottom
---
Its not that bad. With an invis potion, you can get to BRD in one or two corpse hops.
---
The macros here will work
---

---
Exactly why you should roll on a PvE server and stop whining.
---
Just dinged 40 - Where, as a rogue, do I get my mount?
---
Maybe look into priest. Might be less buttons. Shaman can raidheal, PvP and dungeon DPS in the same spec though
---
I'm on a pve server and really the only way you'll get somewhat of a fair fight is bgs
---
Falcorn wasn't a paladin tho
---
But that's not the #ClassicExperience. Blizzard should have the phases pushed out in such a way that the same % of people will experience the highest end content as it was back then. So few guilds cleared AQ before Naxx came out, now people are going to be bitching when naxx gets announced cuz " i have a full time job  and my guild hasnt cleared AQ40 yet, too fast blizzard too fast!" 
---
On one hand people are complaining that blizzard isnt doing things the same as it was in vanilla, but then on the other hand they want the content to be released as slow as originally, but now people are much more informed and efficient regarding how to play the game.  There are 50+ guilds on each faction on my server who have full cleared MC AND LOGGED IT. The amount of guilds that had cleared MC when BWL came out back in vanilla was probably a handful at best.  Already a much higher % of the player base is experiencing the cutting edge than back in the day, it shouldnt be this way. People are begging blizzard to let casuals catch up, but in fact, they're already too slow. The game should not be balanced around people who play 3 hrs per week.
---
I think they will if they can't just run around ganking people for hours at a time with a numerical advantage. If their targets dry up I think they might jump to another, slightly less horde heavy server in hopes of being able to keep camping most of the medium-high level zones.
---
and you DID think and that was all you came up with? real intelligent.
---
Word - quit just because of the same reasons. Fuck this :)
---
Unexpected Stockholm Syndrome!
---
Your username is self reflection, obviously
---
&gt;No one in the real world is gonna give you what you want for free.
---
Lmao. Except this isn't the real world and people who don't need your item will join your reserved group whether you have the key or not. You malding over it won't change a thing.
---
Rekt
---
AB would be more than enough to hold people over for a few months.
---
Most people will give up grinding honor for ranks in a few weeks.
---
Lowbies are also a mediocre source of honor, but for now most people don't really understand the honor system and just go for HKs.
---
It's been three days and the drop off is already visible.  As in the camping and impossible areas are getting closer to what they were on Wednesday.  It will never go back to what it was but this is pvp.  What did you expect?  This was always possible before and sometimes was.  Players are going back to their farming and grinding.  Come reset, they will be raiding.  It will be glorious to see  BRM on Tuesday night.  If a guild really wants world buffs before zoning it, they'd better log out there Monday.
---
It really isnt. Its a minor part.
---
Not for quite a few months *at the very least*. By the time xfers are available your guild will be full.
---
The whole set is nice for PvP. You can go up to 5 pieces np. Most of them just aren't that good for raiding. The bracers are really the only piece that's better than pre-raid bis. The others are either worse or pretty much equivalent to pre-raid bis.
---
&gt;  You think the human condition has drastically shifted in the past 15 years?
---
Yes. Quite largely so on-top of that.
---
Same on Benediction but I'm Horde and the population is pretty balanced. I'm also 58 and last night after playing a total of 3 hours, I only gained 1 bar of XP and died 17 times in 3 different zones.
---
Dang, not sure how I'm gonna do that. I have managed to run up and cast a quick CL when my faction pushes but I very rarely get openings for it.
---
Might have to stick to 1v1s out in the world, those 199 are juicy.
---
You have kids? You should be able to reach rank 7 mainly playing on weekends. Should also become easier after a while, when people get bored of world PvP.
---
Will be fixed tomorrow. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-calculations/364258
---
Surely you knew it would happen though. Why not roll pve and do BGs when they come out?
---
Main 57 runs to get hoj. Alt got it in first run at lvl 51.
---
Main did 78 runs to get True strike. Alt havnt seen them, at 19 runs.
---
Also it's likely that they have an add-on that tells them the best price to put theirs on for. TSM comes with a 1c less as standard. Probably done automatically.
---
And I didn't expected this and rolled pvp, what exactly is your point? Is it ok that one faction is literally unplayable because some people expected it?
---
When people clicked the PVP server button what the fuck did they think was going to happen
---
He didn't ask for optimal leveling. If you want to level a warrior optimal, it is one of the most complicated classes to play, because you will have to use that tendon strike thing and then backward jumpaddle while to minimize hits you take to reduce downtime. As well as you will have to do Melee Cleave runs.
---
Kromcrush is pretty solid. It's like 55/45 H:A right now, but the alliance gives a really good fight here. I suspect a lot of them are just better players than some of the ones on horde, honestly. Granted, we win the pvp zergfests and you will be mercilessly camped, but the allys on krom are no joke. Much respect for them.
---
Roll alliance on kromcrush, they could use more numbers!
---
Okay, so if faction based login was implemented, then there's a theoretical scenario where some people on one side never get to play. 
---
How much does this solve? This assumes that everyone is interested in WPvP, which is certainly not the case. There could still be a major imbalance if one faction is more PvP hungry than the other. Many 60's are focused on instanced content as well, and not WPvP. So, just because it's 50/50 distribution, doesn't mean that there is going to be a 50/50 representation in the open world.
---
Why do you think that every single player in the game spent hours and hours researching this stuff? Not to mention the prevailing attitude was "PvP is the real experience you will 100% regret PvE".
---
T1 is good for pvp
---
It's not, it's literally a big huge of the world.
---
Late comment, but do you have any indication of which herbs spawn in DM:E? I'm levelling my herbalism at the moment, but I don't know which level I have to get before I can pick up all the herbs in there.
---
&gt;Even if the server isn't full, don't allow Horde to log in if it would push the ratio beyond that point
---
Nope, you lost me here.
---
Give Alliance priority login sure, but don't lock out people indefinitely just because they play horde.
---
Realistically, he can get all of your information just from your character name. Even in video games you should be careful who you’re an asshole to.
---
And druid?
---
Sure, I said PvE. PvP gear is obviously different. But what OP said is basically equivalent to “I’m going to pvp in all shadow wrath greens even though I know they’re worse because they have a green border on their tooltip!”.
---
This is why I play and always will play PvE and WM off. People think, "Haha PvP servers are cool because everyone plays on them, i will get to 60 and then gank noobs till they rage." For the most part, we ARE the noobs.
---
Don't play on a type of server because that type is popular. Play on the type of server you will enjoy.
---
Especially as the high value honor targets won't be in quest zones.  Do I want minor honor for a Scout or Private?  Or do I want the higher honor from killing R5+ players?  Right now, everyone is worth the same honor.  In two weeks there will be a huge spread.
---
Yeah, I honestly don't know what the solution is other than faction based queue systems based on server population. But that seems rather extreme to me.
---
I'm sure it does, but I imagine it happens to alliance much more than it happens to horde
---
update please?  been looking around for it
---
Its not about the color of the tooltip alone though.  
---
Its about the visual appeal.  
---
The set-bonus (even if its not that powerful).  
---
The additional stamina allows for mistakes and lifetaps in raids.  
---
The additional int gives me crit and mana.  
---
The magic resistance is dope with master summoner in pvp.  
---
Combined I do my fair square of damage in raids.  
---
Most damage from warlocks comes from percent increases anyways and I have 300 spelldmg.  
---
I dont really like the greens with 3-5 more spelldmg and no other stats.
---
Fucking hell can you mongs stop bleating on about this like a stuck record. 
---
The guy is maybe looking for a bit of advice or reassurance. Stop being a fucking asshole about it.
---
No I know how to do it, I just don’t like the layout
---
Please stop with this crap.  I did 2 hours in Felwood and not once was I camped as a 53.  Sure, tons of alliance and probably died a ton but it wasn't enough to stop me from playing and I had more equal fights than I've had in months.
---
Using science and numbers to calculate WHAT though? Probabilities of what? What kind of scenarios?
---
You offered absolutely nothing, your post just sounds like it was taken from r/iamverysmart. You wrote something that sounds intelligent and deliberate but ultimately you didn’t come even remotely close to suggesting anything.
---
Well if cap the gy:s that actually make it harder to win, sure. No one frowns upon people capping /towers back
---
Depends on your race
---
Do you actually have a source for blizzard saying that?
---
This is such a stupid idea it's unreal. Horde is the more popular faction in general, so them transfering woudn't even solve shit as eventually you run out of places to go. You'd just punish players for.. wanting to play horde?
---
ps: I'm alliance.
---
Its mostly fine tbh. This sub on the other hand seems to have collected a rather dense mass of smug cunts for some reason.
---
It's a valid thing to not know. Sorry for everyone being fuckfaces
---
There's really only one server that isn't heavily skewed Horde: Heartseeker.
---
No one, especially Horde PvP tryhards, are going to put themselves in the situation they've been inflicting. As evidenced by OP, they'd much rather spend 4 hours lazily farming than 4 hours fighting.
---
Auction house tax can eat away a lot of that margin.
---
Seems like your raid should have zoned out to escort them in.
---
Does it include reduced honor for repeated kills?
---
Well I would say you have two main choices.
---
1) learn to tank and enjoy it
---
2)stop tanking and say you are DPS.
---
I'd go with option 1 with a push to trying to join groups as DPS as often as possible 
---
Good luck hope this all sorts itself out one way or another for you
---
Hey are you the guy from that gaming forum?
---
No way! Osmond is my buddy, Lolol.
---
Lmao doesn't though I'm not offended just confused
---
Incendius is definitely not alliance leaning, the horde simply dont work together. Its been a fun couple days rolling over Yang Gang and Goon Squad groups and making them flee to another zone, just to go mess them up there too.
---
How dare you!
---
The set bonus and crit are still worth less SP than just wearing the shadow wrath. Health/mana aren’t issues in PvE.
---
I agree wear different gear for PvP but shadow wrath is just objectively better in every possible way in raids.
---
But that is just a symptom of too many people not quitting Classic. Everyone was saying that higher pop servers would have unbalanced pvp. The increased popcaps are actually not \#nochanges approved, and some have argued that the low pop caps are actually EXTREMELY important in maintaining Vanilla accuracy.
---
That was the only possible outcome of rolling on a PvP server. That is what 90% of wPvP is and always has been.
---
If you want PvP other than ganking low level players and corpse camping in groups, that's what BG's are for.
---
I'd invite him.
---
No thank you I enjoy having a liver.
---
is this the coyote pack leader with the +15 damage buff?
---
And yet for some reason people think flying killed wpvp.
---
World pvp is awful in this game. There is no skill, no strategy, no competition.  If you have more players of higher level you win.  Period.
---
World pvp died because in vanilla everyone realized how horrible it was and they made bgs.  BGs killed world pvp and good riddance.
---
Did you start BRD at 52? I hit 52 today and its probably best for my to whole up in a dungeon for a while
---
It's exactly this.
---
Sometimes you don't have the 2.5 seconds to get a meaty frostbolt off, so you go for that effectively instantly 1 second cast time slow which will give you more wiggle room.
---
Same for Rank 1 fireballs. Sometimes you don't have 3~3.5 seconds to hit a rogue with a giant fireball for the full 8 second burn. Sometimes you need to get a burn on them *right now* so you use a quick rank 1 and that'll either delay their vanish long enough to hit them with a max rank fireball to lock them out longer or boot them out of it (if they cast it before realizing they were burned) letting you have your way with them.
---
I mean... The game has also been pretty fresh and no one starts off with broken tooth, you have to get him, so it isn't the best comparison. Now and within the next month it'll be a bit closer to what you described
---
It's a small part of the game
---
If nearly every server horde outweighs the alliance, then you'll still have to wait.
---
i'm glad i'm on pve server
---
&gt;they'd much rather spend 4 hours lazily farming than 4 hours fighting.
---
Believe me I get that, I don't think they will join a server where ally have even a remotely even footing. What I'm saying is we may see horde from say a 90:10 split server move to a 70:30 server in an attempt to get more farming targets while still having a massive number superiority
---
Your buddy deserves a medal
---
I’ve been loving our server’s PvP. At times it feels a little horde heavy but very balanced for the most part.
---
People need to understand that it's alright to take your time.  If you are playing too much, get help.  This game isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  Do your laundry, help out around the house.  You need to do something to burn time while waiting campers out.
---
Its disabled on some servers, the systems supporting it were not avaliable at launch and now they are here they will basically be the same for the rest of classic.
---
Absolute bullshit. If everyone was expecting it, why are we here? Surely there'd be some measures taking against it being literally _zero_ fun for one side?!
---
to people who use that term its basically anyone over 25
---
and yes that is as stupid as it sounds
---
"Is it just me, or does a thing that looks nice, look nice" /s
---
grobb is a badass server for alliance. horde are constantly shit on because there are actually ally that like to fight. thats what happens when sheep bandwagon a faction because of broken pvp racials but dont actually know how to pvp lol.
---
There's countless other games and genres that offer much more balanced and competitive PvP gameplay than MMOs which are literally built around the philosophy of valuing time investment and player cooperation over individual skill.  I've never understood the argument of people who think MMOs are capable of being a fair measurement of PvP ability.
---
There are plenty of legitimate complaints people have about phase two but "my brother in law wants to solo quest in peace on a pvp server and he's quit the game now because he can't and I'm upset about it" is not one of them.
---
I hate to be that guy, but seriously, your brother in law should've played on a PvE server.
---
&gt; They had to modify draw distance and other server side things in to support massive pvp battles.
---
so did classic you fucking clown lmao
---
It's an MMO in development (UE4) from a kickstarter with some promise. The kick starter was very successful and they have continued to raise revenue through cosmetic only MTX. But a lot of people are concerned it is a scame. And there has been some controversy about the BR and I can't say I am all too confident we'll see a release any time soon if at all.
---
But they release updates with videos of their work on game assets and development. And you can play the BR now which they say is helping them test the combat system. 
---
I'd say there are as many red flags as green flags on this project. But if it comes together it could be really awesome.
---
Cheers cunt.
---
If you’re Undead, go to Brill outside Undercity
---
If you’re a Troll, head to Echo Isles in Duritar
---
If you’re an Orc, head to the beck of Org near the hunter trainer.
---
If you’re alliance, someone else may have to comment because idk bro
---
Yeah. PvP is Definitely more savage than any one thought, it will slowly die down tho. I expect many people to take a long breaks from classic until the next phase with BGs or even BWL. Its very unfortunate that its turned out like this. Best recommendation is to keep LFG channel open to see where attacks are happening and try to stay away. Good Luck out there soldiers!
---
Pretty sad all the people in here saying IF YOU FALL FOR IT YOU DESERVE IT. That’s some classic victim blaming bullshit. I don’t need to go over the entirety of why that statement is wrong, suffice to say some people who play this game might be vulnerable to this type of thing for a variety of reasons. Instead of attacking and mocking the people who have fell victim to it, why not share some tips on how to avoid it.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
How did they do this tho?
---
Still, the mana drain seems like it'd be horrible to play around as a class with no cure poison or disease.
---
Yes swords would be much easier. For daggers it’s easier in a group because you can constantly hit things and backstab. Swords you can face tank everything and SS/evis.
---
Take a drink when people realize how brutal pvp can be and why pve servers were so popular back in the day.
---
You people had a choice when you created your characters to be in a PvE or PvP realm. If you are brand new to WoW, you could have easily looked up the difference.
---
I will agree that what people are complaining about are not examples of PvP; being mowed down by groups, 60s killing lowbies, being camped for hours on end... no, those things are not PvP.
---
But what makes a realm PvP has nothing to do with what type of PvP players are engaging in... what makes a realm PvP is the fact that anytime you are in a contested zone, you are flagged for PvP and thus an open target.
---
This game has existed for 15 years. Vanilla cake and went, but what followed was tons of videos, forum posts, information websites, and word of mouth; all resources any of you could have used to be prepared for phase 2 before the game even launched so you could make an intelligent and informed decision as to what kind of gaming experience you would like in WoW.
---
If you can only play a little bit each day, or a few hours per week, have a wife and kids, travel across the world for your job, whatever the excuse is... did you really think that rolling on a PvP realm knowing full well you would not be an established level 60 by phase 2 was a good idea...?
---
This is vanilla, people. It’s the game you all wanted. It’s the game you’re paying $15 per month for. You knew (or should have known) what you would be in for. You either accept that made a mistake, or accept that these “PvP riots” will eventually die down, or accept that you really just don’t like Classic and came into this with rose colored glasses/because it was the hottest thing on Twitch at launch.
---
Many of the bis guides that put you in a ton of greens dont account for outlier scenarios. Sure your damage is higher; until you dont get ignite mana dispelled fast enough on a boss fight and now you have terrible spirit and awful mp5 and spend the other 80% of the fight wanding because you are OOM.
---
No one is disputing the spreadsheets. They are factually correct as long as nothing out of the ordinary happens. But on occasion its nice to survive tons of fire damage on rag after the healer on your side dies because of your fire resist :)
---
Amusingly that "nope" could have been a "yep" and they both would've been valid, although "nope" is more matter-of-fact and "yep" would be clearer at expressing intent.

Maybe he thought they had him with 3 people

not to late, but it will be a harder ride then if you started 2 months ago

there still games like that, eve online for example but even there there are some limitations to mindless zerg ganking
---
“Science and Math, REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!” 
---
That’s about how useful your comment was.
---
Because lvl 60 vs anyone 5 lvls lower than them is not pvp.
---
yes... i just sat down for a drink and my party ran off hunting allys.
---
In a controlled duel with no consumes maybe 55/45 assuming the rogue can gouge the blink. In open world with a fap the mage is fucked.
---
I have a druid alt I'm level as balance, over the last 2 days I've tanked and healed in dungeons so it's tough as there isn't a lot of gear that works for both those roles.
---
We had a discussion ahead of time and I said I want to roll need on anything caster/healer and if no one needs the more tanky based stuff, it would be awesome to get that as well, but my main spec isn't a tank.
---
So like the person said...MS need, OS need if no one else MS needs....that's my opinion as well...the only difference being MS and OS are what you decide you need in that run and discuss ahead of time.
---
City's are literally the only safe haven for ally in most PvP servers. Leave it alone. 20 other ways to get honor than city raids.
---
Probably depends on how much you play. Pretty much played *almost* every day since release and only just hit 60. So many things for me to do.
---
&gt;tons of alliance
---
so you\`re horde. It explains everything.
---
Because we would never ever see innkeepers in alliance cities and towns?

That's a bit of a dumb reasoning. I think it's interesting that you don't just have to follow color to know what to where. That dumbs things down to purple=Good, green=Bad. I mean you don't have to wear something just because it's a bit better, but not wanting to do that just because something is purple is a bit strange
---
This guy is a complete asshole man. Don't even give him the time of day. Anyone who disagrees with him is met with a "lol Try again" type comment. He's a child.
---
I moved to a pve server a few weeks ago even after leveling to 60 on a pvp server. Choosing to play on a pve server is the best decision I have made in classic. It suits my playstyle more, which consists of soloing and working on reputations. 
---
The fun of PVP is far outweighed for me by the thought of playing in peace and being able to choose to PVP when I want or when battle grounds come out.
---
For those thinking of maybe moving, it worked for me. Consider it everytime you are trying to level and wonder if you really like PVP that much after all. It is worth all those corpse runs to you?
---
&gt;Horde was also under populated in Vanilla, and this helped facilitate (especially new people) to roll Horde.
---
How many do you imagine were actively researching racials, exactly?
---
Humans do not do the whole "educated populace" thing. That's like the core issue with democracy and if *democracy* has that issue your favourite game sure as fuck has it, too.
---
I pvp’d as combat for a long time without problems. Switched to hemo and my ability to delete squishies went up. A 5 CP cold blood evis is usually a 2k crit. Hemo is just better because targets take more damage, preparation and cold blood.
---
Sometimes it's the server your friends are already on and if you want to play on the same server as them, you have to roll there too
---
It does they're in the game to make sure that lowbies can still play the game
---
Most of my points are in shadow at this point. Should I fear early or save it?
---
&gt;50g
---
Which is bullshit because dying in PvP costs you zero durability loss. This is even in the loading tooltips.
---
I pick off people from behind the line or just scout enemy locations.
---
Let me guess - you play Horde. Because for Alliance life RN is literally an endless corpserun.
---
Sorry, but world pvp is trash. Most people won't participate in it, only an extreme minority of players do.
---
its not the first fuck up on blizzards site. i knew that blizz classic was going to be worse than pservers
---
sounds like a lot of bitching and whining
---
Rogues in the fuckin trees man
---
Bah that's nothing.. some silly gnome gave me the [best cloak in the game](https://i.imgur.com/7e46OoK.png) in exchange for some crappy old book I had lying around.
---
Double stitched.. that's like twice as many stitches as any other cloak, how can you beat that?
---
I think it's common for people with a gaming mouse to do because it matches with their mouse buttons. just a guess though
---
Everywhere is not camped.  This is a lie and I feel bad for people taking you seriously.  From Thursday night to today, the number of camps have died off substantially. Honor grinding means that you aren't getting gold, bis, or materials.  So people took a few days off from that and will be mostly back to how it was in a few weeks.
---
You said a lot of words there.
---
And still not a single comment about what enlightened solution you would put forth. 
---
I’m all ears.
---
\&gt; ***Ad hominem*** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for "to the person"),[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#cite_note-1) short for ***argumentum ad hominem***, typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.
---
what he's doing is literally the opposite of an ad hominem. He's attacking the argument.
---
Uhhh but they are
---
Dal’rend OH is useless without the MH. Thrash/mirahs.
---
Just find an active guild. This happened while the guild was doing pvp around BRM. They had just wiped another horde group and managed to kidnap their Hand of Rag player
---
I rolled PvP first time round.
---
When classic came out I was like F-STV I'm rolling PvE as I cba with that noise again as I can only play occasionally.
---
Ganking is part of the game. Phase 2 is all about that
---
honestly .... yeah, i can reroll on pve server and it would be propably best think to do (55 ali hunter, cant level ... rly ... cant) but i kind a lost the interest in the game as a whole, i dont know ... something broke inside me, i wanted to be on pvp server, i never played vanilla, i started in TBC (pvp server) and i have not experienced this and no, its not becouse flying, here on classic i get killed and ganged while im leveling, killing stuff, trying to turn over quests etc, no flying mount could fix this.
---
Its the shame thinks went this way and its a bad think for horde too, with this no respect or culture left think OPs talking about, horde soon will not have anyone to pvp with
---
LOL I bet this guy plays horde on herod and then writes this shit.
---
Put render scale to 100%
---
So you’re telling me that there’s 3 rogues that can’t use their abilities like blind, gouge or kidney? Rogue vs mage is a tough matchup for the rogues but with more than 1 rogue you shouldn’t lose.
---
Plenty of us
---
Doing things no one else has ever done
---
Mutually exclusive
---
That's what BGs are for. World PvP is almost never a "fair fight". It's skull-level enemies 2-shotting you just to be assholes.
---
If you rolled on a PvP server looking for competition or fairness, you are in for a rude awakening (as you've now seen with P2).
---
BTW, they're doing faction based transfers. 
---
This entire post can be summed up to "I want something and I want it now" rather than carefully load balancing the servers, which is what blizz is doing. 
---
Have you tried to balance a database cluster? Take that scenario and then add in that your data can just randomly stop being there (people quit) and now you have to solve for that. 
---
The crying on the forums about this is just ridiculous. You aren't taking any actual facts into account other than "it's imbalanced and you need to fix it yesterday"
---
&gt; It's a snowball effect.
---
The snowball was shown in Retail with War Mode. One side starts to win due to numbers, the other side starts to quit. Now it is more lopsided and more people leave because they don't like getting stomped. Eventually there is almost no one on the other side.
---
Why join a pvp server then? There are pve ones.
---
Just need some faction caps and faction specific queue times to level the fights out. 
---
The Zerg dominating faction will have to actually learn to pvp then
---
Yeah I would argue that people were bigger dickheads 15 years ago. The average player was like 12-18 just supreme dickhead ages
---
So you're telling me 60%-80% of the player population knew that the largest part of the game was sitting with 4-15 other horde players on individual alliance players and ganking them with no chance at all of them even reaching lvl 60 nevermind fighting back and that this is their idea of fun?
---
Same here. I knew what was coming on pvp realms and I ain't got time for needless shit in my free time. It looks like a lot of people didn't think it through when rolling on pvp, unfortunately.
---
I am on Heartseeker.  Any other questions?
---
&gt;Should people that log in to do UBRS, Maraudon, general questing, farming mats and all the other things there is to do be welcomed with a
---
...40-man Horde raid camping every frigging inch of terrain while they try to get to their destination?
---
&gt;  I can guarantee you that all the people on the PvP server is not interested in doing world pvp 24/7 when logged in 
---
40% of them are forced into it anyways. 10v1 type, LOLGANK class. Other 60% rolled Horde.
---
Am I missing something? I just see a single picture that really doesn't say much.
---
No DR
---
Hmmmm then I could set it on my pet and use it to determine the deadzone?
---
Us "carebears" who got shit for rolling on pve realms are having the best pvp experience right now. You can join in when you want to and every night has been mass brawls in hillsbrad. I'm already up to 3k HKs, and it's been great fun.. I've done my stint on pvp pservers and I knew it was gonna be a nightmare. I'd rather pvp when I want to pvp, and it seems hundreds in hillsbrad on our server agree :D
---
I hit a 60 priest with a 1700 ambush, 1300 backstab and like a 300 auto. He didn’t have time to even react.
---
now this is  some good content. well done!
---
how does it help? thats why u r being downvoted to oblivion, becouse its not helpful comment its not even topic related comment and only ones who says this are ppl who r part of dominate faction or oposite lv 60 with all their bis gear, doing thinks they want and where they r safe, for the rest of us its unplayable
---
&gt; WTS wife and child, really cheap
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkKP4g0vv5s
---
and theres more horde players overall. looks like the brain train left the station without you.
---
Imagine crying about pvp as either faction xD
---
Anyone get dismotivated for having so little time to play that is getting hard to reach the crowd?
---
13000 honor? Lmao
---
Is this not obtainable in retail? Jeez you are pathetic.
---
Nah, don't really play enough for that.
---
Over heals are considered bad. You want to efficiently heal only the amount needed to bring the target to full and not extra. Raid addons track overhealing, and it can point out bad healers.
---
Mana efficient heals have longer cast times, you will time a mana efficient long cast heal, only to get sniped by a fellow raid healer using a more inefficient shorter cast time heal. Your heal then lands after the target has been healed. 
---
Even though you are playing more efficiently, on paper it seems you are healing poorly, tons of over heals, lower on the heal meter. While the healers with poor habits on paper look like they are doing better. This is where the frustration comes from.
---
That's not how it works.
---
There isn't a solution and honestly there doesn't need to be one except for the handful of realms where the factionbalance is so skewered it needs to be adressed. That solution is already there in the form of free transfers.
---
In the end with your plan all you'll achieve is everyone who plays horde to be punished for playing horde which is hardly a solution.
---
No you cater your gear around your role which is to hold threat. A +def stacked tank is so fucking useless in all the content atm because you just slow everything down.
---
There could have been a queue too
---
well some of us dont want to pay for game that sux :) not saying it takes 30-60 mins to get into the instance and you r almost red when u get there so u need to repair
---
A good exemple: in vanilla most people thought SP was pure trash because it didn't perform very well in low tier raids. So this bad reputation tainted them even in pvp where they could perform well and everyone told them to go heal.
---
Today in classic they are considered completely OP in pvp because people actually know how the game function.
---
At least it's easier to find people to kill if you are alliance.
---
Now I can combat the Alliance “ok boomer” with “tarnation zoomr”
---
You can still raid cities. Just keep your raid in line and make sure no one attacks civilians. The only people that attack you are guards.
---
So are rank points just honor?
---
Ok cool
---
since when is stating a fact whining. looks like undead rogue #39345093458 is triggered by the truth.
---
how unfortunate,
---
What makes you think you *deserve* to have fun on a pvp server? Listen, I busted my ass playing 18 hours a day to get max level BiS gear in under a week. Do you have any idea how hard it is to balance grinding dungeons all night and then getting my dad to stop nagging me about finding a job all day? I've put in the work, and now it's MY turn to have fun.
---
Or just ask for the orbs, lots of people would agree.
---
get good
---
its best you pickpocket mobs that are green, ie Lower level than you. if you try to pickpocket or even get to close to things you're level its like 50/50 they see you.  things that are way higher can spot your stealth from aways away. same thing when doing with enemy players but you're not in a pvp server, so no worries. 
---
the level of the mob matters as to if they can see you and at what range
---
Oh there'd be alliance.
---
Gank squads are kind of lame too. I’ve just been sooo pvping on my rogue.
---
I made posts about this months ago on my non-WoW related account and got downvoted into oblivion by people who really "think they do but they don't". I tried to change things, WSG should have always released with phase 2, anyone who wasn't looking at this through nostalgia or extreme bias knew this was how WPvP would be without a BG option.
---
alliance has better pve racials and skills for the hardcore minmaxers. doubt has anything to do with your tiny penis and over inflated ego.
---
i got tired trying to do my Onyx preq in SG so i just ressed on spirit healer and wanted to HS and logout, i got camped, my gear was already red so i said to myslef it doesnt matter, i ressed like 20 times and the group of the same players keept killing me, i stoped giving them honor points ages ago but they still kemped me, so i keepet ressurecting just to prove point that they r idiots ...
---
For every nerd who has enough time/dedication to farm R14, there are 40 nerds who just want to chill and do battlegrounds. It’s completely illogical that they didn’t release WSG after like 4 weeks, considering a decent chunk of players just want to play battlegrounds at endgame. Battlegrounds allow casual and hardcore gamers alike to enjoy PvP no matter how unbalanced their server is faction-wise.
---
Roll Horde on Horde-dominated server. This is the only way.
---
But griefing kind of comes with the implication that the behavior is against the rules or shouldn't be a part of the game. But it is, and this is explicitly allowed by blizzard. So the expectation that people won't do things like this is unrealistic. If you don't value that experience then blizzard has provided a way for you to avoid it by creating pve servers. Complaining to people not to do these things is like telling a cat not to chase a bird... it's stupid.
---
Who, you?
---
It's almost as though you completely ignored everything I wrote.
---
Yes, I'm saying that reserving the item and allowing other melee classes to join is better than tell melee players to bugger off whether they need HoJ or not
---
Because most classic players are now adults in their 30s-50s
---
Longer than Jeffrey Epstein did in prison.
---
I played vanilla on a PvP server, and transferred to a PvE server when TBC dropped.  The novelty wore off, and as much as I love PvP still, I get my fill in battlegrounds and later, arenas. 
---
Didn't want time joining a PvE server in classic.  Gotta know what you like, and respect the hell out of others who like the gank fest.
---
if he hides my funko pops again im literally gonna replace all the soylent in our house with cum
---
you have brain damage on a galactic scale.
---
So would you say gaming culture as a whole and/or the culture of the Classic playerbase on servers (other than ones like Faerlins) is objectively worse? Cause if it is, that's a big downer for me.
---
I have no idea why facepulling would cause them to unlink, but its just something we (the hunter discord) found out due to a lot of having different routes or pulling methods. I have practised both so if blizz would force linked, its not a super big deal for me however, but the shaman is the most annoying to have linked eitherway.
---
I think at 5:15 its just pathing issues for the mob, aka 'welcome to classic wow' is all I can say to that
---
As for when this is worth? depending on your skill earlier than I state here, but I would try to get as much pre-raid bis that is NOT from DMN (Rings, Barb blade, chest) before I would attempt it, which is actually fairly little gear, do make sure to pick up strat UD bow from Nerub'enkan. 6% hit is required to not miss boss, however you can easily get another 3% hit from surefooted instead of Imp Hawk like I use
---
The problem is that people think raid zergs are the most efficient way to farm honour. This is FALSE. Going solo and picking people off is much better. I have 65 hks and 780 honour from just picking people off while I fishing. While some guy who was in a raid for 6 hours has the same amount of honour then me. By all means if people are having fun farming as a raid then do it. However I really don't see much people having fun unless they're a mage/rogue.
---
Yeah I'm just taking at least the weekend off from even trying to play and will give it a little time. Wish I could have hit 60 before the patch but I started like a month after launch and life stuff takes priority.
---
Why not mention it? Isnt it important to remember a holy spec human has more mana regen and heals more than a holy spec dwarf with every heal?
---
I play for fun, so if I can't play I don't stress about it. You can always come back later and the content will be there.
---
Then Alliance on Heartseeker is much more kind to you than Horde on Bloodfang is to allies. They even allow you some breathing room.
---
That is true. It's the closest an MMO has come to WoW for me, but it just never held my attention unfortunately! I do remember the PVP being excellent though!
---
Last time I played retail was WoD and I can't fathom anything even half this fun occurring naturally.
---
its an accurate statement. thanks for your edgy response about my "edgy" response. undead rogue #498569845986 is butthurt.
---
what an idiot.
---
Horde raiding on your asses is just revenge for all the ally rogues griefing us along the way to lvl 60.
---
Yeah I realize I got the game back that I loved but the not the player mindset of vanilla, it was a sad unsubscribes this month for me.
---
You better not or you can kiss going to the next Star Wars movie premiere goodbye
---
If players min/max battlegrounds, those "nerds who just want to chill" are going to have a bad time.
---
The optimal BG strategy is to premade queue into an enemy pug, then farm them at the graveyard until they are worth no honor before ending the game.
---
So you play Horde.
---
