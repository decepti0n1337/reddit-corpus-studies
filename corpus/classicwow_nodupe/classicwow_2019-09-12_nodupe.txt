They removed a lot of the fluff abilities, and also made all the classes more alike to each other.
---

---
Like if I don't know how to play a class, I could probably quickly identify what their 2-3 panic skills are, their movement skill, their aoe skill, their single target spam skill, their attack steroid skill. Throw in a few extra "flavor" skills on top of that you have your class.
---
In classic, as a Shaman, I get Cleanse Poison, Cleanse Disease, and totems for Frost, Fire, Nature, Poison and Disease. In retail only the first two would exist for my class, and even that maybe only in Restoration.
---
I enjoy retail to an extent, but I also really enjoy having so many options in classic.
---
---
---
Yeah, get em to actually finish that dead end questline too
---
Just a matter of time until they slowly ease people into accepting real money stuff.
---
My best guess is another "it's for charity" thing.
---
Because they are preparing for when they remove layering, which will significantly lower the realms caps.
---
Bummer, the decision to play on Faerlina was a heavy one..
---
That got changed few hours ago, demo threat is now equal per mob with no multiplier.
---
nightbane dark runner wargens, im lvl 29
---
Except for, like, leveling. Which is a gigantic portion of the game. I got to level 70 in retail in like a week and never felt like I was in danger the entire time. Even in dungeons, I went into them using dungeon finder with no knowledge of how any them worked and never failed to complete one. Stopped at 70 because it was just too boring and easy, and that's for someone who's a total noob at MMOs. I can't even imagine how mindless it is for someone who's experienced. In classic you actually have to be careful around mobs that are the same level as you. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm sure the max level raids in retail are quite difficult but there's a lot more to the game than just that.
---
I love this screen cap reminds me of monkey island
---
Ok cool, thought it may have been but I've never seen it before, nor have I ever really leveled fishing lol gonna have to do it in classic now
---
Thanks, Josh! I am a big (recent) fan of your podcast. I was excited when I discovered it a few weeks ago and even more excited to see how many shows you have for me to catch up on!
---
That's the joke dipshit
---
Probably wanted some int for weapon skill ups, as that is the only thing that int benefits warriors with.
---
Because what you consider "nearby" might not be what the game considered "nearby" - by moving around and getting them closer to each other you can make the game recognize as a second "nearby" target.
---
Also remove Battlemasters from cities. Force people to go to the BG zone-in instead of sitting in IF all fucking day. That change alone will bring more WPvP than anything else, since you know where the opposite faction is going to congregate. Create actual WPvP in Ashenvale between WSG matches, or Hillsbrad while waiting to get into AV.
---
I will get you something from the shaman guide just wait
---
&gt;Because its clearly an improvement  to your DPS if done correctly. 
---
Except it doesn't really work that way in practice, and you haven't remotely proven that it does.   
---
&gt; is expecting me to just believe and accept the results of your "test" with 0 evidence 
---
LOL didn't I address this already? I don't give a shit about what you think, son. This is for players who are actually open to learning things who might have read the dreck you posted.   
---
&gt; you havent posted any evidence that it is BS 
---
LOL. Yea, because that's how burden or proof works. I hope for your sake you're like 14 and weren't even alive during vanilla.
---
Hey man as long as you still feel enjoyment then your good
---
I know on private servers dots wouldn't clear after a duel ended and would kill friendly players. You could do the same to opposing faction, but guards would attack you if around.
---
Well if its hotfixed rip poor warriors tryin to spell cleave.
---
Thanks mate, enjoy the ride through the episodes!
---
If you're interested in wpvp and battlegrounds, then I suggest Rogue.  While they stomp when pocketed by a healer, a Warrior is a free kill to pretty much everyone 1v1, and won't always have a pocket healer. 
---
 Rogue you can pick &amp; choose your battles.
---
FOR THE ALLI.... 
---
*dies*
---
Tldr, tame 1 pet you like. Keep pet, either for cosmetic, tanking or dps ability. Store pet. Find new pet, get starts from new pet, (best lore makes it easy), if new pet has higher rank ability, feed and keep it until you learn the ability, then sacrifice it.  Put new abilities on beast you like. This confused me significantly.
---
Eh, I feel like it balances out the massive pros of having a pet
---
You should be pre-shielding and waiting for the shield to drop before even casting a heal.
---
Ravager proc 100% will out damage blizzard, but people aren't relying on that alone.
---
A warrior taking 2+ mobs will certainly out damage most dps.
---
Warrior dps is mostly capped by the rage they're able to gain, so tanking mobs especially with zerker rage up is going to be a high dmg warrior. 
---
I've ran enough dungeons by now that it's extremely clear that having a 2H warrior "tanking" is by far the best way to run a dungeon (pre 45 so far)
---
Healer threat has been the very least of my problems with it.  It's usually the dps bursting the off add, which being in def stance with a sheild isn't going to stop.
---
In reality,  with a  mis-focused dps, you're going to have a worse time, as you swap off to gain the threat back and lose the primary mobs threat, then you have zero mpvs attacking you, and a one handed weapon.
---
In zerk, you can sometimes get a cleave or WW crit and they're back on you a lot faster.
---
Auction 80g?
---
ORB
---
N1
---
Use Sunder all the time and press overpower every chance you get. Sunder is incredible.
---
How do you make that show up as such?
---
You want the Earthshaker from MC, it's the best thing you can equip flat out given the current raids that are available.
---
My first MC raid in vanilla, some dude was yelling at us to dispel and I didn't even know what dispel was (60 priest). No addons, click person heal, it sucked. Yea this was the kind of person doing MC raids.
---
Bigglesworth is not like this at all.
---
The point is that the warrior or the druid will be a dps loss. Using eye of kilrogg allows you to pull more at once and then the warlock helps dps with rain of fire and maybe hellfire.
---
This way we were doing any sm in 3 pulls most of the time then clearing bosses just fine aswell.
---
Nice
---
COWARD
---
Doesn't AV have rep mounts in vanilla, or was that TBC also
---
If you think the playing hunter on retail is easier or even comparable to Vanilla (which is an echo chamber statement), then you're either just not good at playing it or repeating what you read someone else say.
---
The rotation to do BM at a world class level is actually one of the most nuanced of all the classes.  I'm a 95%+ Mythic parsing raider ranked as high as 5th in the world, top on my server, and I have plenty of experience with the Hunter class. 
---
Ragnaros was killed by people not even level 60 in greens on the first night in MC.  It's that easy. Mages spam frost bolt, it's that easy. Warlocks corruption and spam shadow bolt. It's that easy.  Rogues (considered a harder spec) spams sinister strike and keeps up slice and dice. It's that easy. The boss mechanics are a joke.
---
Retail massively different than one spell mashing for optimum performance. It's not even in the same multiverse.
---
Vanilla is awesome but it's not mechanically comparable on almost any level to retail. It's just not.
---
Flash Heal is more of an emergency heal, Priests best friend is utilizing spirit regen and using our big heals. If you're using Flash Heal often as a Priest you've gotta break that habit, you're not a pally.
---
This comment intrigued me, so I went to see what kind of spells a mage have in BFA. And some seem pretty cool actually, especially Displacement. But something is bothering me. If I understand things right, a mage will only have the frostbolt spell if he's a frost specialist? Same for fireball and fire?
---
Not trying to spit on BFA BTW, just want to know. But I would feel a little sad that a mage can't cast frostbolt if he's a fire or arcane mage. Hopefully I'm wrong.
---

---
Fighting against Humans (Perception) and Dwarves (Stoneform dispels Blind) is equally annoying.
---
do people even read my post? the 15 strength comes out to 30 attack power which is a little more than 2 extra dps. this puts it at &lt;1 more dps than ravager. WW axe is only .1s slower too, with only a slightly higher average hit. in terms of killing single mobs, this is so close that it would take hundreds of solo kills before the ever so slightly higher dps matters.
---
Judging by the forum posts, no. Seems unclear.
---
I never used add-ons outside of raiding, and even then it was just decursive
---
Have you watched his stream? Like you havent seen gear, gold and quest objs funneled to him?
---
I'm new so I just follow the wowhead profession guides, lays out seemingly efficient levelling
---
Blind is a poison btw
---
Unless they changed something, druid tanks always get hit like trucks and use their huge Dodge to mitigate, which is semi unreliable so they really don't make great tanks unless desperate. 
---
This was the case until Burning Crusade iirc
---
Tomaz Turbando
---
All you did was run away. Why would you post this?
---
Not usually, since people tend to bandwagon onto the winning side. Rerolling in Vanilla also has a much higher barrier due to the time sink.
---
Mage is definitely S tier QoL with portals and water, 1 set of gear, 4 bags, free food/water etc. Any other class is a step down really. Personally I find the first 30 levels as rogue a huge struggle. You're more like a squishy warrior with no aoe than a rogue.
---
Bruh wtf, the economy on herod is fucking terrible right now, I’m jealous.
---
Kind of funny to see things like this from before big changes like the name of a continent, lol.
---
Mine look similar.  Not sure if it’s faster to power level to 60 then do professions or do them as you go, I suspect the former.  But it breaks up the monotony of mob grind.
---
The scenic route
---
That's really not true at all. You don't even need a someone with real tank and healer specs.
---
I have really been enjoying fishing, its nice taking a break from all the questing and exploring the world to find hidden fishing spots. Found a giant turtle skeleton yesterday! Plus I cook my fish and having that buff food makes for a bit easier fights.
---
it's only .1s slower, and the average hit isn't much higher after the str bonus.
---
Ditto for druid tanks most of the time, though if it's someone you know it can be useful to for popping out to innervate or powershift if the shield will hold long enough.
---
A large majority of Classic players are straight up veterans lol.
---
I was clearing my way to a chest and quest mob. A warrior showed up, looting the chest while I was fighting and then proceeding to tap the quest mob. I asked if we can team up, he never answered and just went merrily on his way. Before I had asked repeatedly in the /1 channel if somebody still needed that quest.
---
I think I need to make friends with some people from the other faction.....
---
Mind sharing with me the info about the addon you're using "main hand"? I've been looking for that a while.
---
Also, just kill the priest next time :)
---
Yes, but if you've already been stunned for 20+ seconds, tell me... When are you supposed to cast abolish poison?
---
Employment is a mutual agreement that you will do tasks for pay, homework is something given to children to remember what they learned that day. Big difference lol. Coming from someone who goofs off way too much at work.
---
Whats the mod?
---
As opposed to getting ganked by other classes?
---
Think they nerfed demo shout today.
---
Yes, AV had the Frostwolf (white Wolf, with cool looking armour) at exalted for horde, I am not sure what the alliance got though I'd guess 
---
 a white ram.
---
Doesn’t that happen with every team up on wow minus the gold? How was the binding handed to him?
---
Imagine with the +150 skill item.  Enchant it with something wicked and you have yourself an heirloom
---
As vanilla Orc warrior I salute you, Lok’Tar Ogar!!!
---
Ive never had that issue besides with undead.... well, i guess BE made me do that, but thats probably just because they are stuck up d-bags... and it doesnt apply to classic lol
---
You probably won't be making any money from any professions unless you're in one of the top guilds on the server for the next 3 months.
---
Why the hell would they give rogues AoE of all things?
---
I'm a warrior, so I was there for the Fray.
---
I kinda like it from a RP perspective
---
Hunters have to earn the trust of their pets and can name them whatever, while locks are summoning a demon that already exists and presumably already has a name
---
Seriously? Quit the fear mongering. Classic is based on the modern client, which has character services (like realm transfers) integrated into it. It’s the interface used to do the free realm transfers.
---
Burnt server you say? Welcome to shazzrah pvp.
---
/r/choosingbeggars
---
You can cast fear to interrupt mobs that cast heal.  I never said to never use shadow bolt, I said to prioritize wand over shadow bolt when farming mobs.
---
i don't know who's worse here.
---
I watch him quite often and really never hear any of that. If anything if something is different he usually takes it as that's how it was.
---
Imagine eating milk
---
I'm running https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctioneer it comes with everything you need.
---
Classic *is* 1.13.
---
1.12 was the last version of vanilla.
---
People who are close to getting their mounts just want the gold.  Which is great for anyone who wants to invest. I have been buying things I know I will get a lot more for later on .
---
Exploit early and often.
---
Nobody thought to use Blackrock spire fire resist buff and face roll through mc
---
Ah that would make sense. I've honestly never seen a tank take so much damage until this run, it was like healing a rogue tank. Still has me hesitant to attempt another run as Shadow.
---
I can't imagine any amount of gear would make much difference. Any melee will happily fight you close and any ranged will happily kite you to death.
---
This is when your supposed to roll the opposite faction and gank the fuck out of them so bad they leave the game
---
You can keybind the marks now, so need to have them on your action bars
---
This is a quality of life change! Back in the old days, the boat or zepplin would just disappear and leave you stranded in the ocean or falling to your death!  The game's getting too soft!!!  *Old man grumbling noises*
---
What's greedy about a shaman rolling need on an item they need?
---
It's not even up for debate the classic wow gearing experience is just a million times better than getting a freehold 1 wepon followed by a freehold 2 wepon so on
---
Take a nap now and play 4 hours later.
---
That reminds me of when i was doing quests in Arathi highlands.
---
I got killed by a Rogue a bit higher than me, i ran to my body to see another rogue getting ganked.
---
I revive and then fear the rogue away so we can beat these guy. The Rogue casts a speed steroid and leaves me to die again.
---
So the moral of the story is : Not everyone plays by "nice guy" rules and Rogues are sub-human.
---
It's displayed for Retail, but if you never play retail you'll never see it.
---
I'd suggest asking Blizzard, maybe they know where you can find a good guide for your reroll
---
*Furiously throws feathers made of light on the floor everywhere.*
---
You’re right. I fixed it, thank you.
---
I would love more Tank specs. Shaman, Rogue, Lock, DISC PRIEST EVEN. The possibilites are endless!!! Well RIFT did pull off a Rogue tank thats all i really know there.
---
You don’t have 3/3 imp blizzard? Well there’s your problem lol
---
Yea I found those easily just didn’t pay attention here lol
---
Leveling is not hard at all, it only requires 1) having enough time. Yeah, you'll probably die many times in classic during leveling since overpulling is much more dangerous, but that doesn't make it hard.
---
A one-handed 8 year-old could make it to 60, it's really not difficult at all.
---
Yup, the sooner you are out of that shitshow, the better for you.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0
---
Most people are focused on leveling, as PVP rewards aren't in the game yet, so most people would rather just not get involved.
---
Gotcha!
---
not pictured : the two leopards and the three undead rogues in stealth
---
After years of private server experience, I can say this, don't worry.
---
I don't know what level you are, but it's generally not a good idea to level using prot spec.  You will have a better time leveling using arms/fury and you only need to spec deep into prot at level 60.
---
From what I understand, all you really need for tanking at lower levels is a sword and board, defensive stance, and using your threat generating abilities.
---
They should fix the bug where Overpower misses when it clearly says it cannot be missed, dodged or blocked...
---
Its role playing pal of course its gonna be easier
---
Ehm doesnt it mean looking for more
---
It's reddit and the internet, might as well be comical while arguing over a petty copypasta in a game.
---
It depends on how smoothly the dungeon is going for you with your specific group. If you have a bad tank and mobs are all over the place hitting dps constantly, save your mana for healing. If you have a good tank and incoming damage is stable, get in there and smack mobs with your melee weapon. If your tank is handling 3+ mobs without issue, try dropping a Magma Totem and see whether or not it grabs aggro and dies. Aside from just dealing more damage, use your utility. Drop Earthbind if you're fighting close to another pack and worried about runners. If a patrolling spell caster wanders into your fight, hit them with a rank 1 Earth Shock and position yourself so the mob has to run through your tank to get to you.
---
This is a great post.  Really captures the difference between retail and classic!
---
Hi new to wow here. Why is this item so valuable?
---
let the mage die and /laugh at him
---
!remindme 4 hours
---
&gt; WoW token
---
Yes this was my argument.
---
You're not at all in the wrong, I don't often post but it's quite annoying how often this is happening. I'm on Flamelash EU and it feels like half the people around me think other players are invisable. I've met a few nice people but the vast majority of the time they will outright ignore you even if you're dying to a mob, steal your loot and leave the group wordlessly after they're 'done'. They'll want you to stick around and help if they aren't but the moment they are, they're gone.
---
The modern community is absolute trash and while you can't blame retail entirely, it's clear the retail mentality + classic can be very toxic. The RP-PVP servers is apparently much better and so is the RP server but at the moment, it just feels like I'm on a private server. 'People' are so anti-social and absorbed in their own little groups only 2 weeks in to the game. It's honestly disgusting. The gameplay is great when everything falls in to place but most of  the time community outside of the RP servers makes it a chore. PVE seems a little better but PVP is just terrible. It's like a containment board, everyone's so nihilistic and self centered it beggars belief.
---
people are asking 400g for the pattern on my server despite it not being particularly rare.  Kinda frustrating
---
Yes
---
I feel guilty if I run past a stranger without buffing them. Even as a mage where an intellect buff might not be that useful to some classes.
---
Just to note.. the suggestions based from atlas and wowhead are there to make sure that your group is high enough lvl to hit the final boss of the dungeons. In WC case, I think some of the bosses are 23/24, which is the soft cap on hit chance 5”6 levels above you’re character lvl. So it saying “lvl 18 “ is saying “minimum 18 to do “decent dps” on the boss”
---
I'm a lock and I've never had trouble finding a group other than finding a tank during slow hours
---
Hmm that didn't seem to do anything for me. But guess I don't really need it anymore.
---
4 mages and a priest is the fastest possible? Fuck it just go 5 mages. Also the guy without a party saying "just need" then proceeds to list 4 people. 10/10

I came back in MoP after quitting in VERY early Wrath. I did an LFR with a random Paladin I met and when a purple popped up on my screen I asked him where it went and how we saw what loot the boss dropped.

It was on personal loot and I won an item. I felt really stupid but the changes were so drastic I felt like a grandpa using an iPhone for the first time.

I had this issue when I had Details! enabled. Started as soon as I installed, went away as soon as I disabled.

Post that condescendingly talks about retail players that don’t understand classic mechanics
---
My favorite is seeing theyre both awful. One gets feared and dotted to death and the other gets seduced and dotted to death. Cant even boost their own confidence with a cheap gank.
---
I think that is part of it. Flying mounts didn't kill wow for me though. It was the server sharding. When the community died completely. You no longer knew anyone. There was no such thing as player reputation. Impossible to make friends and our guildies slowly drifted apart and we didn't get new ones.
---
[removed]
---
That's why I play tank or healer. I can get ninjas kicked or leave myself.
---
Farm that felcloth for all the mage wannabe warlocks that have their free mount gold stocked up.
---
I mean, that's going to heavily depend on your level, your gear, and the mob. Test it out for yourself.
---
Sure, every class can fill the same role... but there's a reason you would see a lot of 3 guardian/2 zerk warrior or even 5 guardian fractal runs. it was certainly not uncommon especially in the first few years to be shunned from groups as engi, necro, etc.
---
Man, you're making me want to stop leveling this warlock and go even slower leveling a warrior. I miss vanilla warrior but wanted to do something completely different for once.
---
Not really, classic is more resource based and retail is rotation based for the most part. I definitely have to think more when questing in classic compared to retail
---
Especially considering BGs will not even be out in four months.
---
You're not wrong. Your spec is your class in retail. Instead of buffing a third of your stuff your they just split the classes in three and gave a third of the abilities to each one.
---
*resist*
---
I ran across a bunch of ally teen levels in the tower with the voidcallers in Darkshore (I had cleared the door). Emoted shoo to try and get them to leave before the respawning voidcallers killed them all. Then two of them attacked me, and I had to slaughter them all. Took 8 GCs before they realized their mistake, but they'd already been DoT'd and their fate had been sealed.
---
The aoe grind isn't what bothers me. It's the fact that people won't consider you a high enough level til 45 for zf because people don't know how to cc and just want to aoe everything.
---
Mages are by far the stingiest buffers. Priests and druids are great.

You feel SO much better playing hours of wow on the weekends if you go to the gym regularly. Healthy body, healthy mind, healthy wow addiction.
---
They're selling for 3g a pop its actually impossible to make money with Tailoring.
---
Nope.
---
Some pvp servers have a High Alliance dominance 
---
Others have like no Horde/Alliance it's just all one sided server.
---
And I want alliance outnumbered....but not 5 to 1.  Not 70% horde 30% Alliance.
---
I was hoping more like 2 to 1 or like 55% to 45%
---
Ya know?
---
I'm just a Night Elf with a rocket launcher.
---
Classic doesn't mean old server. Classic wow is running entirely on modern wow architecture, so it's all modern server lag.
---
But what has changed so much in EVE that'd make a classic version worth considering?
---
Yes! I make a plan to do some quests in an area and often get sidetracked by socializing or just exploring in Classic. I look at the time and it's been 2 hours already.

---
How is your gear? How was the tanks gear? 
---
I ran SM lib with a 38 warrior and a 34 warrior the other night. It was easier to heal the 34 because he was a better player who used his CDs correctly and also had good gear for his level. Gear can make a big difference, even in my own case at level 39 I still have some pieces I've had since I was lvl 25
---
Because we didnt had both versions from the start, every change in retail asked by the community ruined the game for others and thus the hate was born.
---
Thing is fun is subjective and both versions have different design philosofies. At this point im not wrong saying they are completely different games.
---
Classic is for people like me who likes challenges and overcoming them. Retail is for people who thinks life is already too hard for videogames to be hard too. Theres nothing wrong with wanting a power fantasy where you are the unnstoppable hero since level 1 but remember this game is played by millions of players with different tastes and when the game completely changed to cater to one side of the community the other got angry and now is a war as old as the alliance vs the horde.
---
Its not like there are just a few differences, both versions are at the opposite side of the spectrum catering ti completely different players
---
And thanks god for classic. I love wow but playing retail has me watching videos or my cellphone while i play because of how little attention it demands, this is just my personal taste but if a game only gets good at the end then its not so good. But again... this is just due to my personal definition of fun, and if i the possibility of losing doesnt exist i dont have fun winning.
---
Is there an aoe farmable way to do it? Really prefer there but if there is I don't want to respec:D
---
search AH for troll hide bag they are drops that often sell for cheaper
---
People playing the game the way they want and it doesn't effect  me.
---
Why should anyone care
---
You want to spec an aoe tank build from 30-60 if you want to run 3 mages. It's the most efficient way.
---
Its not ravager is better, the whirlwind doesn't reset your swing timer so even single target it is better.
---
If they were going to port WoW to mobile/console, they would have done so in the past 15 years.
---
Meanwhile people played like this in vanilla.
---
Is titanpanel what’s showing at the bottom? How much gold you have, durability, and level progress.
---
It’s 2 weeks into the game.. chill tf out.
---
There are SO MANY god damn people everywhere this week I have to agree it’s increased
---
As an alliance player I can assure you that about 2/3 of our faction are indeed cowards who refuse to help pvp
---
Yea I dropped it releveled and chron said books ingame. Went there and it let me choose for free
---
Rogues (enough said)
---
This is wrong, it's just a tooltip bug. It shows on the character sheet but doesn't actually increase wand damage.

And of course you're posting on r/wowcirclejerk, what a surprise. Some of the people there need help against a huge hate boner they have against Classic.
---
Look up multi-boxing.
---
Yes but all of my replies are in context to the comment I’m responding to. If I replied to you here and talked about something someone else said it wouldn’t make much sense would it. 
---
Your argument in terms of completing kills is describing a pretty specific scenario. I don’t personally ever really pull 3 mobs. And if I need help I try to find it which is pretty easy at this point in classic. Decision making is certainly relevant. I don’t try to play like a rogue and gank  a quest mob then vanish out.

As far as a death fest, other warrior posts on here have eluded to as much. No one said there’s no downtime, but since you mention it while I was playing last night I was literally not having to stop between mobs, but I’m also doing things like fishing and mining as I run around looking for stuff to kill. Context matters greatly and how you choose to play does as well. I’ve loved every bit of my classic prot warrior and I’ve not had any issues
---
It literally has a count down when it game
---
Oh no, I’m alliance on Fairbanks. Didn’t realize we were so outnumbered.
---
It pissed me off that they completely removed ranged weapons from survival. It was the spec that best fit my Draenei Hunter I RPed, until they changed it.
---
We Everquest now boys.
---
Dashes feel very similar to blinks most of the time.
---
Except they take what they can get because 5 mans are easy.
---
I am pretty confident that you cannot, this would be a pretty huge deal.
---
To be fair, Rogue's kits relies partially on stealth. Dots break stealth. Can't really say it's cheap just because you can't see them, as it's literally part of their kit and required for PVP rotations
---
Can we please have a community wide vote to ban this rats content on here.
---
Locks provide more utility than DPS!  Healthstones, rezztones, summons, stamina buffs, nearly unlimited mana to yourself.
---
They can get gear deoendent for PvP but not nearly as bad as warriors.
---
Gold sellers use blue items on the AH to give you the money. 
---
Most of the crazy prices at this point are people cashing in their purchase and some confused copycats.
---
Because gold farmers massively undercut them so people who buy gold will look at it as £15 for \~220,000g (wow token) or £15 for \~300,000g+(farmer).
---
If you want to be able to take the tank or healer spot, and eventually offtank raids, druid.
---
If you want to main tank raids, warrior.
---
If you want to main tank in 5 mans and heal in raids, paladin.
---
Feral druid main btw.
---
Posts like the one OP posted can be awful convincing.
---
It can miss but can't be parried dodged or blocked. Check the tooltip again!
---
Okay thanks for that.
---
He did you a favour mate, unless he was joking in which case that's funny but if not, lucky you got out.
---
Every time I try this I decide to stay sleeping.
---
Right. And that's okay! But why not just target a mob and command your Priest to wand them? You can still run around and move and you won't have to tell your character to start wanding again. They will wand until that target is dead.
---
I always have wand as "1" on the action bar for both my DPS action bar and Heal action bar.
---
Honestly go for it. People act like retail is not worth touching with a 10 foot pole but I think it’s at least enjoyable for a few weeks just when it comes to leveling and seeing the world. The specs are pretty fun to play and well thought out. It’s not the RPG that classic is but it’s fun for short stints.

---
Vanilla is about pvp though. That's where it matters.
---
Anything that's not mythic in retail is so horrendously dumbed down - and that includes the entire non-instanced world - that 90% of the players are decked out in epics without even knowing what a CC or an interrupt even is.
---
oof, they got some tasty things in them
---
And then you get to wear plates
---
Affects the economy
---
“I’m a healer”, he said. Then I speed read to see shadowform mentioned. 
---
Downvoted, you damn liar. 
---
Next.
---
Apart from the obvious coolness and RP achievement this set provides, I have to be honest that it is incredible underwhelming and probably never worth the time to farm.
---
What exactly is an exploit?
---
As a mage i expect healers to ask for water. And when they do, they get 3 stacks of the best i can make.
---
My lowly undead warrior Draugen would love one :)
---
I take rogues all the time.  I'm a warrior and if I'm tanking I pick the lineup.
---
Just to throw something somewhat related out there:
---
Greater Heal is better when your gear is bad for your level, Heal is better when your gear is good for your level (mana efficiency wise).
---
The reason is that both have the same spell power coefficient but Heal has the lower mana cost. So more spell power = Heal gets increasingly better, Greater Heal increasingly worse.
---
As a fellow Shadow Priest in retail and now playing Holy in Classic.. this story had me full blown smiles.
---
I feel bad for that GM
---
Your last comment makes no fucking sense. Classic is made by blizzard using blizzard information and your trying to say Private servers are more like the original game? Just because private servers had bad scripting, lag and accidentally over tuned mobs and bosses does not mean it was a thousand times harder or more enjoyable.
---
We had like 20 people all doing that Horde quest in Eastern Barrens on the coast where you have to kill 3 named humans in their towers over there.   People have been good about grouping and waiting turns. My group of 3 gets to the last guy, waits with the group ahead of us, wait for them to kill it, and then wait for the 5-10 min respawn. Two more guys show up and we invite to get a full group of 5.
---
After sitting there at least 5 min still waiting, three more guys show up. They position right around where the mob will spawn. It’s obvious they’re going to try to tag it first. We try talking to them, letting them know we’d already been waiting over 10 min, etc, and they never respond. 
---
Mob finally spawns and they try to tag it. Luckily the shaman in our group gets it first. One guy in the other group (a rogue... why does it always seem to be the rogues?) finally speaks and says “ Lucky fuckers, I missed.” I ask “you’re really going to try to jump line like that” and he says “fucking right.”
---
The only thing that kept me from staying there another 10 min just to try to tag the mob before they could to fuck with them was that one of the three said “Yeah, that was a dick move.” Didn’t want to screw him over.
---
Had someone spam this at me after they 1v3'd me in Feralas. He and if friend and on the KOS list now.
---
You're right, really. I've seen some T2/R12+ hunters on pservers who are really good at dueling, but that doesn't mean anything. Survival melee is untenable and pointless.
---
I level aff/demo. There’s a couple different ways to do it, 1 focuses on maxing drain capabilities, using succubus, and fel concentration is key to it. The other is using vw to tank one mob while fear juggling 2 others, requiring at least imp vw in the demo tree. I recommend you look up a guide and decide what sound more fun to you. I prefer the drain tank method, however I just respecced sm/ruin to get used to it for raids.
---
ah, yes...changes
---
Run dungeons instead.
---
That makes since too, looking for (group) member or looking for more.
---
It’s okay friend let it out
---
it tells you what buffs the enemy has up, which is really useful when you're playing with a priest who can dispel stuff.
---
Yea in leveling dungeons. Because respeccing costs a fortune and questing as healer or tank is excrutiating because submitting to a role actually means something.
---
I'm not arguing I can. I'm saying at least I tried something. You've provided literally zero evidence.
---
No problem:)
---
I grinded all the way from 30 to 40 and at 40 got my mount, but realized that after 40 gold start coming really easy so no need to rush 100g, after hitting 40 100g are easy
---
What addon are you using to show your spell crit/hit and all the extra data? I need to know!
---
Thanks!
---
I don’t remember, honestly. I’ve killed humanoids up to 39.
---
I call it “hunter privilege”
---
I had to reroll twice once in Wrath Naxx. Because we both rolled the same twice in a row with master loot.
---
Which I believe is a 1 in 10,000 chance if I'm not doing the completely wrong math.
---
Never seen it happen since.
---
Holy shit lol
---
Eh, this is super entitled. Buy your own water. You are not special for being a healer.
---
The models and textures are, but the graphics engine they're placed in is much better.
---
On top of which some of those models and textures /existed/ in classic in the sense that if you messed around with your config files the game would show you, but they'd never show up to most people.
---
Of course, if you don't mess with your graphics settings you won't see that; because the classic client defaults to graphic settings that emulate the original regular max settings.
---
... which are at 3/10 on the preset quality slider.
---
Yes, it's an extremely viable way to do damage to level 60 mobs at any level with warriors and paladins. Just stack attack power and crit and you can get away with lots of stuff.
---
1st hunter attack should always be concussive.
---
Quick! Call UKgangstaBoy or whatever that twat’s name was! Burn it down!
---
My problem is they say they are paying me salary instead of hourly. In my mind, that means I get paid to do the work I need to do. The problem is, if I finish my work early, I can't go home. So they really are paying me hourly, which doesn't incentivize me to be efficient.
---
It's just a stupid twitch meme, they will get bored with their crayons soon.
---
Damn I’m a first time player too...I just found out 2 days ago that you can press Tab to switch targets.
---
But nobody gives a shit, except you.
---
I started playing as Alliance player because all of my friends were playing on that faction. It was in MoP expansion where I was introduced to WoW. I leveled up lvl 90 human warrior cuz I never played a game like WoW before so I didnt want to be completely lost so I picked the most familiar thing. During the leveling I disregarded most of the game rushing to max level so I can catch up with my friends. Then I started to PvP and finally met the Horde in combat. Won a few BGs then lost some, but generaly I had a positive record. And then I got bored and those friends that got me playing stoped playing. I didnt want to abandon the game yet so I wanted something new. And why FOREVER HORDE you ask ? Cuz,... FUCKING ORCS !!! crushing little alliance players, fucking UNDEAD  forsaken slaugthering the enemy, giant fucking COWS !!!! I had lvl 90 orc fury warrior and lvl 90 blood elf frost DK and I absolutely loved RP ing in BGs, charging into 5-7 enemies like an idiot and sometimes dying, sometimes winning glorious victories and never once my fellow horde warriors blamed me, they never were salty, they charged along with me into the battle, to their deaths, into GLORY !! yelling FOR THE HORDE and running over alliance, best feeling ever... so thats why my hearth forever belongs to the HORDE
---
oh wow, I assumed it did. that's pretty sick then
---
Go play retail, then
---
Call me a noob, but what exactly is spell cleave??
---
you’re ignoring the fact that I’m commenting on the whole quest, not just farming  charms. 
---
30 tusks and 24 charms for 5 players could take a long time.  The charms took me almost about an hour and I was killing  elementals as fast as they spawned. Bad RNG maybe? Regardless, farming the charms and tusks for 5 players could reasonably take 6 hours.
---
And yet the community has continuously proven the Classic build to be wrong. These may be artifacts of the modern tech, entirely new bugs, or simply inaccurate information from Vanilla. On the flip side the "reference client" has proven the community wrong just as much, if not more.
---
Really a shame how quickly people are destroying content. Doing things that took at least months to complete back in the day. 
---
We’re hardly a month into classic and some people don’t recognize the burnout coming their way because of foolish rushing.
---
You hate to see it...
---
You're wrong.
---
I'm sorry I can't help the horde out! :(
---
That's retarded, why didn't you leave at first ninja loot? Not like nobody is running BFD...
---
Hey, I buff people with motw... just because we druids like nature doesn't mean we're weird. But I swear to god, if you step on another leaf, I'm gonna rejuvenate this staff in your ass.
---
You’ve got the right idea man.  I think that’s definitely the move.
---
No you retard, it's a word blocked by the filter. You couldn't a character named "Cock" past the profanity filter.
---
So you have to be creative to get around that shit.
---
Hunter and warlock need ammo/soul stone pouches
---
&gt;I don't need to (prove what I'm claiming)
---
Ah yes, flawless argument. What a true philosopher this one is.
---
Or how about we just have a real lfg? Someone made an optional add-on and everyone Reee'd so hard blizzard had to step in. Just let us use the premade group finder. You don't need to pray that someone happens to be looking at chat, and as a default feature more people will know where to look for groups. At the end of the day there is 0 difference between a party that's formed with lfg, and one that is made by posting in the channel.
---
Yeah but that eats my data like crazy eventho I only pay 1yuan per 500mb. Anyhow, it seems to all be working fine again!
---
Lmfao
---
No, I mean literally anything else. Meta spellcleave farming shit is a totally different category.
---
Did a WC run with rogue/rogue/warlock/druid/hunter. As long as you're not trying to pull 5+ mobs and letting the healer drink, you'll clear the dungeon. It's stupid easy.
---
Returning to WOW classic after last playing around the time that Mists of Pandaria was released.
---
Leveling a Human Rogue. What mods, if any, should I be running to assist in navigation and leveling? I used to play an undead rogue and used daggers, but I'm reading that swords are a better option for humans. Should I switch to using swords? I'm on a PVP server.
---
It's not that, it's that you can finally re-experience the game again. Why do that? You're skipping all the content to get to 60 fast, for what? MC? Onyxia? That's it. It's stupid.
---
It’s all good, help who you can. I hope this type of wholesome community continues on Bloodsail on both sides.
---
Development costs. Marketing costs. The risk that the developed &amp; fleshed-out IP won't do well enough in the marketplace to cover the costs much less make a profit -- so instead of being the hero, you get to be the sidekick in an already-developed IP that is supported by books &amp; movies.

i had more spells at level 36 in my paladin in a WotLK server than i had in my 110 Demon Hunter in legion

The reality is if you transfer you get stuck on a dead server.
---
It's borderline ruining the game for me and I'm already 60. I fucking hate seeing it. I don't wanna shriek about streamers, but it's their fault. They were all broadcasting themselves doing it on the first 5 days, now everyone knows it is far faster.  
---
Nobody is even out in the world questing lmao. They're sitting outside ZF for 45min begging mages in chat instead of just taking a rogue and doing the fucking dungeon.
---
I've just started saying to groups there are 3 pulls at the start, during those three pulls I'll tell you what's frustrating. After that if you keep doing it then I'm just leaving.
---
It's not fun at all to be auto attacking with 0 rage running around after bunny hopping clothies trying to pick up enough rage to get aggro. I don't play wow to clear dungeons in ultra fast panic gogogogo mode I play to relax and enjoy revisiting all these neat virtual locations.
---
I make that pretty clear when I'm advertising for a group, specifically asking for people that are relaxed and don't mind taking a bit of time. If you don't enjoy that ok that's fine, you do you and I'll do me but please stop joining my group then getting affronted when I ask you to keep the commitment you made.
---
I feel you. I feel behind because I work and watch streamers who are all dinging 60 left and right. But I've seen a few of their /played and it was INSANE. Had to remind myself they are literally on their computer streaming for 10 hours or so a day. Probably longer on random nights when they were feeling it too
---
it's blizz, anything is possible given enough time
---
The sooner they finish the content with their zombie - grind approach, the sooner they will fuck off to where they came from. 
---
Patience
---
That sounds like fun, so no you've got the right idea. Keep it up
---
It's about the same. Retail has more if you were to count all the spec wide abilities but retail handles specs more like mini classes rather than how classic is more of an addition to the class
---
&gt;Also no idea why so many are assuming OP is lying/making this up.
---
I don't think anyone is saying OP is making this up, they're saying the whisperer is... because it is far, far too convenient of a slip.  There's a slight chance it's legitimate... but the obvious play if I'm a bad actor is 1) offer a lowball price 2) get the seller to feel like helping me out is a noble idea.  There's lots of people out there who will try to abuse your goodwill to get something cheaper/easier/faster.
---
The alternative is that there is a person that plays WoW, actually does volunteer in hospice, and  was telling a friend about this *immediately* after asking about the staff; like, not even enough time between whispers to have anyone in world chat say anything.  Possible... but extremely suspicious.
---
id kill for a Generals remaster
---
Why does that seem like a good thing to you? (Using a smiley face)
---
Just means you rolled on a PvP server... with no opposition in PvP. If you want a "horde only" server you mays well have rolled PvE.
---
where did i say to give me water? When I play my alts any water I find i save for a healer. For the record I spend about 4g on water to have a stock. When a rogue, or warrior opens trade and is like heres 7 water I found while killing mobs, I am super grateful. Reread the post. I keep food, health pots, arrows to give to people when running dungeons.
---
Niceee
---
Meh its really not hard. Sure there are times you fuck up and pull extra mobs and probably die, but once you acclimate to the potential for those "oops" moments, you're pretty much set.
---
I would. I transferred from a full server in vanilla and was completely fucked.
---
It’s funny how angry some people get about the idea of an AOE farm group, I was getting 35k/hr last night and having the time of my life in a 3 Mage group. 
---
Why is it such a big deal if a class is taking advantage of their niche talents?
---
Yea Im actually starting my physical therapy soon and hope to get back in shape again. I have to be healthy outside so I can have fun inside (WoW)
---
You do still have blessings. Blessing of Sacrifice, BoP, Blessing of Freedom. Ret gets Wisdom and Kings as well as BoP and BoF. Prot gets the same blessings as holy.
---
Yeah I usually will ask before starting a dungeon, most mages comply lol
---
At what level can I realistically find a group for SM? I need to the library for the mage's wand quest. I know that the level difference in the 4 wings is pretty big, do groups normally go all the way until the end?
---
&gt; In Classic I'm simply an every day adventurer. Just getting back to town with a few completed quests and a bag full of trash to sell is hard work. 
---
Thats not really true. By the time alliance players do Onyxia, they've been nominated by Bolvar as an official representative of stormwind. By the time you finish naxx, all the stuff you said is true about being the hero the world needs, enemies cower at your feet, etc. etc..
---
 Your character is a certified badass towards the end of classic.
---
&gt;I'm not able to hold off on healing him because he's getting dicked in bers stance and I always get healer threat.
---
I played heal priest in dungeons with 2 2-hand warriors since about level 20 (we're ~42 now). 
---
If you pull aggro after the warrior has reached 36 (Whirlwind), he is just bad. I had trouble pulling aggro as a priest way before that.
---
I could spam every heal in my spellbook and not pull aggro. Sure, the occasional mob which parried all their attacks attacked me, but this problem also exists with regular tanks and is the reason why things like PW:S, Fade and "not getting oneshot by some random trashmob" exist. 
---
Our 3-man team currently invites any 2 other people who can enter the dungeon (preferably some classes who are not in spellcleave/melee cleave groups), pull 3-4 packs, wait for Ravager to procc on one of them and that's it.
---
Don't use shields as it just destroys their rage generation, wait with your first heal until they are &lt;30% hp (start it at ~50% hp, 2.5 sec cast). 
---
Pretty much impossible to pull aggro.
---
The occasional mage manages to pull aggro but they have ice block and no tank in the world can generate enough threat to stop arcane explosion.
---
Tank to taunt off healer and mob positioning. 2-3 mages. Or 2 mages 1 warlock. Priest healing. 
---
Tank runs in gathers mobs into tight ball. Mage novas and everyone spams AOE until mobs die. Tank taunts runners back into aoe. 
---
Better you get/higher the lvl the more mobs you can handle.
---
Looks like you're keeping it extra classic by not using keybinds as well?
---
There aren't any level 40 mobs in starting zones. If you're running into mobs that high it's because you're passing through high level zones.
---
I literally did this with 2 other people in ashenvale and then spammed it. I literally thought this was me until I realized you said ferals and not ashenvale lmao.
---
You're mad about people grinding? Can't you find literally anything better to be mad about?
---
Efficiency &gt; Your feelings.          People can always make there own group and invite whomever they would like =)
---
Why?
---
I guess the reason I give him the benefit of the doubt is a few days ago someone accidentally sent me a whisper meant for someone else, then the very next day I did the same thing and felt dumb. People jumping to conclusions that he did it on purpose just seems weird to me personally since I just had to  it happen two days in a row.
---
That's incredible I'm impressed.
---
He is kinda right.
---
Just come back at 60 and farm it solo.
---
Your class trainer lets you reset your talent points. First reset costs 1g, then it’s 5g and so on. It caps at 40.
---
The only dungeon I've found to be better with a tank at all as opposed to 4 mage or 3 mage/1 lock is BRD cause of the nets.
---
Reported to Blizzard for buying 4 gold.
---
So why is that an exploit? Maybe I'm misunderstanding I didn't originally play Vanilla, but isn't that just using your skills to your advantage?
---
I posted the theory. Tons here have posted the positive results of their experiments.It would be foolish to trust random claims of 100 samples from a clearly biased source.
---
shoulda used the spooky ghosts scene from the internet episode.
---
That's great! I got the same feeling about it, hope it sticks.
---
As a guy who played classic for about 8 months before BC launches, I’m gonna give you a hard no here. They didn’t get rid of Mana, mages, priests locks, shamans and druids still use it and have to manage it. Melee specs or physical weapon specs rather do not. Hence Hunter focus. Combat in vanilla was not straightforward in the slightest, I’d bet the majority of tanks had no idea demoralizing shout and battle shout generates threat. I’d say even today a TON of people playing warrior tanks just found out through a hotfix that it was even a thing that did more than buff and debuff
---
Omg really? Damn. At 44 I thought I'd passed the halfway point already.
---
Are the mobs at sorrow hill in western plaguelands bugged, or are they supposed to hit a million time a second?
---
Found the warlock
---
Ok at a minimum of you're going to be sitting at 10 days played 14 days after a game has been released, you're going to be extremely sleep deprived.
---
I was 20 or 21 on my paladin on decided to seek out my trainer for skills. I only had about a gold so I was both equally excited and terrified to find out what the trainer was going to have available.  
---
I get to the trainer and for the life of me, I could not tell you what skills I got or how much I spent, but I can tell you he had a quest available.  Bring me back these 4 things and I'll fashion you a weapon.  Ok, I'm in, Ghoulfang was getting a little dated by this point.  
---
Turns out, there's a couple instances you must go to and quite a run!  I end up running into 2 other Palaldins in search of the same items.  2 hours later a couple of new friends, a weapon to take me into my 30s, and some pretty awesome memories!
---
In retail I had the same weapon for most of my levels.
---
Easy 1hander. WW axe for soloing.
---
I'm at 30 already, should have mentioned. But how do I find a group only for the first 2 wings? When I see groups looking for people in Stormwind chat I never see any wing mentioned.
---
If you're using Nightfall or Annihilator, yes. Otherwise, just go resto or reroll rogue.
---
If you don't wanna min max, that's fine. You shouldn't if it's not fun. But get used to the memes. They're not wrong.
---
In retail you could probably heroic strike your way to glad too lmao
---
What? Instance cap?
---
It was a joke.
---
Goes for and listed in the AH for are different things.
---
I believe we are limited to 5 instances per hour, so it depends on when you entered your first instance. If you started your first instance at 2pm, then somehow completed 5 total instances by 2:30, the 6th instance would be available at 3pm.
---
This isn't wow specific but i just despise the stupid "to the enemy rogue/whatever who /waved instead of ganking me" letter posts because it just reeks of karma farming. If your story was really good, why not just tell it as is? Why form it as some cheeky love letter?
---
F&amp;F fan here :D
---
Both worth getting. Consume shadows is useful while leveling solo against multiple mobs and sac void is great for clutch plays in pve or pvp when you need a shield that keeps spell casting uninterrupted. Do it brother!
---
You teach those starting zone players a lesson!
---
Dude, if they literally started the fight with him, what's wrong that he killed them?
---
If you see friendly people waving or anything you just don't attack them. They did. They died. Their problem. He didn't do it bcs he saw lawbies and tried to make their lifes worse. No. He did it in the self-defense. It's nothing wrong.
---
I've found I've been able to pull ranged mobs well out of my reach for 5-8 seconds with a full party Battle Shout in low level dungeons.
---
Haven't noticed the demo shout thing though.
---
It's generally enough to keep things under control. It's fantastic. What I'm hoping is the reason I don't remember this from vanilla is that I was terrible, not that it's a huge bug lol.
---
I "took a break" after TBC and came back in Legion. It was so weird. All of my signature abilities were different. My talents were gone.
---
I ended up making a new character because my main felt like a totally different class. It was like some unfamiliar new character ended up on my account somehow.
---
nah, just the guy who actually appreciate the fact that a gaming company delivered the product we've spent the last ten years asking for
---
the least we can do is quit bitching and show a little appreciation
---
Tanks are spoiled so they are allowed to do that
---
Blame class balance, difference is night and day.
---
After healing a dungeon with 4 warriors or 2/3 mages + lock, its making me fall asleep doing the same dungeon with random shit like hunter/rogue/ret.
---
yeah wtf i would love if i was given the time needed to build threat and turn mobs but that is not reality for most dps.
---
The thing I love about classic is the people. They’re so chill. Today I was questing in Westfall and saw someone doing the same quest so I added them and then we saw another person and another and eventually we had a group of 5 and knocked out the quest in 10 minutes instead of the hour it would have taken me solo. It was so cool!
---
That is very true, thank you.
---
If you hope to ride another race's mount one day, you'll need exalted rep with them. The best time to gain their rep is from doing their quests at an appropriate level.
---
I don't know which other mounts an elf can use, but going to that race's area would be a good alternative to your own zone.
---
/wave
---
Start your own group.
---
So report him then
---
It makes zero difference. People do these AoE runs because they give great XP/hour. If they weren't efficient XP then those people would be questing or grinding instead.
---
dunno but i've been doing some melee cleave stuff with sham healer dropping wf totems and that was tons of fun
---
Calling inquisition and dark soul an iconic ability...
---
I only roll need if I, well NEED it. If I want for an alt I’ll ask if anyone else needs it. If so it’s theirs.
---
Wait battle shout and demoralizing shout generate threat??? TIL
---
Ooh good point, thanks!
---
Sometimes you want to have a lower ranked version of a spell on your bars to save mana but besides that additional spell ranks are just bloat at max level.
---
curse doesnt have tukUi
---
Star Wars Galaxies was an amazing game with such a unique profession and player-centric crafting system, I would love for it to come back. Licensing issues would be a nightmare, but that aside SWG would really benefit from improvements such as some profession revamps and at least adding the Miner profession. I would definitely be a fan of SWG+. That being said, I really believe that we need WoW Classic+, and the #nochanges argument is completely flawed.

This a meme server thing. Faerlina and Herod prob have it the worst. Things are chill over here on kromcrush.
---
Has anyone had any issues with Twitch Client addons causing their game to crash upon login? I've gone through support with Blizz GM and have tried it all. I've narrowed it down to addons but the odd thing is 50% of the time it works with no issue. I'm stumped.
---
Nah, an upgrade is an upgrade. Healing spells don't do damage to enemies, so healers need gear for questing as well.
---
I'm not talking about condensing servers for classic.  Have all servers feed 4 or so servers that will go to TBC.
---
Battle shout, good call!
---
this game ruins relationships!! haha. anyone else agree?!!
---
And then there's ff14 spells... My fingers...
---
Pretty unlikely that they just knew offhand how to translate that.

You said this :" If you join a dungeon group, buy a stack of water for the healer "

My mage in vanilla had 4 Traveler’s Backpacks (all ones I found). It was beautiful (I almost hated replacing one with Ony’s bag)

I feel you bro

Hunters were never picked 1st, or highly sought after back when classic was \*retail\*.
---
Untrue. It isn't nostalgia. You don't spend 20+ hours a week for years with the same people, socially as well, and not pay attention to how they are hampering your progression. We were playing well. Drops were slower. It took time to get past gear checks. I can vividly remember all the strategizing and rewatching of encounter videos with my teammates. 
---
People really need to stop trying to chalk everything up to nostalgia.
---
Wasn’t there an addon in wrath or MoP for ilvl? I remember that was like the old IO score, people wouldn’t take you unless you had a certain ilvl
---
Swords are generally better in the main hand at least because they make your skills hit harder, and you won't really have a chance to backstab. 
---
I'm leveling a rogue, and I assure you that you want all the hit chance you can get, so that's another point for swords as a human. Maybe get the swords from quests in RFD and SM in the late 30s and start destroying.
---
I would at least get Questie if you don't have it. And for rogues an energy tick timer is a good idea. Use your opener right before a tick and it's like a discount versus opening randomly and missing energy.
---
Cocky is a word, and I use that in my name because I am fucking cocky. I renamed myself to something else with cocky still in it, and that's been fine, I haven't been reported for it. I'm not gonna even tell you what it is though cuz you'll probably try to look me up and report me like all the other losers out there cuz you think I'm trying to bypass the profanity filter, which I'm not - dumbass.
---
PS. In case you need an english lesson, boococky sounds like the word Bukakke. So yes, I can understand why boococky what reported, but it's not for the word "cock" lol. jesus h christ

I establish that fact in all my runs and ppl don't mind.

A member of the opposite faction did this to me (the blue pearls in the reef). Let me just say, I frost shocked his ass and he drowned.
---
This is wrong, basic movement is client side in every game including mmos. 
---
If it was server side, latency would effect your movement, which it does not.

In retail mana doesn't factor at all. Classic it's part of it. I always tried to mana gem early do I could use a down rank gem later in the fight.
---
LUL, is that gearscore???

*whoosh*
---
Don't forget fishing up boxes from fishing. Some contain 1-4 bolts of mageweave and other cloth bolts. They can be found in wreckage piles and even random fish pools.
---
You can go IF/Stormwind and do those quests, but be warned that getting there will require a lot of deaths.
---
Tomás is the actual word. Tomaz is a misspelling.
---
id kick the mages who dont. its part of their class kit. just like other buffs.
---
Yeah that would require playing alliance tho
---
It's been 16 days though and that's a massive difference.
---
Takes it from needing 17 hours per day to 15 hours per day.
---
A lot of people get by just fine with 7 hours of sleep per day, so that gets you two hours per day to shower, groceries, cook. If you've got an SO (or parents) will to handle groceries and cooking, then you can totally get up to 8 hours of sleep per day with such a schedule.
---
Like I said, it's a LOT. It's just not surprising to hear that people have done it. I know people who get 15 hours of gaming in daily upon MMO expansion releases (and this is close enough to such to count.)
---
Make friends and get them to help you?
---
Start the parties yourself?
---
Are you also mad because you didn't get invited to parties in high school?
---
Nah it said post removed
---
On reddit aswell apparently
---
At the same time they split BRD into 3 parts (Cataclysm pre-patch, iirc) for LFD, they made UBRS a 5 man. Lowered the level a bit too, i think.
---
Haha. If you would understand the people you would see that the people are asking for a change since 1.12 had cross realm back in the days. People whant that to change. Go on, continue to make a fool of yourself.
---
Christ your hella defensive my dude, all the other guy was doing was pointing out some facts. You need to chill.
---
whats your realm?
---
How is advertising not useful?
---
misworded, didn't realize i said it like that. I dont mean to buy it all the time. But it is a way for a healer to remember you. Read the title as well though
---
Everybody gets one
---
skeleton keys exist btw

No more silly than justifying something completely negative solely because "that's the way it was".

As a L18 hunter I can't give buffs but I do send my pet to deal damage when I see a player struggle to kill mobs.

I got the red hood from grave yard other night. The one with +12 int and +11 spirit and something else
---
I get the pun dude, and I get that is why someone reported you.
---
But the reason blizz ruled against you is because your name contains a profane word.
---
But nah ignore that and keep pretending I'm the person reporting you 👍🏿
---
1 death if done right. Maybe 2 if you have bad luck running to darnassus.
---
Pretty much yea, there’s two types of dps
---
Builder-Spenders and Proc Fishers
---
Most are builder spenders, prof fishers are things like Fire Mage or Enhancement Shaman who just go through a rotation waiting for their proc to go off.
---
Bro I am from Europe
---
Mmmm no, I think the wow community likes twinks
---
Not an exploit, OP is just salty.
---
I took a break. Came back. Then left right after again.
---
Im a tank and I hate aoe groups. If i see a cleave geoup i leave xD
---
Okay fine, I'll keep the Boomerang to myself.
---
F
---
but the point still stands. If I tank or dps and I buy a stack of water and hand it to the healer, they will remember me, and probably make sure I don't die. So regardless of wording the point makes sense. I never said you have to do this or you should do this, it's a way to be more social make more friends. As I said I as a healer carry 4-5 stacks of water on me and refill before dungeons, if someone handed me 5 more I wouldn't refuse and I'd friend them, and bring them into more runs.
---
Not a quest, it's an interactive cutscene
---
Honestly, no one cares.
---
Sm is where I first noticed it as a tank.
---
Legit had a mage that would only cast aoe spells even if on a 2 mob pull. 
---
Weird af, that's not even efficient.
---
It all starts with a solid foundation.
---
From what I've seen of their Discord, EF has a very solid core of both Alliance and Horde players.
---

---
Took a break from WoW once... didn't come back until they fixed their game by resetting to Classic.
---
Like I said, they haven't cared about my new name with cocky in it, and I've been playing that for 2 weeks now. So you're mistaken that they care about the word cocky.
---
mage cleave will literally mean nothing for proper content at level 60
---
Was it horde or alliance?
---
Are they now? :)
---
I've actually had a warlock try and use hellfire, and then get kicked after getting an argument with the priest healer. He was like, "stop taking damage" and the warlock told him he should learn how his class works and to heal him. F
---
With friends like that who needs the horde?
---

Pick one
---
Prob still runs better than my MacBook does
---
Basically yeah, and use your frost nova to get distance
---
Let them drop to 20-30%. Don't be too afraid. Greater Heal Rank 1 heals ~ 950 hp and you get it at level 40.
---
With your stamina buff everyone should at least have 1300 hp.
---
He's a private server player, it's on by default
---
It's a lot of fun! I usually go Survival for leveling and then switch between MM and BM depending on what I'm doing/feeling at level cap. And Survival let's you rock that sweet sweet Hellreaver again w/ tmogs.
---
It's not an exploit.  People talked about doing this back in vanilla and TBC.
---
It's very quick xp and money, relatively.  You'll earn more from Strat or Scholo per hour than you would from SM.
---
The biggest issue is that it incentives priests, mages, warriors, warlocks and leaves rogue's, hunter, Druid, shamans, and paladins out in the cold.
---
And that isn't really an issue either.  People will get to 60, cleave or no cleave.  If you want to go from 32 to 51 spell cleaving, that's your business.  Boring but hey, that is what the game allows right now.
---
welcome to playing druid, as well as playing the game at a high level in general. bottom line is if you're not using a bunch of macroes you're not gonna be as successful as the player that does.
---
Any news?
---
Warlock here. Still easy to find groups for spellcleave because of Eye of Kilrogg (for pulls) and decent damage with RoF/Hellfire.
---
I sheep healed today and the fucker stabbed me in the back.
---
It needs a report to even be looked at
---
Rogue Horde on Herod level 31, have had zero problem getting into dungeon groups.
---
Rogue main, we have a targeted blink.
---
Question, if I MC someone in Ratchet then I'm assuming the guards will aggro. If I then proceed to chuck a hot on the MC will they also aggro due to being healed by someone in their party?
---
This is fine.
---
Paladins are actually super awesome at leveling with a shield. 1-20 can be a bit of a motherfucker but once you have Conc you can aoe pull mobs and aoe tank dungeons. Also, once you get 41 you have Blessing of Sanctuary and Conc so you can just pull 3-4 mobs and tick them down between Retribution, Concencration, and Sanctuary. Add a shield spike for extra fuck you
---
Hopefully this is the case, I will push on and see
---
I used to run a heroic raiding guild back in Legion. 
---
In my personal experience, recruiting was always the most difficult part. Probably less than 50% of the people I recruited actually stuck around.
---
You have to carve out a niche. Figure out why your guild should be joined instead of the dozens of other comparable guilds on your server. For me, it was our scheduled raid times. They were different days than most other guilds on the server. 
---
For you, it's more difficult in my opinion because you're in the very beginning stages.
---
I have no real other advice. Good luck.
---
These type of shit posts should be nuked from this subreddit.
---
No one fucking cares. Seriously. I promise.
---
You got gkicked for not even knowing who your GM was. Sounds about right to me.
---
honestly mana for hunters never made sense to me, they should have had energy likes rogues from the start
---
Lol Mind Vision made me FC radar in WSG. Its super useful when defending against / conducting city raids as well.
---
Just rolled Paladin on Kirtonos! I was playing on Faerlina - BIG MISTAKE! Couldn't stand the queue times there anymore.. Any guilds want to recruit a future holy pally ? &lt;3
---
Forreal horde on skeram are high key assholes
---
Then play the actual game and quest your way to 60 instead of grinding dungeons like a try hard
---
There legit to lmao .. fuk leveling a warrior signed up and watched two people on private stream okay 24 hours in shifts and leveled me to 60 in 6 days lol ... Cheap to
---
Insert cartman wow episode meme here.
---
Yea the concept is so fun. Shields can definitely be linked thematically to endurance, strength of will, etc
---
Unfortunately, it rendered other healers (who needed someone to take damage in order to be useful) pretty much useless. IIRC by the end of WoTLK, Disc priests could solo heal Lich King.
---
Wow is more of an rpg now than it was 15 years ago. Play Minecraft if you want a sandbox.
---
I've poked around and can't seem to find any addon or command that actually does this successfully. Many claim to but don't. I remember being able to set my max view distance further than the slider in the UI would allow. Has anybody found a successful method of doing this?
---
I would say you can do up to and including maraudon without a tank spec char tanking
---
Yeah I dont have high Hope's
---
Looks like the reputation bar. I think it auto turns on when you hit 60
---
/u/Araxom, can you comment on this?
---
thats also disabled
---
I'm sure next time I KS a boar fighting over quest mobs I'll be reported again.
---
You don't need to be resto to heal brotha. Spec enhance and have a melee gear set and an int gear set. Or as close as you can get to a set each. Could even just be 50/50 with a caster wep and melee wep. You'll be fine. If a class has healing abilities you can heal basically all 5 man's as a dps spec.
---
Me too. I looked at all my Geared Wrath characters when I resubed, and my brother did the same
---
Oh no, a flood of silk and level 30-40 greens!  That's not going to wreck the economy.  Strat and Scholo runs net more gold an hour and are dead easy to spell cleave the trash packs.  Prot paladin + mages is teh sex.
---
100% I'm still low level, taking my time, enjoy the learning curve, having a lot of fun!!!
---
it's not an exploit, being good at one thing in the game isn't exploiting anything
---
“Without notice” it literally tells you on the forums and it tells you before you transfer.
---
By the time it comes out I'll probably be 60 and looking to fill my downtime between raids
---
then do what?
---
sounds like you are playing a hunter so I want to ask. As a warlock, I find my pet aggroing mobs first causes mobs to evade constantly then immediately swapping aggro to me. Is this happening with hunters too?
---
Yes, that's the point. The prevalence of the spellcleave strategy on some servers is annoying to some people.
---
So do I motherfucker, fuck off with your ninja rolls.
---
I have been looking for something like this for 5 days. Thank you so much!
---
Not a single raptor heart in sight, authentic
---
Tryhard US servers probably

When you realize that you can reroll cause the next phase isn’t coming out for a while.
---
He might be keeping it as a vanity set.
---
Rogues  Big dick damage
---
Damn I'm dirt poor atm like lvl 14 and only like 10s :/ thanks though
---
Veteran of vanilla and BC. Then haitus for 10 years. I don't know where anything is but healing 4 party members easy enough.
---
ah okay! I mean if you could name some known chill realms that would be good! avoiding streamer ones sounds like a good idea.
---
What I meant by straightforward, is that the numbers are smaller and easier to understand, retail tries that with squishes but even then they scale it to 20x it start by the end of the expansion. I’ve played both shaman and Druid in endgame raids in retail and have never had to worry about my mana for the entire fight as I’ve had to in questing in classic lol.
---
Guy I was replying to wasn't talking about Classic, but retail, where you could run through Silverpine Forest or Westfall and see mobs equal to your level.
---
Yup... Everytime I see a bfa stream I see that they have so little abilities... That feels sad, I know you can't have 60 spells but still, classes feel so unappealing.
---
"So here is your main attack, here is your mono spender, here is your multi spender and here is a buff you need to refresh every 17 seconds or you lose all chances of doing any dps don't fuck it up"
---
Perfect n I let a mage for last night after I said OOM and he pulled, not the tank! Then I kicked him
---
I’d write his name down, periodically /who him to find out where he’s at, and hit him with waterbreathing.
---
This does not help in feralas when trying to find sungrass
---
They open transfer soon enough also they will want that money also.
---
That or I’ll always send my pet around to help people beat down mobs quicker as I run by.
---
For raiding fury is better, but if you just ding 60 normally it's fine to stay arms for a few weeks while you dungeons and build up your gear. Fury isn't much better until you get an epic mh wep.
---
Bonebiter for the 1g 98s or whatever it was
---
There is nothing wrong with people wanting to play in a more efficient way.
---
This is hella wholesome. I think it's a great idea honestly. You horde or alliance?
---
I played Vanilla but not end game, I was also very young. I’m playing a combat swords Rogue right now and enjoying it, but how bad will balance issues effect me? I already feel like 2nd class dps for not being AoE ranged.
---
Making me already feel like I should have just rolled a Priest (played Mage for 5 years on retail through Draenor, was sick of it.)
---
The hit is the most important part
---
It's pretty common when you're chasing someone in pvp. Distract from behind and they'll about face and run back at you for a second.
---
Rogues &gt;!are so stealthy, they can even hide while you're describing them!&lt;
---
/r/titlegore
---
Rogues open my damn lockboxes
---
I feel ya, I think most people use it that way because they think it’s an onomatopoeia(sounds like how it’s spelled), and not an acronym.
---
What would you say to someone who has more fun doing dungeons than questing?
---
People wanted vanilla with no changes so this is what you get. Warriors dominating end game and makes dominating everything else.
---
They REALLY need to do a little bit of tuning to bring the game up to scratch for 2019 gaming balance standards. It’s gonna be a shitshow when people are 60 and impossible to anything but pure dps classes to get dungeon spots.
---
2/3 is fine, it just takes a different game plan. The reason for only 2 points is so coc slow will overwrite the blizzard slow. At 29 though that's going to be dicey if you're not too experienced. You don't really have the mana or talent points to use a mage's full tool kit
---
I’m hoooome—CRASH.
---
A Sony Trinitron is pretty decent!
---
I'd give up my 4K screen for a modern CRT monitor... I haven't seen any LCD come close in color reproduction and smoothness, but to be fair, I haven't seen any OLED or Freesync screens yet (which I believe may provide a similar experience).
---
Also keep in mind what zones you will level in, later night elf zones only have bowyers so no gun ammo, and I believe the reverse is true for dwarf zones
---
How do I obtain this
---
You can die once, travel there purely as a wisp, then Rez at the graveyard in goldshire. Win win.
---
Ah you're right honestly. I'll keep that in mind and start rolling on healer and tank gear on my druid since I need it for questing.
---
No one cares dude
---
Title says it all, but for context, installed a few UI tools day 1 (zperl and titan in particular).  Never really got them working, then saw SpartanUI, looks sexy AF.
---
BUT....I can't seem to unlock or move or get rid of this stupid buff frame.  As you can see, the UI already has buffs above my portrait/info...so i would really love to ditch the ugly rando buff icons and declutter the screen.
---
Won't be missed
---
I love DejaCharacterStats. Love the look they gave it for classic. 
---
But fuck I hate that they showed iLvl on the items and I think there's even an avg iLvl at the top of the pane. I uninstalled that shit after about 40min. 
---
Anyone who knows classic, knows that iLvl matters slim to none with a lot of items.
---
Take your own advice 😉
---
Hi! I am currently alliance, 
---
However I am considering also rolling a horde toon after I establish the alliance guild on my main and level up  my alliance main a bit more, I don't want to just make this supportive guild for alliance players only! For now it will have to be but I hope to spread this to the horde as well, by making a horde side. For now though, it will have to start out alliance!
---
You know disagreeing with a controversial casting in a shit movie doesnt make you alt right.
---
Its sad because its true :'(
---
If you ninja my spirit loot I’m
---
Gonna fire blast you
---
Im on kromcrush and see a ton of mage cleave sm groups spamming trade chat all day horde side.
---
Fixing broken specs/abilities doesn’t feel like a step back to me.
---
What you said matches my recollection, but not my present experience. Still doing baby dungeons, though, so I'm hoping it gets more that way as I move up in levels. It's what I miss most from the old days!
---
Oh, I see what you mean now.  How you originally said it confused me.
---
Well I always roll Horde, because I rolled human irl and it sucks.
---
This.
---
I feel like most people complaining either never played classic or were oblivious.
---
It wasn't as common because the internet wasn't as developed and streamer culture didn't exist, but when TBC came out I leveled a shaman almost exclusively in dungeons with 2-3 mages.
---
Probably not. 
---
The distance is set by Blizzard because the distance it's at is how it was in vanilla. 
---
It's not just a rendering distance, your client just isn't being told what's further away by the server so no add on can render mobs or players further than that because they aren't being told what's further than that.
---
This guy fucks
---
Thank you!
---
As far as raids are concerned it doesn't matter. It's a small boost while leveling.
---
I think you need 15 skill to make a difference for ranged weapons.
---
So I just managed to convince my friend to play Classic with me so I’m here to ask what kind of classes should we play to so to say complete each other?
---
So he is definitely not the type who would go healer, so that’s out of the question for him. I also been running holy priest till now (decide to start fresh with him and level together) so I would rather not go healer either. 
---
I was thinking of warrior plus healer (seems to be the best combo) maybe I can convince him to go Shaman or Druid and I go warrior, how would that go? 
---
But more then likely he will want to go dps, would warrior still work with a dps class? Or would I have to go Druid then? (To have a bit of heal)
---
Also would two dps be viable? One of us go mage the other warlock. By viable I mean would we be able to join bigger groups since I assume the majority of the player base are dps players. 
---
That’s why I thought one of us (at least) should pick a useful class (support / tank).
---
😢
---
At 800x600 or 1024x768, pretty sure any updates-supported MacBook would have no issue with WoW
---
Casuals will always be casuals. Cranking the slot machine for mythic hyper titanforge super titanic heroic socketed armor with a .00000000001% chance of dropping.
---
aww!
---
If you ever decide to roll on the realm to join us if we ever get the foot of the ground, we'd be happy to have you!
---
A holy pally, while being able to use plate, will probably find there's less plate gear, with int and spirit on. Whereas cloth gear, is dripping with it. Because mages, warlocks, and priests are cloth wearers. So it sounds dumb, but the best gear they'll get will be cloth.
---
Yeah I saw was joking around
---
I think we may be arguing about two different things. Average players in retail WoW definitely don't theorycraft as much as high end guilds did in Vanilla. Well, at least not directly, as damage simming alone is more effective theorycrafting for the Retail environment than anything people did in Vanilla for Vanilla content. Way easier? Yes. More effective? Also yes. I'm mostly saying that high end guilds in classic (and the video game playing population as a whole) are way better and more efficient at theorycrafting than original Vanilla WoW guilds (and the video gaming population as a whole 15 years ago).  
---
Like, I get it, I was also on Elitist Jerks forums and read/contributed to theorycrafting as a whole. It was a cool community and a lot of people put a lot of effort into figuring things out. But, like you said, we were working with the hand we were dealt. Information was more scarce, optimizations were not yet found, the contributing playerbase was very small. Take an above average raider in Vanilla and ask them about their BiS, rotation, consumable use, talent build, etc. and you would likely get a lot of varying (and suboptimal) answers. Take an average raider (or future raider) in Classic today and ask them the same and they will likely have a much better idea of the optimal way to play their class. The information is much more widely available and as hard content on Retail is significantly harder than any Vanilla content, people who have played for a long time have adjusted their expectations and are now more experienced on how the game's systems work.
---
I’ve done some research so I apologize if the answer is obvious, but I haven’t figured out how to have TukUI do a couple things.
---
1.	Add numbers to nameplates
---
2.	Make it clearer who I’m targeting
---
Are these things possible with TukUI?
---
Why the restart?
---

Old ventrilo harassment meme. Old but gold

What specs/abilities were broken? WotLK is considered one of the best arena and pve xpacs in WoW history around the ToC/ICC patches
---
ROFL
---
“Allow” it? What would they change? Nothing is different mechanically now than 15 years ago..
---
Sometimes they start working on something then decide it's not going to turn out that well.
---
IIRC there was going to be a island zone added to Legion, but it was just going to be more night elf ruins and demons, so that got cut and we got Argus instead.
---
Thanks, Silencer.
---
No dude you need to stack Strength above all, 1 str = 2ap...
---
Been on Herod since hour 1. Haven’t had any ques longer than an hour or two. The community is huge and worth any que.
---
Arcane mage is the only class that uses mana as mana, because that's their "energy" and they have to manage it like a rogue manages combo points etc. It's just a blue bar they need keep up. The fact that it's called mana doesn't make it more or less different than some energy type bar called Arcane power and is purple.
---
They just decided to keep mana because it fits the Arcane mage lore.
---
For hybrid classes mana is just a bar that fills up slowly to keep them from using more than 3 flash heals in a row. It's just a disguised timer on survival skills
---
I used to farm these things on my hunter in Vanilla for +15 Agi enchants. And I know the drop rate wasn't that low.   
---
Is it possible that it's added to the loot table in a later phase? There are only 12 in my server's Horde Auction house ATM.
---
The shaman and the druid abilities got removed.
---
It really started gaining traction at the end of Warth.
---
Do you want druids to have like 12 button rotation while warriors have 3? I don’t get that statement... I mean that’s like saying in classic warlock/shaman/mage are all the samesy cause 1 button rotation
---
Give it a session or two you will love it, bind strafe to A and D
---
The people who just start bunnyhopping away when they take aggro off you making it even more of an uphill battle to bring any order back are the absolute worst by far
---
Per classicrealminfo.com, it's doing well. I'm debating transferring there from Faerlina.
---
Cmon' Cap! I haven't played retail in since Cata, it's not that bad, is it?!
---
Tailoring and enchanting are usually paired up. The alternative would be tailoring and a gathering profession, purely for the cash flow. Herbalism would be the best bet. Plus you can use your own herbs later on to fuel potions you might need from an alchemist. Saves you paying full price, when you have the mats yourself.
---
Even if you pve alone like questing? I played a pally back in the day i never knew this
---
Once AQ comes out you'll eventually be blasting fireballs. Stick with it :)

Hi everyone, completely new to wow and absolutely loving my Warrior. Have even won a duel! I've been putting my talent points into arms and my question is should I put all into arms or maybe a few into fury? I know the first fury talent is 5 points for increased crit chance. Should I worry about that, or go all points into arms?
---
&gt;No it's definitely poor form.
---
No it's not.
---
Use --&gt; Need.  
---
Vendor --&gt; Greed.
---
And the shaman is definitely going to use it.
---
If you don't want him to roll need on it establish loot rules before going in. But you're not gonna do that are you? Because then the lvl 34 shaman healer is going to tell you to shove it and you'll need another healer.
---
Lineage 2 has such a special place in my heart man. If I hear the music I just want to cry due to sheer nostalgia.
---
Seconding this. I barely have time to play during the week so sitting in a 4-8k queue isn't how I want to spend my game time. Also don't want to deal with no being able to find a group or guild.
---
Here's a translator I found, the phrase in the picture is often used from alliance to horde and is spelled "3 1 p 12 11 2 ppp 41 12 11"

See, I have enjoyed retail. The changes are what they are, but I love the game. I haven't even touched classic yet, but I will give it a shot soon. I do miss the old style talent trees.

There is a list of BiS items for 2 diff builds and build suggestions as we. This will atleast get you in the right direction.
---
I went back and double checked and it looks like you are right. My napkin math a few nights ago at 6am was obviously off. Here's a pic little spreadhseet I just whipped up for profit at various costs per leather. Looks like the breakeven point for both is somewhere between 7 and 7.5 silver each, though I mainly only buy at 1g15s per stack or less, or it's just not worth it when you factor in the crafting time.

Hoers
---
you just need to argue better.
---
Can I still heal if I play a ret pally? Or would I need to Respec every time someone wants me to heal?
---
Damn dude you need to relax.
---
Oh well, I just gold farm to sell the gold irl. Ez money
---
Looks like you aren’t high enough level for the door quest yet.
---
Some times? You mean almost all the time? Lmao
---
It was for sure a thing back in the day too, it wasn't nearly common though. Was more reserved for guild and friend groups
---
Lost my mains name.
---
?
---
Why would warriors have anything to do with spellcleave. If you bring a warrior it's shit in the first place lmao
---
This makes me miss heroic leap.
---
hunter or druid or shaman? will mostly be playing solo &amp; unlikely to do any hardcore raiding. would like to do pvp though
---
Yah, I agree... you are.
---
Do you need to accept the quest for the trolls to drop the tusks needed for the whirlwind axe? Or do they drop it either way? I want to save time by collecting everything then going to the quest location if possible
---
laptop?
---
I'd never pve quest as any healing class. It's just dumb. You'd either go prot, or redemption. In which case, picking mining blacksmithing might seem like a great option, but as for healing dungeons and raids later on, tailoring would be much better.
---
Congrats! Pre-30 bis!
---
You don't go through BB.  
---
You go to Menethil --&gt; Theramore --&gt; Swim to Ratchet. Most mobs in those waters are yellow.
---
Pala forums in the last 15 years  “WE DONT WANT UTILITY WE WANT MORE DPS”.
---
False. Clears the server of one less person who's not in it to win it. Via con dios compadre, enjoy retail. Let those who remain want to be a part of this community for exactly what it is.
---
honestly ret is just basically a less mobile 2h rouge with how it plays. It is really different but unfortunately seals don't fit well into the much different than classic pacing
---
No need to be a dick.
---
Same is true in dungeons. What we lack in specialization we make up for with being pretty decent at a bunch of things...
---
I run feral dps for leveling, but if the tank dies I can tank and if the healer is oom I can heal us through the pinch.
---
Not really good. This will effectively gut warriors in aoe leveling parties. There will be literally zero reason to take one now because it will be impossible to take aggro off the entire group. It'll be much more effective to take another mage for more ice novas. This wasn't busted in end game farming.
---
Agree - and I got to say, I've been having a blast :)
---
Yeah it's pretty lame. I wanted to run Armory today but my I have two of the DPs drop when I invite a Hunter because it isn't "efficient". I dont get it man. I have to specifically tell people it's going to be a "normal run" beforehand.
---
I'll give BFA a try at some point. 
---
I, for one, really like the modern questing in retail (since I last played anyway). 
---
I would highly recommend checking out Classic if you haven't already - 6gb too!
---
wait WHAT :D omegalul. And today I found out about the retail cash shop from a guildie... I'm laughing so much. Why would anyone play that crap..
---
Eye pulling with 1 warrior is not bad at all. They spam demo shout and peel the casters and kind of play free safety they swap to ravager when the pull stabilizes. They just aren't tanking in the traditional sense. WMMLP has comparable clear times to MMMLP I think.
---
Those shoulders are trash though. They give health regen, not mana.
---
How'd you 6 man BRS? Isn't it a 5 man max dungeon, or am I not remembering correctly?
---
Depends on the level of your groups and your offspec gear. I'd say everything up to SM should be fine once you start getting into ulda/ZF/Mara it may start getting tough.
---
i dont trust like that
---
No. You can rotate with the mouse. You can't strafe with the mouse.
---
play paladin 24+ skills in retail pve. compared with classic rogue the actual skills you use as a rogue in pve are a joke in classic.
---
Lol that's the perfect a answer, that or : sorry I actually sold it for 50g to a doctor that is working on curing cancer.
---
/join World if you actually want good groups instead
---
/cast Charge [no combat]
---
/cast Berserker Stance [combat]
---
/cast Intercept [combat]
---
I’m unsure if the addition combat command is needed for intercept

thats some meta-irony right there folks. what a time to be alive

But those pyroblast crits though

It's the stupidity that causes it.

We have a winner. Leatrix does exactly what I need it to do if not more.

---
Recount
---
Questie
---
Threat Plates (Classic)
---
GatherMate2

TinyTooltip
---
Leatrix Plus (Classic) (It can move the buff frames and much more!)

Thanks all!

Once you do SM you can get the staff there or the dagger/offhand
---
Just waitin for me mate
---
This addon is amazing, thanks!
---
Tremble op bfa mounts tokens boosts incoming!
---
I believe unlike the charms the tusks are a quest item so you need the quest for them to drop.
---
Lol
---
After a quick look at the code (with the bugfix version), I don't see how it could not fail. You call the advertise function when a new nameplate appears as long as IsValidPlayer. Which only checks that the player is friendly. So it's called with npc as well, and it tries to send an addon message to them.
---
Maybe the difficulty to reproduce it comes from nameplate settings?
---
Not only do I not know who runs the guild I'm in, (only joined because of a friend, I wouldn't have even chose a PvP server myself) every time I log in, I like to start my day by pointing out how stupid the fuckin guild name is. Fun to keep people on their toes.
---
Lmao!!!! 
---
we just waved to people running by and shot fireworks 😂 I’m only lvl 30 so I didn’t have a mount and hearthed out but the other 4 all made a run for the tram. I believe only one made it to Ironforge 😂
---
...or people learn the hard way that there are actually some downsides to being on the overpopulated faction.  
---
The people that learn this fact are encouraged to reroll or you open up free faction specific transfers to faction underpopulated servers to encourage balanced populations.
---
I had the same problem in Legion. My poor Druid healer was stuck and I told him, press alt bro. And then he wasn’t stuck anymore.
---
We still died a lot
---
He's not complaining about dungeons, he's complaining about class balance and how you have to move 2x slower with anything less than 4 warriors.
---
It doesn't help that the majority of retail doesn't challenge you and feels like you're using game genie.
---
I agree that it is far less useful for the content that was designed for the old Tremor, but it was so brain dead to use and incredibly powerful back then, I'm actually really glad they changed it
---
Hey, my guild is at the top but I have contributed nothing since I’m not 60 yet.
---
It doesn't matter. 
---
Just put them where you want and when you have a better understanding of your class you can reset your talents. 
---
I'd recommend resetting your talents anywhere after 40 if you're feeling it.
---
Yes. Of course you wont be max level in a week but this game is about the journey not the destination. Its perfectly playable in short sessions trought a lot of time. I actually find one hour of classic way more fun than 5 hours of retail.
---
The biggest problem is all the time when you are just thinking about playing wow.
---
Really strange stats on that site
---
Sulfuras with a massive pop realm but has the fewest 60s of any big PvP server, with not even enough to fill a raid group while other servers have hundreds
---
My advice is to make your own group. 
---
I’m a tank and I just kind of go with whatever but I’m not a fan of the meta either. 
---
I prefer slower more methodical and safe runs. I have no problem tanking fast aoe runs.
---
I will straight up leave when kids start pulling extra though. I’m not playing that bullshit you kind find another tank.
---
The quest experience isn’t limited to single player mode.
---
Not really... I mean, you can check this yourself, tame him and the rake, get both on the same lvl, then open the pet sheet and mouseover their damage, it’ll show you the dps
---
Okie doke. Thanks for the help!
---
Yes I’m a rogue. I have long cool downs- making me rely on stealth- with out those cool downs I’m easily focused down.
---
Movement speed is prob THEE best thing when it comes to PvP in classic. If not spec’d sprint is a 5 minute cool down and will not break roots or slowing effects. Just saying- it’s not as easy as you think. 
---
That being said- knowing dead zones for certain classes as a rogue is a must as you can kite/bleed/throw/re-stealth. 
---
Also if you can create distance from the rogue and slow him you’ll be A OK.(rogues have no teleport/charge mechanic)
---
But for party utility we can pick your lock boxes/sap and yea... hemo if taken which can increase raid/party damage sufficiently.
---
Where’s the love for rogues friends- show us the love.
---
Weapons are a huge margin but stick to quest turn in and fringing mobs that are green. Any mob the is yellow have a much greater chance to miss or glance due to duel wielding. Also grinding will net a lot more gold when you hit 40. For exceptional tips check out lmgd, one of the best p/server, vanilla, classic rogues
---
Also, 0/24/27 can get you some decent heals while having minimal impact on your soloing experience.
---
I've always had this problem levelling in WoW. I usually do dungeons or world PvP in the evening and then go bed relatively early and wake up early to quest before work. Its not ideal but it makes a massive difference especially since the respawn timers on named mobs are so long that on my server there are multiple groups camping the mob during peak. Just not my idea of fun
---
I was in the same boat as you, only I did it around legion. I remember it being the most uncomfortable thing, but within like a week of doing it I cant even imagine key board turning anymore haha 
---
Just give it some time, get used to flicking around and controlling your character while just walking anf stuff
---
Just always be casting abolish poison

---
I'm new to the game and just wondering how they handle dead realms - have they ever completed removed a realm(s) that they considered 'dead' and merged it with another realm?  I understand how they fix high queues (let people transfer out of that realm) but how do they handle low pops?    
---
The reason being that I'm on Kromcrush and while there's not a crazy queue (it's usually 50-60 mins every night when I log on) it is allowing me to transfer to Earthfury.  I'm in this game for the long haul and would love to eventually do raids and pvp but am scared of being stuck on a dead server.
---
Upvoted, but I disagree. I feel like playing and rpg lets you make a choice for you characters to be evil or good.
---
 I play very different on my different characters. I don't think that dude that steals the nodes/chests/quest item is a horrible person, but the character is. I love the choice I have to be a villain or a kind stranger, its content that you  make yourself, with consequences ofc.
---
I wouldn't be a douche on my main though, i'd like to do dungeons and raid with him and not ruin my rep, but ill probably make a rogue later and I will be hated by both factions.
---
Why are you like this?
---
Either a graphics card issues, or maybe you have the settings on max?  When I changed from classic settings to max settings the game got a lot darker and misty.
---
Its 10 man, along with Strath too i believe
---
OP is full of shit. I play on stalagg as a hunter and have no problem finding groups and have played with every other class in dungeons. The only problem is that there is there are a lot of dps competing for spots on groups.
---
I'd say skill however you want that's what we did when it first dropped and we all hit 60 just fine. But if your interested in leveling efficiency is highly recommend you look up a guide there are lots of little things you can do as a warrior that will make leveling easier and faster.
---
Good thing we had the giant crossbows to take down Deathwing.
---
No, desktop
---
If you want a good community the first step is to be a good community member. :)
---
Random buffs, a helping hand when someone is about to die, a cheeky heal, party up for a hard quest, take player X to your dungeon even though they aren’t a mage, or exactly the right level or whatever.
---
All the little things add up and you’ll find them reciprocated back to you in time.
---
Assist doesn’t help the ‘lock last night who kept throwing up rain of fire.
---
I miss being able to literally throw zeny at enemies
---
I mess that up all the time when handling multiple convos, so I'd give that guy the benefit of the doubt, that being said I don't think it's ground for a price drop either. You're helping strangers, so what, only assholes don't, that doesn't make you special.
---
As a warlock I feel the same:(
---
Wow’s peak was legion, sorry if you missed it.
---
Yep. Edgemasters sold for 1000g on my server, I saw a skull flame sheild go up for 600g for 30 mins never to be seen again. The items that are BiS forever will be snatched up now, because 1000g is nothing compared to the cost later down the line when people actually have gold to spend
---
I am hoping that once the hot fix hits things will go back to normal
---
That shit was so much fun
---
Maybe it's because Silithus isn't fully implemented yet??
---
Is it really that surprising that people hack in online games?
---
That fact that blizzard doesn’t have an insta ban built in the second your character hits xyz coords that they aren’t supposed to in the air just shows the lack of foresight....
---
LOL. Nice troll, dude.
---
hope he enjoys slow shit combat
---
I usually just don't heal the mage and he starts catching on. No sense in slowing down the run for everyone by having to find another group member half through a dungeon
---
Whoa wait a min what server are you on? Band of the hawk was my guild name for years.
---
I've noticed the same issue. It works, they just have to be damn near on top of each other most of the time. Cleave will reach them, but for SS I'll have to position them so that they're basically stacked for the hits to land sometimes.
---
I will say though, I played Rogue from vanilla to a little bit of WotLK, and coming back in BFA - i thought they did a good job to capture the different feels of the specs and playstyles rogues had. Can't speak about other classes.
---
Yes that's literally exactly precisely what he said._.
---
I'm sure it was intended that way it but the way they canceled the transfers made it a bit of a dick move
---
Tanking doesn't really serve its purpose until the 30's.  SM/RFK-ish.
---
Until then it's basically just watching DPS blow shit up and taunting when you can because the healer can easily cover it.
---
Its okay to not increase the number of spells, its not okay to subtract and remove spells that kept up with the class fantasy because it destroys class identity.
---
You can clear your way to the place to turn it in after you do the first jump.  It's actually fewer pulls than going from the top.
---
I'm having a bit of trouble settling down on a race. I'm not sure if I should go as an undead or human warlock. I don't particularly care about racials or minmaxing, it really comes down to looks/animations, community, questing and best 'atmosphere'. I really like the look of the undead, but I hate how the pauldrons and head gear don't fit properly (I like all the bones sticking out). Human gear fits better I suppose it really comes down to Alliance v. Horde.  I played a bit of each race, and I liked the aesthetics of each city and zones. Is there much of a difference between the playerbases? In terms of story and questing, are both factions exactly the same?
---
Dps is dps. Don’t know why he’s pissed but I get the roll
---
Stats
---
&gt;If they were going to port Diablo to mobile/console, they would have done so in the past 15 years
---
It does have a tab for it, but really just seems to control the buff/debuff above the frames at the bottom.  
---
I remember resizing the debuff frame at one point...i'm wondering if it was with the default UI.  Maybe if I disable the addons and try to move it in the default UI it'll work, then re-enable addons...I'll try that.
---
It just throws me off because 60 mages and warlocks don't have any spell cleave abilities.
---
I think Blizzard was watching and turned up the dial. Gotten 3 in the past 30 minutes.
---
I played Shadow Priest in Vanilla back in the day. It was deeply satisfying in the 49+ brackets. If you find a fellow SP, you can hold the mid field in WSG with just the two of you without issues. 
---
That's even with basic green gear. Learn to manage your mana and you can melt faces.
---
Second paragraph is the most important reason here. Bloods vs crips baby! No cross realm bullllll.
---
I played a lot of vanilla, some TBC and a lot of WotLK.  I remember I would pvp as a resto druid and I could kill rogues with just thorns and a few moonfires (TBC/WOTLK era) and just roll HoTs on myself to get through stuns.  It took a long time but it was fun.
---
Cata was out for a while and I got it.  Got to max level fast.  Was doing some PvP and fighting a rogue and after like 15 minutes he's at full health
---
Ya man do it up. And if you plan on pvping at 60 you can go ele or resto. Both are fun af
---
Well, he would be wrong. So there's that.
---
pRiNt ScReEn!!!!
---
Mines better
---
So you guys go on gank runs?
---
Here, have a downvote
---
What do you mean? 
---
Using tank gear as a druid lets me pull multiple mobs and stay healthier between mob pulls and tank, and then I can equip healer gear between bigger pulls and keep myself topped up better between mob pulls or just roll on it for healing in dungeons later. 
---
Better example is a paladin, what if I'm a ret paladin but I want to also heal in dungeons so I start needing on both the cloth gear and the ret DPS and the tank gear since I want to dabble in tanking and give it a shot. 
---
Under your own rules there is nothing wrong with this right?
---
I need all of the gear above to fulfill the things I "need" to do, but do you not see how others would be upset and potentially have a problem with this idea?
---
That’s what I mean. I haven’t played classic much but back in the day aoe was a no no most of the time. We used to mark targets and use cc if I recall.
---
No.
---
LOL fyi, it's being hot fixed
---
I remember being Ele in PvP back in Vanilla, it was super fun!
---
Anyone who can do that knows exactly how Blizzard can track him
---
Yeah smart man :) gold will reduce in price and ppl will start buying it
---
You really gonna do rogue like that eh
---
Questie is pretty much all you need for navigation and leveling. Other quality of life ones would be onebag, titan panel, Atlas loot, classic aura durations, and enemy cast bars.
---
Now you have to learn to play warrior properly
---
Warriors and priests aren't even the best early. Pally and druid are both better aoe/5 man tanks, especially early, and both pally and druid are fantastic healers. Druid's now having a real res is the only downside. I'd take a pally or druid tank/heal to any 5 man without a second thought.
---
The mage part is true tho, pretty hard to compete with their AoE and utility.
---
Some people have committed time, although probably unhealthily, to achieve all of this. There's no time restriction on how long some things should take, but how much dedication you put into grinding.
---
Sarcasm. I was being sarcastic buddy
---
Check out /r/classicwowplus!
---
I'm on blaumeux and it's pretty nice
---
Ya I agree it would be nice if they held off on the Battlemasters for a bit.  I don't think hour long queues for one faction is worth that added community aspect that you speak of.  There will still be plenty of that going around, especially in phase 2.
---
Can't seduce a Will of the Forsaken 💀
---
It's been fun playing undead in classic.
---
You just stood in the middle of a busy sidewalk and shouted if anyone wants $100 raise your hand - don't get indignant when some rich fuck in a suit is the first one to raise his hand.
---
AH is about business; charity should be done face to face. Make an effort, choose your target and you'll feel a lot better about it next time. That's what I do.
---
Favorite album Everything Goes Numb 
---
Favorite song is a very very hard question haha. That fluctuates between songs of all albums. 
---
I prefer to accept that SITB is their best album and choose no favorite song, and keep EGN as my personal favorite album. 
---
Right now I want to say Failing Flailing though.
---
You have to get the linking flight paths. if you get the one on the other side of feralas it will go straight across.
---
To level up to 60 with, it's pretty bad. You'll have almost no herbs and no money to buy herbs. 
---
When your at 60 it's fine because you have much more money and buying you're way up to something like level 200 alchemy will cost almost nothing compared to trying to get that 200 at level 25.
---
Indeed, feels kinda useless without it. But I think Blizzard would detect the fun right away and implement a hotfix to prevent this addon from working because it violated the game designers wet dream of telling people how to enjoy the game.
---
This is unrelated but I'll ask: Is Gnomish Battle Chicken broken as well? Is it supposed to stay frozen until a mob runs over it? Isn't it supposed to follow you around and assist you?
---
Rogue here, not hard making gold, level 42 and have over 100g with my mount already bought.
---
Nice.
---
I agree with you.  There could potentially be much better games than classic in the same genre, but it would require the same amount of artistry - something you can’t really get out of a large corporation. 
---
I played retail for 3-4 months having not played since WotLK.  I got to 120 and it was fun running mythics and such, but the daily quests and trying to unlock flying made me never want to play again.  I thought to myself - oh my god, I never want to go to Nazjatar ever again after I get revered with these people.  The content got so stale so quickly and I still can’t even put my finger on exactly why.
---
Sorry no gank runs here! The plan is to make the game a good wholesome experience for others. Not make their adventures miserable. Ganking will not be tolerated in the guild as it draws away from a positive atmosphere. We will be a gank free guild.
---
That NPC has a pet bar spell that teaches the smelting, though. You don't "talk" to him in the standard NPC sense.
---
Spider horse
---
Share build please? I just been spamming shouts.
---
1 Strength = 2 Attack Power
---
Strength would be raw damage while agility would increase critical strike.
---
If the casters actually wait for you to get 3-4 demo shouts off, it's perfectly capable of holding threat.

Act like you were about to go on break.
---
Found the GM

Thanks for the reply, but none of those seem to have any confirmation... just people guessing.

Learn when to let shit go kid.

Tailoring is only like 100g on most servers
---
Oh I dont doubt it man. I'm just a pretty casual player. I'm not sure how I'm gonna afford my epic mount much less spending 70 hours (two to three weeks of  playing for me) for two pieces of gear.
---
It probably doesn’t roll whole numbers. We see the truncated number. One rolled 1.23 the other rolled 1.55. Maybe. Iono.
---
I have mine on a macro . It says this is a light well, use it wisely to heal, it only has 5 charges then gone  forever .
---
Literally it cannot happen. WoW can't be hacked like that. 
---
You can do things like movement speed, teleport, flying, viewing things that you shouldn't be able to on your minimap, but you absolutely cannot do things like casting random spells or giving yourself items.
---
its only high value on established servers with an established twink bg scene.
---
Could you get big money for it in a few years? Probably.
---
Today? No. Soon? No.
---
How'd you get up there roach?
---
Got one today too!
---
Lol, a Gm with special characters in his name. That's fucking sad.
---
For the record, when you MC that NPC, his pet bar has a spell that when cast teaches the smelting. You don't talk to him like a normal trainer.
---
I'm not sure I've ever had that exact thing happen, but charge did get pretty whonky. I wouldn't be surprised to find a vanilla clip where what you described is shown.
---
&gt; Edit: Anyone actually denying this or saying how is it is to farm normally, are playing a mage.
---
Grow up.
---
Yeah... we have people who killed ony and rag so hopefully one of them can come and tell us - I’m still level 39.::
---
You have absolutely no idea if it is profitable. You don't even know how many subs WoW has right now. You have no idea how much this cost. How many subs are new vs how many switched over from retail. How long these people will stay. How much the servers are costing.
---
You know literally nothing about if this is profitable. And none of us will know for months.
---
Yes, but if you make the second jump you can kiss those grimy, mysterious objects goodbye. :(
---
Went there to level up my first aid, moment I saw it I knew I was gonna finish every quest in that zone. Besides the constant ganks there as an alliance, it was great.
---
P99 was content-stagnant for like 5 years, and still has a huge population. And they're not about to release new content now: they're starting over fresh. And people are chomping at the bit for it.
---
What add-on shows all the stats on the character panel? Ty
---
He didn't do 10 man dungeon grinding.

You think you know your character, but you don't

Thank you, i looked up a map of flight points, didnt see that one on the run over

Cata was when their core design philosophy changed to "bring the player not the class" and subsequently simplified/pruned all the classes. Cata was also when they removed most of the RPG elements.
---
How much did the pattern cost?
---
I thought it was originally that the EK were called Azeroth but it was then retconned, mustve been mistaken.
---
U may find yourself finding an item like this and then boom u got it all I’ve been lucky and had 3 solid boes so my bis boe Gear is sorted and my epic mount
---
The one that's got more damage and strength to give *even more* damage.
---
haha idumb is fitting
---
How’s it condescending? This is a huge deal
---
Paladins &amp; Shamans save our butts. They’re lumped together
---
I am also someone who has tanked extensively, and while I admit I have not been active the last couple expansions, we are not talking about new expacs with quality of life improvements for tanks, where it takes real talent to wipe or lose aggro.
---
I have a couple points to make. In 9 out of 10 groups I've tanked so far in classic, the group *expects* you to lead, and pull. I don't see how ranged dps pulling mobs is the slightest bit quicker than a tank pulling mobs. The only difference is, right away you are behind on threat, and playing catch up from then on. 
---
As blizzard has come out and said that the threat multiplication with demoralizing shout is a bug that will be hot fixed, let's take a look at the tools in the toolbox for a leveling tank to maintain agro on a pack of mobs.
---
Let's see, there's thunder clap- next to useless in classic. 
---
You have cleave- rage negative and not a useful threat generator.
---
Obviously we have taunt- on a 10s cooldown.
---
And challenging shout, usable on a 10 minute cooldown.
---
This is assuming you are not charging in and using SS and WW and trying to out dps a mage to hold agro. Might work if you are over geared and higher level, otherwise you are just going to be a melee dps, not holding threat on shit. 
---
So what does that leave us... basically tab sunder/ revenge. It's only practical to do on so many mobs at once, and doesn't hold agro for shit when your mage decides to cast a blizzard on your pack of 6+ mobs.
---
You want fast pulls, I'll give you fast pulls, but I'm going to LOS the casters and healers and hunter mobs, and make sure they're in a nice tidy little group so that once I *do* have a teeny tiny head start on threat, the range dps and melee can beat them down properly.
---
Guarantee you this is faster than having a sloppy pull with casting and healing mobs spread out all over hells half acre.
---
people used to make characters optimised for the lvl10-19 battlegrounds bracket. This item is best in slot for cloth characters in that bracket.
---
Look how mature thia guy is, he says shit every second word.
---
Think of it, some people have barely logged off since release.  7-14 days /played  is more than enough time to farm for an epic mount.
---
&gt;If you actually tested a corpse maker w sunder/hamstring, its so clearly better there is no way you would still be talking.
---
Oh hold on a second now. You were telling me that this method is VASTLY superior to HS. But now all of a sudden you need certain weapons for it to be better? Hm how interesting!   
---
Also LOL at three MORE fucking posts from you dude. What the hell is wrong with you. Some serious autism showing off here. You might want to take a long look in the mirror and think about why you care about this so much, then shake your head, or like, consider suicide or something.
---
Ty!
---
Hemet Nesingwary has been the OG MC animal-fetcher, and no one is giving him any respect.
---
My hunter is skinning/enchanting.  It's, not horrible.  But I also don't care if I min/max everything and a hunter is a good "farming" character.
---
Is StaySafeTV a better source?
---
You horde bastards only fight when you have double the numbers!
---
I think you missed my point. Try to read my comment again.
---
Ah ok
---
Holy shit that's hilarious
---
2 hand fury build is awesome too.
---
That is some awful logic brah.
---
Thanks for the reply! Wouldn't selling the potions make up a bit for the cost to buy herbs (or enchanting services)? Failing that, would it be smarted to go tailoring to sell bags and stuff until 60ish and then switch over to alchemy?
---
There is some food in the barrens that replenishes mana so you can eat and drink mana regen at the same time, but to be honest you'll kind of have to get used to it, later on you get mana agate as an ability which gives back some mana which is nice but so far at least I've had to drink every now and again, sometimes I use lower ranked frostbolts and wanding to conserve man's
---
Because I stick up for rogues I'm the worst person? You don't know me, you don't know how much I do for people.
---
It's not. Retail just does it to an extreme.
---
Westfall - Team Redacted?
---
I’m not sure it’s the most competitive spec but you could always play DS/ruin if you wanted to warlock without a pet. Some variation of DS may work in PVP I’m not sure tho.
---
add paid character transfers make it easier for people to play together
---
Yeah I recently met someone on here that was convinced everyone should roll Need on stuff you're going to sell because we all need gold equally... Like that's what Greed is for you dumb dumb
---
Sigh... hunter dps is on par with most classes until late BWL. Hop off the bandwagon
---
Way to go, youngblood. Getting paid, getting paid.
---
It doesn't but the felhunter increases stealth detection for all party members within 30 yards.
---
This is probably what /u/cornysheep noticed so watch your step when a felhunter is nearby.
---
Might push some people off with this one,  but I try to avoid even joining the parties of people with alt-code names. Way too much of a correlation between alt-code names and being a toxic asshole over the years.
---
Always remember your ABCs.
---
Are you gonna keep following my posts and flame me which is against the rules?
---
Lightwell is one of the worst ever designed abilities in WoW history. I don't take that statement lightly, and I believe it with all my heart.
---
Because witchhunts always end well
---
Truefaith is extremely good but you'll manage just fine without it. Robes of the Exalted are great, and you could make it a goal to rush for T2 chest as soon as possible since it's on par with Truefaith.
---
Is it worth having? I'm playing priest and I just don't see much use for it.  Like the zf idea tho! Would love to hear some thoughts
---
1000g for edgemasters is nuts, and where did that person even farm that much?
---
Got one during my first few kills into questing STV. A horde was mid ganking me too and as i died i looted the pirate that dropped it
---
Yeah, I figured. Just wasn't sure why I see all these memes about the real classic experience using these old CRTs. Lol
---
Come on, that's just like the "my faction always loses BGs" statement.
---
Everything happens equally on both sides, we just don't wanna admit it .
---
Is too cuz it isn't all stuns. It's a stun, stun, incapacitate, disorient
---
Apparently Kirtonos has free transfers to Earthfury, so maybe the balance will get better as people leave.  The group of RL friends I play with is considering the move, so we'll see.
---
add paid character transfers, would save so much grief x. x
---
Only double? Horde are brave on your server!
---
Sorry dog but that's 100% due to the amount pull. A mage literally just blizzarding will outdamage a rogue on 5 targets doing a full rotation.
---
There's a lot more active spells. Active in this case being spells that you must constantly use to do your job.  But less niche situational spells unless you purposely go for less optimal builds. Generally since you can easily swap talents around whenever in a rested area there's no reason to build as a jack of all so you build your character specifically around the content you're about to do. 
---
The big issue a lot of people have is not having agency in your choices/the development of your character. With classic you are  building your character up. With retail it's more about optimization/tuning your character for content. A big reason for this is just the nature of the game.
---
😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
Yeah Druids are usually on the low end of classes played
---
I started playing a few months ago and I’m finding with the two classes I’m playing, AST and GNB I have more abilities than on any of my WoW toons. Enjoying it tbh
---
Mages have always been prioritized in raid compositions, not sure what youre talking about
---
If you stop after turning in the quest to the shrine, you can keep the rod and not have a quest polluting your quest log for all eternity.
---
It's part of the game. Especially when it is someone of the other faction. In the end you reap what you sew though. The best part about classic is the community and once people catch on that you're a dick it'll catch up to you.
---
Yea there was a spell squish, which at first was great, but they took too much away.
---
Orc has been fun as well
---
Appreciate this comment.  I'm a lowbie Warlock and I'm BROKE so I've been stressing about how I'm going to make some gold in this game.  Good to know it's easier to come by at higher levels so I can just continue leveling rather than going tryhard with professions and auctions.
---
Legit this will still happen at 60, I'm a mage and I get removed from groups all the time because "I'll roll on their pre BiS" despite it being +healing or a wand I don't want because I have the stat stick wand.
---
You'll find yourself kicked if you join parties already formed simply due to the gear you wear, i.e you use swords and the tank want a certain one, you wear cloth and there's a warlock, etc. 
---
People look to play optimally nowadays with most of the veterans being parents, career workers, etc.
---
What is a good high population pvp (not full) for alliance
---
I like how you didn't even bother going into DH lol
---
Lol, no fuckin way rlly?
---
Ah well, I guess everyone has bad days.
---
I know if I had not chosen to play retail for 15 years, I would probably be less burned out and think better of it
---
When did they add scaling like that? That's crap..
---
ony and rag both drop tier 2. has been that way since 1.0 i believe
---
I think there's a free character transfer when you click on the "shop" button on the home screen. Honestly idk if it's a one time thing and if you want to do that, but if you want to that'd be awesome!
---
It sometimes overheats and shuts down on login, 2018 book too. Poor guy can’t handle the 2004 specs I guess
---
I had the opposite problem with my warrior Paschendale. Spelled for the Maiden song, kept getting whispers from wannabe WWI history buffs "Did you know your name is really close to a famous WWI battle"? NOPE WHAT A COINCIDENCE GOLLY GEE YOU'RE SO SMART THANKS FOR TELLING ME A NEW THING. or "You spelled it wrong." It was basically neckbeard bait that kept leading to people trying to give me a history lesson so I rerolled .\_.
---
Are you saying that you can't hit Exalted in Darnassus  until you're level 60 generally, or are you commenting on the cloth quests?
---
Warlock &gt; Rogue
---
Back in Vanilla people would say that trolling the class forums was too easy. Except druids. Only troll the druid class forums if you want pancakes.
---
Ahh yes, one for beer and one for piss
---
You're projecting super hard and you make yourself sound stupid af
---
As a mage I just hit a point where I can AOE grind and I agree with this completely. Last night I helped some lower level guildies by AOE grinding their mobs because it was far more fun. Sometimes as I am running by random folks and see them needing a hand I will just stop and help them for half an hour. 
---
But it will take me longer as a result of me having more fun.
---
Private aervers have just dictated the "meta" because there is 14 years of theory crafting on there. Esfand was a PS player used to stream it on youtube
---
how does the soulstone work for warlocks? how do i use on my party?
---
Yep, when pop out of form with full mana and want to use it well, locks synergize. A regrowth/rejuv should do most of the work while the healer drinks
---
THE BEST AND CHEAPEST ZUGS IN TOWN
---
I miss playing Ret back in Wrath and being unstoppable :(
---
Basically everyone is going for what's good per parsed data from private servers.  One thing that makes it relevant is proper rotation which despite picking one of the best dps if you do your rotation poorly it doesn't matter cause your dps will reflect that too.
---
Will do that on my lunch break, thanks.
---
Uh huh. That's why I had the name Dropthesoap on my rogue from Wrath until now. Nice source btw.
---
::laughs in arcane::
---
That honestly sounds like something not fun and a poor way to invest energy and which would ultimately sap me of my desire to play the game.
---
me and the gf found a chest with just a single piece of dwarven mild in it last night -\_-
---
Ya don't you just hate it when warriors roll on staves...
---
I've been using classicwow.live for questing and a mix of the icy veins and Wowhead guides for talents, gear, rotation, and whatnot.  Just having those three tabs open is all I've needed.
---
The loss of stamina/strength from stacking spirit hurts combat too much to make the lower downtime worth it imo. Ive tried both ways and really i hate not being able to 2v1 mobs more than i hate having to eat more
---
Whoa watch out, we have a quick witted one here boys...

Shamans Rise Up
---
If you are playing the cookie cutter 21/30 healing spec that most priests will play then it is not worth having as the spirit buff from the discipline tree is much better and you can only pick one. I'm playing my own hybrid sort of spec and I do have an extra point up my sleeve and lightwell with a group that communicates well is definitely worth it for me. If used correctly (when your party know to use it when they aren't taking damage or tanking mobs) it can provide 4k healing for just 225 mana at level 40 which is incredibly good value. If you do 5 man content with a warlock mate then it is definitely worth the one point.
---
It's a mage posting it. They run it 4 mages and pref a priest healer. No tank needed.
---
With how much people like you bitch about it, you'd think you would be able to find each other and group up.
---
If the ease or difficulty of somebody else obtaining something in anyway effects how you value your obtaining that same thing, that is on you.
---
What a prick your old gm is.
---
Its a game
---
Its played for fun
---
Use common courtesy and respect. They sound like they are full of themselves. This sort of self entitled godcomplex ultracrap is why i seldom join anything anymore.
---
BuS warrior gloves are also level 40ish mail.  Feral druids also have a level 20 mace that’s bis technically and a 40ish trinket that’s bis.
---
Don’t even get me started on pvp gear... GS is basically completely worthless.
---
This was definitely a thing back in vanilla. How was it standard? Nope. I used to get pissed as a rogue who ran with 2 mages buddies in dungeons. For a long time I did significantly less damage than them until I got further down the combat tree. Now I think you can argue that it’s gone further considering people are taking 3 casters now. People didn’t like to have to compete with 3 people for gear let alone 4(assuming your healer is priest). But whatever. If people only know how to aoe at 60., the fun will still be there for those who learn their class. More mages means more bad mages.
---
What's the addon for displaying all that extra detail? Total +spell damage, etc
---
there are plenty of unused zones in the wow map, maybe add dungeons/raids with loot skewed towards speccs that need a hand?
---
I went the spell cleave group and got 60 pretty fast. Still made a ton of friends with tanks healer and mages. We did a 30 hour brd to lbrs group on the final push from 50 to 60 with all of the same guys. Even got a few brd runs in after we hit 55. We still regularly party, and I got an invite into server first mc clear.
---
I'm adding OP to the list.
---
Shamans don't exist i guess
---
WAAAAAAH, people dont play the game how I want
---
Oh well yeah, of course. Anybody who refers to any server as dead or dying in any way is usually massively out of touch and or a private server sycophant.
---
Get a new girlfriend lol
---
Like Mages aoe grinding back in the day?
---
No
---
Aap only "works" till 40
---
It's on there. Listed beside Paladin.
---
Yeah someone else explained that too. I kept hearing “classic is 1.12” but seeing 1.13 on classic wowhead and couldn’t find the answer by google. Thanks for the explanation
---
90% mage for sure
---
I see that even comments about rogues can use stealth.
---
They can single smith
---
Oh you're right, my bad
---
Hell, works for the Irish.
---
Not in Vanilla/Classic. The ability to DW was added in patch 2.0.1
---
Instead of making a hotkey do one thing like casting a single spell or using a single item, you can write a macro in World of Warcraft to do have a hotkey do many things. 
---
As an example, you might know that you can type emotes into the chat box like /dance to start dancing. If your make a macro that says the following:
---
/say Let's dance!!
---
/dance
---
Then that macro will let you say "Let's dance!!" and then start dancing with one button press. 
---
This is useful because a rogue can make a macro that unmounts them and stealths at the same time instead of manually having to unmount and then manually pressing stealth. This turns two key presses into one. 
---
The above macro would look like this:
---
/cancelform
---
/cast Stealth
---
Check your auction house. First aid can be free to level after you vendor your bandages.

Imagine being this wrong lol
---
Um what server are you on? Lol the rest of us don't experience this
---
No he shouldn't of. Rend is garbage. He did it perfectly.
---
I could not imagine playing warrior without a mount past 40
---
Far sight and eagle eye I think
---
This is the answer. It does it with Druid forms too. I like to hide my heals when I am in cat/bear just for more screen real estate.
---
So didn't actually destroy the faction balance. You just so happen to have personal experiences on the server that led you to feel like it was suddenly unbalanced.
---
Tomorrow you could have a completely different experience that makes you think the faction balance has shifted wildly in your favor. Hooray for unquantifiable unverifiable feelings and the freedom to use them as basis for wild and hilarious complaints!
---
&gt; maybe i just prefer the old fashioned holy trinity (or the four archtypes of dps, tank, healer, cc) but it never clicked with me.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I find that modern MMOs like GW2 and ESO while fun, really falls short due to the lack of a real trinity. Every class can do everything. Which is why I keep going back to MMOs like WoW, DAoC and FFXIV. I really want a new MMORPG where the holy trinity is respected and possibly add CC as its own respectable archetype which so far only Dark Age of Camelot does really well at the moment.
---
I'm. So. Angry!
---
Hey Stalin I thought you were fucking dead
---
I'm sorry, but you're not much of a tank if you don't know that Battle Shout is your threat generator...
---
I want to play either a gnome warrior or warlock but can’t decide. I will be playing on a pvp server and I like to world pvp. My friend is playing a rogue so I don’t know what would mesh well.
---
Isn't Dal Rend an UBRS item and thus a raid item?
---
I was only 5 when vanilla released and I always wanted to experience WoW in the way people did at the original launch and honestly I couldnt be happier with classic
---
You can restealth after gouge?
---
I've watched some streamers do Ony, T2 helms dropped.
---
It shouldn't be, but it is what it is.  I'd much rather not give blizzard any money but I kinda have to now.
---
So for enh I would go with two handed weapons?
---
It's literally a stat stick. The shaman should've been in RFK and trying to get a Corpsemaker.
---
Typical ninjalooter.... First warn him, if he still does it, either leave the group or kick him.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Runed copper battle axe is a good option from blacksmithing at low levels. Look for the RFC quest “Hidden Enemies” to get the Axe of Orgrimmar as a huge upgrade.
---
I'm not sure, I resubbed after years.
---
The color depth on that looks great
---
Roommate and I are looking to very casually play together. Probably will mostly spend it on questing. What’s a good combo?
---
Udumb
---
Blizzard has their "reference client' they promised it's a bug OMEGALUL
---
lmao
---
It feels good to help others. I gave it about 30 linen bags in brill to lowbies on my server. Cleaned up my inventory and helped people out. Win win.

Get out of here dad you can't fool me I said I'd do the dishes soon.

Well, thats in terms of total xp.  But you'll be gaining xp faster at that level, so you'll spend less time
---
Why do i have to pick one?
---
Wtf?
---
Just curious, how long will that be a good weapon if you got it at 30?
---
I skipped 3 or 4 of the gnome quests. That's easily my least favorite dungeon in classic
---
I use DejaCharStats too and don't like the ilvl stuff showing.
---
You can just turn off that option and anything else you don't like while still maintaining the extended stats option.
---
They might be important if they guild you play with or the Pug you join has resistance requirements
---
Peasants use 4g 20s 69b.
---
Prince use 69g 42s 0b
---
Kings use 420g 69s 69b
---
Gods use 42069g.
---
Yup. maybe for WOW Classic 2 in 20 years they might learn from this.
---
It's a steal!

We used to have a guild rank called the 'naughty step' with no chat posting permissions that we'd stick spammy people on for like 5 minutes to calm down while giggling at them :D

You can also just enable class name colors so you don't have to shift click on everyone.

It's already happening? The wow version of yellow text content suggestions? Support

How can you be so lifeclueless? Holy shit I feel dumber just reading your comments.
---
So i tried something that helped...I disabled all addons and reset interface settings to default.  
---
Then I re-enabled the UI and Bartender 4.
---
It didn't disappear, but it moved it to the upper right corner, which is ok.  Going to re-enable the addons one at a time now.
---
Unless you herb. Then it’s a bitch finding them.
---
Guilds run by narcissists are a miserable experience.  Consider yourself lucky.
---
I hate this so much.  I even get people doing this when I'm on my Mage, and it's so hilarious because 9/10 I'm going to get the tag with my Fire Blast macro.  The invites suddenly start pouring in, but 5 minutes earlier it was everyone's full or complete silence...like, just fucking work with everyone to finish a kill quest, it's not that hard of a concept.
---
learn to lose with dignity
---
I got feared by a bat, and the fear pathed me inside of a tree, and then I got kicked. When I relogged I was half way across the map in some random graveyard.

Please list your addons.

Did you remote connect any other time prior?
---
All I’ve been running is 3 ravager war 1 ravager enhance shammy and holy priest. The downtime is so minimal it’s nice.
---
You have a number of "signature" spells for every spec and can't learn spells of other specs: no frosbolt for firmage, survival hunter have almost no ranged spells etc.
---
There are seven tiers of talents you can use one of three at every tier: they add new abilities or give something to your old ones.
---
Level spells are mostly deprecated, but some spells still have several levels giving new effect for the spell.
---
Is this some sort of healer joke I'm too tanky to understand
---
Rogue
---
No one should care about that shit in a leveling "Zerg" guild
---
Yea wtf
---
or elite quests that suggest you group up with other players, which results in creation of new bonds
---
For horde its 4 warriors and a resto shaman. Gotta say tho, works really damn well in ZG. 
---
Toss down windfury, stoneskin, and healing stream, magma, and just chain heal the warriors as they keep pulling until I gotta sippy sip.

Ezpz.

I have not allowed my life to become too busy (I'm 23, living on my own), because I value free time more than almost anything. Even with full-time work, I am left with around eight hours of free time on a weekday, and much more on weekends. Simple living is a blissful thing that I intend to maintain.
---
That's funny. I transferred to deviate Delight as well and I have been having a great time with people.
---
I can tell there are fewer people on deviate Delight.
---
It required effort on my part to open my mouth and talk to people and play with people and make the effort to invest personally in the small but growing community.
---
And it does take a minimal amount of self-control and discipline too, if I find myself out in the wetlands and I happened to be alone and nobody speaks in general chat for 5 minutes, not immediately get depressed and delete my character and re-roll on grobbulus.
---
I mean I don't know how else to say it. You craft the community experience you want. Whether your server has 10,000 people or 1,000 people.
---
Now that's the "welcome to classic" I'm used to.
---
My friend is on that server but playing after work is basically peak hours which I don’t want to wait to play with the limited time after work that I have but I’ll probably try it out
---
:ork101:
---
Man I’m 2.5 days played and 33 and feel like I’ve been squeezing in more than I’m comfortable with my schedule. I almost wanted to reroll back to rogue from mage because there are so many mages but the 2.5 days was a huge turnoff. Just figure that there are so many mages that means there will be a ton of bad mages. Hopefully I don’t end up falling into that category.
---
You are referring specifically to levelling in raids with AOE right? I am not, nor was the sub thread  down to my comment. In fact the important point of "three mages" and the bottleneck being mage mana means that this could be done in a party anyway. However I don't really want to argue that or argue about levelling because.. levelling.
---
I AOE farmed plenty in a party as a  priest with a warrior bff. We would get mages/locks and go ham. While this is obviously my personal anecdote it wasn't a secret. I knew many people on my server who would do it. It wasn't "normal" but it was common among players/groups that knew "how to play". It isn't against the spirit of vanilla unless vanilla means "having no idea how to play".
---
I'm not playing classic because I got as close to "finishing" vanilla as I could and the amount of play time for the handful of encounters I never beat (loatheb+) is not worth it today. However I am watching streams for nostalgia. Many of the big streamers talk about how "vanilla was not like this" in some particular way. Their vanilla experience was not like that is what they mean because they (overall) did not play in a guild that killed everything and had it on farm before the next expansion came out. Many of the aspects that seem new, cool and getting people excited existed in vanilla back in the day.
---
For example earlier this week a streamer (can't remember) was talking to his party about how "in vanilla noone knew what bosses would drop and people would get excited and see unexpected things" + waffle about BIS. This was couched in a manner that makes it sound like everyone's experience. Which is absolute nonsense. Many people knew what things would drop where. Many people I knew had loot tables memorised because it was faster than tabbing out to look at thottbot back then. Most of the tools, techniques and whatnot that exist now existed back in vanilla because that is where they originated. 
---
TLDR; People AOE farmed with a mage/lock heavy group in vanilla. Has nothing to do with "spirit of vanilla".
---
Benediction here too, found it quite odd. Most servers are high or full as well, it's almost like they had to temporarily lower the numbers of players. I'm the only one in my guild on, so it doesn't feel like it's just a lot of players on at once
---
Sounds like a personal problem.
---
Lmao mages are not broken. I don’t think I’ve ever lost to a mage in a fair 1v1. Every class has unique and powerful abilities—that’s one reason why classic is so great. No class homogeneity.
---
That’s great! Keep up the good work. Your cast always makes my commutes much more bearable.
---
Wow, which UI is this? Looks really clean.
---
Because they rolled rogue or hunter and feel left out and instead of making their own group made of the classes that are left out they would rather cry about how they aren’t invited.
---
Then people wonder how retail got to the point it is at, crybaby shit like what you read here.
---
I don't think you know what literally means. Staves usually have very slow attack speed so windfury procs hit for a lot.
---
Oh that grinds my gears. I could practically tank while in metamorphosis on my demonology lock. I come back and see that they took my spec into a whole new class...
---
Not quite the impression I have of some classes. I may even have stopped playing druid because it's such a bore. I'm leveling a mage now and holy smokes I do so much more damage. Everything goes so much faster.
---
Get an authenticator ASAP and require authentication for each log-in. This could be a much larger problem for your pc though, would 100% secure all accounts ever used on it.
---
Except against Warlocks
---
Typo on LoS, Line of Sight.
---
It’s not like you start at 0 when you hit 60 though.
---
What’s the best auction house add-on? 
---
The two I’ve tried (auctioneer and TSM) seem kind of overwhelming. Are there any other options?
---
Oh I bet you're going to love when you find out those quests send you back in a total of 3 times.
---
Neat plates has cast bars.
---
ElvUI
---
To everyone else it just means you're a bad healer.
---
Don't forget team, whatever you do, don't hit the same target as somebody else! Wouldn't want to make life easier.
---
THeres a part of me hoping id get hooked once again and make classic wow my everything, outside of work but it didnt catch like i thought it would.
---
Still enjoy it, but this time on a legit casual basis, i can't stomach playing for more than an hour at a time.
---
If that's what it takes and you want it that bad
---
Tomorrow's experience will be different from today's
---
Or you can make an effort to meet and find people who are also actively against the spell cleave idea
---
So Tauren have this problem because they have larger hit boxes compared to other races.  The fix to this is to be close to both mobs.  It doesn’t hit a nearby target if you aren’t nearby.  In this case, stepping closer SHOULD fix the issue.  Rogue blade flurry works the same way.
---
u should never download 3rd party addons, u should only download addons directly from blizzard
---
i like saving people from dying, or rezzing them when they die. the worst i've had happen tho is someone sees me heal them then LOS me and lets me die.  some people are assholes, or just bad at the game. idk which.
---
Needs a fix ASAP
---
Better pay for the Respec.
---
As a shaman I feel this on a personal level....
---
As a resto shaman, I both support and appreciate this notion. 
---
10/10 will windfury totem you every pull, even if only you benefit from it.
---
What rotation may i ask u? Its classic u only have 1 skill
---
Combat Rogue weapon upgrades are few and far between, if you only run dungeons.
---
Some dude was waiting for a boss I also needed so I invited him to group. He said "Nah I'm good" so I didn't say anything. We were waiting and the dude decided to go mine a nearby node. The boss spawned and insta aggroed me and I started fighting it. The dude ran back mid-mining and group invited me. 
---
Proceeded to kill it, loot it, THEN accept his group invite.
---
Typed "/p Nah I'm good." then left the party and blocked him before he can reply.
---
Yeah, interrupting my quests with saps, blinds and death.
---
Make new friends
---
I feel ya. I'm an exterminator and summer is our busiest time. So happy it's about to be fall and hours go down (pay stays the same though).
---
really isn't too relevant considering 10g now =/= 10g in 3 months. If you don't need gold now, save it for later. Same with BoE twink gear, can either sell now for \~5g or hold onto it and sell it for a couple of hundred down the road when BGs are released.
---
If you want to potentially find out which addon this is, if any at all... If there not reading this or dont have good operational security. Next time it happens, get all of your network connects (netstat) at the time it happens and document them. Then, put all of your addons in a free malware analysis tool, such as joesandbox or hybrid analysis. See if any of the identified IPs identified from the tool match any of the IPs from your netstat.
---
The likelihood of this matching is probably low...however something to consider. In addition, hopefully the potential malicious developer isn't reading reddit post like this to change their tactics.  If it is caused by your addon. I suggest also ensuring you don't have team viewer or similar application running.
---
The circle jerk in this sub is out of control...
---
WoD, Legion, and BFA classes all have WAY more actual meaningful buttons to press than any Classic class...I'm not really sure how you can even compare them...
---
You're going to compare [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/ShakingFrozenLampTBTacoLeft) to modern mage? I'm loving Classic too and having tons of fun, but threads like this are just ridiculous.
---
He hasn't oficially yet, but Sco has hopped in his chat after the new toon was made and offered him a spot and possibly help getting to Twitchcon.  He said on stream he would join.
---
You could argue though that the increased rate of farming vendor trash has inflated the gold available in the economy, therefore increasing the value of everything else like devilsaur leather.
---
What a burn
---
Let’s wait and see when the first big content patch drops in retail. At least some people will leave then
---
I got both to level 25 and I have decided to stick with Hunter. 
---
Back in vanilla I raided with Druid and loved it, but now I am also unlikely to do any hardcore raiding.  I loved the look of T2 druid set but really hate how druid's gears are kinda out of sync otherwise (has to wear dress for resto spec and the leather pieces look mismatched for feral).  Plus I never had a hunter at 60 so that's why I decided on hunter
---
Wait for people to leave, then discuss how we could have kept them.  That sounds like a solid plan lol.
---
Well, i agree with you, but you can't not be the hero after defeating Ragnaros, Illidan and Lich King. That's a problem when you have an expansion to an epic ending. Unless you need to create a new character to play the next content, it will be yours, now epic, character journey continuation.
---
Are they stealth shrinking servers? Stalagg queue monitor reporting higher than usual queues after many days of steady decline
---
Did you just win your pre raid bis to a double 100 roll?
---
he is a legend of a bloke
---
pounce is a 2s stun, hibernate is a 1.5s cast that you need to get out of cat form to use (gcd)
---
not even counting the pet itself hitting on you and pushing back your hibernate cast, giving hunter the time to simply SS you
---
It's always funny to read these class vs class from different perspective it's always a "it's so easy bro" matchup
---
by your same logic the Hunter scatter shot you in cat form any time and then Scare Beast, easy
---
Yeah, I am definitely aware that very little about Retail feels rewarding, specifically because of how much I have played retail in the past, 14 years.
---
The pruned a lot of things that were bloat and weren't pressed much.
---
They did go a little far with the pruning but have since dialed it back, it's in a decent spot now I believe.
---
huh?
---
Yes, but how do you turn off the notifications whenever someone joins or leaves LFG. It is so obnoxiously spammy.
---
There's no way they're going to remove the layers by phase 2. Absolutely no way. There's 50,000+ people on multiple servers and the game is still growing. 
---
Sorry purists I would've preferred it without layers myself but there's just too much demand.
---
&gt;  also made all the classes more alike to each other.
---
They've been actively moving away from this for the last two expansions. It's the root of pruning that everyones complaining about in this thread.
---
Warrior's Embrace from Avatar of Hakkar and Elemental Rockridge Leggings from Princess are the two parts to my metal bikini.
---
Probably shouldn't have taken this picture in the church...
---
Probably in a PvE server lol
---
Yeah I've worked out the hp/me on most of my heals. I barely have any +healing and gheal is so far the best use of mana out of all of my spells. Heal is good to top off the group when not an emergency because renew is pretty garbage hpme with no healing on gear. I just use a mix of mid-rank and max-rank flash heal to spot heal the group if there's adds everywhere and a big fuckin mess.
---
Its actually easier for hunters to make gold, go sell Mara runs for 20g per ring
---
don't worry just a couple more days and all the tourists will start quitting in bulk, any day now, blizzard promised
---
I will check it out, thank you!!
---
Because there's no "spirit of vanilla" in 2019 for most players lol. You're playing a 2004 game with a 2019 community/mentality, this isn't a time machine.
---
I just started playing last weekend. I hadn't played retail in years so not kept up to date with the game. I learnt about classic from an online article on a news website, Blizz take my money.
---
I think there are a lot of people like me out there that loved vanilla and then hated what they did with the game and so can only be targeted via general media like news sites rather than gaming specific sites. Therefore I think this will be a slow build up as word spreads to us old farts.
---
Totally agree with you. Retail classes have actual rotations and interactive gameplay. Its not just spam frostbolt or shadowbolt
---
Cheap shot, gauge, blind, stealth, cheap shot, kidney shot, vanish, cheap shot, gauge. 
---
Fixes a UI bug.
---
Oh I guess you're right, it was briefly a special event dungeon as well.
---
Compared to three weeks ago. LOL.
---
haha Imagine judging people for how they spend ingame money in an RPG
---
The true gay agenda.
---
Getting good minion names is so satisfying. I'm super stoked with my Voidwalker (*Tanggrave*), and Succubus (*Anxia*).
---
Kidney Shot? Nah rogues get kidney shot in classic.
---
I think the dead giveaway that this is fake is that their is no other chat or anything inbetween the messages, like that is a decent size paragraph he wrote an everyone knows how aids world chat can be. I dunno im just not buyin it.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla and playing Horde now. The only quest lines that are remotely interesting for the Horde are the forsaken ones. A lot of the orc/troll quests sound like hobos begging for handouts and spare change to build up their mud hut city. 
---
Heck just duskwood alone is better than anything the Horde has to offer.
---
What are we looking at here?
---
You can't neglect real life responsibilities if you don't have real life responsibilities.

As a warrior, that Windfury is like crack man.
---
Right as you enter Azshara there is a horde questgiver right behind the Alliance FP, then another questgiver at the horde FP
---
I believe he got a list.
---
It's the same on my mage. There are more buttons in different situations, which was kind of the point. Spells from other specs have an impact and you lose a majority of them in retail when you choose a spec.
---
Listen, I get that.  A number of people have said that.  What I’m saying is that if I were looking through the AH, I wouldn’t buy something up cheap that someone else could really use (especially so early on in classic) to make 9 silver.  Here’s something new,  I play on a pvp server, and so it’s alliance vs horde.  If i were able to give my fellow faction members better gear they would be able to level more easily and get to cap faster and be better off from world pvp perspective.  I understand that the AH is a free market and all that crap, I was just hoping to help someone.  Because helping one helps us all.

Out of my like 40ish PVP deaths. Only 1 has be actually even level and 1 on 1. Of course my Fear doesnt land and his does sending me into 2 mobs. Lol but still a fair fight.
---
I just saw him and gave him a gold! And told him about this post!
---
For context I just wanted to farm some elementals, I had a gentleman's agreement with this mage through signs, he then proceeded to kill me once so I killed him back, then decided to get some just revenge after figuring out that he was going to blink when he rezzed. Apologies for the poor quality I don't have great internet and if your'e wondering about the accent it's Northern Irish.
---
Take your time and enjoy it. The raids aren’t going anywhere.  Don’t need to be 60 by now. There’s less to do when you get there until they release more which we don’t even have a timeframe for
---
Both of those are still in the game though.
---
I tried marking skull and x for awhile, but everyone just did whatever they fuck they wanted. The dungeons are pretty easy so dps can usually tank safely. We'll see if they learn at higher level stuff
---
yeah sure why not
---
probably because perdition blade is a ragnaros drop
---
That has been the case sine MoP, so 7 years now.
---
And it kind of sort of started in Cata with the refined talent trees, but not fully.
---
You're not wrong, you just don't understand the way the modern game has gone and how they've approached Class design. Many things that need to have the same spell on different specs have flavor name/animation differences.
---
Like Ice Barrier, Fire Barrier, and Arcane Barrier.
---
Goes to show people have no idea what's going to happen
---
Just my Bank-Alt but I feel like leveling it to 30 just to check out all the names.
---
Goddamn, that sounds hilariously bullshit. I'm definitely rolling rogue for my next character. Going to wait for the player influx to die down first though as mages are extremely overrepresented on my server and as a mage myself I just don't understand how rogues and warriors are supposed to beat mages in a 1v1 situation.
---
ahh yes, combine all these craftable things with a 10/30 minute cooldown and that will totally reflect on the macthup at hand!
---
You’re really reaching for that analogy. Retail is all builder spender rotations.
---
underrated comment
---
I tried to run in circles backwards like I always did in classic but no luck.
---
How is PvP grinding? That doesnt even make sense.
---
\#warlock scuba adventures
---
ass by far
---
Forsaken Warlock has pretty nice quality of life because both racials are useful. Will of the Forsaken is arguably the best PvP racial in the game and is useful in PvE fairly often too. For most cannibalize is just kind of a meme ability, but it really does save you some money as a lock since you can turn that health into mana by life tapping.
---
Oh yeah, because Classic is much more interesting....
---
[Frostbolt...Frostbolt...Frostbolt...Frostbolt...Frostbolt...](https://clips.twitch.tv/ShakingFrozenLampTBTacoLeft)
---
I've read about people being able to tame pets that are +2 their level, but I can't figure out if this has been fixed. Has it?
---
Yeah, better off advertising that stuff in trade chat.
---
The hand isn't clasping the staff? I don't know if that is what the op is referring to.
---
You must:
---
a) tame a pet with said ability (refer to petopia)
---
b) stand near the pet and make it use that ability a few times until it says in the chat "You have learned the ability _____"
---
c) have a pet that is both the minimum level to learn it (refer to petopia) and also the race of animal to learn it (i.e. cats can't learn charge, as it is boar only etc)
---
lol, idk how long you've been in this subreddit, but you'll get crucified for advocating for gearscore here. Maybe it's not as bad as it was before launch now that it's a whole new demographic, but their reasoning is any addon that outputs a "score" for your gear is anti-classic, which i agree with.
---
That is the equivalent of the starter zone of the xpac though.
---
That is not when the hard spec division started, it started in MoP when they turned dual-spec into being your specific spec.
---
How did you get SexyMaps to work? I downloaded it from twitch and it's there with a few options but the preset bit to change the look has no options. The header is there but the next header is right below it.
---
Was just thinking this. Age 30+ only huge red flag.
---
Yeah it's playable.
---
Layers don't affect the queue though. Layering solves different problems.
---
You made it to 25 with those! That’s pretty impressive haha
---
My first wow memory was running to Barrens as a level 12ish hunter, and probably only being about 12 years old, with a group of friends to get a raptor pet. Haven't played the hunter on retail in years but as long as nothing changed I still have that raptor.
---
Why is my paladin a holy rogue now?
---
A loooooong time. It usually lasts into the mid 40s. It’s very op at 30.
---
I guess Bliz are (finally) squishing the number of available layers.
---
Honestly yeah with the help of the questie add-on.  I accepted I probably won't be able to get 60 for at least another two weeks. Questing is better for making gold to need things once you hit and 60 anyways. I definitely won't say I'm taking my time but I'm just being more adventurous going to locations for quest my level using the add-on instead of just hyper focused on hitting end game and that being it. After that world first mage hit 60 the next three days he had to grind money anyways.
---
you need blacksmithing to use them
---
I blame streamers for starting this whole cleave spam garbage
---
" I choose not to make the effort to get to know anybody else because I expect to fall ass backwards into a happy friendly sociable pile of fun."
---
no better odds possible, you just press need or greed when an item shows up and the game auto rolls you a number between 1-100 if no one selected need it is greed rolled
---
lmfao cmon mate hahahahha
---
You didnt meed my ass with free action potions, mages are like moving target dummies lol.
---
&gt;for 5 seconds after dropping a totem you get an effect
---
Effects could be diffirent, like stronger totem, aoe healing, aoe damage, damage reduction etc.
---
like any other day
---
Go priest. Ive always played rogue or hunter and it's refreshing to be a caster n do different stuff. Also I'm virtually unbeatable 1v1 in the open world lol it's so funny seeing people open on me and then it's like oh shit his wand does a lot of damage
---
Why do you think that is? The comment above you said the same. Are alt codes indicative of something?
---
I thought the point was to go back to vanilla... this is vanilla.
---
How to tell if someone has no idea how specs work in Classic:
---
i am the one who prays
---
Although this is true, it’s pointless for a shaman to do so since we don’t have any talents that benefit spirit regen. If the piece of gear is there and no one else’s needs it, and has other stats besides spirit, then yes it will work with the spirit on the gear. But in testing, int/Stam stacking is the way to go. Anything “of the Eagle” should be worn instantly no matter how minor the upgrade is to stats over spirit any day.
---
Maybe
---
MoP was the best if you ask me. They even managed to add complexity to *affliction*, pretty much every other expansion has had them just apply 2-3 dots/ debuffs and spam something. Maybe with a haunt on cool down.
---
Whose licking me!?
---
Posted and sold prices are very different
---
Ran from thalnos at LVL 12 due to this.
---
I would just do this all day. That shit is hilarious
---
The only downside to SUF is that there is not indication for difficulty. So I’ll hit something too many levels above me more than I should.
---
No body wants to quest alone .... That's the answer .... No body wants to quest alone. Watching your favorite streamer grind through wow classic levels much like yourself; taking part in twitch chat banter. It all make you feel like you ain't doing the grind alone half the time
---
God damn skyrim horses.....

Hi, /u/GetToWorkBruno

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d31u6f/level_36_and_just_realized_i_can_zoom_out_my/). 
---
Is that not a medium spirit? You don't play retail trying to conserve resources. You might keep them for key parts of the fight, but other than that you wanna use everything as much as possible. There's no risk of running out of mana and being useless for a minute (unless you're a healer). No super long cooldowns that last over multiple pulls either.
---
Not too sure haha I haven’t seen any horde yet but I’m only 28
---
google
---
I don’t mind people pulling off me right away via AoE. I tell people that if you cast in first 2 seconds of a fight and pull agro then that’s your mob to tank. 
---
If you don’t wanna let me build threat then by all means, you tank it.
---
Only every day
---
So basically, you're telling people not to use a feature Blizzard built into the game to be used and enjoyed.  You're an odd one.
---
At least you're honest lol
---
And I’m just saying, we’re both near the node at the same time.  I want that Copper node as much as you do.  Why in God’s name would I let you have it when you were kind enough to clear the mob guarding it for me?
---
That’s unlikely as it’s happening on multiple servers that are not normally queued.... on a random Wednesday...
---
Right so my experience and everyone else who is posting about it on our server discord and the official forums. Clearly the opinion of some random jackass on reddit who doesn't even know what server I'm talking about is more credible than everyone who plays on the server.
---
I've never died in WoW.
---
So true. Quested with one tonight in Hillsbrad to do a yeti quest. We cleared out the initial cave with him mostly in cat form but then had to go into arathi which is a much higher level zone and fucking run to the cave. We got tangled up with the Syndicate and fought off a shitload with him in bear form absorbing hits for me before swapping out to heal when we got low and despite being outnumbered killed a good 5-6 before having to leg it. 
---
Then we got to an ogre camp and we had to get through but there was no way we could take them as they were much higher level. Help arrived in the most unexpected of causes as some alliance gnome mage sorta seemed to see what we were doing and a few /waves etc. Later she cleared the area for us despite us all being PVP flagged! 
---
We slowly snuck our way into the yeti cave and we met another higher levelled adventurer so the Druid healed for us and helped us slay this level 37 yeti monstrosity. 
---
But all the mobs outside had respawned. So the Druid switched to cat form, ran forward pulling everything and outrunning them due to speed and essentially cleared a path for the rest of us singlehandedly culminating in a mad dash for our lives across arathi and back into hillsbrad. 
---
Later on that night I ran into him again as I was grinding and some night elf rogue tried to Gank me (loosely he was 33-34 and I was 29) just after I killed a mob. Luckily I dinged as I killed it and with this Druid healing me like a champ we actually managed to kill him! 
---
TLDR: I had an epic adventure with a Druid and they are indeed the best to quest with!
---
I always assumed it was because there’s such a low skill requirement that “bad” players are able to reach higher levels faster.
---
Hey, we have massive hearts cmon
---
Layers have nothing to do with the queues..
---
It's more likely people are just playing.
---
You dont bring tanks to spellcleave
---
Haha yah I’m not hardcore enough to put up with 4 hour queues lol
---
Paladin? How about frost mage. Ret is just a builder/spender, where as frost mage is literally shoehorned into a ranged rogue build due to Glacial Spike being so dominant. At least with Ret you have procs that can generate extra holy power or give you free uses of Templar's/Divine Storm.
---
I'm not that guy, but neither. It appears that the issue is that heals and buffs and what not create threat on enemies which is then applied to the casters of said spells on the enemies threat table. So those abilities are "sharing" their threat with other party members, instead of it all going on just the caster. It's not an issue with the numbers generated, it's an issue with where the numbers are distributed once they have been generated.
---
What happens when all need on that cloth piece?
---
I totally agree with you. It just seems like a courtesy to ask first, I get that. 
---
On a different note, does retail really have personal loot? Like something that drops for me only drops for me?
---
You better not do any raids in Classic then.
---
And cast frostbolt or arcane missiles (lul) anyway. You'll get to play fire in like AQ and shit and it's definitely more fun than frost
---
There are quests, you just won't ding 60 purely from quests probably. You'll need to grind some mobs as well.
---
Just do some dungeons or kill some mobs.
---
Am i the only herbalist here that can find herbs using the minimap and play on max graphs just fine?
---
1) im not attacking at all. im a healer =/ 
---
2) if u want attack - you can attack normally and heal members using mouseover macroses (when u just hover mouse over them and press skill, with no pressing target)
---
3) im guesing like at 25 lvl, maybe. but its not strong and manahungry. And you have one also in talants
---
Is that guy saying that gear checks are engaging?
---
Excuse me
---
Exactly, i have zero problems lol
---
Google &lt;big name streamer&gt; Onxyia kill. Fast forward to the end. 
---
Spoilers: t2 helms
---
i mean, isn't that an addon?
---
Yeah. At least thats how it was in Legion. I havent really touched much of BFA so I cannot comment on that.
---
The 'LookingForGroup' Channel is pretty good.
---
apply to any of the many guilds actively looking for new members. Doesn’t have to be the H3rdOre “Lite Gamers just a decently big guild and you basically force yourself to interact with other players. It’s always fun to have a massive Discord group convo
---
Now I can finally afk heal!
---
Honestly, if your on Mankrik it was probably me
---
From a new player's perspective, do you feel lost? As in having no fucking clue how to progress, not as in not knowing as much as you wanted.
---
Kinda curious. I've played for a long ass time and still feel lost from time to time in Classic. Wonder how new players find themselves in Classic vs. retail.
---
I had an Orc shout taco to me today.
---
Bruh.
---
Valid question. Back in the ye ole days I remember some carrying staves I thought.. 🤔🤔
---
which is so weird to me, its such a boring game to watch someone play (not a bash on the game itself)
---
Right! Now I wish I made a bigger deal of it at the time. I gotta find my imp doppelganger
---
Str is your main stat, followed by Stam if you are tanking and then Agi if you go Fury (dual wield).
---
That being said, keep an eye out for 2h axes as you are an Orc, you get a skill bonus, which will increase your hit chance on mobs and make boss mobs a little easier to hit.
---
&gt;Also LOL at three MORE fucking posts from you dude. What the hell is wrong with you. Some serious autism showing off here. You might want to take a long look in the mirror and think about why you care about this so much, then shake your head, or like, consider suicide or something.
---
Trying to say what you want to say no matter what.
---
Both me and my healer in my last armory run... Like... I'm your biggest DPS, the healer is why we are all alive... CHILL BRO. I cant do all those chain lightnings or help the healer with those heals if you don't let me get my mana.
---
we were all dumb back then, we didn’t even know how to press the same spell over and over. That’s why this happened. We know so much now.
---
The server populations are dynamic based on people logged in. If everyone logged out at once the server would have Low population. At prime times, or as more people join a server, it'll hit full sometimes.
---
Full means there is a Queue on the realm. Once it drops out of prime time it wont have a queue anymore, or if people lose interest in classic.
---
I'm unable to access any of resource websites like wowhead/wowwiki etc
---
And I'm doing some theorycraft
---
Don't understand why your comment is controvercial... It's horrible in comparison.  
---
Anyway, try this addon: https://github.com/getov/CharacterStatsClassic
---
Prayer of Healing is the group heal. You get the first rank at level 30.
---
Some tips are: 
---
* don't heal people until they are lower on HP, e.g., close to 30%, and don't bother healing them to 100%
---
* keep multiple ranks of heals available and choose the one that will heal enough for the moment
---
* if the party is healthy you can drink between pulls while they fight the next one; since you won't heal until they're low you have some extra time
---
* learn the 5-second rule: you regen mana 5 seconda after you last spent mana, so if you don't need to be casting then stop
---
* to DPS use your wand
---
I think removing Metamorphosis was fine. That never really felt right to me.
---
But they replaced it with a system of pets as glorified dots instead. 
---
Instead of the mind-numbingly boring, predictable rotation they have right now, it would be nice if they did something with Demo to actually make it worth using your other pets. In Classic other pets have situational uses, but in retail, there's literally no reason to every use anything besides Felguard ever. 
---
Removing Metamorphosis was only a mistake because the Warlock team seems too lazy, or too incompetent to replace it with something equally compelling. So now we have an incredibly boring, predictable rotation where you just put DoTs on the enemy with demons as the animation.
---
Instacast druid Hot and priest Renew.. does that put them in combat instantly or does it not occur until the first tick?
---
Incase you don't know as priest especially you should focus on burst healing with your biggest heals all at once - don't heal even your tank until he is at 30% and then top him up in one go. And basically never do anything else except for wand.  It takes 5 seconds for mana regeneration to begin again after casting most spells.
---
Im not certain but probably.  Think it was a quick conversion from the retail version sp some of those little details probably not addressed yet.
---
Really putting those critical thinking skills to use I see.
---
Groundskeeper on strike
---
Cool. The faction balance was not destroyed.
---
Wait, you can soulstone a dead  player in Retail?
---
How does that even make sense? o.o.
---
How do people notice layering? I’m on a medium/high pop server and don’t know what to look for.
---
That's an issue with you though. Once you get to 60 in Classic if you plan on doing any degree of daring, like at least 3 of the classes I can think of are 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 3. or something to that effect.
---
And there's even less raid to pay attention to. Maybe the game didn't get worse, but your taste changed away from key based MMOs
---
That zone forces everyone to a single layer?
---
That is not true, the more layers they have the more players they can fit into the server gameplay wise.  The caps they've been using (18k+) are only possible because they can spread everyone around the number of layers they have.  If they start reducing the number of layers they're going to have to drop the cap in order for the game to be playable.
---
No. It more likely has to do with the taurens extra reach. This is not intended behavior.
---
And now we're back to no dps lmao
---
Where do you get your addons from? This shouldn't be possible.
---
Maybe this is what they meant when they said "You think you do but you don't"
---
The game has been out for 15 years. Google it.
---
Anything related to raiding. Especially in this games infancy where people need buffs on relatively poor quality pre raid gear and are constantly upgrading gear. Therefore enchanting and alchemy. Take up cooking for buff food too and fishing for money and help level cooking. Only issue with enchanting is that a good chunk of revenue requires you to sit in a major city waiting for customers so it's a time sink of you want to maximise profits
---
I'm right wing for life that sounds great ffs.
---
650 loooool you're dreaming
---
You people (classic fanboys) talk like nobody solo levels in vanilla, and nobody ever plays in a group in retail. It always leaves me wondering if you're ignorant, willfully ignorant, or know the truth but are lying because it's a common statement in the classic echo chamber and you want people to like you.

Where have they released how many low, medium, high and full translates to.
---
You throw that down everywhere u go on the off chance you get ganked by rogues? Lol probably not a bad idea
---
Why do you need leatherworking? Isn't devilsaur leather just dropped from skinning from the devilsaur?
---
Gonna need the sword of a thousand truths for that
---
It's great when someone tries to get you and you just sac VW and they run away after watching your HP just go back up to full

Congrats. I will try at home again but I might stick to mobile data 😅
---
What's the source of the trickster art?
---
Thanlos was BiS. 
---
Someone posted it shortly before half the servers disappeared.
---
is it normal to get burned out on one character and then reroll to another when solo leveling?
---
I have a 26ish preist and am so tired of dying instantly when the enemy mobs are grouped so close together that when I tag one, I get the whole group.
---
buying gold with $$
---
AKA a lot of things in D&amp;D 3.5. Probably a dozen different ways to build one. It's a very popular concept that is surprisingly underserved in games. IME, it's rare to see it as a first class citizen like "sneaky guy" or "healer", even though it's something that seems very popular.
---
Or at the very least a game with content worth doing.
---
People are the biggest losers
---
On top of that, they pruned pretty much all utility/fluff spells. So while you do have more actually useful spells to use in combat, the general number of spells isn't that big. You pretty much just have your rotation and cooldowns.
---
If I ever get to 60 I’ll be happy. Even rounding the bend to 40 will be a nice milestone with my upcoming calendar. 
---
Would love to start a warlock
---
It's a weird peeve. I've had alt codes in my character names because I was always late to the party and the names I liked were taken. I absolutely despise drama and do my absolute best to avoid it.
---
Fuck, I'm a rogue..
---
You can tank if you died
---
Rampage is all I need.
---
Play classic like it’s your first time. There is no rush. Level an alt and see more of the world
---
happy cake day btw :). yeah i do end up feeling lost, what makes it worse is looking through endless guides. so far i find it much more enjoyable just playing and doing what i feel like in the moment. i don't wanna try and take on too much and get overwhelmed. iv never played any WoW game either, so its cool playing the original.
---
nah daggers is terrible for levelling as you can't backstab without gouging or stunning the mob first. combat swords if you want to kill stuff faster or hemo spec will give you better chances in pvp.
---
So I have never changed keybindings, but you can still strafe fine by holding right click while pushing forward+direction. Is the only difference to rebinding the turn keys just so you dont have to also hold forward?
---
Hear, hear on that 2nd point. I realiz we’re all competing for kills, but don’t just run by someone dying so you can take their mob.
---
Compared to classic where my rotation is literally 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4? Or in raids: 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4...
---
Yep, my thought with that is quick respawn, cloth and coin drop, if you're horde you've got stonard close and I can't imagine it would be too terribly crowded.
---
Priest to 60 first so I can dungeon and raid, hunter or rogue when I'm not farming for raids, still haven't decided yet.
---
Jeeze, you must be the videogame market expert huh? It's not like any other developer has done something on a similar level of this before and made profits!
---
You're absolutely idiotic if you think they're not making millions on Classic Wow within the first 2 weeks of release. There's thousands of players paying 15$ a month each. It doesn't take a genius to know they're not running a game (that was already made 15 years ago) at a loss.
---
240p authentic classic experience.
---
I got kicked out of a guild I'd been in for 4 years over petty drama like that. Right around launch of firelands, my (former stoner) gm decided that anyone who wasn't 100% contributing to raid progression needed to gtfo. I've joined the odd guild here and there, but for the most part I gave up on guilds. I don't have the time or energy anymore to engage in the bullshit drama. I'm paying to play this game, kiss my ass.
---
Are you serious or is this a home?
---
Someone gets it and we keep going.  That's the joy of a set guild group we don't concern ourselves with petty loot disputes.  The upgrades come for everyone quickly when you can clear dungeons like SM in just a handful of pulls.
---
Right click general chat tab, select settings, check off LookingForGroup should make it channel 4 if you haven't joined any others.  That's a global channel you don't need to be in a major city.  It's official channel so you don't have a troll in there banning people like world. You'll see lfg snap non stop.

**[&lt;From The Beginning&gt; | Horde | Kromcrush| EPGP ]**
---
**About Us**
---
 Our guild started in 2013 as a reddit post during Mists of Pandaria. Many of us were tired of modern WoW, so we formed a guild with a singular goal: to do old content at the proper character and item level on live servers. We ended up leveling together and clearing all raid content from lvl 60 Molten Core all the way up to 85 cataclysm with Deathwing. Here's a few of our raids to give you an idea of the atmosphere and environment:
---
BWL run - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauUwwBeHs8&gt; Black Temple Mother Shahraz with no shadow resist gear - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qTgZToJoS38&gt;
---
**Raid Times**
---
 Tuesday/Thursday 7:30 PM to 11 PM, Sunday 6 PM to 11 PM. EPGP loot system.
---
**Member Expectation**
---
We raid in a relaxed atmosphere with most raid members being in their late 20s, early 30s. You will be expected to follow directions, be polite and respectful. Raiders will need to bring a minimum amount of consumables to raids, as well as put together a half decent best in slot pre raid set. We’re estimating that we’ll be starting MC 3 months after launch, that should be plenty of time to hit 60 and get some decent pre raid best in slot stuff. While doing MC our optional raid nights will be focused on running the entire guild through attunement quest chains. Casual players who won’t be raiding, or pvpers are still welcome. We’ll be running Battle Ground premades and our optional raids (everything not current content) will be open to all and alts.

awesome.
---
For me the rebind was to force myself to to turn with the keys. I feel at is also probably more efficient to have them that way. Having the extra finger not holding w could help hit a seperate keybind?
---
Oh you want to open up the line by line? Lol. Dude you're literally just repeatedly saying its nostalgia. It isn't. I'm telling you why and making a rational case. You're just screaming nostalgia REEEE. It's not a good argument.
---
Yes the top 50 guild players back then were just as good. Its the same mechanics. They are going through the same learning curve. It isn't a new problem. It's an old problem. That's like saying people couldn't do 2+2=4 as well 50 years ago. Makes no sense.
---
To clarify we aren't talking about watching videos. We're talking about watching "game footage". You know...like top professionals do in most activities. We were watching OUR fights and parsing OUR combat logs to determine how to improve and progress. On top of all the other preparations.
---
I'm not sure why you bring min-maxing into it. I didn't say anything about that, but FWIW yes we were. Min-maxing started in Vanilla just like it does everywhere, as a divide between casual and hardcore players. That debate literally started in Vanilla.
---
I don't understand why it's so hard for people to accept that people were good in Vanilla. Like there wasn't an entire generation of gamers who lived before this game came out. Like this was the first MMO ever created. Just STOP. Just because the playerbase as a whole is more knowledgeable now does not mean that there no good players back then. Of course there were. To suggest anything else is...ignorant.
---
To your second point until raids you pretty much only need max rank heal and renew.  If you need a smaller heal it isn't worth bothering casting at all imo.
---
Well at least the warlock will be fast to level,and easy to find groups with. That what I rolled and it's a breeze for the most part
---
Yeah, not even concerned about the grind. I'm having exactly as much fun now as I will have at 60
---
What does cc mean
---
Thank god I'm on the right track. I got herb and alchemy and been selling all my herbs and whatever potions I've been making. Whatever I don't sell immediately gets vendor. I hit 3g and I'm level 18. My biggest fear is not getting my mount within the first few levels of 40....
---
‘Low iq’ lol ok bud.  You couldn’t have given yourself away as being a high schooler more than you have already.
---
[Right in the shiny part.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eSiiJ8uvc60)
---
Awesome thank you.
---
I remember switching from a Sony trinitron to my first LCD monitor in the early days of WoW. I was so upset when I first set it up because of the light bleed at the edges of the LCD were so obnoxious. It was such a downgrade for several years to come.
---
Many classes have significantly less abilities.
---
Tell that to the mage who's pulling 800tps when you're not hit capped and it's taunt immune.
---
Saving for later
---
If Warlocks aren't taking actual damage from mobs don't heal, maybe toss a Renew is they go below 75% but between out of combat regen and Demon Armor they're fine. Also if they don't sit down to eat or drink, don't heal them anymore. That part is all classes
---
You wouldn't even know
---
Tanking isn't supposed to be able to be done by an amoeba, it takes some modicum of effort.
---
I'm sure jaina enjoys having theramore back
---
So this is interesting just by the fact that it rolled the same number, and one at that, twice, right?
---
I'm trying to figure out what the implications here are.
---
Unless you have where they said that the cap relies on the layers I think you're mistaken. Noone in all the interviews and amas about layering has said it works like that.
---
You know man I wasn't even going to reply to your post because it is some obvious troll shit and can tell that even replying is a waste of my time, but this triggered the shit out of me.
---
I played Vanilla when it was retail.  Human Mage who got to Field Marshal as part of full time PvP group on Warsong server which was ultra-high pop.  Still wish I could get that like 6 months of my life back was totally not worth it.
---
TBC was seriously my favorite shit.  I played Warlock, but mostly Spriest PvP and it was such a great class.  I didn't have as much time in my life to play when TBC was retail, though, and stopped playing around S2 or something and I never played WoW retail again.  I played Spriest on Excalibur private server for like the last 4 years as Spriest named Trism and was full BiS PvP in S4 set except for the shoulders, which were almost impossible to get on the Private server anyway without win trading.  Probably close to 50,000 HK's between the 2 spriests I had on that server.  It was freaking great and I still think TBC is the peak of WoW PvP.  The server just kind of died out over the last year and I still mourn the loss, it was really well maintained, but hosted in EU so my latency was shit.
---
I rolled Rogue on Herod because I've never done a melee class and have been really enjoying it.  I don't like to raid, though, just PvP, dungeons kind of bore the shit out of me.  So I got to level 40 before I got my first real taste of blood trying to run SM and the Alli were everywhere.  I decided to stop running boring ass dungeons or fighting with other people over like the same 5 quest mobs out in the world to actually have some fun.
---
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I like this Sub spec way better than my combat sword spec.  I'm learning to PvP on a new character with a bunch of other \~40's I'm not ganking lowbie scrubs in Duskwood.  The SM graveyard is right there so they can almost rez immediately.  They are in Tirisfal and should be expecting a fight, they usually have their big cooldowns and no one has a trinket so it is pretty neat way to PvP honestly.  I am not twinked in any way, I have a mix of greens and blues and nothing enchanted, nothing bought from AH, not really even planned 'perfect' quest gear.  Most people will give me a good fight, some will just try to run for SM, I definitely don't always win and you can really tell the people who have their keys bound and who know how to PvP from the clickers or newbs.  I can't really kill anyone instantly its not like that at all, but I need to be able to do a good chunk of dmg quickly since a lot of fights are more than one person and I got to burst the shit out of one (I took Imp Sap from Sub tree so can get a legit 1v1 against group of 2 for about 10 seconds, and then Blind when they come out of Sap).  I don't have time to stun lock someone most of the time there are literally Alliance running up the road all the freaking time or there are more than one and I have to just kill as fast as possible.
---
"You're obviously a first time vanilla player to stop leveling and gank when HKs aren't even a thing yet."
---
This is the line that really pissed me off.  Fuck off with your know-it-all attitude.  Only some Alliance PvE wanker would even say something like this.  I don't play for HK's, just the fun I get out of PvP because it is fast paced and you don't ever really know what is going to happen.  The world PvP I've been doing outside SM the last week has been a fucking blast and is such a nice change of pace from the BG (or later Arena) grind that is late game, and I've already done that on 2 characters to the point that I don't really look forward to doing it again.  In fact, I almost know for a fact that I can't do any kind of high-level PvP on Herod because it is high pop with uber try-hards and since they kept the original insanely toxic PvP ranking system from Vanilla I simply can't get a high rank.  I actually have a life with responsibilities and there is literally zero chance that I can spend 8+ hours a day in a PvP premade for a few months.  At SM there are tons of groups of Alliance and always people running up into the fight on accident, both Horde and Alli and it gets nuts.  This is almost a once in a lifetime experience, because a steady stream of mid 40's for world PvP in a Horde PvP zone will never happen again, not like this at least, it is really insane on Herod server, the Alliance just roll up the road all night long.  I don't really discriminate I'll pick a fight with anyone coming up the road, higher level, groups of 2 or 3 (not successful on 3 yet unless they were all lower level), if there is 4 or more I can maybe insta-gib the lowest HP of the bunch like Mage or Warlock and Sprint out.  Makes for some fun and really gives everyone that classic feel.  Getting ganked by a rogue on the way to SM is a memory =D.  If anyone dies they rez right there.  Only sensitive scrubs will get mad about it, it's all in good fun, I don't grief anyone's dead body or anything, usually just one and done, but some people will rez and come looking because they also have that PvP bug =D
---
To be honest I am not good at rogue PvP yet, still learning.  I have gotten killed a shit load of times and don't always win for sure.  I can't seem to remember to use Vanish like I should it is really powerful, and Thistle Tea is a little too expensive for me to be using it like I probably should, I almost never use it.  I am mining/engi and broke as shit because I spent all my mats and gold on engi to get to Iron Grenades.  Mount fund looking real bad.  Good freaking times, though, absolutely having the time of my life for the last week.\\
---
In the 30 minutes I've wasted writing this I've let at least 20 Alliance run into SM unscathed.  Wtf scrub quit wasting my god damn time.
---
Four so far, as I planned before launch.
---
Unless they're hot garbage they don't expect heals
---
&gt;cheap shot
---
2 seconds
---
&gt;kidney shot with 4 combo points 
---
5 seconds
---
&gt;is 10 sec stun
---
Uhhhh wat
---
It could've been done better
---
I always thought the intro to WoD was made nicely, despite what people think of the expansion itself (bit from entering the dark portal to escaping by ship)
---
It, too, is an interactive cutscene
---
How do they de aggro when they get there in order to cause the havoc everyone assumes?
---
Is this going to make tanking harder or balance out? I swear most tanks I've run with might as well dps for how well they hold more than one enemy at a time.
---
Then call the devilsaur FBI and send them to the Graveyard.
---
Well shit I am now.
---
Im enjoying classic a lot but between the massive server sizes, layering and cross realm bgs they sure are hurting the server community aspect.
---
Which is concerning because community is arguably the most important part of classic.
---
I played retail, probably legion or warlords of draenor and got to around level 70 with a troll hunter. That was my first wow experience. Despite getting that "far" I wasnt able to get into the game. I've been playing classic for the past two weeks now and I'm loving it but I do feel like a bit of a noob.
---
I dont care too much about not knowing the best ways of doing things, I like going at my own pace. I'm already messing up my spec and making gold is quite hard
---
oh totally fair - gauge is also a word, just making sure there isn't some other stunlock skill I don't know about!
---
You can also continuously cancel the trade and reopen it though right?
---
Lol ye when I started playing WoW I had been playing a lot of rts games. It probably amazes me that people dont use keybinds about as much as it amazes people that I've been keyboard turning for 13 years.
---
Yes that is also a problem
---
But you also have about 20 other abilities in classic which, depending on your class, add different pieces of utility to every situation 
---
Hunters can juggle aggro and cc mobs with traps, distracting shot and disengage
---
Mages can conjure food and water for groups (which is actually useful and needed again)
---
Druids AND ONLY DRUIDS can buff armor and stats with mark of the wild
---
Paladins AND ONLY PALADINS can buff melee power, and mana regen of party members 
---
Priests can provide clearcasting to casters via shields for tough melee fights
---
Pretty much all of the above is provided by almost every class in retail wow, removing class identity and uniqueness.
---
Too bad the beta troll models got changed. 10/10 would main one
---
My GM has special chars..... he’s a nice guy. 🤣
---
Nah, the night elf just copy and pasting exactly what that guy said "inb4" over, as in "Let's not pretend this is the reason" then the guy after him says exactly what he said IS the reaso- It's not funny if you have to explain it!
---
Nah, not buying that at all.
---
Comments like this really bother me. This isn't lack of foresight at all. Determining what xyz coords are possible or not, is not a trivial problem to solve in a game that has movement like wow. Particularly so when its a networked game and you have to deal with unstable internet connections.
---
I haven't done dungeons other than ZF and dungeons around that level range. SM and earlier you can do with 5 caster tanks and it doesn't really matter but I'm not concerned about those ones.
---
I’ve been playing a lot, and I currently have a lvl 26, a lvl 19, a lvl 17, a lvl 12, and a lvl 9 character. Yeah altaholics exist. Also, leveling “easy” classes like hunters and Druids makes life a lot nicer solo.
---
This has not been my personal experience at all, at least not at the level I’m at.
---
I'm thinking that the radius doesnt change, but Tauren are just larger, meaning the radius just feels smaller
---
It is a mind trick, not a bug.
---
Yeah I played retail 1-120 before quitting before doing much endgame stuff and I agree, that scenario was epic. The WOD questing content was great storywise. Just far too easy, unsociable and you miss a lot of story because you can’t do the raids now or the post level 120 stuff.
---
Cheap shot is actually 4 seconds and kidney shot with 5 combo points at rank 2 is 6 seconds. Learn to math. And it's 5 cp cuz if you talent proper you've got 75% chance for 3 cp on cheap shot instead of 2.
---
Upvote for the correct use of a little used phrase “beggars belief”.
---
Felwood
---
I really like how often questing gets auto corrected to questioning. Cracks me up every single time.
---
Yeah I saw a Hunter LF mage and warlock for spellcleave in ZF lol
---
hey why are you using Enchantix? it shows wrong info about disenchanting items. Beware.
---
Also xrbgs make it much harder to fix matches, which maybe wasn't a big deal back in the day, but nowdays could be.
---
Honestly this is one of the only thing I don't like about retail, is how armor are portraited on woman's. 
---
It makes zero sense
---
Is it just the warrior's shout or also the druid's roar?
---
/pat
---
Who's a good boy?!
---
What a cesspool of retails talking about how rotations are more intricate over classic. Lol just lol .
---
yeah unfortunate I know but got to make do with what I have. Understandable it aint the greatest of quality but the humour of the moment is still captured.
---
Druids are always lowest on the census usually a little below 10%
---
It won’t end up like retail because classic is nothing like retail lmao. Two completely different games. Retail sucks ass.
---
yeah bro im on arugal and on alliance just transfer over here and ill help ya
---
Bind them in your Windows mouse settings to be shift and ctrl.  Some mouse software will let you have application specific bindings.
---
What  you're saying makes sense.
---
I guess I would argue that the only thing that makes these efficiencies and consistencies possible is the fact that people in Vanilla did the homework first. Everyone in retail is "standing on the shoulders of giants". It's a bit like denigrating the intelligence and hard work put into developing early computers and saying that everyone is so much better at it now...It's kind of apples to oranges.
---
For sure though. Lots of people were theorycrafting in Vanilla..the hard way..which is why they got it wrong so often:) Nowadays SIMS are lovely, but they still don't work for everything.
---
#nochanges
---
where the qua is the keyring?
---
They were supposed to have focus from the start, but it got cut in beta and they were given mana.
---
Oh ya good point
---
Stormwind by Christmas?
---
What they’re saying is that movement isn’t completely decided client side, which allows easier manipulation of position.
---
In any online games with an authoritative server, when you move on the client, the client sends more of a movement request and then continues as if the request will be approved by the server. Client and server are continuously negotiating your position.
---
If movement was purely client side, your client would be telling the server where you are and the server would go “sure, whatever” and not correcting obvious invalid positions.
---
Autionator.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever been prompted in client since I’ve added the authenticator and I’m on mobile right now so i can’t check, but definitely check your settings and turn off all auto-log in features until you resolve this. 
---
Also i second what other users have said, get a free malware scanner (i use MalwareBytes) and do a scan.
---
Ǒh, ĩm ŝűŗè ħę įš.
---
Looks like a pretty informative addon that will help people make choices...
---
I do his, currently 60 lock. Only real issue I have is finding tanks that aren’t already busy or plan on being on long enough.
---
Lol gm sounds like a dick, you dodged a bullet for sure.
---
Always remember guarding the middle flag in AB and rogues constantly trying to kill you and Just breaking them lol
---
Weird, as a mage I'm usually sitting back with the healer sipping my magic water while we wonder wtf the tank is thinking.
---
Because you saw I was physically closer, essentially arrived before you to hit the mob, and am obviously working to it being a foot away and because you're a decent person and recognize this?
---
&gt;Yes the top 50 guild players back then were just as good. Its the same mechanics. They are going through the same learning curve. It isn't a new problem. It's an old problem. That's like saying people couldn't do 2+2=4 as well 50 years ago. Makes no sense.
---
It's not as simple as saying 2+2=4, so it does make sense.
---
&gt;Yes the top 50 guild players back then were just as good.

repeating yourself doesn't make you right. Neither is it a good argument
---
&gt;You're just screaming nostalgia REEEE. It's not a good argument.
---
No, I am making a case using the evidence we have - the timings of boss kills and how long guilds take to get a world first. That is my argument. You have to resort to a strawman (nostalgia REEEE) because you have no case.
---
&gt;To clarify we aren't talking about watching videos. We're talking about watching "game footage". You know...like top professionals do in most activities. We were watching OUR fights and parsing OUR combat logs to determine how to improve and progress. On top of all the other preparations.
---
That still doesn't make you good, or as good as the people I'm talking about.
---
&gt;I'm not sure why you bring min-maxing into it. I didn't say anything about that, but FWIW yes we were. Min-maxing started in Vanilla just like it does everywhere, as a divide between casual and hardcore players. That debate literally started in Vanilla.
---
You think you were, but you weren't. That's the problem. You keep insisting you were as good as these players, when you weren't. How long did your patchwerk kill take?
---
&gt;I don't understand why it's so hard for people to accept that people were good in Vanilla. Like there wasn't an entire generation of gamers who lived before this game came out. Like this was the first MMO ever created. Just STOP. Just because the playerbase as a whole is more knowledgeable now does not mean that there no good players back then. Of course there were. To suggest anything else is...ignorant.
---
I never said there were no good players in vanilla. I said the players in vanilla, even in good guilds back then, were nowhere near as good as the players now. To pretend otherwise is ignorant.
---
I've used it, and this may earn some dislike, but I wouldn't really be against removing this add on. It feels weird to have something so impacting be there for some players and not for others. I know it's free, but honestly I just want to play a wow without named casting, it sounds fun. Maybe make detect magic expose their casts
---
When are they going to come?
---
If you heal someone in combat, you enter combat with them, so maybe. You don't have to be in their party. But I don't really have much experience using MC.
---
When you are invited to a group and the leader is in a different layer then you'll notice everything phase as you change layers. The mobs around you will change and the players around you will change.

Literally four comments above yours

Lvl 30 troll hunter and finished all the quests I can do in stonetalpn mountain, barrens , thousand needles and strangethorm and Ashendale, really sick of doing 2 quests in an area and having to cross the map to do another 2 quests....
---
Where tf do I go grinding is boring asf
---
These are the same people who didn't invite me to BFD as a healer at level 21 because I was too low to heal a dungeon that nobody actually takes damage in. I get a kick out of it too. This is me playing the game how I want to haha.
---
Its usually used to make it harder for someone to be reported
---
Meh, I played feral in wotlk. I’ll take the one button spam in raids. It’s chill, I can relax and just chat and play. When it’s time to focus, it’s world pvp and bgs, where all my abilities become important. 
---
You just can’t make raids as difficult as pvp, ever. They’re piñata’s. They lack any of the dynamism that comes from fighting a real person and any of the foolish whimsy of it too. Classic is golden and I love it.
---
Rogues. Left empty.
---
As a rogue everyones hatred fuels my desire to gank you.  You only have yourselves to blame.
---
I feel you my priest brother.  Also playing Alliance on OCE.
---
&gt;keep multiple ranks of heals available and choose the one that will heal enough for the moment
---
Big tip for this is to make a macro that defaults to your max rank heal, then add Ctrl/Alt/Shift modifiers for downranks.
---
Now that I think about it I haven't had a single Horde player that isn't 5+ levels ahead attempt a fair 1v1 against me in my entire 36 levels of playtime
---
From what I remember we put hunters in the tank group so bs would do crazy threat.
---
Yeah I don't have a problem, your cursor changes in mouse over, so you can just wave it around for a second
---
There are hundreds thousands of words in the english language and a myriad beyond that in other languages. Alt codes suggest a lack of creativity and a poor propensity to share.
---
Someone else has that name. It's not yours.
---
People saying there aren’t enough quests to hit 60 are just wrong. Go to Un’goro crater, Winterspring, Swamp of Sorrows, Blasted Lands, Feralas, Western + Eastern Plaguelands, Silithus, Burning Steppes, Blackrock Mountain. There are literally dozens of quests to do, many of them taking you into dungeons to complete. If you ever run out of quests, go to a hub in one of the above zones you have never been to.
---
Always show action bars: On
---
I think you're thinking of Revenge procs, I'm talking about the 2h axe called Ravager that Bladestorms on proc.
---
While I see the funny haha in this, FarTooManySpoons is more correct.
---
I’ve only managed to breach that horde stronghold once, with a 5 man group on an almost empty layer.
---
But then a solo mage tagged Andre before us, and I ended up abandoning the quest.
---
Drop server so I can kill you.
---
Quick, throw it up on our [wow classic guild list](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds)!  Great trend btw, I'll probably make one for my server xD
---
You and a group of these "rag tag" adventures banish the lord of fire, slay the mighty Onyxia and Nefarion, then go on to stop a troll god, then go and kill the most powerful of known undead. You're anything but a regular old person by the time you hit 60

The mages who charge into melee range to AoE a millisecond into the pull, then run away when they get aggro and frost nova mobs next to the healer 25 yards from the tank. Those are the worst.
---
Have you seen Corpsemaker's attack speed?

Seriously, stop. I know what's good and what isn't. That shaman didn't need to steal an int/spirit staff.

My fans always kick on like crazy on my 2014 MacBook when I play away from my PC. Sounds like you might have a venting issue? Do you play on your actual lap?

Kinda in the same situation 34 undead rouge what should I be doing ?

There is a guy called Poor on Whitemane doing this too, but far more annoyingly.

oh, sweet summer child. don't tell him what it has become.
---
I was playing retail to sate my desire for classic. It's so empty. None of your loot matters leveling. None of your levels feel special. You start with all the cool spells so there's no real satisfaction in a level. It's just a number on a screen. Leveling is all too easy. Pull 3 mobs? Nbd. Pull 8 mobs? You're probably fine. There's no skin in the game and no rewards.
---
You can have it....in retail.
---
Wow you're right. This really does defeat the entire purpose of classic wow. Time to pack it up boys guess we aren't home
---
Power trip. So sad
---
Buy a windows key you fucking grub
---
Crowd control
---
Holy shit who cares if they accept gold.  
---
There's a lot of negative aspects to streaming so why shouldn't they accept the benefits as well.  
---
Would you act any differently? Guessing not.  
---
It doesn't impact you so get over it ffs.
---
Reserve a couple of AB slots for your weapons and you don't need to update the macro:
---
    /click [worn:shield] ActionBarButton 10
---
    /click [noworn:shield] ActionBarButton 11
---
    /click [noworn:shield] ActionBarButton 12
---
Use `/fstack` do figure out which AB slots you've used to put into your macro.
---
Should have just given them to someone in person or through trade chat. I looted a green lvl5 dagger and 2 health pots off a rare spawn as I was passing through Elwynn. I was way higher than that at that point so dropped what what I was doing and ran to Northshire Abbey. Found a lvl5 rogue and traded them to him.
---
Could be closing layers and lowering the max pop back down to where they had it before doing that fix 2 days in?  Or a bunch of people just showed up fashionably late to the party.
---
Wow how long do you play a week roughly?
---
Maybe they will chill when they realize that try-harding a game that isnt all that hard is kind of silly.
---
I really want the edge in PvP so I'll start with hemo. My server has alliance outnumbered almost 4 - 1. Is gnome the best race to go or do I just suck it up and avoid mages till later levels?
---
Can try playing some FPS games too. They only have strife and that helps get used to controls.
---
This is a feature, not a bug. Warrior at least can only build threat on one mob at a time, and it takes rage to do so. Since rage primarily comes from hitting things and being hit, with all the miss/parry/dodge you don’t always get the rage from hitting, and if the mob isn’t attacking you you don’t get that rage either.
---
So if, at the start of combat, you miss your first attack and the dps opens all the way up, you now have an uphill battle to get threat. And all this is for a single mob. Imagine having 3 mobs and all the dps opens with aoe or multi shots.
---
This is why when your tank pulls you should let him establish threat first instead of blowing your load and then calling him shit.
---
Agreed. WOTLK was the pinnacle of class design IMO. Every class had their own thing but also enough spells and functionalities to make it playing them very engaging. Things like cool, unique spells to good rotations, fun procs etc.
---
Is this bait?
---
Discuss streamers on their subreddit, thanks.
---
Until you get to about 15-25 I think the warlock is a bit slow then.
---
Didn't really make me want to start did it
---
I really wished the game started at patch 1.2 and worked its way forward.
---
Sounds like he did you a favor by making sure you weren't in a guild led by someone like that, tbh...
---
I feel the same about fishing.  Don't run up and throw your line into a school or wreckage that someone has already been fishing.  You wouldn't do that in real life.  It's just rude.
---
Level 43 babyy

I am lvling a few places to 10 in the three start zones just to see everything.
---
I usually have issues when I cant make things hard enough
---
I have more than 2 hours available (no kids) so I play more hours however compared to 15 years ago where I would play to 4am, sleep 3 hours and get up for work at 7am and never sleep on Saturday night, that doesn't happen. I need my sleep and I also do other stuff whilst back then WoW consumed me.
---
literally just join your realms discord channel and find some

Old McDonald had a farm...
---
FELSTRIKER! 
---
*LET ME HEARR YOUUUUUU?!*
---
why do people care so much about how streamers play
---
focus on yourself my dudes
---
Blizzard has said in multiple interviews that they were concerned people would play initially and then stop, so they wanted to use layering so that they could plus up the servers beyond a normal population so that after the initial excitement died down the realms would have healthy populations.  A realm is not capable of supporting 10k+ players without layers, even at 8k+ on pservers it was a shitshow
---
I see a gazillion hunters but they look really fun
---
LMAO Home Owners' Association people for real power trip so hard
---
Yea for every 1 set on gear try to aim for 1-2 spirit, common knowledge for us warriors.
---
Yeah +Defense gear is mostly good for tanking while underleveled. If you have a ton of extra defense, your disadvantage from being 2-3 levels underneath mobs mostly disappears (besides hit chance, which is more important while leveling)
---
As someone who likes wasting time theory-crafting talents I envy PoE and miss WotLK
---
How do you have time to play them all?
---
It was Bigglesworth
---
TBH I actually kinda find it fun, spamming heals, waiting for 5SR to get a few ticks, spamming a few more, waiting again. Chug a little mana pot on cooldown. Bonus if you can get Spirit Tap to proc.
---
Hectic while its going on, but feelsgoodman after you (just barely) squeak thru and everyone /cheers (and then I rez the 1-2 that didnt make it)
---
It does. Reducing layers will reduce the overall amount of players who are able to play at the same time on a server
---
There is a smaller Named spider with the name Naraxis in Duskwood. One of my favorite pets because only those two mobs have that skin.
---
Whitney Houston called, she wants her crack pipe back...
---
So what addons do you have installed?
---
This is classic where reputation matters, so name and shame.
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve read today...
---
What class is Leo then
---
I'm not sure.  I remember seeing someone streaming a while ago who was using different models for his druid forms, so I just assumed it wasn't.
---
as a healer, i always mark the tank with a star so they feel special.
---
Sac has already saved my life 3 times and I’m only level 18
---
Scarlet Crusade. The Argent Crusade was Tirion's renewed Argent Dawn who went to Northrend to take out Arthas.
---
I really hope there is a small delay between each light so that when it comes on it runs.
---
On Thunderfury i regularly logged 8.5k players are peak times and we had no queue.  Tonight with the queue its down to 6.5k.  They definitely lowered the caps.
---
Yeah, those wow-only plebs never tried asian mmos.
---
On the other hand, I love ESO with only two swappable 6-slot bars.
---
i need this xD
---
Usually you should leave marks the same. You skull the mob you want people to attack, and people should know enough to not out dps your threat.
---
If you switch targets to grab threat, keep the skull on the original target unless you are telling people to burn the new one.
---
Could you explain a bit more please? Looking at the loot able I don't see the Outlaw Saber but I do see Electrocutioner and the max hit is 8 below my mace. In this case would it simply be an upgrade because it's close but has a 1 second faster attack speed. Resulting in overall all smaller numbers but hitting them more often?
---
Sorry it's just a little confusing when everyone says slower the better and nothing from the dungeon tables pass my mace in raw dmg until like level 30. There is Van Cleefs Cruel Barb but it still has a 2.8 speed with the same amount of dmg as the mace
---
There are dyes that are harmless, this is likely one of them.
---
Warrior. You need everyone to pay attention to you
---
They're great at farming but middle of the pack end-game. Someone that understands the class is good for CC if you can't find a mage.
---
i almost exclusively use tab targeting actually it just doesn't like me and decides not to work some times
---
Once I hit 30+ and quested in HIllsbrad, Arathi, and STV, I realized how outnumbered Alliance was compared to the Horde on Kromcrush.
---
The same corpse camping groups of 5+ Horde became a bad issue in STV and Badlands for me so I had enough and me and my friends transferred to Earthfury. I had no backup either really.
---
It appears the faction balance is better on Earthfury and it’s only Medium pop. It still feels alive and I’ve had some word PvP so far but it’s been fair 1v1 or 2v2, no corpse camping, etc. that’s the kind of world PvP I don’t mind. It needs to be fair for both sides. A one time gank is fine too, just don’t corpse camp. Just move along to the next target.
---
PvP realms are fun if it’s actually balanced, but when you’re just trying to quest and the other side won’t let you and goes out of their way to make your experience miserable, it sucks and makes you not even want to play. I don’t think anyone really enjoys getting killed over and over by a group of the other faction, and to the people doing the killing in groups, why? What are you trying to prove?
---
* head to newegg.com
---
* click on components then video card
---
* click on desktop
---
* the filter should have a min-max price.
---
generally the higher the number on the model the better the card is.  worst case, use google and type in your GPU then the one you're interested in to see which is better. example: `nvidia 1080 vs amd r5 2500` There a few comparison sites which will give you an overview on which one is better.
---
That sentence is more Horde for my realm. Usually it starts as a 1v1 against a horde then 5 seconds later it turns into a 1v50,000
---
No. They said they increase people per layer while decreasing the numbers of layers. Never say anything about realm cap.
---
Here's an interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236
---
Well you can solo AoE farm Cath at 60. I'm talking about farming for loot not XP leveling up =\]
---
I also dont farm with blizzard is just straight up flamestrike arcane explosion nuking.
---
Hunters do it long distance. 
---
Wait, that shit never works out...
---
I would inform the group before coming that your intention is to roll on dps gear.  I've done that many times and found people being ok with it.
---
Better than Thannos? I doubt that.
---
The really awesome thing about keybinding strafe to A and D is that it frees up Q and E for important keybinds. Probably the best keyboard real estate there is.
---
Rogues are fun as hell in pvp imo and do high damage endgame pve but you'll have a lot of gear competition
---
Maybe they're gradually taking away layering instead of all at once.
---
That actually sounds like a better idea.
---
It’s medium now and I haven’t had problems finding groups lol
---
I might have to reroll alli...
---
Rogues...
---
Leather belt leather belt leather belt... aaaghughggh!
---
Only natural from the inferior alliancs
---
How do you kill, that which has no life?
---
Yep. I’d love to be in a horde rogue gang wreaking havoc in Ironforge assassinating people at will, but I can’t, because I’m a mage.
---
It’s give and take with any class.
---
I know you're trying to be helpful (or doing it for karma), but this spot is useless if there's more than 3 people doing this.
---
No not prevents ninja looting.
---
Need bananas for scale
---
At low levels, yeah it's a pain. Once I hit about level 30 and my tank is sufficiently geared, I tell them to pull while I drink. Even if I cancel the drink halfway, we still get through it quicker and I can move onto the next dungeon.
---
Every time I pull too much...
---
This speeds up cleave groups. Bringing a tank in general slowed them down but made it a little safer. Now we just won't bring tanks at all. Most cleave groups aren't anyway. This hurts regular groups, not the cleave groups.
---
Layering and server caps are two issues that are very much intertwined, its not that difficult to understand
---
Call the locksmith!
---
Is this how Asmongold got his mount?
---
Macro that /oom son!
---
Haha more then I should... took time time off when it launched...
---
Community in Cata? "LF tank, raid. NO WARRIOR TANKS. Link achievement"?
---
I’ts not LoL it’s WoW
---
I hate attention though. Being in the center of attention gives me anxiety.
---
My younger guild mates were like “wow good catch with the sheeping pats and casters” while I was actually just lapsing into twitchy bad flashback moments.
---
what the hell are you talking about
---
And clips of the twitch link above are protecting them how exactly?
---
YES!

Ah? Druid any good end game?
---
Try talking to the tanks in your group instead of telling reddit. More likely to get results. Hell, macro it with your drink item.
---
I too am experiencing wow for the first time in classic idk whats going on
---
It will never be worth remotely near 1500g in vanilla. For example [here](https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/lights_hope/Northdale_Alliance?search=tree+bark+jacket&amp;time=all) are its prices on the most recent popular private server. Note that these prices start from 6 months after the server's release. Realistically if you hold onto the item until WSG releases you can sell it for 25-50g.

I actually rather like having a mage to sit and drink with me, makes it feel like I'm not the only one holding up the group.

Which keys do you need as a Rogue with max lockpicking? Can I get away with no keys?

Scan done(nothing found) and authentication setup and done.

How do you kbow its not an mt....
---
YMMV pugs are different than guild run. /wTank pull or not while I drink depends on squish
---
Press V to show enemy nameplates
---
It's not a problem if you roll on a server that has no big streamers.  My advice (and this applies to life too) is don't keep track of what other people are doing and constantly compare yourself to them.  This only leads to a bad time.  He's gonna do what he wants and you're only doing yourself a disservice obsessing about it.    
---
If Asmongold were to, for instance, have sex with a 13 y/o girl on stream, then I think we could all get together to take that child rapist down, but since he's just playing a game and being himself, it really shouldn't matter to you.
---
Ignore it and use serpent. You may be asked to use it later, wouldn't even make my bar though.
---
The only coordination you need in a spell cleave group is a nova order. There isn't any big brain strats going on. Bringing a tank just made it safer to set up, an eye of kilrog pull is just as effective with a priest. This speeds up cleave groups while making them no more difficult.
---
It makes sense this way, because you would assume people are more spread out over time, with people doing different things at 60 vs everyone clumping during levelling process.
---
Mind you, Ironforge is gonna be quite full at 60.
---
Spell cleave is a full team of casters.
---
Typically 3 mages, 1 priest, 1 warlock.
---
The warlock pulls with eye of Kilrogg, with a power word: shield on it. Thus the reason for the priest and warlock specifically.
---
The mages rotate frost nova, Cone of Cold and Imp. Blizzard to AoE down the packs.
---
The warlock also uses Hellfire to add DPS.
---
Maybe your experience was different - and that's fine - but it wasn't like that on my server.  Many guilds worked together to get Deathwing down - and many worked together for heroic progression as well.  It was the first raid I ever progression raided on so I remember a LOT about it.  
---
Not saying it was perfect, but for my personal experience this is about as close as I've gotten.
---
I have no idea how
---
Just wait until endgame when your life revolves around re-running dungeons ! Wooo pre bis
---
Not enuf skeletons
---
One per raid, generally speaking. You can bring more but it's best to limit it to one or two.
---
Ah TIL, thanks for the correction
---
Can you equally see druids?
---
Plenty of people play like this. It's fine.
---
I forgot to tell you- Calvin Coolidge was a good friend of mine.
---
Same boat.  I think I spent a small but appreciable sum in cooking, tailoring, and enchanting.  
---
I think I suboptimally sharded items.
---
I think I probably have been less lucky on average with bow drops, and some I have but haven’t been able to flip.
---
I also probably picked professions which are not immediately profitable.
---
I probably haven’t spent a ton of time focused on wealth, whether by specific farming or AH arbitrage.
---
Not in a warlock group. Power word shield.
---
What's the best use for blazing enchant from badlands? Thrash blade? Wait for raid level gear?
---
I run the Alamo mod (it occasionally does random says when you shapeshift, the says are based on Alamo wisdom). I had to modify the file to add “Alamo says:” to the start of each text line because I was getting people tell me that there’s more to playing Druid than casting moonfire etc...
---
I’ve been running it for nearly two years now, it will never get old.
---
Oh okay, so not a lot of placements for them :)
---
The only upgrade
---
Yep, that's what I meant by sufficiently geared. I'm not telling Greenedoutboy to start chaining.
---
oh the things we could get away with in 2004
---
They would never do this, your wow 2.0 is going to come in the concept of a cata like expac 100% why would they try and fragment there own game BFA made huge proff just with in game shop
---
100%. Warriors have literally no reason to”randomly” be in the SW church. Lol.
---
YOJAMBA FOREVER!!
---
You might try asking a GM, I dunno if they do this sort of thing but Blizz support has always been good in my experience.
---
Same experience, but I'm limited to the "normal" LFGs. There's definitely a lot of "AoE farm, quick runs" LFGs that I'm missing out on.
---
Because if a warrior isn't getting dps talents right away then he's gonna be terrible. 
---
This idea that warriors are putting 51 points into protection is stupid and you're equally stupid for "debunking" it for us.
---
You’re going want a mouse over macro which will let you keep target on a mob but heal allies

---
Agree.  Every earnest attempt I’ve made to air farm has been met with heavy competition - to the point that I just instance grind instead.  The exp/hour is far less lumpy.
---
Keep trying bud.
---
forgive me but it was easier to screen shot then try to figure out the actual names of each part.  I suspect it came from one of  addons installed on the 9th.  DBM was throwing messages that I had the wrong non classic one installed but i did not get to fix.  I'm not accusing any of these addons as being illegitimate because it may have just been because I downloaded from a sketchy place.  [https://imgur.com/a/NJLs1jr](https://imgur.com/a/NJLs1jr)

Don’t blame ya, wanted to bail myself, but my friends were afraid of ending up on a low pop.

Wow classic runs on the modern client using the 1.12 data and assets. This video goes in depth; really interesting https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
Pretty sure that was late vanilla or BC
---
Fuck no transmog ruined the look of the game.
---
I knew it would drive someone mad
---
that doesn't mean someone can't play the game to match how it was originally played. You can still do the "spirit of vanilla" gameplay in 2019.
---
He clearly talks about how they think player attrition will get them to where they can do that.
---
If you really think they are going to remove layering for phase 2 with these realms that have 10k+ populations, then I don't know what else to tell you.
---
God forbid he plays a massive multiplayer online game with other multiplayers on this online multiplayer game
---
As someone who has never played wow before. I picked alchemy and herb but my friend mentioned switching to tailoring for this robe. I play a mage and wondering if it’s worth it? I’d hate to drop herb and alchemy because I love it so much!
---
Let it go, it's not that important.
---
I almost vomited from laughing.
---
They've actually never said they weren't and that they were 2 solutions to 2 different problems either
---
Nobody knows, it’s provocative.
---
Not like any of the tanks I've played with even used Demoralizing Shout to begin with. \*shrug\*
---
traitors using new water graphics.
---
Well we are missing a lot still.
---
This is weird because I have literally never been anything but the top DPS in every dungeon I've run thus far from 18-55. The only time a mage does more damage is if we're doing 10+ group pulls. Hunter DPS is outstanding as long as you have a decent ranged weapon.
---
/spit
---
That’s all they cost? I can get 12g way quicker than 100+ kills
---
He chose the wrong class if he wanted to grind mobs and watch porn
---
No, it literally doesn't, and yeah obviously we have more players now, we aren't running on 2004 servers anymore. Layers are subdivisions of the server itself. Every player is on the server layered or not. Layering isn't there to let more people onto the server, it's to prevent 50+ people trying to do one quest for the first few weeks
---
Annnnnd blaming u later
---
aye... it must come out in a different phase then..
---
I feel like you need to clarify. If it is the opposing faction. You should do everything in your power to disrupt it
---
You're able to find groups? In my server (Skeram, Horde), only tanks are needed. Healers are as numerous as DPS. I've given up trying to find groups for dungeons. It sucks.
---
So, i'm a warrior and I plan to work on my preraid bis set for dps and tank because I want to be flexible for whatever the guild decides they want my role to be. Will leather and mail wearers get triggered because I roll on preraid BiS gear that isn't plate? I don't wanna get labeled a ninja.
---
I remember upgrading from a 17" CRT flatscreen to a nice Dell 24" 16:10 sometime during vanilla. Night and day difference, couldn't believe I needed to move my eyes to see the whole screen.
---
You know what's weird though? I've noticed on my druid when I try to buff or heal a character 15-20 levels below me with my max rank spells I've been getting a "target's level is too low" error message. I never remember seeing that back in vanilla but it could just be my poor memory ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Church has first aid trainers doesn’t it?
---
What kind of rogue doesn't level lock picking?
---
Mine sold. So yeah
---
really quite horrible :)
---
SPriests are actually okay or good in pvp, right?I haven't given them a try yet for fear of being forced into one role
---
There are a few things that could be causing this.
---
What type of pet are you using? Are you training the new levels of growl as you level?
---
according to this it's comin eventually

---
What you’re feeling is the RPG part of the MMORPG. It’s been painfully absent from most MMOs recently.
---
Try STV. North part
---
I ended up transferring to Earthfury! Despite being EST I haven’t noticed any lag when playing, which is great.  
---
Hopefully more people will continue to transfer over as time passes so the server population will rise a bit!
---
technically right click plus walk left = strafe left
---
&gt; I know at some point in Vanilla jumper cables could break on failed use
---
I don't ever remember that. You may have equipped them?
---
So excited for more rogues to try and get me... usually it's a skull level Warrior right now lol
---
i thought this was widely known, was the first thing I tried on my mage back in WOTLK when I started, while jumping off from Tirisfal zep. These kind of things makes the game so unique
---
This is why today I rolled a warrior
---
Kinda nice.
---
Mobs don't have base stats like that, so it doesn't work on them.
---
Lol just play the game. Who cares what some streamer says/does.
---
Doesn't matter, since the mage has to drink after the pull anyways (and i play healer)
---
The people who are 60 already are hardcore players. A large percent of the player base is still in 30’s and 40’s. 
---
The people hitting 60 know what the fuck they’re doing. It’s a terrible representation of what is the norm.
---
You sound like such a busybody. I (and apparently majority of commentators down below) could care less how an individual plays games. Your self roghteousness is unwelcome. I'm not even a big fan of asmon but goddamn. There are people telling him how to play a videogame he devoted his life AND career to. You are like those people writing articles on IGN or Polygon about every little thing a streamer does or say. They owe you nothing. If he breaks TOS he will get banned but as far as i can see he did nothing illegal. So what he gets a mount or w/e faster than you? Why do you care? You are so tilted about it you have to write a mini essay about it on a subreddit that is devoted to a game. If he vexed you so much write about it on his stream, keep this witch hunt karen shit garbage out of here.
---
Yeah so my pet is L34 with Growl 4, I'm 35, enemy is 41.
---
Nice! Thanks for the link!
---
Brickies am I right?
---
Your cleave groups can be brain dead and will still gain more Xp.
---
Been havin a blast on boats as rouge
---
 Me an my buddy see how many ppl we can stack up before we cant kill them when everyone respawns at the transfer.
---
The simple answer is to always have your own stack of highest rank water and not rely on Mages, just like Warlocks do to priests with lifetap, you are just draining the Mages mana to replenish your own.
---
Layers will be removed before we get phase 2. It will happen
---
Rofl. I love how rogue just gets a mention.
---
Too many.
---
I don't watch streamers and other people shouldn't either. This way, none of this shit matters, which I assure you it does not.
---
So that's a yes or a no?
---
&gt; Being useful isn't the same as being enjoyable. Getting a raid invite just to cast a buff on someone else might be useful but it's not exactly rewarding gameplay for most people. Knowing that the only reason you're their is because you bring a buff is kinda demeaning and makes you easily replaceable. It's like getting a participation trophy.
---
As a Shaman main since vanilla I disagree, I can tell you that I have never felt as useless as when they stopped having classes be unique. I pretty much never ever gets picked for a raid now, because shamans do not do as much dps as other classes, we never get picked, and what made use useful and fun before as a support class has been completely stripped away from the class.
---
&gt; People want to be useful because they do a lot of damage, not because they let other people do it little bit more damage.
---
Thank you for telling me what I like to do, I was clearly mistaken for liking to play support classes, when in truth I liked to deal damage? Thanks!
---
That is a shit argument. People are different and everyone likes different things. If you want to be useful and do just damage, then roll a damage class. If you wanted to be useful by being a support, then you could roll a support class like paladin or shaman.
---
That whole "bring the player, not the class" mantra stopped working when they removed all of the class identity.  
---
You mention WOTLK, but WOTLK didnt exactly use that mantra as much as the game would later on. Every class was still insanely unique in WOTLK. Shamans, for example, were brought for both their decent dps, but mostly for their totems, and you arranged your raid groups to make sure each group had a shaman that was good for the group (resto shaman with mana tide for healers, enha shaman for melee group for improved windfury totem, ele shaman for caster dps for the flametongue totem etc).
---
But if you didnt have a shaman, you could still finish the raids. WOTLK had pretty much the perfect balance of having every class be unique, but also useful to bring along if you had one.
---
Just be transparent at the start of the run.
---
Faster and safer with eye.
---
What type of pet is it?
---
I'm a warrior and I was wondering if there is a macro that dismounts you when you try to charge.
---
I'm actually experiencing the same issue.
---
I demand you make more
---
Sufficient.
---
No and if they do tell them to get educated before throwing that term around. Most mele dps understand. Rogues go in prepared to roll against warriors on some stuff.
---
Omg! I had no idea they were ever a Trinket! I was young went I started in BC and didn’t hit max until WOTLK so I’m not sure when it just became an item in your bag. Yes, there they are. Thank you!
---
why hasn’t it been removed yet then? lol
---
We have it now. Before the new traits it was a pure Templar Verdict rogue. The class feels really nice now with the rebooted 2T10 bonus as a azerite trait and Light's Decree for AoE. In my comment above I just tried to enact my reaction in the transition from LK to Cata when I saw the pally rework and got really mad. Since then we lost some of our core and signature skills, like our seals, auras and Blessing of Might. It's really sad to come from my full flavored paladin (but useless) from Classic to my gutted Verdict bot :(
---
Yeah the only helpful thing I’ve seen is try to run as administrator and didn’t change anything
---
Who is talking about solo vs group? We are talking about class based leveling. Try playing a rogue and warrior. 100 percent a warrior will always hit 60 first unless he avoids dungeons. 
---
People just want warriors over rogues in dungeons and that’s the easiest way to 60 right now.
---
Is anybody else getting kicked so much the game is unplayable? Yesterday I was getting kicked every 15 mins, today I can't stay in queue for more than ~45 seconds without being kicked back to login.
---
WoW players have had 10 years of training telling them that DPS have no responsibility for threat management. Many new players will have no concept of how threat works at all. Even single target most DPS can easily pull aggro off the tank with a crit or two (or the tank getting avoided/resisted) if they don't give the tank a lead. 
---
I mostly play with some vanilla veterans and we act like idiots half the time, a lot of PuGs are worse. Not a single time while tanking (every dungeon several times so far) have I seen someone stop hitting a mob when they pull aggro to let the tank have a chance to get threat back. It might get better for a while in higher level dungeons as people are forced to be more careful or die, but then I expect players will start outgearing and "optimising" for content much faster than back in the day and be able to scrape through chaotic dungeon runs anyway. 
---
Tanks should probably just get used to feeling frustrated and annoyed in 5-mans.

---
Just let me slip into owl form... OwO
---
This is so true, it hurts.
---
It means your heals are going to generate more aggro so you'll get punished more for doing silly things like buffing while in combat or renewing a tank before he pulls.
---
The Q and E keys are much more useful for keybinds. 
---
You'll only ever want to walk, strafe and quickly change direction. There's absolutely zero reason you'd want to rotate at a slower speed than the mouse or with a single set speed either.
---
I got ganked by 2 lvl 33's  (hunter and pally) while questing and at 20%hp being lvl 39 and a rogue I showed them how strong Evasion is and decided to take a break from questing to set up a tent on their bodies.
---
Sure they pruned away the fluff, but they established a way better class fantasy and playstyle for every single spec.
---
No, that is dumb out-of-game bullshit that literally has no upsides.

What is wrong with some people on this subreddit I swear lol.

Pro hunter. As a warrior I applaude your effort to steer your kinsman in the right direction, how ever feeble it may be ! It is a valiant effort none the less. But all I can see in my head from many times and experiences are the words "Hunter loot" . Oh the cursed words. It is the mighty shield they wield when faced with such loot. Good luck and God speed.
---
If an add-on can do it and you only use an add-on to do it, it's perfectly legal. There's many things an add-on can automate with the UI and there's no problem with any of them. If Blizzard decides they don't like how a part of the API is being used, then they simply restrict or disable it. No harm to players.
---
why does everyone repost this
---
I think it occurred at the same time they made it into the knife
---
For EU it's until the 16th. Don't know about US
---
No offense but you really should be on a pve server if your interaction with the opposite faction is to just keep waving at them.
---
Yes, because x*layers amounts of Kazzak, Dragons aspects and AQ gongs on the same server is a great idea. /sarcasm
---
Classic just feels like an RPG, I even spot sprinklings of traditional D&amp;D tropes alongside a plethora of fantasy themes. Quests feel more lived in and grounded in the world. 
---
Honestly I think people like the feeling of earning things, even if the things are much less shiny.
---
Yes, you just cancel form and cast charge.
---
Okay so just to be clear, all the gear progression guides I see are purely based on DPS so when we talk Rogue gearing, Sword progression is basically putting highest DPS in your offhand and just a raw damage weapon in main since it's really only for your abilities to scale off of, regardless of what kind of weapon it is?
---
If that's right then I'm starting to understand, that makes a lot more sense, most of these guides don't even mention these weapons are for offhand nor do they mention the high dmg slow attack main hand aspect
---
You don't understand how moderation works, do you?
---
I think it will be nice mainly for lower pop servers. But one of the above comments mentioning picking people from your server first and filling the stragglers with cross server would be nice. Going to be hard getting infamous if it’s always cross realm peeps.
---
nah i do, it’s either the mods are slacking or it doesn’t break “rule 1”
---
Layering doesn't affect server cap
---
Some people don’t understand that you might want to experience all the quest lines and only want to play one character. Can’t help selfish people who refuse to share 😉

Oh no, not one person!

Same with rattlegore. Tonight is the first queue I’ve had. Not going to transfer.
---
Horde started it when they ganked Azeroth with a high level warlock in a 20-30 zone &gt;:/ #Neverforget #Darkportalsucks #Guldanwaswrong
---
There are not enough quests to get you through every zone unfortunately. You will have to grind out 2 to 3 levels every ten levels or so. That means either grinding mobs or grinding five man dungeons. If you don't like just sitting there and killing npcs in the open world get a group together and run a dungeon two or three times in a row with a good group. You can run SM GY and RFC at that level, or start leveling in arathi highlands.
---
God, I can't wait til I'm high enough level to do this.
---
You don’t catch STV, STV catches you
---
I'm not 100% on why you are gaining threat on it so quickly with the numbers you're stating, but as a possibility, cats are known to be weak in vanilla for keeping threat. Some hunters end up having to manipulate their auto-casts to keep aggro. Have you taught it claw/bite? 
---
It might be as simple as it isn't good enough at keeping threat cos you're rekking face. You can try an ape if you want to see if that holds aggro better.
---
I think you should keep a stack of the highest water always but if the mage can give you water get it and use that. You should get water from mages because one or two casts from a mage is worth the pace you can set when you don't pay for the water. Water can get expensive if you drink the way I describe above. It's not an inconvenience to a mage who understands that it helps everyone if the healer is equipped properly. When I play mage I keep an extra stack of water just for healers. Anyone who complains about making water for a dungeon is a bonified asshole.
---
This is a questions thread. Did you have a question?
---
Can I ask why you would fish in sw? I just want to go to the oasis for those deviates!

PAYING to be in a guild? What the what

Fwiw, locally many of the larger nursing homes also provide hospice care, and it's common to have a small horde of volunteers there just to keep residents company. Lots of teenagers volunteer there because it looks good on college apps. Usually it's not "final hours", but includes residents in hospice care. Typically nurses steer the volunteers toward patients who are easier to be around.
---
There is one group geared toward "no one dies alone" that takes the tougher patients including night shifts, but those are almost exclusively retirees who have seen some shit and are tough enough to handle it.
---
Maybe it's for the C L A S S I C experience!
---
What's the best race class combo for a beginner? Does it matter at all?
---
I have a few questions about macros.
---
Can you layer cast commands so it will go in order?
---
As an example from FFXIV, if you do:
---
cast &lt;mo&gt;
---
cast &lt;t&gt;
---
cast &lt;me&gt;
---
It will look for a mouseover target, and if there is none it will cast on your target, and if there is none it will cast on yourself.
---
Also, is there a detriment to macros? In FFXIV you only macroed very few abilities, if any, because macros don't activate the ability queue so you lose milliseconds of GCD time for every macro you use.
---
I definitely had a similar experience when it came to rivalries. "Oh it's that twink paladin /rogue team that we always run into". Though I think at this point I'm willing to give that aspect up. I don't have enough time to develop rivalries with other regulars any more.
---
It's a funny clip. We fought earlier.
---
Nope, just zoom all in and disabled HUD
---
I wish i could get into the AOE farm.
---
Spriests are decent levelers, pretty good in pvp and loathed in dungeons/raids. People will shun you when it comes to max level pve stuff simply because you're shadow. 
---
You might find some people that will accept a s priest but pugging 60 dungeons you will not have a good time.
---
Yeah it's super lame
---
Yeah? If everyone is spread out, *which is what layers are there for.*
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294589/blizzard-clears-up-layering-tech-misconceptions-in-classic-wow
---
&gt;First, we’re absolutely committed to reducing to one layer per realm before our second content phase goes live, and the sooner we can get there, the better. The reason we can’t do that initially is that on launch day, everybody will be clustered in the starting zones, and having players so close together causes an exponential drain on server resources. In fact, the same number of players cause more server problems crammed into Northshire than they do spread across all of Elwynn Forest. We expect that even after the first couple of days, we’ll need fewer layers than we need for the initial hours of launch, and our stress tests have confirmed that expectation.
---
You can still have it. Just convince your team to play defense and you'll drag out games forever.
---
This is a guild on Faerlina advertising that they are trolls and I am also pretty sure they have some dumb guild name, their previous advertiser in chat was named "Asmonsucks". I think you should be happy not to be in that guild.
---
What about Virgo?
---
Cringe
---
Who cares about streamers? It'll always be a shitshow of ignorance and drama, just so you, dude.
---
How did you get it at 30 without outside help
---
No I agree it's the same with all classes. We were talking about rogues specifically. Look at all the rogue egdelords that took it personally. There is a lot of cheesy shit in the game but i think saying rogues stealth/stunlock in wpvp is by far the cheesiest. I say that as I im leveling a rogue and mained one in original. Do you really need me to list out all the things in the game i think are cheesy or dont take "skill"? cause that would be one long ass list.
---
.... you use literally 4 spells max. Cool circle jerk.
---
Its real simple.  We have 15-18k players on the servers.  This is ONLY possible because of layering.  If those players were all on the same layer, the game would be unplayable.
---
They have stated they are committed to having one layer by phase 2.  A realm during vanilla was capped at 3k people.  You do the math.  The only reason 15k+ layers are even possible is because of layering.
---
Thanks for the reply!  I really don't want to have to transfer servers...  Might roll an alt and check out another server's balance, though.  I've already made a lot of friends but, unfortunately, we have spaced apart in levels over the last few days so they can't help me now.  It's nice to know someone else feels the same and has found a solution.  I still feel that it's mostly the imbalance of the layer, not the server itself. 
---
Just frustrating to not get the most out of my playtime when I have a 9-5 job and can only play during what appears to be the ganking hours of the evening.
---
It had less to do with hunters being low dps, and more to do with players being perceived as being *bad, and looting everything*.  Because after all everything is a hunter weapon.

spriests are very strong in PvP, so if you're a PvPer, I'd just reroll.    
---
Level 20 is maybe... 1/8 the way through the game? so you wouldn't be losing too much time.
---
I might have accidentally out DPS'd my cat in the beginning but after that I just stood still (Cats pathing makes it difficult to attack when it's chasing the mob which is running) and watched the threat build up while I wasn't doing anything. 
---
One thing I thought of is that maybe my threat meter adds threat from growl even if the mob resists the growl, which would obviously give misleading numbers.
---
Where have I been? Having a life. I've never run enough dungeons to have known about it.
---
Fixing a bug isn't good? Okay...
---
Ahhhhhh! Ughh ughh!!
---
I would agree that buying multiple stacks from the vendor is the easiest solution.
---
I disagree with your logic regarding the mages mana. There's no reason for mages to not be making water if they would otherwise be idle waiting for players to get to the instance.
---
&gt;you are just draining the Mages mana to replenish your own.
---
Im not asking them to make me water mid combat
---
You wish
---
honestly, its fine.  If you're leveling an alt (or 2 or 3), you don't want to go through 120 levels along the same path you've done before.
---
Beg to differ. https://youtu.be/HrJqWag8cqs
---
Nobody is suggesting older stuff like reagents were better because they were old, lol.
---
People are saying they were better because they made the game feel more immersive and RPG-like.  I was saddened when they initially removed ammo and reagents because I felt like a core tenet of those classes, of their identity, was being removed, and I felt like we'd lost potential ways to feel self rewarded by being prepared.
---
Having to go buy ammo gave vendors more purpose.  We will had our favourite gun shop or local blacksmith.
---
So yes many of us prefer these "inconveniences", not because they're older but because they really are better.
---
Everyone knows it's a mage weapon
---
Herod had a 6k queue for me today, which was a lot higher than the last few days. Also, I kept getting booted from the queue after not checking back for so long, which is new (unless that's just a fluke)
---
Also wondering this. Would appreciate a heads up if anyone knows.
---
They got rid of pets? Isn't that kind of the hunter class's thing?
---
It's always a mage in my groups...
---
Is carapace spine crossbow better than Blackcrow though? The weapon itself seems to be, however the 1% hit on blackcrow I would think still makes it best.
---
Every private server that has allowed 8k+ concurrent users has been a shitshow and they've had to implement several measures to make it playable.  The cap in vanilla was 3k as a design decision, not a technical limitation.
---
I'm playing shadow priest at 43 now.
---
Solo leveling - fine, easy, fun to MC people off boats.
---
Group content - i wish i was a rogue with no mana. Or mage with free mana. Or Warlock with lifetap. Or a tank to find groups fast. I don't know if i should keep playing it. Pvp is fun, but it will impossible to get gear (switching to healer will be pointless cause i will get only +healing gear or it would be ninjalooting from casters)
---
It seems to only happen in certain zones. Duskwood was one kick every 15 minutes minimum. I said "fuck it" and went to go level professions in ironforge, went and did like 2 dungeons with no dcs, then as soon as I went back to duskwood to finish up quests it was back to 15 minute dcs.
---
Now this would be amazing if Retail was like Classic
---
As a Druid I’m the tank and the healer. Never get to finish a drink. 
---
About umpteen minutes into a chain pull the oom-mage was bandaging oom-me after he used the last of his mana for a frost nova.
---
Shit was amazing.
---
You sweet summer child. Don't worry 60 will be so amazing.
---
I was in a group like that. Was running sm gy. I'm level 35 everyone else is 29-31. I'm doing literally over half the damage. Tank kept pulling like 3 packs at a time. I was the only aoe class. Was out of mana, and so was healer. I'm drinking, healers drinking, tank pulls another large group and him and the other 2 dps die.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Try doing /who for tanks or healers in the level range you want and do a quick copy paste action to a bunch of them. You can whisper 30 people in just a minute and there's a good chance at least 1 will say yes
---
Can people start spreading the word that layering doesn't affect server cap? I see everyone saying this but It doesn't make any sense even if blizzard did actually lower the cap for whatever reason
---
This is what layers are for
---
Wat

reposts dont really get you karma here just stop its kinda sad
---
Yeah war leveling is more bearable with a buddy, if you get stuck leveling quest-wise you can always grind out a level or two at the highest dungeon you have access to

I don’t think the EK residents knew kalimdor existed so they thought they were the main landmass on the planet.

You can play Classic with an NES controller. Dude, I love classic too... but wtf are you smoking?

I just lost my twink BIS to a fucking retard who then equipped Shadowfang after winning the tied need roll.
---
The worst part is, they all said I could have it when it dropped, and he's the only one who didn't stick to his side of the bargain.
---
The reason they said I could have it, was a) because I was boosting them, and b) because they didn't know its value.

I already grabbed one. Not very good on Warlock.  3/10 looks cool
---
I don't think anyone thought it would die this quickly.  It's only been 2.5 weeks.  The first real test will be 30 days after day 1 when all the people who resubbed for the day 1 hype will decide whether they want to keep playing. I know a couple of people who resubbed after years of not playing, knowing they were going to be testing the waters of whether or not an MMO could still fit into their life.  At my/their age (elder millennial) that's probably the main determining factor of whether people keep playing a game: less about the game itself, and more how it fits into your adult life.
---
LOL idk what to tell you. Private servers aren't blizzard servers

I know right, i stopped there when i hit 20 on my way to the wetlands aoe farm...

It didn't go well. I went back to the highlands soon after

This is not how Vanilla economy worked...

Fuckin retail kids. “This needs to go faster” “can’t you use a more efficient heal?”
---
Bro the warrior doesn’t have a shield on and nobody else is taking damage I’m spamming lesser heal. Chain costs more and if there’s only one person taking damage it isn’t efficient. Greater heal sucks. I can’t downrank yet. I’m fucking elemental. Lemme drink you stupid rogue and warrior groups.

I think thats the castle

Maces? Shields? Wands?

Simple fix: you didn't kill Illidan. A large group of people stormed Illidan's temple and you happened to be there. Veteran of glorious battles? Sure. But the single most epic badass of the whole universe you are not.

I remember when weather was first enabled on the PTR, I logged in and took a flight from Orgrimmar to Silithus in hopes of finding something. Transitioning into Un'Goro revealed a pretty heavy rain storm event. 
---
I landed in Silithus and made my way back to the crater. I don't know how long I sat there with my headphones on, admiring everything about it, but it's still hands down my most favorite details of the game.
---
Which you cast when? Constantly? Just in case you get ganked? And you stand by it til it's off cd so you can move again?
---
I want to be a buttcop too but the Posterior Police Department said that you must be shorter than 4 feet tall to enroll in the Ass Academy. Now I don't know what to do with my life.
---
You're right, and thats why they wont cap the servers at anything that high after layering
---
Just an update. I now have over 10g :D
---
Been doing this since vanilla
---
It will, but you can get like, one tick off. 
---
I actually saved a dude by using tuaren racial into a bandage.
---
Race does matter, they have racial abilities that benefit certain class/combos more than others, but it's very specific based on what you want to do!
---
Do you have any thoughts on what you want to play as? Or just want to be told the easiest class to level?
---
Every time you used the word females in your post, I cringed.
---
You're not scientist conducting an experiment.  As if women are a different species or something.  I can imagine you in a lab coat with your chemistry set saying in a nasally voice "Test number 10 on the female organisms commencing..."
---
I cry in feral druid
---
im just saying, you an strafe with the mouse technically. you could unbind q and e from strafe, and leave everything else as is, and still strafe. Thats all I'm saying.
---
Warlock and Paladin is a good duo. Paladin has lots of sustain and warlock has good damage and utility with pets. Also you both get a free mount
---
I would find out what role you want to play then go from there. If you can't narrow it down to that and want flexibility to do multiple roles then you should choose a hybrid. While hybrids in vanilla aren't really great at any one role they're a jack of all trades and can do a bunch in dungeons and in a pinch. But if you find out a role then think about how you want to execute it. Hunters are a mobile ranged dps with great solo play, etc.
---
except all vanilla private servers and classic are based on the 1.12 patch
---
That’s why I only played Tank in FFXIV. The DPS rotations (tried our Monk and Ninja) are too much for me in a game I just play casually.
---
I love how since the game has launched the nochanges pitchforks have been put away to embrace something like this. Good idea!
---
I am a priest and playing on Arugal server and also going through the same thing.   I was bullied until 40 while leveling.
---
So listen i can tell you are really offended by this so let me help you out a little. Read my comment again except s l o w l y this time. Remove the rage for 30 secs, actually maybe a few minutes for you but just read that comment s l o w l y. I know you can do it. Youll notice that I never once said "all the other classes take so much skill ---- except for rogues" which is apparently why you are all huffy and puffy. You just made up shit to be mad about. I was also responding to a comment specifically about rogue stunlock so it wasnt even out of context.
---
it was like that in vanilla
---
As a hunter, if I pre-explosive trap, multishot through the whole thing, then single target one at a time, I am easily topping mages at close to 6 mobs at some points.
---
...Do you actually think a private server will have the same capabilities as a server run by the billion dollar company that's actually the ones running the game? If you really do then there's not much I can say anymore, you just don't understand how any of this works
---
I'll have to install this tomorrow...
---
Repost...
---
I do wonder how ever. Whas that line of text there in vanilla. Or did blizz add it for classic?
---
You have no idea what the caps are. That is a guess. It's probably closer to 10k. We don't really know.
---
I can't do the math on unknowns and guesses. The only thing we can base it on is what's officially confirmed and reducing caps is not. 
---
But they've specifically said the servers can handle it, just won't be able to do much when all the people are in the same zones at launch. Which is the only problem layering is for, not capacity.
---
No idea, I don't see anyone speaking German
---
Yeah plus when people start getting to ragnaros on your server, you can build your entire economy off of selling fire resist pots
---
This thread reeks of how toxic this community is jesus.
---
&gt;and do WPvP.
---
and wait in ghost form for your queue to pop.
---
thats a different command. from your own source, a standard who will show everything.. the one that shows a layer specific adds "z-"
---
mad?
---
Never underestimate the power of WIND
---
Its not about tracking them on the map, its about finding them to click on in the world, some plants really blend in and are hard to find on the ground.
---
Hunters are super easy to level and also very quick to level. 
---
The cliche is for people new to the game who don't want to work too hard is to play a Night Elf Hunter. If you want to min/max, go a Dwarf for stone form. Hunters get their own mini-tank and can put out good damage and keep themselves alive pretty well against mobs.
---
Alternatively, Mages and Druids are easy to level too, (Druids only become easier post level 20 though). Mages have a lot of Quality of Life stuff,  like portals to major cities, free food and drink, etc.
---
Warriors, Rogues, Paladins are harder to level, avoid those if you're a newbie looking for an easier levelling experience. They're awesome fun in their own ways, but easier is easier.
---
Beauty of pvp server
---
I bet if you post it again it'll get a couple more downvotes.
---
This fucking sub Reddit man.  I make multiple posts why cross realms are shit and the new av is shit, and get down voted into Oblivion.  You make the same post, 3 weeks later, and get gold.  The fuck is with with you fickle ass people?
---
Muscle memory is such a crutch that people hold onto when afraid of changing.    Sure it’ll be confusing for a bit but you’re far too smart to not overcome it after a few times.   I recently changed up binds after literal years and after a few tries it’s all gravy
---
Then you gave up some other dps talent. Which is fine, it's personal preference.
---
I honestly didn't mind the 2h arms thing, we're low level, arms is better to level as, 
---
I was keeping up with healing fine, what annoyed me was him running off into groups across the instance and blaming me. 
---
I feel genuinely bad when someone dies under my watch but some people just can't be helped.
---
53 rogue killing lowbies. Don't think I've ever seen such skill before.
---
I learned about it in BC. By no means is it classic only. Just figured some people might not be aware
---
I did not, but I had one last week about what sever I should transfer to, so I was just trying to help some people (and the server) out! If the mods would prefer i delete it I would be more than happy to.
---
I had always held in my anger when the tank did that, but what pushed me over the edge was when he also dispelled my bubble so he can get more rage too :(
---
I'm not mad. Everyone has the freedom do make the choices they want. However, we can still question the choices people make, and ask if they could have been more morally worthy.
---
Not really, Westfall (my home) is like.. 2:1 maybe even 3:1 ally to horde.
---
It would be legit impossible to rank up as the Ally on this place
---
Right? I don't understand the point of being negative about an achievement like this.
---
Yea, moving between zones is where I get list sometimes too. Been way too long to remember where to go lol I like using a quest addon to get myself back on track if I get really stuck, it's better than guides imo
---
Don't you shit talk MOP. I stopped playing in legion because standard rotations were so much different from MOP.
---
this is sexual
---
Scarlet Monastery Graveyard, and maybe Library. Razorfen Kraul should also be right around that level
---
I used to make people wait till each mob had x number of sunders before opening up.
---
Not gonna lie i realy like them! Other classes top PLZ? :3 
---
PS Maybe add a dps spec for paladins
---
Hmm.. that certainly does seem connected.  I wouldn’t know why but there’s probably something there.
---
May I ask why? particularly interested in which one has the most immerive 1-60 experience
---
Damn. I'm not sure what i don't want to do more - reroll or heal.
---
Nowhere near as upset as I was to learn I'll never experience old AV
---
6k queue on whitemane during peak hours on weekdays. 2.5 hours or so

---

---
Hey what do you think, how much do I have to pay to get tailoring from 1-300? (Buying all mats)
---

---
Wouldn't this work as you've written it?
---
Seems like a waste of a bind.  Why would you just not push down both mouse buttons to not move and bind something useful to X lmao
---
We have a textbook sophist here everybody.
---
There’s also an exploiter here too.
---
I seem them advertised all the time, but since I don't want to run with them, I don't join them. I see people forming regular groups for basically all instances in /2 pretty much any time I'm in a major city. Haven't ever had a hard time finding a group.
---
We just gonna forget ironfoe exists when talking bis
---
Oops. You just proved my point. 
---
You never tanked anything serious in Vanilla then, huh? Did you even play Vanilla?
---
Might wanna brush up on those patch notes, Champ. :)
---
The gold after 40 is for your 60 mount.  You're just dipping into that fund.
---
I shot a set of streetlight manifest. Took a rad picture of the sax player.

Not if it's too name your druid Eastwood but the alt characters make the two  O's look like an owls eyes. The alt character/toxic correlation is a generalization and 'all generalizations are dangerous. Even this one.'
---
All I’ll say is shadow priests are outrageously good in PvE and PvP. Keep at it, it’s worth it. 
---
Don’t sweat over not having AoE. You’ll still be able to get into groups/raids despite the SpElLcLeAvE hype.
---
Korbon Dallas, we got em!
---
How fun are hunters to play in PvP? I currently am at 28 with my hunter and really enjoy it so far but every now and again I get the itch to go back to warlock which is pretty much the only class I have ever truly mained over the course of WoW's life. A guildie told me that Hunters are a super high ceiling class in PvP and aren't too gear dependent.
---
lame
---
Maybe if your hair didnt look like cotton candy...
---
I'm trying to fix my taunt macro to only cast when the target is NOT attacking me. Any tips?
---
I’m the name of balance you just introduced imbalance. “Some will be better than others but...”. And those that aren’t will run to the forums to tell you about how unfair that is. This is the cost of balanced PVP.
---
Who does better? Once they're geared nobody beats fury warriors. And they're more durable than any other dps class. Even through Naxx.
---
You can run raids to get gear then swap to PvP as shadow.  But that will mean some healing
---
Alright thanks for the help man I appreciate It
---
How does anything you say, counter anything I wrote?
---
Oh I thought you meant in the context of BfA. Because that's how frost plays right now in raids, it's a ranged rogue. If we're talking changes since Wrath, well shit. Frost lost PoM, Arcane Concentration, Evocation, Frostfire Bolt, and 2 whole schools of magic. Somehow the arrival in Pandaria made me forget how to cast Arcane Missiles.
---
I loved stealing buffs in TBC.
---
Thanks man. I appreciate you too.
---
Please explain yourself this comment seems lame?
---
Layering literally has nothing to do with server capacity. Why is this hard for people to understand?
---
Just wait til you see a nelf in the pirate shirt.
---
Surely BfA gives a lot of random talents from random items with random teammates
---
It’s one that comes with auctioneer.
---
Blizzard hasn't spelled out exactly how they're planning to do what they're talking about but there's only a few realistic ways.  It only makes sense that since they are using layering to enable increased server populations, that it will come into play as they try to decrease realm pops.
---
Sophistry is about using language to convince others. I actually think this was an interesting reflection on how we play games.
---
It was a NA server, here is the Link for the discord
---

---
Should be easy finding both guilds and people to play with
---
AAP
---
Where did he spawn?
---
Just the way I've always done it, no reason why. And I'm never gonna bind anything else to S, I play to many games to fuck with that muscle memory, so it is what it is.
---
Do people do certain parts of SM only? Or full run? Assuming from this, its a long dungeon?
---
This. Avoid the problem and be up front and no one can argue.
---
The difference is that Classic came first. The fact you agree it's just as bad says far worse things about retail lol they've had how many years to better it?
---
Just always need.
---
There's no way anyone has 650g yet.
---
The shit dropped on my 3rd SM and then today the shoulder drops lol
---
Starting your own group as dps is a good way to have 3 dps just standing around waiting for tanks/heals
---
Is this a new copy pasta?
---
Yeah I understand the sentiment that it is anti-classic, but that doesn't change the fact that gear-score is still the best way to gauge a players usefulness.
---
Noob move to bubble warrior tank
---
Ok? Stop moving your goalposts. We weren't talking about player experience. The bottom line is Layering doesn't allow more players on a server.
---
Sure but it's lame for new people playing. Really loses a large part of the experience.
---
Except that they increased the realm population in combination with more layers to facilitate all people during launch. On firemaw EU there was a census of 20k 2-59 chars. This means current server population caps are in the 10 thousands instead of the 3,5-5k vanilla caps, and they will be back at 3,5-5k in phase 2. So they might aswell start that process now, gradually. Instead o in 1 go at phase 2 and have 30k queues.
---
it just seems a little bloated when really I just want to talk to my friends.  Don't really need a facebook feed that stores all links posted forever.
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Just reminder who it is and never run again w them lol
---
If being killed gets old wouldn’t it make sense for you to reroll onto pve server?
---
No one can say for certain but the odds of it are extremely slim while they are also shorting the seller by more than 6/7ths of the value of the item.
---
Just the motivation I needed!
---
:D omegalul
---
There's no way in hell anything is selling for 650g. Not possible.
---
Sad
---
Bzzzzt
---
Still a populated game? Has it become better?
---
This. Even without the crit immunity on druids what boss is going to actually do over 15k damage in a hit late game? You're not going to just get oneshot by a crit unless you're very undergeared to begin with. This is one of the biggest misconceptions people still spout that just makes no sense lol.
---
GearScore

The retail ilvl shit is all due to the players

Works great! You rock.

---
"The Titan's Gauntlet"? You killed lowbies for an hour. Yikes dude
---
you can't shadowmeld in combat in classic
---
To be honest i've never laughed as hard as I did when you tried to define and frame moral worth in one paragraph.
---
What's even better is you tried to pre-emptively build a defence with the whole "b-but moral worth is subjective" by saying detractors lack "moral clarity".
---
What a fucking clownshow. What a complete disregard for his entire argument.
---
When someone says that other people can't dictate how he can play the game, and that he derives the most personal enjoyment out of the game from how HE plays, the subject of morality needs to be one of the LAST things you try to argue. it is already so far removed from the subject, and you use it as best to conflate your views on morality to his method of play being "wrong".
---
It was a good mental gymnastics experiment. Pack it in.
---
You misspelled hunter
---
I can assure you there are no tears here, but its the truth. I do not envy you
---
&gt; It was like some unfamiliar new character ended up on my account somehow.
---
thats how i felt after every expansion with my hunter and shaman.
---
First time I leveled through Guild wars 2 I felt the same way, sadly there leveling experience got much worse after first expansion.
---
Damn, that really hurts but thanks.
---
For current MC/Onyxia  they aren't a match for mages, rogues, and hunters mostly, unless you're talking about specifically horde side because of windfury, which they still don't really out-dps rogues, just get closer. I didn't know people were talking about Zul/BWL/AQ/Nax though. They definitely match top dps. But really it depends on the fight.
---
The real way warriors maximize DPS is by tanking, the limit to any dps is how much threat the MT can generate, right?! Haha
---
I prefer pallies personally. But I also love using rain of fire so....
---
It's pretty easy to go from WASD to home row on the left hand quickly enough to avoid suspicion, I think.
---
Exactly this. Everyone hates rogues, so I may as well let the hate be justified.
---
You clearly just wanted to stretch it as far as you could to turn it around on me.
---
Why don't you stop being a burden on society and get a well-over-full-time job yourself? Then tell me that working that much is for bragging about.
---
Please get over yourself.
---
Resolution is too high.
---
You should practice what you preach.
---
Because we have the same gear 4head. Every class will have competition for gear.
---
Blizz bars, just disabled the frames around the bars.
---
Greater fire resist pots?
---
I got 3 of them as a Warrior just killing Deadmines trash mobs in the span of a few runs. Just keep at it, it’s not worth that much gold.
---
Yeah you got destroyed in this thread with your dumbass comment. Embarrassing dude, go learn how to play classic or something lol
---
BFD would be more level appropriate, enemies max out at 27.
---
You can track them on your minimap. Makes finding them real easy.
---
Classic resides in an era of existence where performance and theatrics are an unwritten profession. 
---
Bless him.
---
Hunter is good for solo 
---
Druid too 
---
Races don’t matter too much especially as a casual player
---
1280x1024 is absolutely reasonable for the time.
---
What class are you ?
---
The owl eye O's look like titties. Reported.
---
Playing a priest and I have a cheer macro for when I heal or res randoms. I like to cast Piwer Word: Encourage.
---
Good eye!
---
Yeah I understood this before
---
I wish more quests happened there that aren't elite stromgarde ones. I think I was able to do like 10 quests total before I ran out and left
---
There is definately people who have more than 650g.
---
idk what shamans and paladins you're playing with 😂😂
---
Enjoy your streamlined norpg game prepped for 12 year olds, idc. Classic is infinitely more complex.
---
Nope, but everything else, including cloth was up for grabs.
---
There was a point in time around patch 1.7 where a set of cloth bracers were BIS lol.
---
It's worth what someone will pay for it
---
I agree. I feel like it will be a huge hassle to level my alt character for 110 to to 120 and others from 100 to 120.
---
Honest? He said borderline
---
will be done before the evening
---
I'll just activate Shadowmeld and rez them later.
---
Okay man. Well I can see that you've been debating on the internet a long time. I could take the time to spell out how each point I made was a logical contention to answer your point, but I think it would fall on deaf ears. Have a nice life.
---
BoP mate.
---
As a rouge player I’m highly offended
---
I think the implication is that they are reducing player cap, after which they would need fewer layers.
---
Who gives a crap?
---
What a fucking joke.
---
Get bent.
---
My favorite was when you would blink and it would put you 100 meters back up in the air and you would die anyway. The old blink bugs were best.
---
Nothing wrong with that. You don't use tab with 3 or more targets or you're entitled to target the wrong mob.
---
Can I rank as a ret pally? Currently level 23. Just wondering if I slap on a shield and 1h if I can sufficiently rank stocks and the like
---
You don’t need to put Spell name every time, every [] pair is a separate condition and they are checked in an order they are written, like 
---
/cast [@mouseover,help][] Holy Light 
---
Will check if there is a friendly target under cursor first, then will try to apply usual behavior 2nd for Holy Light
---
That way the tank can live half a second longer for your piddly 50% heals to do fuck all.
---
how tf are goons still a thing and in these numbers lmao
---
Your problem was not being vengeance.
---
Stopped reading after the point where you think there is a right and wrong way to play games. There isn't.
---
I don't know how you found it so devoid of mobs.  Raptors, spiders, horde...
---
they started ruin the wow with cataclism... that is the point when they have to restart the game.
---
Only if you take a picture of it with your phone
---
How is drastically lowering the skill ceiling a good thing?
---
Having those "useless" or peripheral abilities lets talented players notice opportunities to use them effectively where others would never expect it.
---
When you're in good dungeon groups, you might want to encourage people to add you to maybe group again another day. I'd much rather have a good rogue than a bad rando mage.
---
I think you should probably watch what you say in group chat if you want to post it here.
---
Increase server cap -&gt; more layers, assuming layer population is static. So if they're reducing server cap, perhaps they're doing it a layer at a time.
---
It could be argued that a regular retail dungeon has more boss mechanics than all of MC. 
---
 It isn't untill now, that I have reached Scarlet Monestary, that there is even a hint of something more complicated than "tank and spank". Although it still only amounts to moving away from the boss when he does his aoe thing, for both the armory and liberary bosses.
---
Yea it seems you need to have a group of people who you play with that will be willing to take a spriest
---
It funny because Day of release someone talked about gold farming and how the price per gold will stay 15$ for 1 Gold for a while.. 
---
You have to look at OSRS in the economy aspect we aren’t kids anymore we are wired to try to be efficient the economy is going to be much different this time around because we all know where the money is
---
You rarely see alliance on kurrinax. I'm playing alliance on blaumeux though seems good
---
That's not really true at all though.
---
And it makes it sound like its simplified vs classic, when classic is quite literally press 1 button, maybe two, and repeat until boss is dead.
---
To do mechanics AND to do your rotation &amp; time buffs/power spikes etc to fights &amp; procs etc is NOT easy on retail. There's a reason there's such a hige disparity in skill between raiding players.
---
Paying for a vacation so you can sit inside in queue. Seems worth it.
---
Sometimes i have to turn this down to be able to find herbs.  I swear its like going from Fall to Spring/ Summer.  So much more vegetation.
---
I fully agree. People think CRT's were some ancient awful piece of shit that could barely display an image, when in reality it put out a better than most LCD's. If CRT tech had continued progressing instead of abruptly halting in 2004, I think we'd currently be seeing higher resolutions, higher refresh rates, and better overall quality in basically every aspect of displays. The only thing LCD's were objectively better at was readability of text, but that's not a priority for gaming or watching videos.
---
I've seen OLED, and it's probably the best screen tech out now. It does however suffer from burn in, and the few consumer displays out are more of an experiment than anything. Freesync/Gsync along with higher refresh rates are probably the best leap we've had in the last 10 years. 
---
I play on a 1440p, 144hz freesync LCD, but I'd swap it in a second for a quality CRT if I could.
---
You get free mounts bro don’t even trip about money in this game. 
---
Sincerely, a fellow Warlock
---
Is this a joke? Horde will often run from a 1v1 but suddenly get brave when they have triple the number
---
You never move backwards?
---
Play what ever way feels right. If you notice something in particular that you want to refine/improve, look up that specific thing. It helps cut through the clutter while you learn the intricacies.
---
I see, so stuff like fear from warlocks also have a chance to just randomly break if you're unlucky? Especially with Immolate ticking.
---
Also a lot of the builds that im seeing being posted right now have all the points in Assassination and combat, and very little in subtlety which increases your stealth against enemies.
---
Why envy PoE when you can just play it? New league came out last Friday.
---
Well since they're BoP they're kinda worth nothing.
---
yep, class balance in vanilla is going to end up being a really big issue over time
---
mages and warriors being comically overpowered compared to the other classes is going to really start to get on everyones nerves once we get a few months into classic
---
The odds arent slim at all. 
---
And nobody has 700g so offering around 100g for a top tier item isnt that absurd.
---
&gt; so they are very empathetic to all roles and their performance.
---
See, that’s where I differ. If anything I’m even more critical because I’ve done your role, and know why your fucking up. Between playing a Druid in classic, retail from vanilla to current, as well as other classes here and there.
---
Are you trying to say that THIS, in contrast, makes sense to you? A backless metal bikini and thigh-high metal boots?
---
I really wish they would allow us to increase the view distance/reduce the fog.
---
usually they wait until i am fightkng a mob before they decide to attack my back
---
me orc me smash
---
but also significantly more abilities they use in combat
---
Blatantly false as I have no friends
---
Cause victim healer card is easy karma
---
Gheal is amazing and possibly why you’re having mana issues. If only the tank is taking damage you should allow him to drop to 50% or so and bomb a gheal + renew on him then go back to wanding. This allows you to drop in to regen(fsr) between heals which would in fact be a much more efficient way to heal.  
---
I assume this is low-mid level considering the tank isn’t wearing a shield, and regardless gheal is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lesser
---
See that was my stance for the longest time. But then you meet someone that wants to use teamspeak or ventrillo. Then they have to download mumble... Meanwhile discord works in browser. It's much easier to ask someone to open a link than download a new program. Also posting memes and leaving messages for offline people is a nice touch. And once you join multiple discord communities, you're kinda annoyed at how the other apps don't let you do as much. Turns out, discord is quite nice.
---
No he didn't. Actually read the quote you copy pasted lmao.

After having a hunter specific legendary whose special feature....was not needing ammo.

I was using a 23” CRT until 2008. Played wow on it back in the day. It was a monster but the picture was nice
---
Talented gouge doesnt take me out of combat.
---
It's bind on pickup and therefore can't be traded, so you'll have to loot one yourself.
---
That sounds easy. Or more like that sounds easy, but actually impossible and never going to happen.
---
i watched a hordie initiate a 1vs1 againts an alliance and die
---
boy did the hordie piss and moan to me that i didnt jump in and help him.  what am i?  his buddy cause he is he same faction as me?  i just randomly happened to be walking by
---
hate to ruin a perfectly good 1vs1.  they hard to come by
---
You win by not playing. Doubly so if they're playing SL
---
Oh, so it's okay to be racist against Brazilians, then?
---
Repeating, of course.
---
This hotfix does nothing to affect spell cleave groups, why would it?
---
The F keys or numpad keys are good candidates for keybinds for marks. Make sure to make a keybind to clear a mark as well if you put the wrong one on.

Had the same.question and found this guys guide. It works very well. I can solo quest easy and do good damage in dungeons.

You should visit Mulgore.  I always train up my fishing in Mulgore, it's so serene.
---
Yes I did. Played a Warlock since patch 1.5. No privates
---
Currently playing a hunter and I'm okay with the classic wow patch being based on 1.12 even if it means trap shares DR with scatter.
---
If anything, warriors would be nerfed if we got new patches/content for vanilla, instead of buffed, I think you know that.
---
The icy veins leveling talent guide for classic warlocks is decent. Focuses on affliction for dots and demo to buff up your voidwalker.
---
Man, I don't know if it's an Oceanic thing or an Alliance thing in general but my fellow Alliance on Arugal never seem to care about a Horde player nearby that's a prime target to kill.
---
From what I heard in guild chat and /5, Horde don't seem to have the same problem.
---
Same, it's such a weird emote, I can't help it.
---
They don't. You can only have a single effect on your weapon. 
---
I don't know how the priority works, it's probably due to which ever was cast first. It's a moot point because you want windfury.
---
Really? You just right click their name..

this.
---
it's way more fun and challenging playing on retail. classic was unplayable for me because of that reason.
---
There's a lot of hospitals that make it mandatory that no-one in pallative care dies alone. These slots are filled most of the time by volunteers, usually ex/retired carers or pallative health providers. There's a facility for anyone to sign up to do it, but the turnover rate is immense for obvious reasons.
---
That being said, OP's screenshot is like straight out of the choosing beggar handbook. Considering how close the messages were to one another, i'd be very, very surprised if it was a coincidence.

It does? I never knew. Thx

I’ve failed you

Sunder Armor doesn't require defensive stance? How have I never known this?

Um I do, that's when I would take my fingers off the mouse buttons..
---
Those guides will be for the retail version, In classic it was rocks and a salt plane.
---
Need that Varian fan art
---
Never done a dungeon before but planning on it soon. I see people mentioning to manage your threat as DPS, not out-threat the tank, etc. How do I know if I'm close to aggro'ing something off of the tank? Is it just gut feeling and use Feint whenever I have it?
---
Interesting, because I swear I remember someone talking about Demo Shout being stronger the more enemies are affected in early days of the release. I think it was Esfand.
---
I figured as much. It seems like they added a lot to the game based on addons/players over the years.
---
Your humblebrag aside, many players are perfectly fine putting groups together without having aoe. All it takes is initiative.
---
Am undead mage. I /lick every gnome I see before polymorphing them and /pat them and move along.
---
I’m disappointed /pet is not a thing in classic though.
---
Ok, now that there is internet... What the hell was that for?
---
Those people were stupid before.
---
Translate please........ I need to know what you're saying.....
---
Saw a warlock full green from lvl 30s and stuff in complete level gear with tier 1 helmet. Raids are super easy if ur dps just show up and u are fine. Classic is easiest Content so far only tank and maybe heal need decent gear
---
Is it just the old raptor strike and traps same as old vanilla?
---
Go to something cool and stop wasting your life on Reddit you inbred.

An exploit is exploiting game mechanics to do / obtain something that wouldn't otherwise be possible. Like how paladins used to be able to stack a certain buff, then one shot world bosses.
---
It's blocked for me =/

Yes pls very much would appreciate if you could post a pic of the base attributes (AND health/mana) for specifically all warlock/mage/priest races (or just undead if it's too much)

My raid will at least bring one Moonkin. Everyone needs a mascot. All he has to do is stand in the middle of the raid and /dance

No matter anyone's opinions, it's up to the rogue in the end. He's the one actually casting the Lock Pick ability and will have access to the chest before anyone else. Most of the time the chests are full of vendor trash. People only care because the small chance for something worth some change. That's also why people are ok with the double standard and don't force rolling on Herbs or Mining Veins. It is pretty sad to put time into leveling up your profession to never get any of the rewards because everyone think's it's fair to leave it up to the roll of the dice. People will argue it's not a profession but gathering professions are the only thing you can compare it to by how it works and the time sink. imo it's probably the most fair to just let the rogue have the vendor trash because he is the one that put the time into it so that chest could be opened and if you need something out of it, why not just ask?
---
honestly it doesn't matter what i'm doing on a computer, if i'm not actively typing my hand defaults to WASD.
---
Thank you, I’ll get the addon!
---
Yeah I always hit a wall in the mid 20s and reroll and the process repeats itself. When I inevitably play the other characters they should have plenty of rested xp
---
7 actually, since the first enter can be skipped by just pressing the / button
---
Grats, it's a tough camp
---
Is the side button being held down? Either by your thumb or something stuck inside of it?
---
It isnt.
---
Unless... blizzard makes it.
---
Id imagine an automatic trading addon could cause problems, bugs etc and people lose valuable items to some nasty dude
---
Man, I wish some of the "anything beyond WOTLK = bad" circlejerk would stop being so prevalent on this sub. 
---
Can't we all just enjoy Classic without whining about why retail sucks?
---
Ok then ill try now
---
He linked it on curse
---
Isnt that the same?
---
I know what it is. But nothing he said is an exploit.
---
Yeah any time horde gather in groups larger than 2 its safer to just stay away because they usually will kill me on sight. One or two hordies usually leave me alone, however.
---
So.... retail?
---
I fucking hate people that list things in singles when they have 100 of the item.
---
It's the only way to actually die in a dungeon currently. 3 mages and a lock pulling everything in the instance amd coordinating CC and line of sight to burn everything down or die trying is **infinitely** more engaging than Frostbolt Frostbolt Frostbolt Frostbolt imo.
---
Let people make their own fun.
---
That's handy. I'm worried that it's dangerous for the culture of the game to have it as default, especially if the addon catches on. People will measure each other by any number they can, even though it's a garbage measure in classic.
---
Honestly, if I just recently joined a guild I wouldn’t know who the GM was either unless the person told me. I don’t really look at ranks.

öäü are regular characters on german keyboards (and maybe others?).. just saying that these are not so special that you need alt codes everywhere. :)

Pre-bis is a guide, not the law. I for one am not farming ST for random Frozen Wrath gear.

They also have a downside to them. They tend to lack other stats such as Stam/Int. So your survivability will suffer tremendously.

Have I ever told you the story about how Reddit is complete waste of person's life to point where each Redditor will one day wake up and have a major realization that all the time they spent cowering behind their keyboard, inching for the next hit a dopamine just wasn't worth the regret :(

I played until just after Cata released. It was the same shit at the end of Wrath, and as far as I know Cata isn't retail now. Remove stick from ass.

As I warlock I just hand out healthstones to any passerbys when im questing, not too many passerbys though, as most people around my level are doing dungeons, which is what i mostly do too.

Hey guys, I’ve been playing wow since Panda Land, and I’m downloading classic as I’m typing this. But I’m stuck in a bind. My main character since the beginning has been Warrior, but from what I’ve heard the class is mostly expected to tank. So I was thinking of leveling a rogue instead, but I really have no experience or knowledge of classic. Leveling is not an issue, I’m planning on taking my time and I’m also leveling with my friend who is a priest healer, so I’m not expecting much difficulty. Really just looking for some insight on both classes viability PvE and PvP. Ty!
---
&gt;	You are the main character of your own story, but not the main character of the story.

I think this a very good way to phrase it
---
BiS entire game, nice find
---
Had a rogue not only do what you said, but he waited until I was done killing the mob and walked over so he could steal it in my face.
---
I finished up my quest and then tracked him down to he next hub and what do you know, first pull he pops all of his cooldowns to kill two mobs at once. So I priest fear the both of them and spam /hi as he dies to the chaos that ensues.
---
Oh sweet revenge.
---
i'm not familiar with the twitch app, so I can't tell you if it is there, but I think all addons that are available on curseforge are also available via the twitch app. Can't you find it there?

But this, does put a smile on my face.

You're getting a lot of "hate" because this is not impressive, dude.

You were ganking low leveled players that were in no way a threat to you.

What you did is the equivalent of me, a guy in his 20s, going to a playground, and beating up a bunch of little kids and feeling a sense of accomplishment about it.

Back in Vanilla, there was a Rogue that made a video where he took on level 60 players with white daggers and no gear. And won.

I don’t think it’s a bad thing. It’s really odd to see this sub so upset over people efficiently utilizing class mechanics. This isn’t a new concept, it’s just more widespread as the player base has drastically improved over the last 15 years.

You can swim far from the coast and avoid aggro, might be slower than walking but you just point at the right direction and afk auto-swim.
---
Nope. I can completely remove my hands from the mouse and attempt to type on the keyboard but it will still be bugged like this. And I'll usually hit the side button a few times to try to unstick it but that has yet to work. I know it's the mouse because the only way to notify my group is to unplug the mouse and then I can type normally again while it remains unplugged.
---
Youz a tiger then 🐅

I like the cleavage of the rogue and the details when it comes to the lip piercings. Great work
---
yesterday I saw a tank druid with literally full preraid bis gear and already gear from ragnaros. I checked the value of his goods, and the total value of gear were around 1500g. +1000g for his epic mount. maxed professions also cost money,but cant even imagine how much for lw and engi.
---
What amazes is that in original wow i had like 3 60s and many alts, and not once did i ever hear of 10 man raids in lvling dungeons like SM. Where did this come from and was it always in the game?
---
I personally think that aoe farming raids is taking away from the spirit of the game. Having different aspects that each class bring to a party is where wow originally shined.
---
*classic swing timer
---
Has the 500ms autoshot delay visual built in better. Weapon swing timer is inacurate because of the tick rate I believe

Completely disagree.  Like many I feel 1.12 was peak vanilla, before ez pvp loot equivalent to T2 came along.  No AQ yet but practically tbc, holy hyperbole, Batman!!

Hate to tell you this bro but there is also horde who camp low level zones. It's not a faction thing. Also what does asmongold have to do with you getting camped lol
---
A game of chess or checkers or even snap, is more difficult than raiding. Even mythic raiding. The a.i does not respond or change like we do, we change our strategy and read our opponent in any way we can. We eke out a meta game from Rock Paper Scissors lol. You can make raiding as complex as you possibly could and as you do so more and more people become unable to do it. That’s all you achieve. Unless you make it impossible to complete it will never be harder than pvp and like you said, at that point the fun is lost. In pvp there is almost always someone better than you and even when there isn’t the meta may shift faster than you can adapt.
---
The devs searched for that sweet spot, gave up and instead made multiple difficulties of piñata. It’s still just a piñata though. Once you know how to do it, it’s done.

Wait, they removed melee for hunters?

It used to work like that in Vanilla. But people have bad habits and in retail it started. Now people don't do anything else.
---
[Lorti UI](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lorti_ui)
---
This does not mean that they are not artificially limiting server size as they remove layers. For example: let's say their end goal is 5k concurrent players by the time they lower each realm to a single layer. Currently they might have 20k people across 4 layers. As they remove layers, they may also be limiting concurrent players to avoid having too many people on a layer. Maybe not by the full layer amount, maybe they cut it by 50% of a layer size or something - nobody knows.
---
The point is, they very well could be doing it this way. They've already confirmed that servers have much higher capacities than servers in vanilla at the same listed population. They were banking on a high percentage of people leaving. If those people aren't leaving, they remove layers and limit the capacity to "squeeze" them out while they're offering free transfers.
---
What spec?
---
What do you mean Hunters can not need strength 2handers like Destiny?
---
Just a few fun stories I encountered with SM cath. 
---
2 mages, 1 hunter, 1 warrior, and 1 resto druid (me) were farming cath. We were averaging 1.5k exp / min including reset. So around 90k / hr before we locked out. 
---
We clear the few mobs at start, then all mobs in the lower yard, go up stairs and pull all, open the door and pull boss all using hunter pet, arcane intellect, feign death, and ice block. 
---
In most pulls, 2 mages were doing 1.5k dps and I as resto druid was doing around 600-700 dps. There was like a 30 min practice though. 
---
Today I joined a pug with 2 mages. Pug Tank pulled 2-3 mobs at a time, did not know to group mobs or kite when frost nova went out. Did not swap targets or taunt, and mobs were going every where even when there were just 2 or 3. I was averaging 350 exp / min at level 41, around 21k/hr. 
---
Later I joined a 3 mage group as a druid tank but got instantly kicked because I have healing gear lol. Little did they know it would be a cool run.
---
if you didn't come to the game with a guild already, there is no point to joining one before your first raid. 
---
guilds are transitory. everyone and their mother made one and thinks they are hot shit or that they have amazing plans, but most of them won't make it out of the 40's. 
---
bide your time, prove yourself. the good guilds will come to you.
---
Alliance in STV are particularly aggressive and Badlands is proving to be much the same, but I'm not high enough to comment on the nature of every zone.
---
What professions are recommended for a hunter? I hear good things about engineering but is that more of an end-game thing?
---
K E K
---
There are no problems with regular dungeon groups. But if you want the best xp/hr then you need to either be a mage or warlock, healer, or a tank with 5+ years of experience in something that has only existed for 2 (it’s a metaphor).

Alamo addon?

Don’t play on a streamer server if you don’t like them. Plenty of other full servers.

World pvp happens, just make the most of it and try rally your side or go somewhere else. It’s part of the fun of the game :)

yeah, they are both quite hated races by a lot of people.

If you don't know what you're talking about, the best play is to not talk.
---
Dungeon Cleave has been a thing since Vanilla, but was hashed all the way out to where we are now on provate servers, with the distinction that it was **worse** than on live because the mobs were harder and xp was nerfed.
---
This is not new.
---
You can actually use it as a group finder tool. You put yourself in queue and when there are enough people in queue, a group forms. The kicker is, the meeting stones on Classic do not do a role check. So you could find yourself in a BRD group with 5 Priests.
---
I can relate to this
---
I'm pretty sure it used to work.  You'd have to try it, my hunter isn't 30 yet
---
&gt;Tower of Althalaxx
---
yes Tower of Althalaxx, farm those 28-29 mobs, recommend level 30+ though
---
I always thought of it like hybrid techno-magic. Shooting bullets/arrows but casting a spell on the projectile.
---
I get how it works. I still don't give a shit about them and take whatever's available and in the appropriate level range. If you care so much, stop only forming aoe/cleave groups.
---
16 str and 5 agi is a very good stat stick for a feral druid around level 30.
---
I agree. Class mechanics are the way they are. There’s no changing that. But I believe that it harms the community in this regard. Players are downright forgotten just because of the class that they chose

Oh, what if you like beating kids though?

Wrath was good, but tbh I had the most fun in Legion. Wrath also had pretty bad raids aside from Ulduar/ICC, 5 mans sucked and ofc it brought LFD. Class design was pretty good tho.

I had the most fun in Legion. It was different, quick and flashy type WoW. It had a lot of class/spec flavour and some strong lore in all dungeons and zonesç

He shouldn't attack me when I am already attacked and on low health, what is there to achieve? No honor, no reward. Just being a dick.

No argument from me, usage of words like sophist just don’t come off as unintelligent to begin with. Just found it amusing.

I hardly even know who this asmongold dude is. Never been into streaming though.
---
lmao if its such a waste of time why are you on your posting your limp-dicked videos?
---
Because the reverse is that you're a hero that's saved the world about 10 times over already, and at the start of the expansion you're still running around collecting bear asses for NPC treating you like dirt.
---
Damn, that's not a bad idea, might have to set that up!
---
If you can't tell that diff you aren't very highly skilled I can already tell just from that.
---
They already stated that server populations are much higher than servers listed at the same populations in vanilla. They may have said it was particularly for starting areas, but it is clearly benefiting players in every zone. Just because that's one reason they included it doesn't mean it's the ONLY reason. If that were true, they would have only ever included layering in the starting zones anyway.
---
Unfortunetally I haven't received any updates on this, I won't be able to make another ticket unti lthe weekend but it might be worth tweeting about it.

This seems really awkward. A UnitIsPlayer() check should avoid npc's from being messaged. And I really don't understand why it just happen to a few people. Maybe I need to contact some Addon developers and Blizzard if they know what this could be.
---
? I am not discrediting them. They are idiots, they poluted a river for no reason. I am literally voting the green party.
---
Uranin while not harmful for humans, does not belong in rivers and its effects on microbiology nd animals is not really known.
---
Its literally pollution.

---
He's not that far off.
---
Can confirm im on kurinaxx alliance side and it is bad. You just need to find a group or guild to help because otherwise horde gankers are just going to ruin your day. Also its better to just skip STV and go straight to aoe farming.
---
Blocked too =/
---
My human Paladin is named Aodhán and I would greatly appreciate a care package. I’m new to WoW so anything at all is a big help. 
---
Thanks a lot for helping new folks. This community is awesome and I’m looking forward to passing the buck someday.
---
Get Thalanaar fp and go from there
---
Let me paint you a picture...
---
A guy in his mid 30's, overweight, balding, unattractive, middle of the road intelligence. He gets up every day to a 9-5 he hates where his boss shits on him. He gets home to his fat unattractive wife and 2 snotty shit kids who's greatest achievement is a 7th place trophy in the maths quiz at school that only had 8 people in it. His wife hates him, she shouts at him, she undermines and demeans him and shits on him because hes a loser. Finally she goes to sleep in her separate room and he gets a few hours to himself, a few hours to log onto a fake online world and pretend he's anything but himself. 
---
Finally he gets to do to you what the whole world does to him. 
---
At least, that's what I picture in my head when someone much higher level or someone in a group of 3 ganks me when I'm questing lol 🤣
---
Maybe you should educate people on the topic, with links to the sources from which you get your info.
---
Right now you just look like a dick.
---
Twitch bought CurseApp so it's the same CurseApp but in purple with twitch broadcasters
---
Looking forward to go there again.  Also not looking forward to STV as a warrior though.
---
You'd think with all the warriors it'd be easier to cinema tank out there
---
Idk if I'm not looking in the right places but I'm 38 on my Hunter and it feels like there aren't any exciting "hunter" weapons or gear to look forward too. Like is there anything iconic like the ravager or staff of jordan?
---
Only thing I'm looking forward too is the Dragonsbreath gun because its literally a dragon head. Idk if I'll be able to raid though and get geared up for bwl
---
Yes they definitely are
---
My group was full of lower level casters. We had almost all just upgraded our wands to the BFD shadow wands. Of course we sold our old wands  Two warlocks and two shadow priests in the group. With me on a mage.
---
Ya he's immune to shadow damage. Good thing we all got new shadow wands. Wouldn't want to be useful after we all went oom. We had to stave him down. It was a shit show.
---
why?
---
10 man was a bug and got fixed
---
Because he's a mage
---
What do you mean by this? Legit curious
---
i played another game that had a pug meta that i did not enjoy. 
---
this is what you do:
---
"lfm rfk - tradional tank, heal, dps run" or something like that.  that way you get people that play your way and not people expecting something else
---
then if you get someone that wants to defy your clearly described advertised run then just insta kick them.
---
By making all the classes functionally the same, no one can complain about being disadvantaged relative to others.
---
And this is why communism has always and will always suck.
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/ is probably your best bet.
---
However the developer says he needs to go through and better filter the data he gets since the data for some servers is clearly pretty wonky
---
That 75Hz refresh rate though.
---
How do you /who the alt code people, can't find a way to copy their names.
---
You can DPS as a Warrior and be just fine honestly. I know at times even DPS warriors are expected to off tank but beyond that you’d be DPS. Generally leveling up doing dungeons you might be expected to tank, plus getting groups for said dungeons would become very easy though granted having a healer already is also very nice. Just keep a spare 1H and shield on you and you’ll be fine. I think overall you’d be ok going DPS Warrior, raids generally bring a decent amount of them so finding a spot wouldn’t be too bad either.
---
I only post content here lol I don't interact with you all normally, ha!
---
I'm not grabbing a pitchfork to harass someone else enjoying a game that doesn't affect me.
---
The threat only applies on buff application.  You need to remove the buff to get the threat.
---
&gt; I find the first 30 levels as rogue a huge struggle.
---
Man this can't be stressed enough. Everyone watches these old videos of max level rogues in epics wrecking people in world PvP but no one sees the massive ~30 levels of utter uselessness and barely scraping by you have to do just get a semi-competent kill on someone *at your level*. I definitely don't recommend rogues for people who lack deep reserves of patience.
---
I made a sub for warlocks and I’m getting it out there. Also I live in a free county and you’re not the boss of me
---
What am I some kind of normal person or something, lol?!?!?!
---
It's crazy.  Being BiS suddenly makes everything cost an epic mount, like wtf, we got 20 slots, they all cant cost epic mount money.
---
Seeing as the game's been out for 16 days, that means there's only been 2 weekends since its release. That means you played 5 days worth of time in a total of 4 days. So not only did you not sleep, you also conjured up another 24 hours worth of time.
---
Aka you're full of shit.
---
god does this mean the r-tards will actually sheep and trap now? the ability for warriors and druids to tank in a way that was NOT how it was back in the day has exasperated and encouraged the current poor live playstyle of gather it all, aoe it all down.
---
Will try
---
Sooner you are away from that cancerous GM, the better.

---
I think they have. It's kind of hard to make that claim when you're going off of vanilla WoW. Only like two devs from that era even exist still and one didn't even come in until vanilla wow was already completed.
---
Modern Blizzard gave us retail WoW, which isn't really good game design, more so a game designed to use predatory gambling-esque tactics on gamers that are too new to the scene to realize what is happening to them.
---
Blizzard has taken all the crap in the "last year" because they have quite frankly lost touch, classic is the best thing we've gotten from them in years and it wasn't their creation, they just inherited it. The ones who made it what it was are for the most part long gone.
---
Yeah cause me being 60 week 1 with epic mount and full bis totally lends to me being in a third world guild. Stop posturing casual.
---
Which add-on lets you move frames like that.
---
&gt;makes people doing it the "right" way have more trouble
---
Couple problems.
---
* This isn't a nerf due to spellcleave, this is a hotfix due to a bug. Cleave groups had nothing to do with this.
---
* The breakpoint for Shoutspam to become noticeable is 7+mobs. Very very few "traditional" (slow and steady) tanks pulled that much at one time.
---
I mean the only thing I want to do is get to 60 as quick as possible. I don't give a single shit about having fun whilst leveling because I absolutely loath it.
---
If that means I will aoe spam dungeons for faster xp then sure as hell I will do that.
---

---
No but the service I’m getting from the coffee shop is not TIME to drink coffee. If it were I would expect coffee instantly.
---
Mages with tailoring must be retarded on my server. They sell everything at 4th the cost it takes to make shit effectively ruining business for everyone.
---
Both kind of... I tried them both out: Gnome lock to 20 with Classicwow.live and my current dwarf priest (47) with AAP. The latter only works until 40 and it's designed to work from level one but the 40 levels were a delight! It really is a great addons! 
---
I switched back to Classicwow.live at at 40 and it's been cool so far!
---
The only thing time consuming was lvling 1-60 far
---
Petty gm
---
Please don’t buy this.
---
I believed I was going mad at first, but now I can say with chilling sobriety: My fan is trying to gank me.  I lie frozen in my bed, acutely aware of its ominous oscillation in the other room - its infernal flathead tapping terribly on the rumpus room wall.  It is waiting. It is preying. It is raiding Molten Core.
---
*tap, tap, tap*
---
If only I had just waited in queue...
---
It is off
---
Lol :)
---
I've found it's not *always* the best idea to auto-include Rejuv with that sequence. You might be too low mana to shift back into form, especially if leveling Feral before getting Heart of the Wild.
---
Pathetic
---
Those old guides are all very very valid. The boom of videos from a few months ago was beta.
---
I mean we made it work but I tell you its ROUGH. When I am doing top damage, tanking half the mobs because the tank is pulling crazy and just running around and just wants to whirlwind all day, and then have to save many to help the healer... Its a rough run. Thank the elements for mana totem.
---
Yeah because having your group afk for 15 seconds each pull before attacking is sooooo fun for them!
---
Okay maybe I try retail raids ! Thanks so much for feedback
---
You should really be spamming shield block for that sweet revenge.
---
Phone is charged!
---
eh right on bud. ye i started using a questing add on at lvl16 its amazing lol. glad to hear your enjoying it too mate, cheers
---
Yes, after your edit it says weekends and week nights. We both know what it said before the edit.
---
It was a joke but.. Alliance
---
But nobody cares
---
I got rank 14 last time around.
---
Yes and no.
---
People get better, so off-specs become more accepted and people start building off-specs cos they don't need the T1 gear anymore. So it's easier to get into raids as an off-spec like feral or boomkin cos the raid is just easier and gear is less fought for.
---
BUT, you also run into gearing problems, as the classes that scale better start outstripping the others, so you're simultaneously getting better gear, while also falling behind the better classes.
---
What might change everything is if TBC is introduced as they've been hinting at, but that's years away.
---
Omg thank you so much for reminding me of that sweet sweet weapon
---
Just completed it on my level 35 Warrior and it was because a level 51 Mage was hanging around and helped out.  I just stood there as a meat shield for 20-30 seconds while the Mage killed it.
---
I hate when this shit happens to me but if it helps this guy... that’s the bigger plus here.
---
I got a good life outside wow.. but I feel bad for these people, but damn if I still am not pissed at the douchery
---
Good god I remember being so enthralled by the Worgen city that was in WotLK but not accessible
---
The age old sunder timer is a classic but only works with warriors. It's useless if a paladin, druid or something else is tanking.
---
&gt;If you then see that person get attacked by the opposite faction and you sit there and watch
---
Ah a fellow Alliance player I see
---
I understand that, but my point is that we pay for time to play the game and we’re not receiving thattime for one reason or another.  For the record, I went on a new server already.  I took measures to be able to play and avoid queue times.
---
thats...not why people use alt codes.
---
the reason is that the name they want is taken, so they used alt codes to get the name they want with an alternate spelling
---
I actually got excited when I misread "buff limit" as "Debuff limit" because then I could've viably played shadow priest in classic raiding...
---
No source, but layering works by splitting up the existing community into multiple instances. So if you have 6000 players on 3 layers that's 2000 players per layer. Removing those layers does neither increase or decrease any population numbers, it just puts all those players into the same instance.
---
You are a genius.
---
I tries to think of a funny punchline until I realised I was reading it. Lmao!
---
Don't forget the fact that the ones who have already downed Ragnaros pretty much prepared for it on private servers for the last few years.
---
Regular aiding guilds will still take some time to go through all of MC, and won't down Ony at first try probably.
---
People should just stop comparing themselfes to the top 0.5% (if even) of the players.
---
I had a tank way back in the day and I didnt mind it but I wasnt the best at it. I also had a hard time keeping aggro for like 4 to 5 mobs especially when DPS wouldn't focus on one.. if I had more confidence in it I'd go with a tank class again.
---
1) Not sure what you mean about numbers
---
2) Yes this is one of the biggest drawbacks. Elv (the big brother) has a much better nameplate targeting marker. I've thought about backporting it to Tuk

&gt; This is a subject that has been asked about several 4.5k times 885 recently 1.2k, and we want to clarify some of the details surrounding it. Like many aspects of the game, Alterac Valley was tuned and adjusted in different ways from patch to patch in 2005-2006.
---
&gt; First and foremost, we’re planning to use the 1.12 version of Alterac Valley. For many parts of the game like this, we’re picking an original WoW patch that gives us the most clarity for WoW: Classic, and 1.12 is that patch.
---
&gt; In Alterac Valley, that puts us before the introduction of reinforcements. It puts us before the removal of all of the Commanders and Lieutenants. The only win conditions are the killing of Drek’thar in Frostwolf Keep or Vanndar Stormpike in Dun Baldar.
---
&gt; It gives us several early improvements to the BG that we’re glad to have in place. Early on in AV, there were too many NPCs and they were too hard to kill. By 1.12, many had been removed and NPC health was brought down to a reasonable level. Turning in armor scraps is an encouraged, supportive activity by this point. Many capture points (mostly graveyards) had been moved away from their initial placements to gain better balance across the map. Korak the Bloodrager was removed, and killing opposing players no longer drops items like Dwarf Spines, Orc Teeth, or Human Bone Chips. Gross.
---
&gt; In our content plan update 2.8k, we mentioned that we’re still working out exactly how and when PvP elements of Classic will roll out. We’ll update you on that here very soon.

retail has armor more gender neutral in style. how does that not make sense?
---
Both.
---
1. Shows the loottable. What each boss drops.
---
2. Maps show they layout/map of the dungeon. Helpful for dungeons like Gnomeregan, that are a maze.
---
When I was tanking Gnomeregan a few levels back we just did it the old school style with one pack at a time, some markers and not more than 2-3 mobs to tank at a time. Steady stream of small packs and we cleared it quite fast despite being quest runs. 
---
After that I actually had people tell us what a smooth and nice run it was compared to other groups.
---
My server has a notorious noob killing undead mage called Bass - everyone else was getting pissed off at him nut it made a great moment today when the entire pop of Lakeshire teamed up to take him down and succeeded
---
I dont disagree with this at all and it has nothing to do with my point
---
I think you don't. 
---
10 layers capability,  7 layers full would equate to something like medium or high.
---
Where if the total layer capability was only 7, then the server would be full.
---
It's pretty fucking simple really.
---
Orc hunter would be nuts with this. Almost a 50% chance to completely resist a stun.
---
at least warriors dont shine in anything until way late game w/ all epics
---
Well they won't read your request if you only post it here
---
That’s just bs.
---
Rogues are needed for melee cleave too. Most teams take two warriors but also have to take a rogue or feral in order not to rage starve a third warrior. 
---
That way if you count dungeon levelling rogue would be faster again because the early level rogues are definitely faster with sinister strike.
---
If you now say not every rogue will get a slot. So will Warriors.
---
You can just right click them in chat and report player. You don't need to copy their name. Blizz fixed the issue with it being more difficult to report alt character names a while ago.
---
Fordring quests in EPL
---
This one works for me: https://i.imgur.com/cBvRz8g.jpg
---
Oh hell yeah that's nice to know. Will make running my slower buddies through dungeons when they hit max a lot easier.
---
Timed vanish and cheap shot. Get a spell tick timer if you need one. It can be done.
---
Sometimes we just luck and forget we aren't in any form. Then we quickly go into the form and lick again, to make up for it!
---
And melee cleaves are almost always with a 2H war...
---
Your fun game is what you make it
---
Rogues unlock our boxes for us :)
---
Just because someone put it for 1000 g it doesn't mean that it was bought. Plot twist, it wasn't. People don't have this kind of gold to spend and are not stupid enough to do so.

I've never played wow before but my 1st PvP experience was 2 seperate ?? Undead rogues in the span of 2 mins pretty much one shot me then spit on my corpse and spin around so I've devoted my little night elf life too exterminate them on site
---
Dude. I’m on rattlegore.
---
No worries, somewhere someplace a bunch of high-level horde are griefing low-level Alliance.
---
As a Lvl 27 Warlock I feel bad that I don’t get to buff as good as the others...SO just some light humor I buff them with underwater breathing for 10 and people usually stop and laugh while walking down a dry ass zone... or killing mobs in a tiny pond.. hahaha I get a small laugh watching their response..but for the ones who stop me to laugh and/or say thanks...I trade them a minor health stone...
---
Hey man. Having 50+gold individually is no problem. I have had a steady 50g and some others I know 100+ and i am lvl 40 and the others about 50 range. 
---
Pooling now is only for epics, everyone can buy the other ahit like mooncloth. Its selling like butter on firemaw.
---
You pay for entrance to the servers...
---
Blizzard warned people to roll on. Less populated realms, they said there would be several hours queues.
---
I play on ZT and have little to no queue, plenty of people and a very good experience with everything.
---
Absolutely man.  Before it was released i was not entirely sure if it was just mainly nostalgia.  But seruiously, i am lvl 24 now, and i am just having so much fun. And already i am looking forward to play new classes and even play as a NE again at some point.  Man i am going to be here for a hell of a long time to come.  Absolutely reminds me why i started playing WoW in the first place. Retail doesn't even come remotely close.   
---
Doing stuff together with strangers again, the satisfaction to get those first grey shoulders, the joy for each upgrade, the wider skillset, the runs on foot, big pvp battles, actually dying again as it is not just a mindless dull AoE grind fest, professions that matter and have depth and specializations, having to share loot and not just been given free handouts just for attending, seeing a ton of people,  random acts of kindnes be it with food, buffs or taking on a mob, getting an invite for a boss, the sense of zones as you spend actual time in it.  Just a more alive world! Just absolutely fantastic.
---
Hmm you agree that it may be an issue then if _alot_ of people are posting about it then?
---
I never got above level 45 in vanilla, only hit max for the first time in TBC so I never saw this. Never knew the portal was blue in vanilla

Discord starts to shit the bed at around 15+ people.

Druids don't *swing weapons* while in furry forms, so they cannot take advantage of Windfury. That said, it's not like the strength or agility totems aren't good; Windfury is just OP. But that warrior tank can't AOE tank as easily nor heal himself, you, or a critical member of your party in a pinch. And you certainly won't get Innervate either.
---
I started as a spriest, got to 16 and rerolled warrior.
---
About to hit 30 and it’s been rough, but much more fun and the payoff will be great

I am guarantee to die 2-4 times trying to get to the dungeon cause there is so much horde camping.
---
They should always have mana because of how terrible and boring focus is. Idc about lore, getting artificially capped on how much burst you can do was awful.
---
This sounds like Failbook posts from Walmart customer service complaints. "Customer is always right!" (even when it makes no sense) etc.
---
No, they are not obligated to offer refunds because you happened to roll your character on the same realm as 10000 others who want to play on the same time, they've already started taking measures (free migration), maintenance is just a normal part of the game.

---
I mean if a druid is tanking, threat isn't really an issue anymore past the first 10 seconds. Fire away!
---
Why would fighting scripted images ever be hard? If you want something hard and unpredictable - play against real players.
---
1. You don't need to be prot specced as a warrior to tank in dungeons while leveling. You also don't need to specced into healer while leveling to heal in dungeons. The best healer I group with is shadow spec. As for your solution, after lvl 36 warrior has all the aoe they need with whirlwind, cleave, thunderclap, demoralizing shout, even battle shout generates threat, sweeping strikes, challenging shout, and retaliation.
---
2. I feel like it's not hard to learn what to do to tank in these situations: experiment, ask questions, research and learn your class. Tanks are among the most demanded role for dungeon groups. As for your solution nerfing the exp severely would mean NO ONE would run dungeons that don't have end game BiS or twink BiS. 
---
In conclusion the game is fine, just adapt to it.
---
wait what
---
I would agree with you if Battle for Azeroth wasn't the first expansion that I was not subscribed for. And I really don't care what the content is, I was subscribed for the entirety of WoD. Azerite, Artifacts, I don't care. If my class isn't fun and deep to play, it doesn't matter what the content is. 
---
It makes me upset to think about how precious my retail characters are and how much I do not enjoy playing them. I can't describe it properly, I'm not very good with words, but I don't feel like I'm playing WoW anymore. I want to play both, and I will if classes feel like they once did. There's a sense of character and feeling that I don't have with any of my classes anymore.
---
Spellbooks, damage, scaling, there's so much wrong with the game and it's far from an RPG. I feel like I'm playing an instance simulator. Battlegrounds are dull, the world feels choked, there's so much wrong with the game and I wish it wasn't. I purchased a Tabard of Frost and Tier 3 on retail years ago on three of my characters. I love them. Yet it is just not enjoyable to play them, it sucks. 
---
I thought to myself a few years ago now, that if Vanilla WoW ever came out I was going to play my retail characters in PvP/Raiss and Classic on the side. And I still want to do that, I stare at my old characters in their transmogs I worked (years) on hopeful to play them again.
---
Since you seem to be a bit dense—or at a minimum, ignorant—secondary professions (cooking, fishing, first aid) cannot be trained to artisan until you’re level 35 and 225 skill. At which point, you have to complete a quest to be rewarded with the artisan skill. Having any of those professions parked at 225 when you ding 35 is a accomplishment to some degree.
---
Primary crafting professions require level 35 and (I think) 200 skill to train artisan (which costs 5g before your faction discount). Having a crafting profession that highly leveled that early in game is, again, an accomplishment.
---
Now go troll somewhere else.
---
Hah, while i'm tanking i don't bring the other warriors along so i get all the loot :)
---
COPE. LOL.
---
I've also had many experiences where that's completely different I can name 2 names where we q together still and q in dungeons. I guess it just depends
---
Irrelevant question but what do you do as a mage vs a hunter? Kill the pet?
---
Sure go play retail, basically same shit there
---
If it's more than 3 mobs I'll usually charge, thunder clap, berserker rage, and then spam demo/shield block. Revenge when I can and cleave for rage dumps. Always save rage for shield block and try and use berserker rage on CD of you don't need to use it to break a fear or something.
---

Why is this on r/classicwow?

That’s one way to work towards your mount I guess. Must have plenty of RL cash. Is he multi boxing his levelling toons also? What sort of tip is he earning?
---
Nah man. Ask Jeeves closed in 2010. RIP
---
60 rogue here. Spamming dungeons to 60, no selling stuff on AH, not buying skills I dont need. I had 600 gold when I hit 60, spamming dungeons on 60, got like 100g a day from just greedrolls and trash items, 3 days after 60 I got epic mount... some luck involved sure. But still no mage aoe farmer.
---
No,  we as a group need to make sure getting wiped is as low as possible, sometimes it need strategic way to do it in low lvl, sometime u need to regain your mana between pulls.
---
DKs are dumb.
---
General community in Classic has been really great personally. Maybe like 1 in 50 are douchebags
---
&gt;shun these people off the server
---
Good luck with that.
---
What heals?
---
I'm talking aura, blessing, judgements, nightfall, T1 set bonus, short-term powerful buffs (freedom, sacrifice, protection), powerful stun, another short-term cc in form of repentance as well as a fear against undead (Rarely useful, but well it's there). And two big cooldowns for a massive instant heal with lay on hands and divine intervention for wipe recovery.
---
It's really not worth it because everybody wants it right now so those awesome camps where you can average crazy good exp per hour are all contested
---
Ahhh, the great (Can only use) Outdoors!!!!
---
Sounds like you should play elsewhere
---
8500 online? yeah that would be bogus.  But generally, as in characters rolled, not just online? I don't that as unrealistic
---
Came here to say this. He did you a favor, really.
---
Yeah, especially since melee cleave is ungodly. Four Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind going off at once is so much fun to be a part of.
---
Well guess you didn't waist anytime with that guild. Poor leadership
---
Holy shit what did you keep that was more valuable than dropping eng and re-leveling it?
---
Why is it that PVP realms have more Horde than Alliance? Does it have something to do with Horde Racials? 
---
It's the same on my server (Arugal-OC), somewhere around 65/35, but I've always wondered why. 
---
I'm questing in Ashenvale as Alliance at the moment and boy you can tell there's an imbalance (or maybe its just that it's right next to the Barrens).
---
"hey man, come play on the server I'm on, more always dominate the horde and raid Org every weekend" and on the flipside "hey man, come play on the server I'm on, more always dominate the Alliance and raid Stormwind every weekend" So friends bring friends others over to populated servers.
---
If an item is a minor to medium upgrade for me, but pre raid BiS for someone else, it would be really really shitty of me to role on it. And it's pretty shitty of you two if you do that.
---
I mean, I rolled a mage without knowing anything about the AoE farming thing and I usually prefer running dungeons with a diverse group. But it is nice having the option to do the aoe thing when I want to bang out a leve or two quickly. I get sick of it kinda quick though, and certainly would never leave a group that wasn't getting max xp/hr as long as it was goin smooth.
---
Nice closing statement bro
---
You are 35.
---
Why do pservers with peak 1k players have less queue time than official servers with max population?
---
And that's easy to do things as a group when you are playing with friends, playing with people who you know and have played with before. It's harder to do when it's people you have just met
---
You can always go Holy and be actually viable.

I think the commenter was asking why people are asking for it to be nerfed.

I just wanna hug them so hard I squish them is that okay? If they get hurt I’ll just polymorph them back to full health!
---
&gt; If not for my guild not wanting to transfer I would have transferred long ago.
---
This 100x this. All these idiots are literally trying to lure people to a dead server so their miserable lonely existance can be more tolerable.
---
propably from private realms, got his method from last 15 years
---
Sounds like you found the hell-mouth.
---
'organized' may be the wrong word. It's not (or not often) a coordinated effort by a gigantic group of people, but more like 3rd party surveys (like on this sub) and census addons, and the like.
---
People see that their faction has an advantage on this or that server and so decide to roll on that server, furthering the imbalance. Many people (myself included) prefer being on a server that has a lot of potential groupmates for them.
---
I’m actually curious about this as well, we know the /sit does not work at all because it wasn’t ever supposed to but when I tried the spec out it didn’t even seem like the standard mob crit hits were proccing it either
---
Agree 💯
---
As a human mage, I do this all the time! However if attacked I will not hesitate to kill you on sight
---
&gt; "I'm *paying* for the game" 
---
Oh my god. You are *actually paying* for the game!? 
---
You want to be treated differently because you are paying for the game. Guess what? So does everyone else. 
---
That's like the epitome of having your own head up your own arse.
---
Probably because they would rather pay for their own server than become the product.
---

---
If you want a more homogeneous class group then go to retail. 
---
Warlocks aren't complaining about not tanking like warriors can, dont complain about not aoe'ing like a lock (even though warrior massively out dps locks single target..)
---
But I bet you still need to rent a server? :) That's another thing discord offers for free to anyone.
---
You just have to get lucky. :)

There's nothing stopping you from Rolling another character on a different server to see what it is like.
---
there is no faction loyalty.  if there was why would my fellow hordie loot the chest while he sees me killing the mobs guarding it and then runs off without so much as dropping a dot in the mob. sometimes the red lettered player next to you is more your friend then the green lettered one.
---
these people are freaks who i wouldnt associate with in real life
---
Near total absence of difficult mechanics or mechanics at all. It is just numbers and gearing.
---
Welcome to classic bud. This isnthe way it was then too.  Don't roll on pvp servers is my only advice if this bothers you.
---
I like doing regular group dungeons as well. The aoe thing is nice to bang out some levels quickly, and I won't deny it is nice always having ppl want me in groups. On the downside, there is a million mages, so it will make end game harder I imagine. Thankfully I'm in a guild with people I played vanilla with so that shouldn't matter too much.
---
Using odd things as tanks works well in lower levels. Always has. Like shaman, lock and hunter pets, or druids/warriors/pally who aren't spec'd for it. (Rogue with evasion tends to work well for a short while on high level bosses.) But as you go up higher it becomes less viable and the times you still could become more dangerous of a wipe.
---
Then at max level it becomes fairly impossible in most cases. (Especially if you happen to snag more than you wanted from something like a patrol.) Unsure about in vanilla and BC but I used to tank and heal 5 man heroics in WotLK as a holy pally. Though that took me having good gear to sustain the extra spell casts and damage. Druids are often able to be an improvised tank at higher level if they have to and aren't spec'd for it.
---
Yeah you can, with the judgment cd. But since you have no aoe you'll need to ask the mage to sheep an elite, and if you have a lock remind him every pull to only dot the guy you are hitting
---
It does not
---
No one with half a brain does 3 mages and a tank, just do 4 mages and frost kite lol

You realize Victory rush works in PVP right? Which is multiplayer? 
---
Also NOW your using tuned correctly. Because your now saying it’s balanced/tuned towards single player by victory rush being so good during leveling. However your still wrong about it being tuned towards single player, since the game is entirely balanced around arenas and high end Raiding.
---
You don't. 
---
Layering takes the total capacity and splits it into layers so that the total capacity isn't interacting with each other.  That way the zones don't have thousands of people running about and instead has multiple layers of hundred of people.
---
I feel attacked

They don't even have to have a pet anymore. And they can shoot a bow point blank, no distance needed. Now you can draw you bow in someone's face. Like pew-pew
---
Reading this kid’s comments lol. What a freak.
---
I'm mainly tanking as a druid but have done some dps runs too. As a cat I'm well aware that I can drop an opener and pull off the tank and I deserve to die for that. Every dps should be aware of dps control and none should have the expectation that a tank is going to save them from unreasonable actions. I will do my best but inevitably the healer trying to keep an over zeolous dps alive is going to pull agro and that healer is my priority.
---
They typically aren’t great at pvp. Just kill the main one then they freak out
---
Wow, I hope that guild tánks.
---
Thanks for this insight, *fatdap*.
---
Yeah, maybe... lol
---
eh, i don't like pets AI. It's terrible even on retail.
---
Rogue here. If you think YOU hate rogues, then you should ask a rogue player how much they hate other rogues. Seriously, every rogue has some weird vendetta against other rogues as if they need to prove some weird point.
---
Also, I don't want to gank you. Just sap you so you're forced to witness my /dance moves.

Nothing except my motivation. As I said, right now my guild is the only thing that really keeps me going. Its a fun bunch and I am an officer as well.

Maybe as a paid transfer later on. Transfering to another language server were only possible when they made them originally (russia, spain etc)

You may try a ticket tho, but dont have your hopes up too high.

Are you alliance or horde?  Either way start ony attunement now.  Also grab the mc attunement quest for brd and do it, if you haven’t already.  If you want to, you could also do the quest for the scholomance key.  And as the other commenter mentioned - do the tyrion fordring questline.

How are we supposed to know it's a Horde heavy server until well after release? I still don't know if my server is. I'd assume it is, but I have no real way of knowing and how extreme that ratio is or is not.
---
I thought it was Horde heavy until I got to neutral zones and saw 30 allies and no horde around, then I assumed maybe it was my layer. Does blizzard release these numbers? Also what about people who are already 60?
---
I think his point is because everyone acts like classic is some magical thing, where as you could just think of it as the xpac after BFA, it's just a remastered one for the xpac.
---
Man I want to know how the guy feels they said this on blizzcon. What a shill.

I wonder how many retarded anecdotal posts I'll have to read like this from both sides

Pretty impressive to be at prebis 2 weeks into the life span of the game.
---
Another fun fact; in the WoW beta back in 2003~ the devs used this dark portal model to mark where dungeons would be. One of the most hidden and still unexplained ones was under the water in the middle of Ashara. Some people think it could have been a raid while others think it was planned to be a battleground, hence the very few quests in the zone.
---
60:40 is manageable but 90:10 is not. How are we supposed to know what our specific server is?
---
The only *real* problem I have with them is how prevalent they are. They don't really interfere with my experience if they are just doing their own thing, but once you hit a certain bracket 80% of dungeon groups are all just AoE farms. Its bad enough I struggle to find groups for regular runs sometimes. 
---
I imagine that will smooth out in a few months once all the power leveling is out of the way, but eh. Agitating is probably the word, yeah.

You can easily keep mining and engineering forever. You don't need to switch if you like to pvp. I would just get used to pick pokcet farming. Preferable in a spot where you can farm nodes aswell. Should allow you to keep your pvp oriented professions and get a good gold income at the same time

CLASSIC IS THE SAME AS RETAIL:
---
Here's three reasons of how it's different.
---
It's called a tankini!
---
You probably have vent issues... get it checked maybe. I have a non-tb base model from 2017 and I can play for 10 hours with no breaks and it barely heats up.
---
I think they're generated by rng on things like dot ticks. Not sure, though. I only briefly logged into it and was confused by all the changes lol.
---
Double gathering is the way to go. The economy in classic is nothing like it was in Vanilla during its hay day. Everything is super expensive and people are still living up.
---
U bad
---
 When you're healer you feel like there are no tanks around, and when you're a tank it feels like nobody wants to play healer. Play what you want to play.
---
But orc and tauren ladies are great!
---
Early bird bonus is huge. If you get ahead of the curve and know what to take advantage of there are a lot of opportunities to make easy money. I saw tons of things where I could have gotten rich if I were in a better spot at the but I just couldn't do them. Getting gold early to buy underpriced BoEs is particularly huge. I saw tons of really good items being sold for pennies compared to what they are being sold for now. Anyone that had 50g to snag them up when I was sitting on 2g got rich.
---
News flash he's just riding out the hype and doing w/e he wants until the hype dies down.  He doesn't even like raiding and is probably wishing he could just run around and do random shit like farm mounts.
---
Eh, tbf, while the number of spells have gone down since the spec-rework, because you no longer have access to off-spec abilities, the number of spells you actually use in a fight have increased more than twofold for probably all classes.
---
I'm peeved that the Org bank, unlike every other bank I've yet to encounter, doesn't let you immediately into your bank. Instead you have to talk to the teller and say you want in your bank.

I'm a dps warrior. If I take hits, I die (haven't put anything into tank skills from warrior trainer or lvl up). Can someone please confirm whether my life decisions were poor or not?

---
Enchanters too. So annoying I specd tailor ench and have to sell 95% of what I make to a vendor.
---
There's item restoration on the website now ya know
---
This is a patch before we got stealth detect but I can still build the powerful PVP build I used to have I think retail hunters are far inferior as well as Shaman, Shadow Priests were all much better up to BC.
---
But they can.   
---
Lionheart 500g.
---
Devilsaur 400g.
---
Arcanite Reaper 800g.
---
Edgemasters 500g (currently, will go up to1.200 later).
---
You really can waste a lot of gold on BoE and crafted gear and it's great.
---
Tank needs to lead the group, mark targets and initiate pulls. Communicate with your group and tell them you are going to lead. Do readychecks if you aren't sure if your healer is ready.
---
OK.
---
I know the exact feeling. I have a level 28 druid now that has been at that level for about a week now, if not longer.  I've had to accept that I just don't have as much time to play as most, but real life comes first. 
---
It can be a little disheartening when you keep reading those "world first this..." posts and everyone getting their dream weapons / pets whatever. But like many here have already pointed out, it's important to enjoy the journey. I've actually been taking the time to read the quests and working on my professions as a chug along, but it really does make for an entirely different game experience rather than grinding along and "ignoring the scenery". You might only level to 60 one time, enjoy it.
---
It's useless
---
And do you do that in raiding spec?
---
I enjoy vanilla/classic at 60, I hate leveling. 
---
Retail at max level is shit.
---
Humans are basically dogs
---
-have legs
---
-eat and drink
---

---
People who make these posts are in for one hell of a shock @60.
---
Classic isn't balanced, 1.12 is closer to it than anything before it but it's still an absolute mess and we've had 15 years to optimize it. 
---
* There are classes that are spec locked @60, you won't be raiding as anything other than Y spec unless you run with friends.  
---
* There are classes that simply don't level fast, and classes that outpace everyone else by quite a large margin depending on the content you intend to do (i.e hunter solo leveling is actual days faster than paladin solo leveling).  
---
* There are classes that will absolutely crush you in PvP pretty much regardless of skill level whilst you have zero ability to do anything but watch yourself die repeatedly.
---
* At 60, unless you're forming a group yourself, you're going to find yourself locked out of a TON of groups because of the gear you wear, you may find yourself kicked after being invited because someone points out you share BiS, etc.
---
That is classic, there's no "everyone is welcome regardless of class/specc" WHILST ALSO being optimal, that is literally impossible and doesn't even exist in retail, nor ever has.
---
Sidenote: Whats with the trend of the people making these threads having the mentality "I have to play optimally but i don't enjoy this type of optimal play so please change it to something else", if you aren't enjoying it just don't do it. A fuck ton of us are avoiding them and making our own, so what it's slower? So is being a paladin, etc.

Layers aren't the same.  
---
Quick lesson on layers.
---
Let's use 1000 people here.
---
1000 people across 10 layers = 100 people per "instance"
---
If they remove 5 layers there will now be 200 people per instance.   Population cap remains at 1000 people and all players are distributed across less instances.
---
It's that simple.  Layers don't relate to population caps.  They are simply a system to distribute the population across instances to reduce congestion in zones.  
---
As players level and leave congested zones and begin to spread the 1000 people around higher level zones they can reduce layers to basically "refill" less congested zones with a higher percentage of the 1000 people.
---
Hope that makes sense.  Pass it along.
---
But have you ever seen a mailman?

can you equip this robe if you crafted it when you were tailor but unlearned tailoring ?
---
Wasn't APES kill of Ragnaros sub 5 minutes? Without a full raid, questing greens and half the raid not even at 60?
---
Is that true? I'm genuinely trying to find out. I assumed they make money through subscriptions, promotions with studios and through the store? If you have any credible sources I would love to see
---
Hespect
---
Is there anyway to see, how many players per server play? My server is HIGH. What does that mean population wise?
---
far from it
---
I mean the time it would most likely happen would be one month from launch, so in another 2 weeks.  There has to be people who won't want to resub, just depends if that outweighs new players.
---
Rogues engage in surprise content
---
Okay, I was thinking about doing tailoring + enchanting for money then eventually switching to engineering + mining for pvp. Still dont fully understand the pick pocket mechanic. Like I said am noob, so gotta look that up some. Just doesn't seem like I'd get much money from pick pocketing npcs, but I could easily be wrong
---

How is it a big deal? Lore heavy quest chain but gives no unique trinkets or anything as far as I know.
---
But it is true in regards to accessibility.

and at 40 they learn Innervate and can help you pay off your mortgage.

can you still equip and unequip it after ditching tailoring ?

Er, sorry. Not view distance. Camera distance. Bad wording on my part.

On private servers where battle shout worked like after that change, battle shout spam was the go-to on group pulls over tab sundering. It's going to be less threat for sure but you're still going to be spamming a shout.

Spirit tap is luckily designed so that it doesnt matter whether you cast before, after or during spirit tap. As long as time spent outside the 5second rule is maximized in both cases. You will lose "1x your regen" for 5 seconds in both cases, resulting in the same amount of mana "lost" on casting.
---
Is this real? Paying to join a guild and then boasting about it is pathetic.

I'm not entirely sure what the joke is here.

Layers are holding (up to) a server's population of players.
---
A layer at max capacity doesn't *just* add more players -- there is no room. Those players get queued instead.
---
Lets say you have 6 buckets 1/2 way full. In this example, the buckets are layers and the water inside are players.
---
Then you remove 3 of the buckets -- putting that liquid in the three remaining buckets. Now you have 3 *full* buckets.
---
If you have 3 buckets completely full -- you don't add more water. You wait until they drain to add more. This is how the queues have been the entire time on 'Full' servers.

Wasn't the group leader, They where asking for tank in stormwind chat, this was my 2nd run, the first one we only died once due to glitch pull at DEADMINES

The second one we got wiped 5 times and one healer quit because "he was in a hurry" like retail hurry and we didn't even find the first boss in stockade dungoen, I was telling them to how not to pull huge mobs at once so we won't get wiped stupidly, when we finished this hell of dungoen run I get called a cry baby 😂
---
You snooze you lose.
---
It was easy because all players in your raid are hardcore gamers, including the non guildies. If you are lvl 60 in MC after 3 weeks you are by definition among the 1%. So most if not all in your group had lots of experience and knew what to do.
---
Come back in 3 months when casuals hit 60 and you will see some wipes in MC.
---
Because of the way private servers handle making BGS.  Also Pserver players arre definitely more hardcore than the people who didnt play pservers, so they were most likely on the server to pvp and always queued up.
---
if you care so much then you should really tell blizzard to shove it by quitting.  
---
its the only option you have.
---
well, technically you could also keep whining about it.
---
Yeah i was definitely in love with the pvp. That was the shit.
---
It may be that my experience with early group content was so bad because the other people already had a lot of experience and could basically do the content without me so i felt a little useless... Like i had no place in the group. Fyi, all the other players were specced for dps, i was the only one filling a more supporting role as an elementalist.
---
Aux works too. You can get it on twitch
---
Bad wording on my part. I meant camera distance. But you're right. Mob render distance and name plate distance are not great.
---
I see, thanks!
---
The ones I've done we've been slow and methodical. The people who play classic like it's retail is going to have a bad time.
---
Intercept is still a possibility though, no? And you exit combat fairly quickly if the target goes far enough
---
What's the warlock's role in this setup? I mean, why not 4 mages then?
---
Indeed guilds with 20-25 active players seem to care more about guild members. Yesterday I organised SFK run as. Lvl 25 alliance feral tank. We had a 30 priest from our guild, lvl 24 mage a 25 ret pally and rogue 24 a friend of mine. We encountered Horde in Arathi as expected, but in the southshore our group was wiped by 3 horde groups. So big deal, but no mage started blaming rogue for delay and possibly thinking of ganking someone, when in reality rogue just crawled in stealth to avoid fights. Mage started whining and lef group near silverpine forest. We managed to get to SFK belated 3 bosses after what pally said he is sleepy and all such stuff. He just got his quest item and didn't seemed interested to continue the run. I am gonna close up SFK today, but zerg guild me and friend joined seem to have a lot of these whiny mages.
---
Some are the other way around.
---
I am farming the lvl 28-31 harpies in Thousand Needles. Lvl 25 mage rolls up and invites me. I decline, cause I dont want to farm for two people together with an underleveled guy, he invites me 4 more times before calling me an asshole and promptly ignoring me.
---
So, yeah.
---
Agreed. Playing ele shaman feels insanely powerful.
---
I think it might be because most hunters (that I have played with anyways) don't bother getting a tank pet. They get pets for better dps or utility. So they don't have they "don't pull aggro" tank pet play that all warlocks have available really early.
---
The point is that you still have access to all those abilities sure you can’t out tank a warrior but when things get hairy you can still innervate the heals or offheal yourself. We also have a super handy brez. Min maxing isn’t the point of classic, cooperation and decision making is.
---
Everyone thought we were getting DDOSd. It was actually Blizzard trying to purge the servers of these demon bugs.
---
This is why I'm using CharacterStatsClassic instead. Looks like a part of the vanilla ui
---
YES. so use the PRINT SCREEN function. I don't know why that's so hard.
---
Your first suggestion was to change class aoe abilities...
---
You doing less Aoe damage than a caster isn't comparable to having to click a chest 1000 times. I ran a dungeon the other day where an enhance sham had that whirlwind weapon, he tripled my dps. I wont be calling for nerfs/changes because I dont want to undermine the integrity of classic and the hard work that a dedicated few put in to revive the game. I'm reaping the rewards of their hard work. 
---
I hope blizzard put their foot down and just keep classic as it is. Release content as per the phases and then walk away from the game (other than bug fixes) and let the whiners quit out.
---
Rogue is a great pvp class but your leveling is absolute garbage. Not as bad as warriors though
---
imagine having your own office...
---
Astranaar is only connected via auberdine. It would be slightly quicker if you got the point in azshara
---
Just read that article through Facebook.
---
Resisted the urge to comment there as most pc gamers content is complete junk anyway, but yeah.
---
They Clearly don't get why people wanted classic at all...
---
Best to ignore click/outrage-bait.
---
You told them you were going to mark targets and initiate all the pulls and they just kept fucking around and getting y'all killed? Definitely just /ignore them and move on
---
Thanks for the input. I probably wouldn't bother duo leveling, or well, who knows really. I am mainly looking for pros of just having a level 60 mage and possibly other alts on a secondary account. If I end up going this route maybe I'll try duo leveling too.
---
That's the one I meant. Just tried it and no luck :/
---
Didn't know it a two L in english. Now I know !
---
When he wrote rogue he got ganked.
---
Because u need to build threat high enough so you won't Lose it easily
---
U pull 2 and one retard dps pull 5 more. FML
---
As a rogue I agree with a rogue statement
---
Paint isn’t dye, or even close to it. If you want to shit on protesters that’s fine but at least make an argument about [uranine](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/environment_activists-dye-river-limmat-green-in-zurich/45218254), which is what they actually used.
---
Ambush + backstab with a perdition blade. Mad skill
---
It is. Basically just go there and run in. Especially on a pve server you don't even have to worry about beeing ganked. 
---
The only downside is, that you can not get the quests.
---
This is a really good point.  Unless it was night and slower chat, but I know how fast world chat can go.
---
Again, very good point I had not considered.
---
Where the fuck did he mention pendulum of doom?
---
My experience is that mages and hunters are the bigger problem. I might be too risky of a target as a warrior for the rogues though.
---
I'm not even sorry for doing that lmao
---
Gives pre bis for at least some (maybe all) classes
---
All the people that talk in my guild, I know their names well. Dude is a bit too disconnected from his guildies.
---
Are you a masochist lol  
---
Lowkey, I felt that image in my soul
---
It's Facebook on an MMO basically :(
---
Selling by definition mean someone else buys it. Otherwise it is just offering something
---
Not if you pay
---
Tmrw am off work gonna try be leader and any stupid not being patient gonna get kicked, warrior needs dem gold 😭.
---
You can talk via bnet in WoW, it comes up as bright blue text. If you have bnet friends it'll default to messaging them in that way if you start the message from your friends list. I'd link a pic but I'm lazy.
---
His brief description of himself says he enjoys long grinding. But he complained about vanilla grinding.
---
What an utter moron.
---
4h queue on EU yesterday
---
This is beyond brilliant.
---
This is what I've bene missing. Playing Aion back in the day I love setting up my own little merchant.
---
Amazing, 5/7 perfect score.
---
This is my opinion with no evidence to back it up but I generally think this is super correct. If you have some good dedicated healing pieces to swap in when you want to heal, I think you could heal endgame 5 mans no problem as full shadow
---
The /sit command to get a guaranteed crit was a big on private servers. It was part of early vanilla patches but was hot fixed out very early on. So using /sit to obtain crits does not give stacks of reckoning. You have to receive the stacks fairly.
---
I agree.  And I'll explain it for whoever stumbles over this comment.
---
Layers literally only spread the population across more than one instance of the server.  
---
1000 on 10 layers is 100 per layer ( still 1000 players )
---
They eliminate let's say half of the layers.
---
1000 now on 5 layers is 200 per layer ( still 1000 players )
---
The server population doesn't change.  The amount of players on each instance within said server does.
---
Why don't people understand such a simple concept.
---
Stonespine EU, Alliance side.
---
Do we outnumber alliance that badly? I really hope not that’s no fun for anyone. I just picked the server my friends were on my dude and have been on my priest the whole time. I too, find that I can’t sell my fish lol
---
It is a direct response to "layering has nothing to do with server cap." That was your point, along with the Blizz post trying to show evidence that it was just for the starting zones.
---
Literally no one is perpetuating that layering somehow magically enhances physical server limitations. We are saying that *artificial* limitations are being placed that are  directly related to and correlating with the removal of layers.
---
You just wait. They are pushing WAY more people into the server with layering, and when they need to remove it, it will result in HUGE spike (again) in the queues. Hopefully some of the more casuals have quit by then.
---
If you write in chat that X is a douche-bag/ninja-looter or something, I am more likely to ignore you than the one you ratted on.
---
Sure, I dont like assholes, but they exist, just deal with it. Our tank needed the helm from the last  boss in Gnomeregan last night, most likely just out of spite, and while that was annoying, its nothing I cant handle, and I wont spam out calling him a ninja-looter for some standard shit.
---
Thats just petty
---
What other mace would you recognize from ulduman?
---
REEEE STOP RUINING YOUR AUTHENTIC CLASSIC EXPERIENCE GO SLOG THROUGH FIFTEEN DAYS PLAYED OF QUESTING AND MOB GRINDING IN SILITHUS
---
Kill all alliance ;)
---
I don't *entirely* have a problem with each class having access to some essential things.    
---
I really dislike that warlocks don't have consistent access to an interrupt. Largely it's irrelevant in a group play setting, but if you are running around leveling it becomes annoying to have some mob with a healing spell on a low CD that just heals back up if you're not dealing heavy enough damage. That's personal taste though. 
---
I do think that all classes should be viable for all content. Obviously if you're pushing bleeding edge content it's a different story, but I remember periods where shamans where entirely undesirable for raiding content beyond having one around for lust/hero. I remember having my hunter be so garbage compared to other classes in raids that I finished leveling a druid tank so I could see content. If everyone can do everything to at least a decent level it means you don't get left out for choosing the wrong class at character creation.
---
Dot
---
Dispell curse
---
Yeah, the reality is, two accounts is only good form simultaneous play.  I intent to have my kid play casually with me, but he isn’t as dedicated so I am leveling them myself.  I let him wander IF. ;). Can’t get into toooo much trouble.
---
Does this only work for casters?
---
&gt;Warriors are great and take the hits
---
Warriors can also be angry as fuck and smash everything. They can also tank in DPS spec. Warriors are fucking great.
---
All the servers
---
Best game is the one you enjoy playing. 
---
I have close friends I've known for years who won't come to classic from retail. But I don't belittle their choice - they're having fun. 
---
It's a game and it's as subjective as anything else in life.
---
That's the plan next time, I will be the leader of the run, and hope finding good people while at it
---
No you're right, rogues are uncounterable and we should all probably just roll rogues
---
Overpopulation is a problem on a lot of servers and spam for AOE groups happens everywhere. This is not soley a Mograine issue
---
Not sure if it's been asked before, but what's the addon that shows all the item levels and extra stats? Thanks! (Gratz on the robe btw!)
---
Gaming journalists are as bad for the industry as lootboxes and live services...
---
SERIOUSLY! Then they nova and the mobs turn and instagib the healer or rogue.
---
Table salt that is toxic to many animals. And Uranin is not harmless. Did you read my comment?
---
I’m 90% sure that layers have nothing to do with maximum server population.
---
Those people belong in retail. They're trying to play classic like it's retail and it's honestly embarrassing. They are probably only playing classic because the streamers are and they don't want to miss out.
---
This is Classic, No Changes!!!
---
First time playing shaman and have no idea how to spec. Right now I'm in enhancement but I'm not sure if this is worth it on the long run. I read that shamans can only raid or do dungeons in the late game when they are resto, is this true?
---
Surely you’d have something worthwhile to post if you spent the extra few hours getting all that to 300 rather than showing us a tapestry of ineptitude and clogging the board?
---
The sword is fast.
---
&gt; More ways to express myself creatively 
---
Yeah, because nobody ever came up with the craziest hybrid builds in classic which _somehow_ worked out completely facemelting.
---
&gt; Better designed dungeon and raid bosses
---
Well, duh. If the author doesn't write better articles after 15 years of writing, there's something wrong.
---
&gt; Classes that have genuine versatility 
---
And who needs that? Every class has a very distinct job in every situation in the game. Some classes can do more than one job good, but overall it's fine.
---
&gt; Quests that don't bore me to death
---
Quest design quite literally stayed the same. Goto X, kill Y, pick up Z. The only main difference to retail is that you can't steamroll through enemy camps in classic when playing alone.
---
I stopped taking hunters since every time I do I regret it. If it isn't their pet pulling everything or them running out of ammo halfway, it's them rolling on things they absolutely do not need. I lost Strike of the Hydra to a hunter. A melee weapon with no stats and just a melee proc. Never again.
---
I'm sorry for the good hunters out there, but it's just a risk I don't want to take anymore.
---
GM is compensating something I guess.
---
WoW Classic brought in loads of new people.
---
Who's to say that Classic+ and TBC wouldn't draw interest from unique groups of people.  Meaning, if they go Classic+ they lose 30% of the playerbase that wanted TBC as the next step.
---
as a mage i watched a lot of epic items , some stats are worse than green items. what is up with the diversity in stats.
---
just looking at the map, most zones have inaccessible sections, zones between zones without tooltips  
---
it was always such a magical and huge world  
---
best part is, it wasnt just a childhood illusion, the world still is huge and i love it, despite most of its secrets spoiled or reworked in later expansions
---
Definitely PvP, but also partake in raids as an alt. Probably in MC when it's being farmed rather than progressed through
---
He said the number of mages doesn't affect when they would pull aggro or something like that
---
I mean at SM if you're going for speed. Comp matters alot. That's just where the meta is going.  I find being a rp pvp has all the things you listed just toned down a bit.
---
Everything.
---
This would just lock out people from playing with their friends.
---
Great idea! Because one streamer ( whom some people find irritatingly stupid ) is flooding classic WoW content, block recommendations altogether!
---
They truly shine in wpvp and duels. But they are not that good in premade bg due to mana issues.
---
Intellect does not provide spell power.
---
Intellect is mana.
---
You want as much spell power as possible.
---
Classic.
---
not impossible, just find decent people to play with and not comp whores. Starting groups yourself helps
---
What level bracket and faction do you play at?
---
Also what a shitty website, i have an ad blocker but still got 4 forced popups and a video that was autoplaying. I can't even imagine what it's like without one.
---
Why hunt with bow and arrow when you can behead the boar with your 2h sword? :D
---
Except you're Robert Baratheon... :P
---
Have you considered not making your grievances public?
---
So stop complaining? What you want us to do about it
---
Rumsey label for 15 stam
---
How many Night Elf Priests are there? I made one on a RP server because NE are my favourite to level and I have already encountered a few people calling me out for not making a dwarf priest... I'm only level 16 and already feel "bad" because I won't have Fear Ward... Actually thinking about rerolling :/
---
I have never understood you people who keybind a, s and d keys
---
&gt;  And one thing that has dramatically improved over the years is Blizzard's ability to make a fun boss fight. 
---
lol if you think facerolling the keyboard is fun........tho most retail players enjoy that
---
Welcome to classic :)
---
Well
---
First aid training
---
I'm horde and level 32. So hitting the areas you mentioned.
---
They stated that they increased the number of layers a server could have in order of to increase the max population of a server.  After they did this, several full pop servers had a drastic reduction in queue time.  
---
The server has a difficult time maintaining information on a very large number of players in one zone.  It can more effectively maintain information on smaller chunks of players separated into layers of the same zone. 
---
You are wrong.
---
I think what they mean to say is that the open world is tuned around solo play. You are supposed to be able to do every single quest by yourself with very little issue on retail.
---
Funny enough I would say retail is tuned entirely around raids and M+. While early WoW was tuned around the open world. That is why questing feels so much better in early WoW but raid balance is lacking; while in retail open world content sucks but raids are fabulous.
---
We really would have not.
---
Thank you. I'm glad it's working well. :)
---
I'm much better at TellMeWhen, so for the Aspects, I have some stuff on TellMeWhen that are a bit more complex, like shows up the Aspect of the Hawk if it's not on, I'm in combat, and the mob is farther away from 5 yards from my character, or show Aspect of the Monkey if the mob is closer than 5 yards, and so on. :)
---
A simple aspect reminder would work, too, of course.
---
Thanks, i will try that one !
---
Bid on it.  You might get lucky.  
---
Maybe as a community we should all get together and make a "bid pact" lol.
---
When ever we see a 1c bid we bid on it.  But don't bid any higher then the next lowest bid.
---
That'll show em.   😂
---
You are publicly stating your opinion in a online line game, they are just doing the same to you.
---
What you mean "these arent serious suggestions" these are great !
---
there is a gate to gilneas in silverpine, go check it out!
---
&gt; I do not care about looks, animations, etc. I only care about maximizing my time and ability to do well with what little time I have
---
Let me explain something to you. Your fear of waking up one day and realizing you dont like the class you leveled, will be 1,000 times more likely to happen if you choose your class "without caring about anything". Your class is you. Your class is the game. You don't choose a class "to be most successful with your time, blah blah blah". You need to do some soul searching bud. The giant newbs on reddit, do not understand that you could pick any class and be successful. They will tell you to roll Hunter or Warlock or Mage every single time. You wanna learn and feel connected to your game? Or you wanna just be told what to roll and blindly follow along like a preschooler being lead across the street? Your call.
---
Your biggest complaint is that you can’t complain?
---
You shouldn’t *expect* to get tipped at all this early. The reward is the skillup.
---
Wait, there is an option in Youtube to block this guy's content? I accidentially watched a few of his videos to understand what the fuss is all about, now I can't get rid of him whenever I want to watch classic wow stuff.
---
Ive seen multiple people with epic mounts on oce arugal server.
---
Not if you actually have good looking transmog sets
---
Agreed.  Also, balance talent trees.
---
A few reasons:
---
1. Computers/Internet is better. Back in the day people took forever to load into anywhere, rand the game at like 10-15 FPS in a raid and dropped out due to lag mid fights.
---
2. Server populations are huge right now, much bigger than any Vanilla population. That and guild charters can also go up to 1000 players. Having a bigger player pool to draw from means you have a much easier time filling 40 slots.
---
3. Players are more aware of information and how to get it. Back in the day, many players just installed WoW and just played the game. They never looked stuff up, used add ons or anything like that. You have to realize the game came out in late 2004, Youtube released in early 2005. Reddit didn't exist. Wikipedia was around, but all the "pedia" offshoots didn't really exist. People got most of their information from the forums if they were into that. But the information players have now is extremely accurate and easy to look up.
---
4. Players are just better than they were back in 2004. Gamers are better. The amount of shit you need to do and keep track of in a retail raid is insane. The average skill of a CoD player today is much higher than the average skill of a CoD player back when Modern Warefare released.
---
5. We are playing on patch 1.12 as a base. This means a lot of things. Maruadon is out. Drop rates for different items have changed.
---
Sell the old enchanting mats as you level away from them. I sold all eventual Magic Essences and they went quite well on the AH.
---
Tailoring: bags. The amount of people that are willing to give good coin for bags at the moment is quite big.
---
You will be able to send your alts boe's and stuff, but unless you enchant it and keep sending new, the leveling experience will still be really hard. Instead of the difficulty being at 10/10 it would be 9/10.
---
I never take a hunter if I have any say about it. They will without fail ninja melee weapons for the stats. However if I needed a ranger weapon as a warrior for the stats they wouldn't like that very much. Ravager doesn't even have stats but I was in a group the other day where a hunter tried to ninja it.
---
Gotta say that isn’t my experience at all. are you alliance? Because with windfury and ravager I outdamage everyone by a long shot. Granted I’m 50 and it’s fallen off now.
---
&gt; Quest design quite literally stayed the same
---
No, now they automatically move you around and baby likes his hand held.
---
How are you not in combat after casting a huge heal on the tank? Your video doesn’t explain that.
---
shift+7 is "&amp;" on a standard qwerty keyboard, "/" is its own key next to right shift
---
Rogue here.
---
Can confirm.
---
An rogue.
---
i don't think i've ever heard this phrase in like 8 years of playing this game.
---
This is way more funny to me than it should be 😂
---
"You think you do, but you dont"
---
But it is. If I want to whip up my own discord server, I can do that in minutes and have friends joining. No fees, no fuss. And I can do that ad infinitum. It's not the same with TeamSpeak.
---
Why didn't this guy use facecam on his race to 60?
---
Stop complaining and eat all the shit the game throws at you. Welcome to Classic :)
---
I'm specced in enh and use a 2h now, but feel really slow and when a hit misses or gets dodged I'm usually screwed. Do I still use a 1h + shield then? I have the blue 1h from WC now but it seems to have lower AS then my current 2H
---
i love the lore of the old warcraft soooo much. these books are awesome to read and short so you dont feel committed
---
There is a whole segment of the population that came to Classic that is the worst brand of gamer to deal with if you're a mature person. Retail is worse. They have different catchphrases for that, but yeah...it's an unfortunate and toxic part of most gaming communities I'm sure you know by now.
---
The nice thing about Classic is I also think it brought in a very large segment of gamers that are mature. Moreso than they were 15 years ago. 
---
I think the best thing any mature person can do in WoW is find a compatible guild. One that doesn't put up with really bad attitudes or over-the-line anything. Preferably one that isn't taking open invites and actually cares about who they are bringing in. It can be a bit tough to fit in at first because  there are no shortcuts to earning respect, but once you're part of the family you're set and you'll (hopefully) be able to tune out /1 and just play the game with good people.
---
Fuck em play whatever you want, it’s all part of the rp experience haha
---
I'm about to go level 50 and I'm still using Bonebiter. As a paladin the reward from this mission is a no-brainer
---
i have the same situation too. hate it so much. even when im like "fuck this i will just grind, abandon the quest" i can't even find a decent spot to grind any more. everywhere is full of people.
---
i don't like dungeon grinding but i think i will go for it
---
Oh nonono, he doesn't know Pepelaugh
---
Agreed. I’ve seen plenty of ?? horde camping lower level players in redridge and duskwood. It is not a problem isolated to one faction.
---
That's not how it works. Each layer is the size of a 2005 vanilla server according to Ion, so roughly 3000 players.
---
Done that to a hunter a couple of nights ago and was quite pleased it could be achieved. Was honestly expecting a kite fest but I was able to scamper out of combat then we both ran towards each other, my charge got off before his shot.
---
Factional queues would be the ideal way to go.  Faction slots wouldn’t work due to being able to make 12 dudes, but a faction-based queue would.
---
That jump boss is a bitch.
---
That title alone.made regret clicking on it. Low -brow pos journalists at it again.
---
nice hit. trash.
---
Is that because Blood Elves made it like 90% Horde?
---
Okay so it's my Swedish keyboard layout that's the problem. Shift+7 is /, the key next to right shift is - (the button with 2 dashes of different sizes)
---
I loved getting hailed. I was hailed for saving the dam too. It’s awesome :)
---
Would be great if you could also a tab for WTB item(s) with an amount you are willing to pay.
---
I remember trying to glitch inside the Uldum entrance, thinking there was an hidden dungeon inside xD
---
Go into Org and /1 LF Guild
---
You should get a bunch of whispers from different guilds that wants you, talk to them a bit and decide which bunch you want to join.
---
Why are you complaining in public? Are you expecting a blizz employee to read the general chat and fix the issue?
---
Be bitter inside and keep quiet.
---
No it is only alliance doing that. :D /s
---
There is both on every PVP realm. Once it starts People get salty and do the same to others and that is the never ending circle of slaughtering lowbies.
---
It is part of the experience. If you wouldn't get mad - you wouldn't care. It is a good sign you are angry :)
---
Tonight I won't kill you as much. If I see a rogue I'll only fairy fire him. Not kill him
---
Because most people don’t take the one meta build as gospel and like to tinker around with different builds and talents that best fit their playstyle. And that is incredibly boring when you have like 5 choices total to make throughout your entire leveling time. Really, really hated it when they removed the classic talent tress for the joke that came after.
---
Couldn’t agree with you more
---
I really can’t wait Until I experience something like this in game, I always hear about these wars but never see them
---
Ganking in stv at lvl41 lol
---
More of a not getting a serious response when there is a legitimate complaint going on in general chat for example. People make fun of anything and everything because hey, welcome to classic :)
---
Logo ruined it
---
If a product is free, you’re the product.
---
Ever seen those videos of large sailboats coming in from the sea, with every man on deck and up in the masts, and they are all singing a sea chanty?
---
Yeah that's what I imagine they are doing, singing about the alliance they are about to destroy.
---
You don’t need a source. All your messages and voice chats go through their servers, of course they’re going to be analysing it
---
There are a few places in Hilsbrad, but it's becoming notoriously hard to find a good farming spot that doesn"t have a couple of mages AoE grinding every single mob in a given area. It's becoming pretty annoying and I certainly don't remember that from Vanilla.
---
As a Druid, I've tanked, I've healed, and I've DPS'd dungeons throughout my journey through Classic, at level 45 now.
---
I don't understand all the people saying "if you're not spell cleave, you don't get invited".
---
*charges to boss at the same time as the tank*
---
Idk about you, but I havent been in a single "aoe zergfest" dungeon group. If you aren't actively seeking out those kind of groups, then you aren't going to get them. In fact, Ive been loving the group where nobody can remember what to do or has ever played that dungeon. Its been awesome have a dungeon where all 5 people are learning it together.
---
Damnit... I’m  midweek into my work grind and I didn’t need to see this.
---
You may have misunderstood the blue post.. They didnt "add layers after launch". They increased server capacity before a queue begins.
---
If you roll need on something with the intention to sell it, you are an asshole. No matter of the item's color. No matter if you want to vendor it or sell it to other players. Same for disenchanting.
---
Well It's a small price to pay for such a good feature, imo.
---
As always the "etiquette" is need if it's an upgrade. Greed if you are going to sell or DE. Usually best to wait on your roll to see how others are rolling first.
---
THERE IS NO AGRO RESET!

---
I think you dodged a bullet yourself, and saved the rest of the subreddit from joining a future ninja looter.
---
I'm not here to judge, I'm just saying that you could choose to unhide your cloak. 
---
It worked for Wonder woman.....
---
That's why I turn off objectives on the map and use it only for the ! and ? on the map
---
I would never do that to my precious healer. I treat their mana bar as if I have a third recourse bar
---
Could be a long wait :)
---
I will translate for him.
---
&gt; but it's not worth the prices people are actually paying.
---
"Despite people being willing to pay that much for it, it's not really worth spending that much gold on it."
---
&gt; You don't need it for progression because a TPS weapon would be better
---
You don't actually need this weapon for progressing through new content, since a weapon that generates higher threat would be more desirable.
---
(TPS = threat per second)
---
&gt; and Feral Tank uses MCPs often as well.
---
"And a Feral Druid who is tanking would often use the weapon [Manual Crowd Pummeler] anyways."
---
(MCP = Manual Crowd Pummeler, which is a low level weapon from Gnomeregon with an on use ability that has 3 charges. Since weapons can we swapped in combat, druid tanks will often swap to this for the active ability mid combat and switch back to their normal weapon. For druid tanks, the active ability on this weapon makes it one of the best weapons in the entire game, despite it being from a level 30 dungeon, and you will want it for literally all content. However the item only has 3 charges, and you will need to farm new ones regularly. Druids will often farm multiple of these for each raid.)
---
&gt; Plus things like this exist so...
---
(He links to a very nice weapon from Dire Maul, 'unyielding maul') "Keep in mind, the weapon 'unyielding maul' also exists and is very desirable. And with unyielding maul available, you don't really need Warden Staff." (Though unyielding maul won't actually be available until Dire Maul becomes available in a different phase.
---
Hope that helped.
---
Probably to express Op's feelings after watching the MC video.
---
Hes gonna get him banned from the Game because his Dad/Uncle/whoever works for Blizzard
---
Ah okay. Use the twitch app instead maybe.
---
I use it to remove my other stings before trapping in pvp
---
I get it often and a hard restart of PC usually does it for me, sometimes it takes 2 or even 3 resets
---
Raid tank spots are usually occupied so you probably won't have to worry about that. Warriors are one of the best DPS classes, so you got that covered. But you'll probably have to learn to tank 5mans, both while leveling and endgame. It can be done in your DPS spec, no one expects prot warrior for 5mans. 
---
If you're purely DPS, even in 5mans, tanks won't want you in (since you'll be needed the same gear and DPS are a plenty) and god knows, if we have a level-appropriate warrior who refuses to tank when all we need is a tank, you're probably getting kicked from the group :)
---
In classic you play your class, not your spec, so it's highly recommended to familiarize yourself with all playstyles.
---
don't forget humans poop too!
---
Wrong sub
---
Would of killed them easier if you actually used fire blast. It’s only one of  their absolute best moves. Or u could waste mana with arcane missiles and troll people with emote macros???
---
&gt; Is that true? I'm genuinely trying to find out.
---
"If the service is free, it's because you're the product."
---
You really think Discord is running all these servers for people for free out of the kindness of their heart?  No, they're collecting data and selling it, just like everyone else.  They're a business, they have to make profit somewhere.
---
You don't take warrior.
---
I mean... I'm a tank. You bet your butt I have a list of people I'm not tanking for. Won't slow me down putting a group together in the slightest.
---
Is there something comparable for warriors which would justify picking up smithing?
---
I'm completely new to WoW
---
SM graveyard, lib, armory and cathedral are separated instances
---
I didn't even think of that. Thanks for the heads up
---
That's not how it works. It really is seperate machines working together. This is how it works with modern sharding and this is how it works with classics layering. 
---
The point of layering is that a single machine can't handle everything that everyone would be doing, so they spread it over multiple machines. 
---
It really is like making a second pizza. A second machine comes with its own processing power and memory to fill, it handles all the players on this machine seperately so the machines don't have to talk except for when players move between layers.
---
Roll 100
---
*internal yes*
---
Other member roll 100
---
*external no*
---
Absolutely true on people not taking it seriously. People sticking on the super overpopulated servers are only gonna have it worse once Layering goes away. The transfers are there for a reason.
---
I guess it's just personal preference but if all these people scared of "transferring to a dead server" actually did it, the server wouldn't be "dead". Not to mention people completely overuse and in some cases incorrectly use the word "dead". None of the servers are dead. All the low populated ones (on EU anyway) seem to be growing, which is the complete opposite. 
---
People are waiting for this magical giant drop of players where suddenly all the queues go away. It isnt going to happen. Itll be a smaller trickle effect where slowly it goes down but people are forgetting that once layering is gone queues are gonna be waaaaay worse.
---
Remember when you had to spam chat to find a group instead of pressing a button?? Remember how we fixed that bug from two years ago??
---
It most definitely is a hurdle, not an easy way to jump it though. From here on out it is going to hurt unless you find a single safe spot and only grind one type of mob. Just remember the pride for your accomplishment after you get past all the difficulties.
---
I like transmog in the context of retail, where you're always the hero in shining armor that can do no wrong, clearly you can't not have a fantastic looking armor set.
---
When you're just an adventurer, it makes more sense to have random bits and pieces, until you've slain the real big bad guys and get to wear the cool epic stuff.
---
Some questions:
---
1. In retail I remember you could hover your mouse over the icon of Bosses, enemies, and other players and see how much mana or HP they had, the exact number. However in classic I noticed I dont see anything now. Is there a setting to turn this on, or do I need an addon?
---
2. What are some good addons for healers? Mainly something for like managing all the spells I have, and for the seeing the player icons on the left hand side of my screen whilst healing a dungeon or raid.
---
3. Is there a way to view your critical strike chance or not at all? I want to know whats the chance of a critical heal...
---
But if all the mages are grouping together, doesn't that mean that all the other classes can just group with each other now?
---
Rule #1: Always take Snowfall GY.
---
You got RATted tgis has nothing to do with addons. Your dumb ass ran an executable you shouldn't have.
---
What Horde guild was that?
---
Approximately 5GB standalone or about 2.5GB if it's over an existing modern WoW installation.
---
He probably had a friend that was a mage and wanted him to be the main or whatever so they get most gear
---
or he's a stupid child, actually those both can co-exist
---
I play warlock and have 0 trouble finding a group. Hellfire and Eye + Summon are pretty much toptier for spellcleave

---
hmmmmm
---
Just reset your machine and make sure there's not too many processes running. 
---
This can happen when you've got a bunch of background tasks running and you slowly run out of memory.
---
Jk
---
Maybe check your memory. Can be an issue with the game but also with your hardware
---
Full immersion is full immersion
---
It's not black and white. Saying this is wrong is... well... wrong. Clientside movement in an mmorpg is just an controller with an ability to predict the future (for a few millisecs, anyway) to account for latency/tickrate.
---
From this point on i will talk about this in a general sense, because honestly i have no clue how WoW's backbone handles movement validation.
---
Movement on clientside is mostly predictive. This is why you experience rubberbanding if you have bad latency in some games (predict your movement, get response from server, get pulled back to las approved position and so on). Latency doesn't affect your movement, but it can affect the outcome of the validation for the new position you requested to have.
---
Best example is Path of exile. You can even toggle predictive or lockstep mode. Lockstep mode pretty much renders your client EXACTLY the way the server tells you to. Predictive mode predicts what will happen based on your input and just shows you the expected results until the server sends you a new validated states which will override all clientside predicted states.
---
Awesome! Reminds me of Warframe's trading
---
&gt; where as you could just think of it as the xpac after BFA
---
What the fuck is wrong with you mentally?
---
I legit didn't know you could get mail from npc s, pretty amazing detail.
---
Saggitarius is hunter?
---
Alright thanks for the feedback. Do you think I should be using 1h + shield or 2h atm (lvl 24)? I used a talent point for the 2h mace + axe but I'm not sure whether it's that good currently.
---
You think you do
---
I did. But you didn't read those I posted though: you are doing exactly what I pointed already, which is listing differences while ignoring similarities.
---
If you were to write a book, and that I copied 50% of it and changed the 50% left, would you say that my work is original or that I copied your work?
---
Rather obviously, and also from a legal point of view, you would think I plagiarized your work. When talking about stories, books, characters, the similarities are far more important when you are to decide if the works are similar.
---
If you can draw several major likeness, like I did, it doesn't matter that you can draw differences; especially as minor as those you did.
---
The roll standoff! Only worth doing for blue and up lol
---
what server is this I kinda want to constantly make accounts and whisper him with "Who is this?"
---
*glares at chrome*
---
Elo is primary
---
I think people underestimated how many new players would be playing. My parents would never buy me a sub so I'm now able to buy my own. I'll be playing this game for a long time and so will all my friends who are also new.
---

I know right? Opportunities missed, Feels bad man, but seriously someone should give this man a medal.
---
the only thing i found is that the netflix app on windwos 10 has a always on top mode/function, so you can position a netflix window and stream while playing
---
For real its not THAT far, still in frostbolt range. Some streamer i ve been watching are further away and still seeing the healthbars.
---
2h hands down.
---
That's Redridge bro
---
I mean you have less skills but they make way more sense and your gameplay actually influences how the same skill can be useless or brutal.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but I like WAY more the current talent and rotation design than the old one.
---
While I do agree, when it's a very valuable item most people roll Need straight away, from fear of someone else ninja'ing to sell it.
---
Sounds like somebody wost a woll
---
&gt; As for team mechanics, there is only one thing that matters in the end, damage.
---
wrong for on all other DPS classes have further utility such as portals mana potions or buffs, that all speed up how quickly a team can run the instances. 
---
&gt;Instead of a tank and a healer keeping an add from tearing the Mage apart, a Rogue can Sap it or just stunlock and murder it.
---
rouges only work on single targets dungeons are rarely single target and without those heals the instance would take much longer as people eat to gain hp back. 
---
if a rouge cannot do the dungeon on its own, then it cannot just take it as he needed the whole team to get there. I can tell you if you choose to do this you will find it a lot harder to get into dungeon teams as more and more black list you, rouges are already not great at PVE content
---
Try again
---
Does anyone actually know how they work?
---
Like not to be mean, but this thread is the same as every other thread on layering where OP states one thing and the entirity of the comments is people telling him he's wrong, and OP repeating something to the effect of "It's so simple", yet it confuses the fuck out of me.
---
My understanding was that layers were added not only for congestion, but so that overtime as people left they could slowly remove layers until all that was left was the server, unlayered. This was to reduce the risk of dead servers.
---
If the player cap is the same regardless of number of layers then it literally doesn't do that function, it's just RNG as to whether or not your server suffers an exodus.
---
I’ll tell you why - players demanded that they make every tree of every class viable  and blizzard ended up with 32 classes and hundreds of spells that they can’t balance so they pruned the shit out of them.
---
We should go back to 12 classes with specs providing flavour and a few unique spells/abilities per tree. It’s easier to balance and allows for more creativity in builds.
---
^^^Call ^^^a ^^^locksmith!

---
I'd say 2H arms is the way to go, at least until 40. Mortal strike is really strong. Personally I transitioned to DW fury after getting the Thrash Blade from maraudon since that's a very strong 1h weapon and I prefer to dual wield
---
As someone said it depends what someone is willing to pay for it. Over the years they’ve gone for 50-100g all the way to hundreds to over 1000. 20g is nothing when it’s a new server.
---
/run SetCVar(”nameplateMaxDistance”, ”6e1”)
---
Just write this in chat/make a macro that types it out. This will set the distance nameplates appear to 60 yards (you can change the 6 to whatever you want 4=40yards 2=20yards etc)
---
i think what this means is that you've utilized all your ram.  shut down your computer more often and you wont see this at all
---
In Soviet Stranglethorn...
---
I get what you’re saying, and I’m not disagreeing at all. It’s a poor mans game still. It’s the decent thing to tip, but you unless you ask them for a tip you shouldn’t **expect** people to pay. Understand the distinction?
---
The lack of talent points is what I miss from WoW.  The new talent trees are super lame.
---
Woulda made a better Calvin, but Gnomes can't be hunters.. :/
---
It isn't funny either.
---
30 is somewhat of a goofy level. Try to get 32 before starting desolace, arathi or salt flats. It will go a lot smoother.
---
Get all quests for RFK. Should grant you a bump towards 31. Get a level or two of SM GY farm.
---
If you want to skip STV that is (I waited with STV until 42+, and only did the southern part).
---
That sounds right. Thanks for the advice
---
They’re not really the university’s finest. No one goes to journalism school with the goal of writing about video games. That’s usually a plan B or C to fall back on, and you can bet they rarely bring it up or have some fancy way to word cheese it when asked what they do for a living.
---
Right...because that would lag out and break the server. Layering is the same solution as sharding in that it allows more people onto one server at the same time. It's entirely possible removing layers woild also remove the max amount of people allowed on at once as without doing that it means more people in the same areas which causes server instability.
---
you don't bring a tank to spellcleave lmao, and what do you need a priest for in melee cleave? the shaman heals
---
How could one live stream playing WoW for a job? Is it actually profitable or do you need some kind of gimmick? Windows has their built in streaming thing, is that and a twitch account enough to get started?
---
I farmed for this solo as an Undead in Westfall during release, got it though. So worth it.

---
This one is more believable, except two things: it tells you nothing about faction balance, just server population, and...
---
Nobody pugs mythic raids. Or at least enjoys doing that.
---
IMO what you just described is every "full" classic server on peak hours. Just grind mobs for few sessions and get your self like lvl 35-37 zone. Then you can stand up to gankers in STV and maybe they wont even attack you. I went to STV in my early 30s too (to do the tigers panthers raptor quest) and yea it was a shitshow, got ganked in every corner. Now I am lvl 38 and I find it a lot convenient. Also leveling before peak hours helps a lot. Like play a bit before you go off to work early in the morning or late at night...
---
I gave up at level 20, ran out of quests and I don't want to grind or do dungeons.
---
It doesn’t matter. Pick which faction you want to play.
---
What’s the addon your using on the right of you character
---
MOAAR
---
He might mean the fact that people don’t know how nova works and breaks and do it in the wrong order/time
---
This dude skipped a does of his medicine.
---
Onions have layers.
---
Classic+ where they actually make the content hard
---
Think of it like this, I play on Mograine, and lets say for example Mograine has 4 layers.
---
This is essentially 4 servers.  
---
Mograine 1 - 3000 player cap  
---
Mograine 2 - 3000 player cap  
---
Mograine 3 - 3000 player cap  
---
Mograine 4 - 3000 player cap.
---
Once layering is removed these 4 'realms' are merged into one, but the cap remains at 3000 players.
---
Numbers are obviously made up to illustrate my point.
---
haha what a fucking dick gobbler
---
I haven't played wow since vanilla and thought I give the time machine a go around! I had lvl 60 arms warrior in vanilla with I mainly did PvP and a little bit dungeons. I didn't really go into raids since my parents at that time really didn't like me playing and sometimes turned the internet off...
---
So enough backstory, I had a warlock twink back in the day and really like the dotting lifestyle and aesthetic of a gnome lock, so I rolled one this time. 
---
On the other hand I really also like the shapeshifting and multiple role-filling (at least pre 60) aspect of the druid and when I'm thinking about pvping, maybe feral/resto druid is closer to my heart having played the arms warrior in vanilla.
---
Does anyone have any input or advice? My lock is only 18, so not a substantial amount of time in. What's "better" or more fun in pvp, since I'm probably going to that most when 60 again?
---
You can now find the simple versions in each project. I've yet to upload the Taragaman one because that one is on another device.
---
only class i really struggle with with a hemo/crit rogue are hunters. It's fine if you get the stunlock working, but the moment something goes wrong? knowing the deadzone means fuck all if you can only melee.
---
In phase 2, they have promised to take out layers. a single lauyer CANNOT HOLD unlimited ppl. It will result in queues, you will understand this in time. You boob.
---
But they could, warlocks were the closest to spell tanks we've had in this game. They were used to tank Leotheras and Illidan phase 2 in TBC, for instance. It's just that Soul Link wasn't really the key there.
---
"Caster who's beefy and takes hits" is a big part of the warlock's class fantasy (rip destro) which is why traditionally warlocks had more HP than anyone else who isn't a tank.
---
You know, you could just not comment next time instead of wasting your time being negative
---
Has blizzard said anything about updating the auction house? I get the appeal of the original auction house, but addons are making it feel pretty bad, you cant really compete with people that are automatically posting 400 single items every 2 hours to avoid fees.
---
Lmao. More like this thing will tame your hunter.
---
Our Queue got cut by half.. but still 2-3h Queue after work..
---
Server is at medium. It’s been a great experience so far. It feels like the world is alive with so many people chatting and helping each other.
---
What addon shows your +hit, spell power and crit ?
---
Windseeker represent.
---
He's building momentum you dummy.
---
And people cheat the system spamming world chat
---
if your guild doesnt allow you to spend 3 talent points for solo play, they dont fucking belong in classic. Im not even closed to optimised pve raiding spec but im at max 30-40 dps below and most of that is either gear or lucky crit streaks. comments of this is laughable, spec permafrost, nobody is going to know.
---
I found the Hunter.
---
I use Stridermom as well. Named her Trudy
---
I dual box a Warrior and Paladin using the isboxer software. You will see most of the 5 man teams using this software.
---
It is fairly easy as my Paladin has a dirt simple rotation. 
---
Using the games interact with target function in combination with isboxer and the add-on clique I am able to control both characters from the warrior.
---
It means a few more keybinds for interact with target, judgement and seals but since clique covers all the buffs and heals via keyboard mouse click combinations in the raid frames it makes it fairly simple.
---
It has made levelling a bit of a breeze and gives me the tank and healer I want to play at max level.
---
I have tanked and healed low level dungeons with no issue. But don't intent to play them together at 60.
---
where did you farm water essence as frost mage?
---
You get arguably the best shoulders from WC as well as a belt, gloves and legs which will last you until Triprunner Dungarees from Gnomeregan. BFD and SFK have some more upgrades for you. Leatherworking fills in the gaps until you can get some more stuff in your 40s.
---
You should spam chat with "I have 3 stacks of vendor water" you buy every time. Since you can just buy it.
---
You probably don't realize a lot of casters can go through 40 Waters in a dungeon if you think just buying it is practical.
---
He thinks he's getting a weapon to enchant :o - must be in the loot council
---
Sounds like somebody got told welcome to classic.
---
Sorry that i wanna be efficient and min-max my character and not just get carried...
---
Would love to see the full macro if you can?
---
Do you have it set up to heal self if no target/heal target if friendly target? That would be nice for dungeons.
---
There is: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/real-mob-health

So lame...
---
He can accept whatever he wants from his community, it's whatever, the only thing he should catch heat for is that he made a pact with McConnell to wait until 60, which he broke.
---
I believe McConnell alread jacked him up / gave him shit for it, as they are raiding together now, so it's whatever again.
---
Neither of these things affect you.
---
-cheers
---
To be fair, I find lvl 30-40 to be the absolutely worst. You stop enjoying walking and seeing the world and just want your mount. You dont get any particularily exciting talent at those lvls, the questing is meh imo. SM is kind of the only exciting part. At least in my opinion before and after is a blast!
---
Payback for asmonds raid when he hit 60 lol
---
I'm not entirely sure. I'm planning on healing in the endgame but I haven't bothered setting up healbot or ElvUI for that purpose yet cause it hasn't been necessary for the limited healing I've been doing in leveling dungeons. Based on my experience in ElvUI, I'd say that if the Classic API allows it, then ElvUI is capable of doing it, but I'm not totally sure. I would guess Healbot would as well but, again, not sure.

---
Sums up rogue perfectly - Rogues offer ZERO to a leveling party between 1-60. Everyone and their mom cleaves stuff to death, so sap is of no use. Bf 2min cooldown is simply too long for rogues to warrant a spot in a serious group. Rogues only become capable at 60 with gear.
---
Myeah but you're no longer flat out blessing everyone. I only looked at it for a minute, but aren't even kings etc limited in how many people you can put it on?
---
the sunhat is totally menacing; just look at how it covers your eyes in your character portrait, so mysterious... they’re all just so intimidated they’re organizing ganks to try to get your suave ass out of their general vicinity
---
Sounds like somebody is retarded?
---
I like the flavors of all this apart from Mysticism, thats more like a shaman already. A hunter without a pet feels weird but maybe it could be a buff pet instead so it buffs the damage like its said and does not much itself. That's a possible route for classic+ also...
---
That's just a choice you've made for yourself man, not classic. There are still DPS charts and all that, I'm certainly trying to level quickly, and I've thought a hell of a lot more about efficiency and planning than I did in BFA.
---
&gt; Its what the playerbase moved onto after bfa.

Completely disregarding the fact that many people have quit long before then and returned solely to play this.

Cata was definitely the biggest dip in the game for me. Everything felt balanced design-wise but all the fantasy and fun of the game was gone. New quests weren't fun or interesting, half the challenge of the game went missing, classes all felt the same or very similar and all the familiar zones were completely different. 
---
Plus I just wasn't that big of a fan of the deathwing storyline. The Firelands prequests and stuff were about the most fun part of the expansion.

&gt;feel you. I feel behind because I work and watch streamers who are all dinging 60 left and right. But I've seen a few of their /played and it was INSANE. Had to remind myself they are literally on their computer streaming for 10 hours or so a day. Probably longer on random nights when they were feeling it too
---
more like 15-16 days. my friend hit 60 two days ago at 9 days 20 hours played, and i felt super bad to be outleveled super hard, but im lvl 55 at only 6 days 4 hours. So im not really behind, he just put in more hours.

Mega servers were a mistake, who would've guessed.
---
Name your pet "Klein" .
---
Honestly don't mind LESS spells on retail. Just not that few... BM hunters have literally 3 offensive spells @90 if you pick passives in the talent tree. +1 for the aoe filler.
---
The class would be more fun to play if they had like two or 3 phases in their rotation. I remember the BM hunter had like a phase to empty up your focus like madness, throwing your offensive CD to do massive damage, then a filler phase where you would build up your focus back, all the thrill coming from timing your bar filling up with the offensive CDs. This made the class having a management system within it. Now it's just empty your bar, and use your procs to refill a bit. That's it, you're passive and you just use the focus generator once available.
---
I feel like this type of gameplay is replicated with more or less success on other classes, some seems to add depth to them like the elementary chaman (with more aoe options) or the demon hunter (more close combat options) but they all feel the same. Filler/Proc/CD/Aoe/Heal core with some fancy around (or not).
---
Go to stv and do the hunting quests, gnomeregan quest from the engineer in the top right place on map in Orgrimmar and make friends with a LW. A LOT of people will make items for mats and a small tip
---
What's the name?
---
Wowhead instance quests and read comments
---
Would it be an acceptable compromise to make teams consist of 1 server only?
---
And at first you are queued to find an opposing group within your server.
---
After X time you can now face teams from different servers?
---
Atleast the people you play with will be always the same.
---
Also, perhaps not 1 massive bg but one of the size of 2 or 3 high/full servers? Should also help getting to know your enemies...
---
Thx 4 the answers all!!!

---
Same. As a priest I actually specced back to shadow at 42 and went back to solo grinding. Seems faster to just quest, more profitable too. Don't have to wait for some dickhead to take 30 minutes to get there also.
---
*Drinks while walking*
---
... you son of a bitch
---
Sounds about right. In retail, nothing but endgame matters. Leveling content is just a trivial grind with potentially some story content for anyone who hasn't already played through it.
---
While on autorun, is there a way to keep the camera facing a certain direction? I can hold left-mouse to move camera, but how can I keep it facing sideways or behind me? I want to be able to click on things as I autotrun that are not just directly in front of me.
---
Where to get this item? :o

I don't care about the faction, just the better race

Welcome to the world of 10+ year old memes.

---
Haha I assume you found it? Hope it helped
---
😊👍
---
The server is Westfall, it's a 30+ year old only guild. Guy spams his ads in LFG all day.
---
Battle shout is also equal now with threat depending on amount of buffed targets. It's more threat than a sunder now if you buff your entire party.
---
In other news ... please dont do this.  If anything pick a DPS to be main assist.  As a tank I am constantly switching targets to sunder/revenge/shield slam/bash/taunt.  Assisting me is a bad idea.  For this reason I have the skull icon on a keybind and just move it around during pulls to the target to kill.
---
No it isn't, max settings in Classic has very low requirements
---
&gt;Even if the community in Classic is terrible.
---
That hasn't been my experience so far. Most people seem very nice and helpful, and unlike retail, grouping is actually meaningful even in outdoor content.
---
The should actualy focus more on faction balance I think.
---
Like have individual queues for each faction and free migration should also be separated. And it would be nice to actually see the balance on each server so we can help even it out.
---
But it does if they limit the numbernof people per layer
---
I have a warrior main. What's the best alt for purely farming purposes. Give professions too if you know. Main is Engineering/mining
---
Maybe, but you could word focus to "focussing your inner magic" or whatever....  I think the weirdest aspect for me about hunters having mana was that you could burn / drain it away.
---
I have a 2nd account lvl 1 char I summoned to the water and I log onto it occasionally while playing my main . I also do bank alt stuff on that account monitor . Saw prince up and ran from orgrimmar with my mouth shut. Shocked I wasn’t rekt by 60s since I always see other spy lvl 1s there. By fate I decided to get off my bank alt before going to bed go check the spy one last time
---
But why are you so focused on the best xp rates? I mean there's a good bit of 60s by now so its not like it's a competition
---
The only thing layering being removed would change is less LFG spam, you wouldn't be seeing any more people in the world than you would on a full layer.
---
The gear is not a big deal. Having good weapons is far more important.
---
In camera settings you can change smart follow or something like that
---
You think you do but you don’t.
---
In my guild it was because one of the officers pre-paid for like 10 years of a Vent server and was adamant about getting his money’s worth. Like, all $16 of it. Before I stopped playing retail it was to the point where 90% of the guild would be in Discord and we would have to remember to open Vent on raid nights just to hear the officer commands. It was super silly.
---
/emote pets (character) should do it
---
50ish % drop from a rare spawn with 36-48 hour respawn.
---
Stay healer and run zf or zombie cleave groups til 48 and start maradon or ST
---
today we didnt even bother rolling on locked chests.  why?  no rogue was in the party thats why.  what if the rogue is in the party but didnt feel like opening it.  kick the rogue?  find another rogue willing to join after that and travel to the instance for the privilage of being the lock picking bitch and a 1:5 chance of winning the roll?  rediculous
---

What's with this obsession about statistics the last few days? Man it's a game. Isn't it supposed to be fun and enjoyable? Crunch those numbers as much as you want, but don't let them decide how/what to play. I mean.
---
Melee leeway is amazing ;)
---
Meh, the PvE realms in Europe are pretty balanced could have worked with server only in those cases.
---
Never needed it as I'm an ancient warrior who the did the basic tab or click name plates sunder revenge prior etc yada yada but I did enjoy the aoe threat :P shame to lose it but I never did need it.
---
Racials aside, the Orc rogue's kick animation is a straight up boot to the gonads, so I can never not roll Orc.

The threat being split is also getting fixed with the demo shout nerfs: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295044/classic-hotfix-demoralizing-shout-roar-generated-too-much-threat?webhook

---
I'm a ret paladin on fairbanks and it is pretty much impossible to get an invite to a group or even have people stay in a group I try to start. That might be universal to any server though. The AoE meta is cancer.
---
Just focus on how good you felt after taking care of all that, sure being able to play WoW after all that work is rewarding, but the satisfaction from taking care of yourself or house should be motivation enough.
---
Or just give in to temptation and become a filthy neckbeard that neglects hygiene and personal responsibilities.
---
Both options are 100% viable for a Classic wow player.
---
Happened to me in Stranglethorn a few nights in a row. There would just be like 10+ Alliance camping Nessingwarry's camp for an hour or so, with some level 55-60 level characters mixed in.
---
In the meantime, try clearing it with 20 people, bigger challenge and more loot for everyone!
---
I haven't thought about this stuff in 13 years haha yes that is where you farm them...
---
Every good melee group in a raid needs a wind fury totem
---
Then rally the troops and create an army to take on the opposing faction. This is what classic is all about
---
I know that but why vomit negativity out when you can just ignore it and keep browsing? Even reacting to my reactions with negativity, kinda sad how that's the best thing you can think of doing with your time
---
yes
---
Rogues begin to move much faster at 10/20/30/40/50/60, especially if you go into the subtlety tree and pick up the 10% additional move speed. I found stealth almost unbearable before 20, buts it’s been much better since then
---
At lvl 30 slam + good 2h weapon starts to shred everything
---
Oh wow i didnt even know that limitation! You learn something new every day
---
Is there proof he’s legit used this as leverage? I accidentally type to wrong people all the time lol.
---
You can be sure retail tanking is a ton harder than classic, yeah you need to keep aggro but actually staying alive is almost entirely the healer's job
---
These are not really server-specific issues, actually I would say Mograine is probably among the best servers for sure.
---
STV is horrible, that's true. Very few spawns, big respawn timers, and literally hundreds of people... but still, I found maybe 5% of enemy players will actually attack, even if they outnumber you, and even if you ninja their tags. wPvP doesn't make sense though as there's just too many players, I had 10 horde players on my screen all the time while in North STV...
---
But, for example Desolace is completely fine, you can comfortably  grind, quest, kill mobs there, it still has some people but just the right number, you can have some nice WPvP while also getting things done.
---
Regarding dungeons, I hate it as well, especially being a rogue... But I reckon I will just start a group of my own and find people who want to do it the old fashioned way. I don't really care if the retailers want to AoE through everything, more power to them; I'm sure I'll find like-minded people to do dungeons with...
---
Hi, planning to begin working on pre raid bis at around level 55. Would I be able to level to 60 from UBRS runs as that's where most of the gear drops or should I do the 5 man's?
---
It's a long quest line to find some venom that starts in Hinterlands, takes you to Sen'Jin Village and back, through Zul'Furak, and then to Hinterlands again where you summon it. 55 elite IIRC.
---
I unintentionally took a chest from a group of players who had cleared a path to it in STV. I didn't see them or any mobs around and assumed the chest was already looted but one useless item or something.
---
I got whispered by one of the people in the group saying they had been clearing to the chest. I felt bad so I traded him everything I got from the chest. He thanked me for being honest.
---
There are a lot of people out there who don't do stuff like that in Classic, ninja'ing items and chests, thankfully most people make the server aware so they can be blacklisted etc.
---
That's not a gun staff it's an (MMO)RPG.
---
And what has this anything to do with it? You think there are no animals in that river?
---
its cool but honestly id get annoyed if you followed me around doing it
---
I mean I think some of his points are fair. Yeah some quests in classic are boring as shit, there's clearly less class versatility since some specs are just objectively worse than others, the better designed dungeons/raids point is obviously true. I don't agree with his expressing creativity point since I think transmog is lame, his last point is also irrelevant.
---
I waited for 20 mins for this guy to respawn the other night....  He never did.  then i got ganked by a group of horde on the way to turn in the other quests.
---
I'm on Mograine and not had any problems, I just made my own groups to run a dungeon once I had the quests.
---
the LFG spam is annoying but I imagine it's the same on every server, but I only join the LFG channel when i need to make a group, besides that i just grind on my own or questing.
---
I know right?
---
Layering has zero effect on server capacity. All layering does it take the total capacity and split it into manageable chunks. That was 10,000 people aren't competing for a single objective and instead 5 instances (layers) of 2,000 are.
---
Came Here for this. Hunters much like druids are misunderstood. Raziya the ravager is a god.
---
But the issue is that Mage is for easy control and save. Not to mention the damage. Yeah, you can do it with other Classes, but Mage is the best. Always useful to have one.
---
I've just accepted that my dps will be my offtanks. They dont realise that their impatience hurts efficiency.
---
They both have their advantages and disadvantages. Discord for example has better administrative powers in my experience way easier to implement things like simulation bots and music bots but once you reach over 60 players discord breaks down just due to the latency issues however this is easily gotten around by picking the right area for server and putting a people limit. 
---
However if you're doing something like EVE online vent is a billion times better because then you're talking 400+ people in one channel in my personal experience
---
West fall chicken is kinda a secret pet I’d just google it, otherwise there’s vendors in the capital cities that. Sell them
---
I wonder if blizz is going to ban this, this is similar to LFG building their own community, I like the idea but I don't like it being a third party addons which is not part of the game.
---
I think gearscore would compensate for that back in wrath, give items extra points of gear score despite being lower item level because they were BiS for a build or something. Obviously retail ilevel doesn’t do this
---
That sucks

If you care so much about min/max as you're implying, then I wouldn't have to tell you about how to aoe grind in a raiding spec as you'd already know how to do that from simply learning what your abilities other than frostbolt do. 
---
PvE in this game isn't hard, don't try to make out to be something that requires PoE level character min/maxing
---
People actually think that doing Naxx in full AQ bis gear is harder than doing MC with level 50s in green leveling gear.
---
I'm fairly confident that it's not ;p
---
Source: MA in English philology.
---
You're not wrong, everyone else is wrong.
---
pretty much all BiS mage and warlock gear is green plus frost for mage and shadow for warlock damage. the question that follows is how much stamina do you need to survive the encounter? after which you use the needed ammout of pre-raid and raid gear to get the stamina you need.

Thank you for the list!

I have found a few for **WOW Classic** macros that I find useful when grinding mobs - adding pickpocket to openers! Gives some extra gold for that mount yknow. 
---
Actually some are less than ideal given circumstances and one of them is not working for me at all but perhaps someone here can help me. Also added one that I assume would work but haven't tested myself yet. 
---
**Note: Remember to check autoloot in wow options before using these!** I also have a fastloot addon - havent tested without it so that could be a requirement for all I know.
---
Basically this empties your targets pockets before you open on them. A nice little bonus cashflow. Lots of lockboxes! Buy big bags! I take no credit as ive found these here and there. 
---
This one works: 
---
**Garrote + Pickpocket**  
---
\#showtooltip Garrote  
---
/cast Pick Pocket  
---
/cast Garrote
---
\---
---
This one works but I don't really see the point since it puts me into combat and unstealthed. With the "remain in stealth Sap" it would probably be better, haven't tested. Then again, why bother since you can just use normal PP to achieve the same. I just included it to emphasize that the coding is sound and to highlight why I don't understand why the next one (CS+PP) is not working.
---
**Sap + Pickpocket (I dont really use this for reasons, but it works).**   
---
\#showtooltip Sap  
---
/cast Sap
---
Now here is the one that I would prefer (Cheap Shot+PP), but it doesn't work and I don't quite understand why. Can anyone help?
---
**Cheap Shot+ Pickpocket**  
---
\#showtooltip Cheap Shot  
---
/cast Cheap Shot
---
The CS one does not work even tho the identical Garrote/Sap one works fine. Sometimes when I try the CS one I even see the loot window "flash" on-screen briefly but no loot is grabbed. Its almost as if the CS triggers before the looting can take place, ie the CS is "too fast" on the tail of the PP. Feel free to try for yourself and maybe even suggest a fix. 
---
Heres one that should also work in theory but I havent tested yet. Then again - it might behave the same as the CS+PP one for some reason.
---
**Ambush + Pickpocket**  
---
\#showtooltip Ambush  
---
/cast Ambush
---
Since I most of the time prefer opening with Cheap shot I actually use two actions atm: 1: PP with autoloot. 2: Cheap shot. This of course works - but its two button presses that imo should be one. Which is why I am so annoyed that the CS+PP one does not work....
---
I wish human females were real

BoEs will never be worth enough. Once you reach Naxx, every raider is likely to require consumables worth between 1000g - 1500g per raid. Have fun funding that on your own or with BoEs.

Modern day WoW feels like if you started a DnD campaign, you already have tons of skills, and you're already regarded as a hero with the populace.
---
I'd blacksmithing going to be at all useful for a Holy Paladin?
---
Hunters and Mages are by far the most popular. I'd follow that with Paladin if only looking at Alliance, which really surprises me given their early-vanilla state. Then Warrior &gt; Warlock &gt; Rest.
---
you know the discord windows client? and how it scans for the games you have installed?
---
yeah that was what was called redshell spyware, discord at least does it up front and is open about it.
---
the web version, when running in a container is less of an issue, but it still keeps tracks of your gaming interests via your chats, the server you join (if they are specific to a game) etc.
---
The problem with ret pallies is that their damage consitently  stays at practically 0, and that they bring no benefit to a group which a holy pally can't bring
---
What are some must have add-ons in general or for hunters. Currently have questie and a damage meter. Thinking about auctioneer since I'm too lazy to use TSM. What else?
---
100% not why this was made, obviously.
---
Yeah quite often. Was recently in a dungeon where the warrior kept charging in before I had enough range for a sunder, then ended up having to waste a taunt as the hunter couldn't hold his horses. I didn't mind as it was manageable and practice for when real shit does hit the fan, but if it was a life or death pull I would have words.
---
Not for long
---
Hmm, I've never been too good with weakauras and that already sounds confusing. Thanks
---
&gt; when you leave an enraged mob at 10% to start building on the next to MaX your dEepS, healer needs to spend more mana to keep the tank/group alive and the run will be slower
---
And in BRD that can be deadly, especially in the later parts where there are casters that people don't focus and suddenly you have your tank dying to arcane missiles.
---
I work from home and rarely has a day gone by since launch that I put on pants :D
---
Yea, no not even close. Stop being a butthurt idiot. 1.12 is literally what every single vanilla server since actual vanilla is based off of. By that argument every tbc server is actually wotlk and so forth
---
I enjoy having the likable Jaina back.
---
Paladins can mostly only do damage by auto attacking and applying their seal. Therefore they have enough mana to do this a really long time, which means their damage is consistent.
---
But their damage output is low in comparison to other classes.
---
If they fight undead or huge mobgroups their damage increases hugely, but also their manacosts, which means they can't do this for very long
---
My brain linked it with dishonorable kill as soon as I asked the question. Thank you for the response.
---
Had no idea! Cheers!
---
Not really. You should sell all your clothes in the AH / Vendor to save gold for mount at 40. You can train it later with other professions too.
---
Yeah, yeah... It never happened so many times that it even made its way to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9oq8nh/petrified_in_bg/).

---

---

I can’t get over how ridiculous your post is 
---
One of the biggest aspects of classic is that classes aren’t balanced and have their unique strengths 
---
Yet you want to remove these 
---
You’re worse for the classic experience than aoe groups
---
I can tell you how as I‘m in the same position. Took me 6 days after release to hit 60 (on Monday). Another 2 days to gear up a bit, farm MC rep, finally clear MC and kill Onyxia (Wednesday). Since then we‘ve had 7 full days to farm prebis, do MC and Ony once again and farm gold for mount. I‘m full prebis, have t2 head and pants, have my archmage robe, have epic mount, and maxed all my professions (gonna drop tailoring soon though).
---
So much of the holy pally pre bis is +healing and no other stats. I can’t understand it!
---
Yep. So by vanilla standards full is actually way overpopulated and medium to high is the sweet spot.
---
Might want to try cleaning up wetlands/duskwood entirely if you haven't yet, aside from that you can try thousand needles (shimmering flats section), but i had a lot of trouble being ganked here. On your way to that zone you might be able to do some of the early stuff in dustwallow marsh.
---
Might be some of the higher level quests in Ashenvale you can try, or desolace has been relatively empty in my experience.
---
Try coming back after missing 2 patches in the same expansion. You're greeted with a "GO AND DO ALL THIS SHIT NOW!!!!" page when you log in. It's so overwhelming.

yesterday in ZF ihad a very smart exemplar wo even killed himself with it while he was standing in the zerg of the tank with an active lava totem from the mobs.

Lots of terrible players because it’s easy to level up, and few good players because it’s probably the hardest class to play well (especially in PVP).
---
It really sucks because I will find a "hot" item within my profession and start building a little sum towards my mount by producing some of that item then the add ons will analyze the market, let people know certain things are going for above what it considers a good profit, and then within literally hours the AH will be FLOODED with dozens of listings for the same item. They all undercut each other. I have seen them drive the price of items/item stacks selling for 75s to 2g down to below 20s within a few hours as each posting tries to undercut each other.
---
For example, I'm not hardcore grinding but at level 45 I am usually 1 to 2 zones ahead of the majority of people on my server. That means I skill out of herbs as they are needing a them and I also tend to be able to make pots that people need. With this whole "add on" economy, I have seen the price of briarthorn plummet from 45 s/stack to 5s, the price of kingsblood go for 1.5g to 20s, and the price of elixirs of water breathing go from 50s/piece to 10s. This happens all within a matter of hours.
---
Stomp is useful in PVP, an extra stun. Thumbs up.   
---
Shadowmeld helps sneaking DPS druids, and they get an extra 1% dodge which is handy for min maxing. Night elves also get a little boost to their base agility stat. Also night elves have the best models in the game Pre-BC. Finally, flips for days

I'm mostly a new player, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I used to dislike MMOs in general, a friend persuaded me to play on a PS, I loved it and I'm now a subscriber for Classic. 
---
The reason I mostly disliked MMOs -- and subsequently put them all in the same basket -- is that they all seemed to be the same click n' go chorefest of fetch quests. The first character I rolled was a Horde Shaman, and up to 20, I was mindlessly killing time. I was already amazed by the opportunities for exploration and absence of hand holding, but it was mostly all a pastime for when I wanted to lay back, have a cup of coffee and a cig.
---
Then...I started getting ganked. And I died a lot, but then sometimes other hordes would come to my rescue. Before I knew it, I was whispering others and we developed mutual 'animosity' for the Alliance, ganking them back. I buffed people, helped them clear quests and they did the same. It didn't take long before I felt like an actual Orc Shaman, earning my stripes in the field, pushing our cause further.
---
And that's when it all clicked. This was *the exact goal* of an RPG. Not the spells, or the swords, or a forced RP experience. It was all so organic and made sense. Hey, what good is this 6 slot bag gonna do me anyway? Maybe that guy needs it more than I do. And then that guy happened upon my corpse, rezzing me and saving me the chore of having to walk back. I loved how the design of the game, either deliberately or accidentally, rewards you for good behavior, without forcing it through mechanics. 
---
Wow this got long, but I had to share my feelings about this excellent game and the excellent people who play it. It's the first time a game exceeds the expectations I never had.
---
Ensure it's actually the one you need by checking other areas (rowboat, small tent up north)
---
I would go for the Druid.  You'll be playing one of the most unique and interesting classes in vanilla wow (imo).  Also since druids are so rare, you'll get almost every drop from MC and other raids, if you do plan to raid.
---
Looking for Inferno hotfix
---
Yes, try to make friends along the way
---
Me too. I spend a lot of time trying to work out which way I am going on the map but still having fun. I am 59 years young.
---
Personally I plan on farming robe of winter night pattern. I’m playing a lock. The robe of the void pattern is harder to farm and I can sell winter night robes to frost mages warlocks and shadow priests who are also too lazy to farm their respective epic recipe.
---
No job in FF has such a low amount of APM.
---
Nice bait tho, triggered the shit outta me
---
Shaman. Only class I have trouble killing.
---
I don't see the fun in significantly disadvantaging yourself. Harder to do quest because being killed more. Zones being nearly impossible to quest in due to the sheer underpopulation your side has in them. Harder to do pve because less people. Harder to do events because you're side is weaker. Harder to take world buffs to raids because easier to be killed. Worse economy because less people. Even in fair pvp numbers, you're alliance is likely to be less geared.
---
You're making the game harder for you in every way. The only argument is more world pvp, but that's really a fallacy since you're just going to have a ton of uneven fights resulting in horde really getting more kills then you could ever manage to achieve.
---
And in all honesty, unless blizzard does something about pop imbalance, it's more likely to shift even more to the dominate faction then get more balanced.
---
Those types.... I just got a flash back from the meetings I had to attend were two 70 years olds were constantly fighting who got to be the "king" there was a vote each year....
---
Thanks these are great :D
---
Noice
---
how did you get the stat bar to the right of the character panel to show up?
---
How so? I’ve been in casting channels with hundreds of other users in the same channel and it’s been fine.
---
They don’t have any other responsibilities
---
Hey, youve downloaded the non classic version I think. I did the same thing. The rar file should read classic in the filename.
---
It's a problem with any open world PvP game these days. There's plenty of sad fucks in gaming communities you gotta be aware of that while making your decision.
---
On that note a bit of advice from me, if the main reason for being on a PvP server is to be with your friends, you should try to group up and level with them.
---
Yeah otherwise just name yourself Aaabbbcccddd for maximum roll luck
---
Video game urinalism at its finest.
---
The author is jabbing Blizzard for being short-sighted in regards to exactly how many people would subscribe to the game, and being ill-equipped to handle the server load.
---
if you are on higher ground than the mobs (for example stairs) then it won‘t hit any mobs. if you are lower then it works.
---
I use alt codes in my name, im not toxic tho :c
---
I'll be fine once phase 2 comes out because I'll also be level 60 and it will be a fair fight. 
---
I really enjoy PVP just not when someone is twice your level.
---
I've been hitting the shore of lordamere lake thats in arathi Highlands for the level 30-31 turtles. The meat is good for cooking, they drop some good greys for vendor trash, and clams which are also good for cooking and have a chance at pearls. Also lifebloom spawns along there and greater sagefish pools which are also good for cooking and the sagefish delight sells for a decent amount. I've ran into no competition, and the spawn rates are insane with a high mob density to match.
---
Rogues :D
---
Someone's in your email and used your chrome remote desktop to control your computer.
---
Though could be worse since you said you downloaded add-ons from wherever
---
these are actually all really fucking cool, and also nice format/artwork
---
There's tons of spellcleave on horde side. It calms down between level 45 to 52 though. Then it's picked up again.
---
Not at all, wishing it was the other way around makes me seriously doubt you did any battlegrounds in vanilla. I look forward to not having to wait at least 20 minutes for my battlegrounds.
---
This happens to me sometimes when I'm opening the first aid menu for some reason
---
Probably, but some of us are stuck on overpopulated servers. At least I am since I know that I can't convince my friends/guild to transfer and I did it alone I wouldn't last more than a month before quitting.
---
Yeah I agree mostly, just apart from the spec balance. I think if some of the real shitty specs were brought up a bit then that wouldn't change anything really, the dungeons/quests are a key part of classic though yeah
---
Havent had a problem with essence of Air. Farmed Waterlords Rep with a grp a few days ago and we did around 10 Full clears of the area and gotten around 7-9 Essences - not a single Earth one tho just seemes very unlucky
---
I just make my own group that often consists of misfits like me(rogue), shadow priests, hunters, retpals etc.
---
We usually have a dps warrior as a tank and whatever healer. It usually goes at a decent speed but it's like 30-50% of the speed of a cleave.
---
Its honestly no contest and the people who think that normal groups have a chance on the speed/xphour of a cleave are severely mistaken.
---
People are doing around 100-150 dps single target at 40 where a mage cleave does 700-1500dps in aoe...
---
So does Ravager
---
If a warrior drinks enough mana potions to they eventually become a paladin?
---
Top meme. Thank you.
---
**AND YOU SHALL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS SHARON**
---
You don't get your point apparently seeing this answer.
---
boe blue = not ninja
---
You will see chat channels when you're in zones, the zone specific one is /1 ( so just type /1 then space to join that channel) and just ask if any social / leveling guilds are recruiting.
---
Literally the exact same words I was going to write. Maybe not the emoji. :)
---
Yes, timer is not that long either so for longer dungeons or slow groups when you wipe you will have to reclear trash (tip: take a warlock for soulstone).
---
Game is dead
---
I'm pretty sure they end up with a belly-ache
---
Well gy rare spawn also has a sweet neck piece that is probably better than what they have (has like int, spirit, stam)
---
Lol. I would have just laughed at that statement he sent you about knowing who your guild master is. The entitlement is through the woof!
---
You are free to quit the game and find one that suits you better
---
This is here to stay
---
I think druid is a very good pvp class both in wpvp and bgs. Especially if you are a tauren.
---
I like the name
---
First off it's gone. No ones getting the item but the ninja. It happened move on. Nothing can be done.
---
Tauren booty is best booty and that is a hill I will die on.
---
lmfao imagine having a power trip because you run a guild.
---
fuckin weirdo. this was a blessing
---
I’ll be your friend
---
Its 4 am and photoshop froze three times to make this masterpiece
---
Define ninja? Was he a class that could also use the weapon?
---
Do guys really bash the scarlet bishop to slutmogs?
---
Ninjaing is not against the rules
---
Tanking as arms or fury is fine while levelling.
---
With arms you get can stance dance thanks to tactical mastery, and as fury you will have enrage for 25% extra damage.
---
You will only be hindering yourself trying to level as prot.
---
Oh I've spent hours just following folk around in STV and shimmering flats, helping them kill stuff for leather.
---
At 30, there's no real way to build up some burst as pally.
---
 
---
I mean you can always go holy and simply wait until you opponent dies of exhaustion or sleep deprivation.
---
And the hillsbrad cloth head for those without engi.
---
At first I was wondering why this reddit is so full of meme posts, but then I realize it's full of 25-35 year olds who still think memes are cool.
---
Is your server full?
---
Same with rogues on my priest . Pop one free action and watch them cry.
---
Did you read what I said at all?
---
**So if a layer has a maximum number of players, and a server has a maximum also,**
---
I found a beautiful white Core Hound (Kurken was his naaaame) on wowhead and decided it will be my pet. Since it is an exotic pet, I went full Beast Master and as soon as I could tame it I made some of my wildest trips across the Azeroth: went to Elwyn Forest (I was at EK at the time and didn't had/didn't thought of a fast and reliable way to get to Kalimdor), sneaked through Stormwind (dying couple times in the process), got on a ship to Darkshore, then to Draenei island, then ran all the way through it to get to the cave where Kurken was, scaring some low-level Draenei on the way. Taming was pretty easy. I named him Cocaine.
---
Especially fitting since his unique ability was basically shaman's Bloodlust.
---
“Last I checked there are a TON of warriors looking to tank”
---
Nope, most of them just want to do DPS. LF tank is all I see every time I log in.
---
M night jammalananan’amandingdong

Simply ask in /1 wich is General Chat, /2 wich is Trade Chat (/2 only works in main cities), just type the /1 or /2 in the chat and it should change :)

And many people start alone and it rarely ends like that!

it doesn‘t even reward you with honor. just a waste of time for both sides, but i guess people who corpscamp are little kids anyway which has enough time to do useless stuff
---
Illusionary Rod
---
I play on a server which is High on prime time, and still have to select every time start the game.
---
I've heard people say they're god tier and I've also heard people say they're garbage. I haven't had much PvP but the PvP I've had has been very fun
---
Maybe run some dungeons instead and then slightly over level the zones before doing them. Ideally your quests should be green for efficiency anyway.
---
Confusing? How can you navigate any other voice app UI but not discords? Teamspeak and mumble look like some kind of 90s chatroom
---
Technically it did gross more than $200
---
Not struggled to get any groups. As a Druid I can tank or heal so I'm in a very fortunate position. But these SM groups are just the worst. I avoided them at all costs.
---
It doesn't take much to reach peak efficency, eye pulls and los is not rocket science
---
Even I, who hates tanking and always feels like I'm gonna die to boredom when forced to, have to admit that it is slightly less of a pain in the ass in classic.
---
Ye I know what you mean I've been having the same issue and no solution, is it maybe something they added with retail or so? Thus not part of the vanilla experience haha
---
One of the best ways is to figure out what skills not to buy until you have your mount. Can be a huge gold saver.
---
Call a locksmith!
---
I should start using alt characters just to trigger and filter the arrogant asshats out.
---
Hunters are great for some solo farms, like Princess. With just a little gear at 60, a hunter can solo Princess and make an average of 50g (I think) an hour just selling the loot.
---
Like people said. Ninja’ing items isn’t against the rules. There’s nothing you can do. People do this. It happens we’ve all experienced it. I’m sure some day you might even be the ninja
---
You have goggles at lvl 10???
---
Holy cow engineeering is awesome
---
I randomly saw it yesterday trying to turn it a quest to the troll behind it. Really fucking creepy
---
I'm thinking when I finally get a mount I'll reroll mining. Doing it without a mount seems inefficient
---
He gave a stranger 10 g and got 12 g back
---
True if they dont change the capacity per layer.
---
Do you think Warlocks bang their Succubi?
---
If you roll need to sell it, you are
---
Eminence #1
---
Ignore list them shits
---
I’m the same and it is a struggle to get gold. I have started selling all my greens instead of disenchanting them. Those greens add up to a lot of gold. Don’t buy anything off the auction house.
---
Wait can you tell me how destructions rotation is far superior to what was in wrath? also How arcane rotation nowadays is so good? because you pretty much spam one spell and then damp the charges.
---
Wave:cyan:bank sale @@@@
---
What are you talking about?
---
Razorgore, it's full but there are minimal queues now.
---
To be fair,
---
This was not the intention of the devs since they didn’t do the same to the males with the same armor....
---
That ship might have been hijacked, I don't know for sure.
---
Nice thanks, now i can copy paste my msg into both trade, world AND lfg :))))
---
Not even a little
---
Yeah us alli on Arugal are alright folk.
---
You can easily tank every dungeon up to BRD with a DPS spec and a 2H/dual wield.
---
There is absolutely no reason to spec into prot during leveling
---
Yes goy time is free

If its an expensive BOE all should roll ... If a expensive BOE item drops and for example i can use, but i can also sell it for 150 gold, i will seriously consider selling it. Why not, it's my item i can decide if i wear it or sell it. Which i think is correct, the problem is such items being world drops and BOE should be needed by all.
---
10 haunting photos taken moments before disaster
---
Very much indeed
---
Not at this exact moment, but it does have a bit of a queue during peak hours.
---
Against The sub rules tho
---
The difference is that you worked for it.
---
My only grip with that is that it (like it did when introduced in vanilla) destroys reliability (to a degree).
---
People can then scam and simply name change / server hop. If you can't do that, then you're stuck with a bad rep on a character you invested a lot of time into.
---
Well it’s Part of the game 
---
Leave the area for a few quests or sth
---
They were the best AoE tank due to spamming demo shout but it wasn't as strong as it currently is. AoE tanking is still perfectly possible just not as easy as it currently is on live. This will mean DPS need to keep at least some eye on their threat
---
It's actually bugged in classic, every mage is aware of that, hopefully with reports blizzard recieved they gona fix it.
---
Firemaw, for me all zones have always been full of friendly players
---
Bro just wait for the healer to drink or regenerate mana? Lead the dungeon. Tell them you’re gonna wait for healer’s mana
---
Can give thumbs up for gandling as well, Horde side haha
---
Rogues.
---
It's funny how normalized the behavior has become now.  Back then people thought it was a big deal.  Nowadays, kids do that all the time.
---
You're so dumb lol, ty for the morning laugh

Stable the pet you want. Tame the pet with the ability you want, spam that ability until you learn it. Release that pet. Remove pet from stable. Teach pet ability.

hey hey, that's easy doable since you didnt specify the level of the mobs.

Last line... Meme post.
---
Taurens have a stun, as for nights elfs druids are good at escaping mid combat anyway but paired with shadowmeld you can eat and drink in it and quickly re stealth to cat if you're clever about it
---
Denied Horde scum a kill, saved repair costs, didn't have to corpse run, won't get corpse camped. Can get on with their life and do something else. Horde stand there waiting to see if they can tap the paladin before he hearths but ultimately just look sad.   
---
Sounds like you are pretty salty about paladins beating you.
---
"Non-wow player" , not possible tbh. 
---
How can anyone be on the classic forum and not play classic ? the hype is enough to power a city, no one can resist it tbh.
---
yeah i think ill start disenchanting after i get the mount
---
That's a debate. I prefer having 1h (fast weapon) wihh flametongue and shield. I kill things more slowly. But I have better sustainability.
---

It's not specific to hunters, I lost Whitemane's Chapeau last week to a terrible level 30 mage that won every single drop he could need on including rolling for chests from each SM wing.
---
This dude ninja pulls the last boss and had the audacity to joke about him being under leveled auto pulling then goes on to take loot he couldn't equip until level 39.
---
Stories like this aren't unique to any single class it's just the typical idiot that seems to have stupid luck to make up for lack of brain cells.
---
I was especially salty as i still had a white helmet on at 44 and he already had a blue at 30.
---
??
---
His name was taken :(
---
idk but i assume blue means inactive and green means active. i dont think this answers your question at all but whatever.
---
You called me sad after all I did was criticise you, ergo you called people who do so sad.
---
&gt;  wasting your time being a little keyboard warrior that wants to be right all the time. 
---
You don't have to worry about how I spend my time. And I gave you criticism once. **YOU'RE** the one who started complaining about what I can and can't say on a **PUBLIC FORUM**. Seems to me like you're the keyboard warrior here.
---
Do everyone a favour and grow the fuck up. I'm going to be the bigger man and block you now since all you can do is throw a little temper tantrum about how people spend their time saying meanie words to you :'(.
---
I like how in all the "Playing Classic at a bar/hotel/camping trip" pictures they're always in queue LOL
---
The servers are packed full, so many other warriors doing the same quest, just team up.
---
My comment is going to get downvoted to hell because this sub seems to have a real big problem with people complaining about ganking. But I wanted to let you know that I get it. I don't understand why people think it's okay to ruin someone else's play time.
---
I'm in your shoes, I rolled on a PvP server because of a friend. I hate PvP. I get no joy from killing other players. It wouldn't be so bad if, like you said, high level players didn't get their jollies off killing low levels. Unfortunately, the only way it might improve slightly is if people get bored and leave the game, but there's still always going to be those assholes who camp low level towns.
---
I play with 0 friends and not in a guild its still social and fun
---
“Doing ports to IF &amp; SW every 60mins, starting at 1600 servertime. Tips appreciated”
---
Define "expensive" please. 150g, 100g, 1g?
---
This is pretty clear to me: if you want to sell the item, you roll "greed". If you want to equip it, you roll "need".
---
Asmongold, is that you?!
---
If you like to be anywhere other than the bottom of the meters it’s the wrong class
---
I was wrong. Its just not working for friendly characters.
---
What a blessing.
---
Blizzard has confirmed that it’s not bugged.
---
Welll you're allowed to multibox, but Blizzard disabled the /follow feature in battlegrounds so its effectiveness is a little bit limited in PvP
---
Is there any situation in the game, and I mean any, from level 1 to 60, where you as a warrior Sunder Armor outside of Defensive Stance? I just noticed it's not stance exclusive but I can't think of a scenario where it's justified in the other 2 stances.
---
IIrc there were also "hidden" auras, mostly setbonuses and certain items, that worked as buffs because of technical reasons back in vanilla. What items does he have equipped?
---
That was honestly a huge insult to every devoted fan. Releasing a mobile game was fine, but they did it to a community that was overdue and expecting something better after the initial mess they made of D3. Had they announced the mobile game after a more impressive announcement, it would have been received fine. It was a very big highlight on how disconnected Blizzard had become.
---
Even FFXIV remove a bunch of useless skills that no one ever uses in their last 2 expansions
---
I cant belive Classic got this popular... oh I knew it would be, but "not like this"
---
Okay big man, have a nice life :)
---
Quick question, whats your detailed character stats addon?
---
Rogues can beat Mages with a dagger/prep/imp sprint build, but wont really be able to get all the req talents till higher levels. I find them manageable as a hemo rogue, but it requires essentially every cooldown and it's a tough fight.
---
It’s just how cone of cold worked in vanilla. People complained about it a lot in the beta but blizzard has confirmed that it’s working correctly.
---
Same question still applies...
---
They do not. Servers have a cap which is independent of the layering system. Increasing the cap does require blizzard to add more layers so the servers can handle it, but adding layers does not increase the cap without the cap itself being adjusted.
---
So you lost your time, and your cool.
---
I actually saw a hunter pet tank an entire gnomer run by wearing nothing but int gear and he spammed Mend Pet while his pet tanked, it worked nicely, maybe this guy is doing the same thing?
---
And if hunter wants to equip all items? Need all?
---
God damn. The good thing is there are like 4 great mage items in LBRS so i'm just going to be running it a bunch of times
---
It’s actually more fun without real life friends. Problem with real life friends is that one tends to socialise more than necessary with them. Meaning that it’s harder to just faff about doing your own thing when friends are present. You feel a certain pressure to play with your friends, always discussing what to do next etc. 
---
I play a lot solo. And then I love to team up with complete strangers for dungeons and an occasional hate quest. The good thing about this is that it requires less energy. Little chatting. And one can walk away with a quick thanks and bye bye.
---
Well I think you could ask the office manager to get those installed to be honest. If your window doesnt have anything and it's distracting you from your work :') should be pretty simple
---
So im up to level 31 and have been using skinning mining to make currency but my end goal is engineering mining. 
---
I know engineering is a gold pit however someone was mentioning how it cost them about 8g to get from 0-225, which while kinda pricey is not awful. Should I drop the skinning now and be able to use engineering while leveling?
---
/use [mod:ctrl] Flash of Light(Rank 1); Flash of Light;
---
Seals were there in wotlk too, and the pace was much much faster than classic
---
Ah so that's what the numbers are.  Yeah I don't like that at all.
---
For me it seems like there's a difference in tanks. Most tanks I've had have been able to hold aggro on aoe groups without the mage really waiting much for threat to build. It might be a gear and skill factor there though.
---
If you want to be the second best buddy of everyone, this is your class. The best buddy of a class is often a purist, but as a hybrid class with a ton of buffs and auras and good heals and purify and the bubbles and decent damage everyone likes you as a group member.
---
In high end raiding or hard-core gaming this will be different, because everything is optimised to the max, but this is not relevant for 99.9% of the playerbase
---
Ah ? Well I guess all the 1.12 servers I played on didn't know that
---
So if I /wave a player that's PvP then?  After all I took an action against a player right.  Regardless you accept it's completely one sided for a 60 to Vs a 10.  Doesn't rly matter if this 'counts' as PvP or not, for a 60 to go out of their way to prevent another playing is toxic.  It's pretty much the language used in blizz's tos.  I agree there cld be a debate about if this is fair play on a PvP realms but again blizz state that attacking low levels is frowned upon even here- eg toxic behaviour.   Justify it as you like but camping a random lowby char that presents zero challenge, for an extended length of time is toxic play.  You gain nothing and you deliberately prevent their playing the game.  Why?  What's to gain?  The only reason I can see is if you can't handle more even fights or you're feeding on the toxicity.
---
stupid question here : why not rogue ? Stealth seems extremely useful to reach quickly nodes/herbs that would otherwise need to waste time killing lot of models
---
I feel the judgement in your tone.
---
I feel the same, a lot of mages. I think alot of them will fall off though, as alot people will use them only for grinding gold and because they're good levelers.
---
Just like the million trash warlocks because they're easy to lvl
---
Hey, I have never used macros when I was playing retail, but now I am playing holy pala and so I am healer in dungs. Do you have any good macros to use for holy pala?

tell them to fuck off, there is nothing more roleplay than a NE priest
---
Does anyone know if the weapon enchants like Striking, Impact (+ weapon DMG) affect druid shapeshift attack dmg? 
---
Some say it do, some say it don't
---
I think it worked on some private servers. Have anyone tested?
---
I thought I read somewhere class quest items are phase 2 or 3... I've been had!
---
Check my wares at torch2!

Ez if you arent bad...
---
In the beta I tagged stitches and dragged him to darkshire on my level 34 hunter, if you kite him in circles around the town the guards will kill him slowly. It took ages, and when he died I felt so good.
---
And all I got was a lousy femur.
---
The game is more than DPS. Paladins are a support class, something that got phased out over the years as everyone became overpowered so buffing was pointless. If the Devs give the classes a little love and attention using things they learned about balance over the last 15 years Paladins will become balanced, while hopfully maintaining their utility/support role and not being judged as a DPS.

/cast [nomod] Flash of Light (Rank 1)

/cast [mod:shift] Flash of Light (Rank 2)

/cast [mod:ctrl] Flash of Light (Rank 3)
---
I hope you aren't actually playing on that one. They aren't great for the eyes.
---
The WeaponSwingTimer addon is really useful in learning to time this.
---
What a dick sucker.
---
Please God no
---
In short, enough for questing but for raiding it won't be competitive with a lot of classes with same amount of gear/skill/consumables. 
---
Even if you consider all the other things a paladin brings to the raid its not good enough to get around the lack of damage except if your raid lacks paladins for some reasons (below 4). That aura and buff can also be brought by another heal paladin and while a ret haas free gcd to dispell he wont have the mana for it if he wants to do damage
---
What is the macro out of interest?
---
I'm maining a holy priest in classic and I can confirm. 
---
Quality meme my guy
---
/use [mod:ctrl] Flash of Light (Rank 1); Flash of Light;
---
Nothing is wrong with them, but they are a support class. They will never top damage charts, but that doesn't mean ret is worthless. If it's fun, play it. Even as a ret paladin, I rarely die unless I'm stupid or unlucky with mobs spawning on to of me. And you still bring utility to 5 man's as ret, but your utility will fade off towards end game, where a holy build will bring more to the table.
---
I remember a post about them on the sub a week or so ago, it was about being true to their name.
---
No, it won't be a fair fight most of the time. You will get ganked while farming in Easter Plaguelands. You will get stunlocked by Rogues. You will get corpsecamped. You will be killed by a whole raid while trying to enter UBRS.
---
It's a PVP-Server and these things are intentional. The sooner you can deal with that fact, the better.
---
Lock is completely useless compared to another mage (im a lock) in ZF. Ive had such trouble getting a group as a lock after SM. In instances you can mount like zf a a shield, ice barrier and mount mage is alot better than the eye. And the fourth mage does ALOT more damage aswell ad not taking damage from hellfire etc. In brd you CAN use a lock but swiftnesspotion and shields is still alot quicker.
---
My brain is not helping me remember if it was this way in classic too, but it def annoys me! I dont even have chars on other servers
---
That’s the the good part though, you can do both
---
SMH on these kind of clowns
---
I never liked macros honestly
---
Ok, keep us updated
---
Yeah, something like once every 20 runs it seems.
---
Not rly. Everyone rolls need to PREVENT ninjas. If 4 ppl roll greed on it, what’s stopping the last person from just taking it?
---
You might like to play with dressing room if the look is a big concern for you. You can see how different races look with tier sets or any other items.

If you’re playing horde oceanic you want to be on arugal.

Nah, still too hard.

Bless you

Why did it take them this long? We had figured it out by SM aoe spam runs day three.
---
Yeah, but she basically wrote The Guild as a way to cope with her WoW addiction (which was interfering with her work, as I recall). I don't know if she's going back to playing, especially now that she has a baby to take care of and a ton of projects going on.
---
I had NO idea you could use bandages on other people until reading this comment....
---
WhatsTraining for that last one I'm pretty sure
---
I am, yes. If you aren't petrified of your government, you aren't paying attention.
---
Only on Oce servers, that's for sure
---
Well thats somewhat new
---
It's on every server.
---
alliance have a good alternative with bonebiter from lvl 34 (if you solo and not carry, likely 37 to get into SM cath).
---
or else its uld with the 2 weapons off of the last boss at 44.
---
Sm/ruin is the default «do everything build» and is nice if you want to do a little bit of everything without respeccing a ton. 
---
SL is I think the best pvp spec, but you’ll have to respecc if you want to do serious pve.
---
Everyone in this thread complaining about pruning when the top 2 dps specs for ragnaros can LITERALLY do it by pressing one button is embarrassing. Looking for any excuse to make fun of "them" with no thought at all.
---
Could be worse, Google “Angwe”
---
But it's not the last thing written...
---
Sweet, engineering sure has some cool stuff.
---
It’s melee cleave, with WF totem and Ravager
---
had tauren written all over it :P
---
He couldn't loot it before he got rid of the old one.
---
Don't think so no, the closest thing would be devilsaur set I think, but that's LW
---
Ah cool. Barrens.
---
We wont really see any sort of real drop off until after that first month subscription runs out. It'd be curious to see how many returning players stick around.
---
even healing higher level dungeons as shadow is perfectly doable, i healed zul'farrak last night at 41 (dinged 42 on the stairs) in a full shadow spec and had no trouble doing it.

I think it’s human nature to miss things. We even miss terrible things. Have you listened to soldiers missing the war? It sounds crazy right. But they do.
---
The animations were so wooden and lacked the fluidity and impact of WoW's. Additionally, the story and world were kinda meh, which is also one of WoW's great strengths.
---
You guys are going to have some wicked gear and spot competition.
---
Can confirm. I was logging before leaving house to get to work in the early morning, so dead server time (= STV quests time). I got whisper spammed by two different groups to come to Cathedral. 
---
Like, I get it, but for real dude? At this time you either are on vacation or you are pulling a sickie.
---
yeh you can put it on 1 person and trust me its not as awesome as it was back in a day where it gave you 10% of the stats.
---
Less than half the classes have a 5s stun without it being a talent, even less than that have full blown invulnerablility.
---
Damn, I could just take a screenie of the server list and get silver? What am I doin with my life
---
Yes thank you that's what I've been doing i just didn't know if there was any utility to having walk bound. Ty
---
It wasn't
---
Warlock / Shadow Priest (they compliment well)
---
Rogue / Feral Druid (stealth, heals, buffs, etc)
---
Warrior / Enhance Shaman or Ret Pally
---
There are a ton of good combos out there, and realistically, there's no real bad combo.  If you have 1 as a tank and 1 as a healer, you can run instances easily.  if you're both DPS, questing is quick, but dungeons might be harder to get into.
---
Number of people in STV also depends on quite a few variables, for example: how many people are there per layer andhow many players are in 30-45 level range. We have no indication from blizzard that they ever want to change number of players per layer, but of course there will be more people in 30-45 level range then there were in 20-30. Not only is each level taking longer(exponentially longer really) but there are more levels too!
---
First off, I hope I'm not interrupting your vacation, you deserve it.   
---
I ran into an issue with using the def/bzrk button 1 in def stance. Essentially it shows sunder armor with no modifiers pressed but it casts heroic strike. In fact, it casts Heroic strike with any of the modifiers pressed even though it cycles through the appropriate ability when the modifier is pressed.   
---
The battle stance version looks like it works fine except with the alt modifier. Is it supposed to switch me to defensive stance when i use it?
---
Nope
---
They shouldn't remove layers before these stupid queues are gone. My server (Firemaw EU) still experiences long queues throghout the day and around peak time you are looking at 2-3 hour queues. That's a big improvement over the 12 hour queues from before but it is still unacceptable.
---
@ level 60, it's worth the effort. I'm playing since vanilla and my first char was female troll hunter. I remember the good times in Zul'Gurub. Years passed and played everything including being a main healer on a hc progress guild. Now back in classic, my first character is an orc hunter...
---
It's like filling a hybrid tank with Diesel, it's just morally wrong
---
Increase the render distance when taking photos like these.
---
Same. I love watching Twitch streams, but I never enjoyed WoW ones.
---
Rotations are not something that makes the game fun to me.
---
In fact, doing Frozen Orb, Spamming Ice Lance and Blizzard (to reduce FO CD) and then doing the same thing again is not much more interesting than spamming Frostbolt. It's not really complex. And the filler spells feel terrible to use on retail, Frostbolt is basically garbage that you cast to proc other shit and if you go on a bad proc streak it just feels terrible.
---
I can't understand how this wasn't catch during the beta.
---
And I feel like it's adding to the aoe zerg bullshit meta that we are seing.
---
Especially at parties. Bear dance best dance.
---
&gt;Remember how in Starcraft the three factions played totally differently but all had something fun to do? That's classes in Classic.
---
That's so oversimplified, factions in starcraft re somewhat balanced,whereas classic is not in the slightest.
---
Well people who try to use ilvl to determine how good the other player is geared betray them self with it. Excellent way to see that they have no clue and should most likely be avoided.
---
It’s not faction exclusive to gank low levels, come on now
---
Block with your breastplate
---
Why do you think so?
---
I would like them if you don't mind.
---
Hello, top virgin prime here, mana actually does not exist in dnd aside from more casual digital games, spells are usually capped at a very specific number of uses per day if they follow dnd guidelines.
---
&gt;  seems like the level scaling for when these quests become available wants you to group to finish them 
---
Yeah that's how it works, the game allows you to pick up many quests you aren't realistically able to do yet. The trick to leveling by questing in Classic is to stop questing in a zone and go clear out other zones lower level quests before you overlevel them and they turn gray. Westfall is a prime example, you usually arrive there at level 11-12 if you did most quests at Elwynn. First couple quests immediately pit you against 13-15 mobs then suddenly the next quest asks you to kill level 16-18 defias. That's why a good strategy is to stop at around level 14, pick up all those breadcrumb quests that direct you towards Loch Modan, go there and sweep all the quests there. You'll end up around 16-17 and you can come back to finish Westfall.
---
This pattern repeats all the way to 60.
---
It’s sad for the melee cleave groups 
---
But mages have always had the ability to kite with imp blizzard that’s how it is and there should  be no change cause it’s core of mages
---
Same here as shaman. I'm barely 28 and I've got almost 4 bars of binds filled. And I didn't even learn the niche spells yet.
---
Not necessarily, warlocks are a must for serious groups, not only they do their "Fire emitting from body" aoe which is really powerful but they provide summon for bag emptying and soulstone for that one unfortunate wipe. Warlocks are cool (and this comes from a mage)
---
hi, im using KuiNameplates addon, but i only see my debuffs applied to mob; how can i see all debuffs? (from party members etc)
---
thanks
---
Welp, i'm on skullflame but if you see a shami around might be me.
---
There is more management than some classes but it's worth it.
---
The trade off is you can chain pull 2-3 mobs at a time without breaks, solo elite quests, and easily farm mobs 5-6-7 levels above you, meanwhile the poor warrior can do 1 mob his same level at a time.
---
Ye, but it make this class unique and really fun to master.
---
I understand why they made the design decisions they did re: tanking, but I shall forever be sad about how much fun I had as TBC/WoTLK Pally tank and much they trashed it in Cata :(
---
Same thing happened to me too! Is this a warrior way or something?
---
Our AH was filled with lvl 21 green shoulders for vendor price it was super nice!  
---
Also feels so good to help people and emote everyone for that amazing community feeling :)
---
For aoeing dungeons you'll use blizz cone of cold frost bolt frost nova and fire blast. This doesn't include any sort of cool down for increased power. People saying pruning means less options than that in retail are wrong.
---
You could go in to mulgore for the flamingo plainstrider pet :)
---
No there wasnt 1 meta build though. I raided as 4 different specs with destro and was relevant with each. Also pvp builds were different to pve builds.
---
And also right now you definitely dont have many choices. Alot of the times you have only 1 viable choice as the other talents are that much worse. Unless it got changed lately but thats how it was when i was doing the second raid.
---
It's 2019, people know mechanics of fights now. Fear Ward was a crutch back then, you're fine.
---
&gt;Logitech G600 
---
I dont have this exact mouse, but a different Logitech one. I have the exact same issue with the CTRL key. Super weird and frustrating and I can't seem to troubleshoot it.
---
Hunter is pretty easy despite that 
---
You can be much better as a hunter if you’re good doe but it’s easy to be ok with
---
Stun&gt;damage&gt;stun&gt;damage&gt;gouge&gt;wait for energy&gt;vanish and gtfo or go for the kill. You need to surprise them out of stealth, there's no way you can win in a one on one, this goes for most matchups tbh
---
In think Monkeynews from APES managed to snipe one for 500g. Lucky bugger.
---
What an interesting and wholesome story :)
---
It's easy to tell that full is very overpopulated. But I don't want to move as I've made a lot of friends on my current server. So I just queue in using remote desktop if i want to play later. 
---
If I can't manage to do that, I just don't bother for the day. These queues have dramatically reduced the time I play. I would often login at 9pm and by 10:30 I log off.
---
I mean if you're comfortable with it then play however you want, but if you're going to pvp at all then it's pretty much essential
---
NINE NINE
---
Nice idea but hype mages while they r good for farming is boring as fuck
---
It seems you are very well informed about streamers even though you speak very negatively about them and their fans. It's almost like you are actively looking for something to shit on.
---
Yeh i dont like the talents now. Its just like diablo 3, which btw i also prefer diablo 2 talents.

I still don't understand why people still go to gaming journalists for info about new games. Maybe people who aren't gamers I'd understand, but when gamers also do it it baffles me.
---
When I want info about a new game, I go to twitch and find a small time streamer playing that specific game. Smalltime streamers are available and happy to answer whatever questions you have about the game, they will even thank you for asking said questions.
---
If it's an old game nobody streams anymore, plenty of youtube videos that show exactly what the game is and how it's played.
---
Gaming journalists are biased as fuck and in general should not even have journalist in their title.
---
/thread
---
People crying to gm's all the time is what killed the game in the first place
---
I'd omit Shatter in an AoE build, since crits tend to break novas early.
---
I've never played WoW(or any MMORPG for that matter) but classic looks like fun and I thought I'd join in.
---
Main goals would be firstly PVE and later on PVP I suppose.
---
I already ruled out Warrior, Hunter, Shaman, Rogue and Druid.
---
What should I play as a new player? I'm torn between dps with mage/warlock or healing as a priest.
---
I probably prefer DPS but I read that mages are very overpopulated rn and warlocks are at a disadvantage at 60 because of the debuffs limit, but I'm not sure I want to heal either.
---
Help?
---
Lol how petty, your better of without them mate
---
&gt;  I just wanted to highlight 
---
I know, everybody ho makes this kind of potato screenshots has some kind of lame excuse
---
He was in &lt;Gravediggers&gt; on ZT EU, so pretty sure he was just an idiot
---
Grats Nappy!!!
---
Sorta happening in BRD already. Some trash mobs will absolutely tear through nontanks. And if you force a healer to try to keep everyone alive he will be running OOM very, very fast. - Healer here.
---
Ive encountered alot over years of pservers. Its fine if you want to greed but dont go crying if someone else is following a well known and widely accepted rule.
---
Which btw. Most do that dont follow this rule.
---
Imagine if the classic formula had a max cap of 120 and the spells cost scaled as it does to 60... The nightmares
---
That's what I thought. It's one thing to kill the FP, that is a pvp action. Body blocking is completely different though
---
I always try to be careful to not do this by mistake, but if I'm also looking for peasants or something, I'll attack it when it shows up. If dots suddenly appear, I'll do what I can to find and invite the person who tagged it. Kill quests are so much faster with others anyway, I don't understand why some people are so against grouping up.

I know, but still somebody sat down and thought "What should I put as a set bonus for something that requires a few dozen hours to get? Oh yes, 1% to hit bonus sounds about right."

Is it though? It's 5 people running a dungeon - how does that effect you at all? Just run your own dungeon or quest. Frost Mages have an advantage over fire Mages in Molten Core - what do you suggest we do about this?

---
nobody will take you into mc as a fire mage. even less than they did during the original classic. people are much more knowledgable today.
---
My conspiracy theory is that classic is pulling too many people away from retail so they’re going to start artificially squeezing Classic servers (making queue times worse) to shy people away. They probably think they can lure all the players that returned for classic over to retail eventually and they’ll start by frustrating them with queue times. 
---
If classic’s popularity keeps up I won’t be surprised if they try all kinds of things, legit and shady, to get players back to retail. I could see stuff happening ranging from some kind of rewards in retail for hitting certain levels in classic, all the way to an unwanted “balance patch” in classic that pisses everyone off. They’ll disguise it by saying stuff like “people are beating raids/dungeons too easily” or “AoE farming is against the spirit of the game” to explain why they nerf mages into the ground. Just wait and see.
---
now farm the other 17 items that increase your damage by like 1% at best hunter scaling :)
---
Judgement had better ally balance
---
It hits medium at night otherwise its low
---
the thinking i think blizzard is going for is getting to a single layer with all full servers quickly so that come Phase 2 all server will be what at the time was a jam packed deal but today is just medium
---
so there is no portion of the flight master that your mouse can overlap?  i think thats how it works.  wonder if there is some addon that removes player models from your screen.  also i wonder if you could /target the flight master and then use his portrait to get the flight

Cleaves were a thing in tbc too. Resto sham ret/arms in 3v3 was the OG.

CencusPlusClassic

What is the addon that shows stats on the right side?
---
If there were people body blocking on a PvE server would it be considered griefing? They aren't participating in a pvp action. It's no different from people sitting mammoth mounts ontop of small NPCs
---
I really don’t understand why so many people are running out of quests and are having to grind levels, I’m level 45, just finishing up stranglethorn, have a couple left in swamp of sorrows, haven’t even started tanaris or ferelas yet

I had a dung group for WC ready (last one of the night for me before bed). We waiting ages to get a healer outside WC so I went back to ogri to City chat broadcast that we needed a healer and were set to go asap. Finally got someone so I asked for leader from these 2 random premades who had started the group, the gave it to me and I invited the priest. We were about to start killing mobs when the tank and his buddy kept spamming for me to give leader back. I didn't think it was a big idea whoever had leader, in face I was confused as I forgot I even had it. They started trolling and not aggroing mobs for us, the tank then started needing everydrop before he got leader back and was threatening us that both of them would just not move an inch if they didn't get it back. I was suspicious... it seemed like they were going to ninja a drop from a boss or something. So I refused to give it back. Just in case, I asked the other 2 randoms (the priest and a mage) if it were okay that I kept leader as I thought these 2 guys were fishy, they had 0 problem with it. Eventually they were just pulling way too much on purpose, we wiped once. The tank needed a decent intellect drop that our mage or priest could have had. That was the final straw. Me and the priest refused to go any further, then just to see what would happen, I gave the tank group leader, they cleared a boss, I watch the chat and he sets the loot to master looter, grabs the loot and laughs. 
---
Probably the worst WoW experience / player interaction I've had to date. Kinda upsetting that it was in Classic WoW too where the community is actually really nice D:
---
TL;DR 2 douche bags in WC dungeon group flaming to get group leader for some reason, ended up giving it to one of them to see if they'd ninja a drop... they did.
---
I have a personal set of guidelines for success that I follow in WoW and they generally work pretty well. One of those is that anyone who uses alt codes in their names is most likes a kid and will probably cause issues at some point. So I'll always avoid associating with someone like that until proven otherwise.
---
I feel like this will always be an opinion based subject
---
That's exactly what my warning email from Blizzard said.
---
Wat?
---
If so, that is the coolest thing I've heard. I know that pets can tank pretty well, instances to some extent. And that Mend Pet is actually quite OP. But that. That is something else. Wonder to what degree past Gnomer that can continue?
---
Greed, if you roll need you best be equipping that right then a d there

Yes, same with Truefaith.

Metamorphosis made no sense? Dude thats ultimate class fantasy, you meddle in the demonic arts, deeper and deeper you immerse yourself into them and one day you realize that you have become a demon yourself

Warrior, all day long.  Tank/Healer combo runs this game.  Makes finding groups real easy.

---
Hey! I’m playing a warrior (lvl 11 atm) and I was just wondering about why my abilities are taking ages to cast? I use heroic strike and it takes a while to get off, think it’s using is as an auto attack buff. Is there a way to get spells off faster or is it just to slower pace of classic WoW?
---
That's the exact opposite of every single other warrior, threat and tanking resource out there.
---
Yup, 12 year old me never would have had 90g by 40. Now I know how to save/better use of my gold.
---
Shieeet i've taken pictures of this and may change to this spec later in the game. Atm i'm going combat for leveling and using swords
---
Gives the "WoW is an RPG" a whole new meaning :P
---
&gt;useless stuff
---
The whole game is waste of time. Nothing you gain in WoW like honor or gear has any other function but to make you enjoy your time. Killing lowbies is enjoyable to some.
---
Seems like portal can be active, yet not connected to another one. There is a whole ritual needed for it to be ready, and I assume it's to make the connection and make it stable. For instance this one is working, while some in outland just don't work, in zangar for example.
---
That's also a valid reason why they need to know the location of one world to invade it, since through they're demonic prayer, they might ask for the other portal at that location to activate and connect to the one in front of them.
---
They’ve probably been reducing the number of layers on each server since shortly after launch, and it probably varies significantly depending on the time of day as well.  As the population spread over the world after launch, the servers needed fewer layers to maintain “healthy” populations in the zones. Similarly, when a server is down to like 3k total players at 5am, the server may only really need a single layer to seem appropriately (read: not over)populated for everyone.
---
which ones? and do you have any data to back it up?
---
I think I’m well over 30 runs, have only seen it drop once. Is my game broken?
---
Shaman doesnt have a blink. Well enhancement got that feral leap thing but otherwise they got nothing.
---
What do you mean by spell cleave? I only know the spell cleave from warriors, where he/she/it is attacking multiple enemies with the next auto attack.
---
Yes. Also you can make friends if u want. Vanilla = forces you to communicate. Retail = 1 click everything.
---
I’m just saying the polling system worked wonders for Classic RuneScape. It wouldn’t be half of what it is today without it. I’d love to see it implemented in WoW. The polling system denied numerous updates, and even passed multiple reversions to even older standards of RuneScape. It’s joked about, but there’s something nice about knowing that even a glitch founded feature won’t be patched without a massive majority approval.
---
this was mankirk. i saw him after my trainer shook me down for all my silver, i almost joined him...
---
Gets you drunk to boot!
---
While trying to do some arm farming while in the mid 30s I got kicked from countless groups because they all thought my hunter was gonna need on the axe. No, I'm not! It's a god damn dead drop for me!
---
that name made me chuckle
---
There's the issue: you can't know if they will equip it
---
&gt;Okay so lets just get this straight.
---
you're not going to get this straight, you're going to strawman the fuck out of it.
---
&gt;Under your own logic, if I am a druid or paladin in a dungeon if Im rolling on literally everything as need its perfectly okay? As a paladin I can use literally every piece of armor and damn near every weapon for holy, ret, and prot.
---
Yes, rolling need on literally everything CAN be the correct roll as a druid or as a paladin.
---
&gt;Cloth gear? I can use it for holy in dungeons.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Leather, Mail, and Plate, I can use it while leveling so I should need on that too.
---
But ARE YOU GOING TO USE THEM?
---
The point is strictly this. If you're going to actively use the item then a need roll is perfectly ok. If you're just bullshitting in order to sell it later then you're  an asshole. It's simple as that.  
---
Around lvl 25 I put together a group for BFD and I intended to tank it, but my target was the 2h sword from last boss. While the group was forming I got whispered by a Paladin saying he could heal the place. I knew he was after that sword as well, so I took a priest instead. Easy as that. I didn't take the paladin to the dungeon and then bitched on reddit when he rolled need on a perfectly good item for him. I'm not going to take someone through 1h and an half of dungeoning and then expect him to pass on the loot.
---
&gt;Oh and I'm under-leveled for the dungeon so I am generally contributing lower level heals and damage than someone who is of standard level for the dungeon.
---
Then the leader is free to get someone on the proper level to heal it. If you bring someone to the dungeon unless it's stated beforehand that he's there strictly for XP and not supposed to roll on anything then you should expect him to roll.
---
As I said "If you don't want him to roll need on it establish loot rules before going in." Or, take another healer, one who doesn't have any use for Mail or 2h axe.  
---
&gt;You dont see at all how this is problematic or something most people would have a problem with?
---
No, I don't. Selfish people will always have problems with other people wanting the same loot.
---
all of these are straight bunk compared to how cool and fun spellsword is and now i'm mad it will never be a thing.
---
And all her hair color...
---
I always donate my mana pots!
---
I could build paint the Mona Lisa and build the Eiffel Tower if I had a million years to do it. Doesn't make it an easy thing to do.
---
I honestly don't care what rules the pserver community made up over the years. They can keep that stuff there.
---
Warriors start out strong, but i suspect a lot of them will give up before reaching 60.
---
Never has the tier 2 set looked so ugly!
---
Some sites have this as pre-raid bis so can't blame the guy for rolling.
---

&gt;Which makes you an asshole

Some of us enjoy being assholes. Try to understand that not everyone cares to be loved (in a broad sense), their brain is just wired to enjoy more being an asshole.
---
Rolled some Horde back in TBC and trekked all the way to Westfall for a Defias Mask at level 12 or 13 on my Rogue and got my Hunter a Ravager from Bloodmyst Isle.
---
These sorts of trophies just don't exist any more.
---
SHAMONE
---
totally ok.  
---
Are you able to handle criticism ? doesnt looks like it.
---
I’m having similar experiences in some groups; what I’ve been doing is rocking my 2 hander and just dpsing... I actually hold decent threat this way.
---
When I see it getting rough, I pull out the sword and shield, def stance, shield block spam and debuff. 
---
I also play a mage; on him I give the tank a good 5+ seconds and then let loose with aoe.  I almost never pull aggro, do amazing dps because I’m not running from stuff I peeled off; and I use the beginning of the pull as drinking time. Honestly a win-win and I wish other mages knew it.
---
Its the same on ally
---
There is a big lack of agi or str leathers
---
Other classes at least find mails or later plate
---
And for weapons we only do swords and maces
---
No 2handeds and no axes
---
Daggers only as offhand cuz it sucks for leveling with backstabs
---
I wanted to quit around 20-30 cuz of how undergeared I was
---
OP, what addon are you using for your hotbars? I'm looking for one exactly like yours. Is it bartender? I tried using bartender(4?) but it didnt work as it didnt show the cooldown timers...
---
No this “bug” was there in vanilla too. People didn’t do aoe cleave because it wasn’t a thing but in BWL this is how tanks kited mobs on the first boss by spamming demo shout. Blizzard later in vanilla did fix it but long after BWL came out not this early. 
---
They probably saw too many aoe cleaves for their liking but it does violate #nochanges imo
---
Is world chat or LFG channel separated into layers now?
---
Is there any resource to see what changes have been made/are so far planned? Changes from Vanilla to Classic, that is.
---
RNG lords are not friendly. Hope you get it soon dude! 
---
Finally hit 40 today, got the mount and rocking all the scarlet gear. Feels good :)
---
TBC was the best extensions of WoW (shortly followed by WotlK). It has almost all of the elements that made classic great just a little more refined. Druids were finally decent dps, tanks and healers, paladins were more than buff classes, shamans/paladins available to both factions, etc. Shattrath was a great hub. Org/SW were still populated, due to the auction house. Content was difficult and engaging. Arena PvP was at an all-time best during TBC. Flying may have been a mistake, though. I definitely would want to have it back. I played it for about 5 or 6 years on privates and would do it again.
---
Was vent even around in vanilla? I'm thinking it would have been more likely ts.
---
I usually wait a bit to see what others do. Sometimes the whole group rolls need, in which case I do as well. If you see a rogue rolls first and he rolls need on staff of jordan, then everyone should follow with need. But yeah usually it should be everyone greed and need who really needs it himself, but he should equip the object so others can see he isn't gonna sell it, which is the commonly accepted way to do it.
---
MC drops are rare for druids too :P I remember trying to get tier 1 druid gear for transmog. 4 month passed and no shoulders. Just my luck maybe :P
---
I can handle criticism when it’s justified you’re just being unnecessarily mean cause you’re angry at the world and edgy
---
&gt;And also engineering and consumables aren’t required for pvp which Is so nice
---
*Cries in Paladin*

Go on an adventure young man.

Hi, /u/reginnk
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d358ij/question_it_might_depend_on_the_guild_but_how/). 
---
Questing philosophy - true, it's old.
---
Northrend and Outland are proper part of WoW's timeline. Cataclysm didn't rewrite history, only changed zones.
---
The only real QoL change I wish for is alternative specs. Just being able to have your one character (that takes over a week of playtime to get to 60) be able to both PvE and PvP just seems very important to the game as a whole.
---
In retail you only see the starter zone though, the rest is a handful of dungeons.
---
because you have like 5/6 quests in each area and have to constantly circle between them. Feralas is super empty, and swamp of sorrow isn't very full of quests
---
once you get the hang of cooldowns and powershifting, you will do so much better, trust me.
---
There are KoS addons for that, you can add own faction there, you will get warning when they are nearby. Works on guilds as well, if you want to know when your guildie is nearby.
---
Seconded
---
Any references to my my friend mr. rat is a welcomed one.
---
o7
---
Just south of Brill there is a hill with a large building on it, the airships dock here. One of these will take you to Orgrimmar, and from there you need to walk through Durotar to the South-West, across the river into the Barrens. Try to get to the Crossroads - there are a ton of quests here.
---
Also, nip into Orgrimmar and ask a guard to direct you to the Windrider Master to get the flightpoint - you can thank me later :-)
---
&gt;Both times it dropped before I got it I lost it to shamans who needed it for off-spec. First time we had 4 warriors and our healer who was healing in enhance won it. I was pissed.
---
So THAT's why you're being super salty.  
---
Assuming enhancement is their off-spec is where you're wrong kiddo, they are probably enhancemenet specced and only healing dungeons to get loot.
---
Hey thank you for your Reply 
---
A friend told me its possible with food too , haven't tested it yet \^\^ when i login will test it and update  c:
---
No, but they added a cooldown on changing layer
---
&gt; I can handle criticism 
---
Clearly not, because the only thing you do, is reflecting it at me:  
---
&gt; you need to talk   
---
&gt; you’re just being unnecessarily mean   
---
  you’re angry at the world
---
Instead talking about the the topic i raised.  
---
play the ball not the player....   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
No, it indicates the population at that CURRENT moment. The queue thing is BS, otherwise every Full server would have a queue, which simply isn't the case.
---
Not really. You can level a Hunter with your eyes closed. At 60 it does get more interesting though.
---
I’d rather circle between a few areas an actually have quests to do that just mindlessly grind mobs
---
Op is the ninja
---
It's a meme post
---
&gt; snowflakes
---
You're the one crying about it.
---
That’s my fear. Equally, single target without shatter is just terrible. You end up circle kiting individual mobs of equal level which is super inefficient and also quite dangerous as your chances of pulling other mobs go up dramatically.
---
You ain't a real healer until you run OOM and have to desperately open Trade with the tank to give him a Health Potion you were hoarding.
---
Yeah this is why both the community and the Devs get to work together on this and the community opens itself to non existing content additions.. we all have an opportunity to grow this version of WoW and take it in a direction that better suits players and the community.. 
---
I understand some people are here for the nostalgia but they will find that yeah for a while the nostalgia will carry game play.. But it never really is the same because we are so Efficient as adults and prior knowledge kind of derails that youthful innocence that you approached the game with back in the early 2000s
---
Keep in mind faction buffs
---
As a druid tank ie you gain from having salv buffs in ur raid
---
&gt; Soulstone
---
If you wipe, you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt; Eye of kilrog is the preferred pulling tool in many dungeons
---
Nah. Not even remotely. Mages with swiftness potions and iceblock are much better, eye will lose mobs too easily.
---
&gt; Getting past bosses may require voidwalker pseudo tank.
---
Skip the bosses or AoE them to death.
---
They do, it is just that no one has seen them, as they are so hairy that covers everything.
---
Well I think you’re the son of a motherless ogre
---
Yeah private servers got it wrong. Their cone of cold behaves like it did in TBC.
---
Big tiddy goth gf cleavage

The classes I played already felt pruned in MoP.

I personally enjoy it quite a lot (more than greater rifts in Diablo), but I am just pointing out that it is definitely not for everyone.

Most probably aren’t even American. Right wing policies just suck dick.
---
Likely a result of layers being reduced in number but yes, I have noticed this too.
---
A bow with a scope.
---
I've seen it all now.
---
Trade chat has always been used for everything, doubt it'll change :p
---
Frostbite gets you killed when AoEing though. If any mobs get frozen they separate from the pack and lose your slow debuff.
---
Just click away from the feed. I only use two servers and I only ever see the feed for 1 second when I restart discord.
---
It's really a non-issue.
---
Well whoever said that is dead wrong, I just checked and you can get gold for less than $3 a piece already.
---
&gt;Loot etiquette is not that hard and has been more or less understood since Vanilla. 
---
And yet you fail spectacularly at understanding it.  
---
STATE  
---
LOOT  
---
RULES  
---
BEFORE  
---
THE   
---
RUN.
---
If  you don't want the shaman to roll on Ravager tell him BEFORE he heals your sorry ass through an istance with only dps mail and a 2h as drops.
---
Hillsbrad
---
&gt; Teamspeak and mumble look like some kind of 90s chatroom
---
Exactly that makes them so easy and intuitive to use.
---
This is actually pretty sweet. I like that you're just happy to get to play your rogue.
---
*looks at ui*
---
This is clean...?
---
Because some heal paladins like to pvp and are to cheap to create seperate equipments. And trust me. Around the  second to third glowing red hunter pet gnawing on your backside you'll wish you wear plate instead of a bath robe. 
---
Keep in mind boys. Its a collection game. Whichever paladin collects the most rogues/cats/pets wins the healer minigame.
---
i think the exact rules are about circumventing it via means that are not in game, so for example someone could get reported for the addon mentioned and if the person dealing with the ticket was feeling like an ass could ban them same as swapping letters and numbers to spell out things to the other faction. where the potions are something that they have put in game they are fine to use.
---
but in reality i don't think blizz care too much about this sort of rule breaking as it's minor and they would rather have your money than ban you over something stupid.
---
Bonebiter is straight up better than WW axe.  
---
Ravager is good if you're cleaving a dungeon.
---
Definitely. All of our raiding was on vent.
---
See... not talking about the topic, but again reflecting it at me, with nonsense  
---
At this point you are just showing how immature you are.  
---
Happy leveling though !  
---
Good luck
---
Westfall
---
Know those two and played. You are correct.
---
Ya, while having to run everywhere is testing my patience, it allow you to take in the atmosphere.
---
IMHO the fog really helps. It limits the draw distance, thus your ability to compare size to gauge distance, hiding the true size of the world making it seem bigger.
---
Damn no rezzer
---
Honestly when the game launched I went homage but seeing the complete clothie spam I rerolled hunter. With hunter you outrange every clothie in the game so they can’t even cast on you. The only thing you need to be careful if is melee getting in your dead zone.
---
It’s The Knicker...
---
Lambs the cosmic slaughter !
---
If you look closely, you can see the mast that one Hunter has been standing on sniping lowbies while out of reach of the guards.
---
By 2004 every pc a saw had a lcd monitor...but i live in Sweden not a 3rd world country
---
Or you work from home and don't have anything pressing at work currently :)

---
That's what I loved about the original Guild Wars.
---
You were just people
---
you are a shaman, your 957382583468 totems alone make you worth it in any dungeon or raid, even if you just drop it and then /dance during the entire fight
---
I love chats like this hahaha
---
but there's no classic version on that page wtf
---
Nice dude!! I’m well into 40 now and I think I’ll just give up on the axe and move on haha
---
The best example is &lt;APES&gt; clearing MC with sub-60 characters and 1-shotting every boss. Even if they weren't from a private server I'm sure them or another guild would have done the same. The information we have now is vastly greater than we did when the game was fresh and no one had a clue.
---
When does phase 2 hit? 
---
&lt;3 from the same class lol
---
The lock's main roll is to pull. A lock can pull an entire instance better than anyone. Also locks can aoe with the mages, and can serve as a tank for bosses (drain life+siphon life goes a long way). Also just finding 4 mages is harder than finding 3 mages and a lock since mages are in so high demand.
---
Zandalari tribe is balanced and has no queues (well rarely 10min queues). It is an rppvp server with healthy community on both sides.
---
That's there in classic no?
---
It’s called The Nicker...
---
No. It only determines if you can harvest a node. And if you have a chance to fail.
---
I am more disappointed that BGs are coming in P3 or whatever-zillion years later. BGs were major part of experience and now it is just not there.
---
But cross realm BGs suck, everyone agrees.
---
There's a few spells (heroic srike, cleave and a hunter's raptor strike) that indeed enhance your next auto attackl, as a warrior you will get more instant abilities later, with the big one being mortal strike (31 arms talents required, so it's available at level 40)
---
It's in classic..
---
Salute from the prot leveling warriors
---
I have them bound, to strafe left, go backwards, and strafe right respectively.
---
i wonder, does horde player understand what vancleef say ?
---
I'm wondering if it's actually based on 1.12.0, given that we got the old mount system. I just can't think of any other reason they'd specifically revert that while keeping a "no changes" attitude. It takes at least a good day or two of work to roll back something like that.
---
If it is, their reference client might also be 1.12.0 without the fixes to the buff limit.
---
Why did this post get removed? This was a great post.
---
Implying everyone is Fury....
---
&gt;As a warrior, some of my pre-raid BiS gear is leather rogue gear. I'm not entirely sure how comfortable I'd feel rolling against a rogue on something like that. They should arguably get priority.
---
That's why I'm not taking any rogue when I'm running Strat Living or UBRS.
---
Thx
---
That doesn't make sense. So you have to farm or buy a boe blue just to get gold from seller?
---
What? Less the a month into the game and you already have it or is this a old screenshot?
---
Goddamn , people are playing too much..
---
Alright, I'll trust you, just a Swede who have spoken English a majority of my life.

Are these guys wrong, or is the context different?
---
Ah yes the spell where you hate someone so much that you are willing to set yourself on fire to try to catch them on fire
---
For me tanking in classic seems much easier, you just can't really do anything when people immediately start to AoE packs of 4-5 mobs. I'm sure you never tanked in retail
---
&gt;-raid group to make them a scarab lord.-
---
&gt;To hopefully attempt to make them a scarab lord but end up barely finishing ZG and AQ20 before their guild dies.
---
FTFY.
---
Honestly - It is nice, but doesn’t proc all that often. (Again RNG)
---
I much prefer the Bonebiter axe from the Desolace quest chain (Realllly short chain)
---
Bonebiter - For bosses
---
Ravager - For AOE packs (More than 3)
---
&gt;While a healer shouldnt roll need on a 2h axe
---
He sure should if he's using it.
---
I chose Thunderfury because it was a brand new low pop server...
---
Shockadin
---
Definitely saved a wipe on one of those accidental nightmare chainpulls in SM armory by sneaking a MB in there for spirit tap.
---
Havent seen a mammoth in classic. Again turn on friendly nameplates and interaction on mouse left click. Are you unaible to use the fp ? No. Are you beeing ganked and corpse ganked ? No. Then is this griefing? No
---
It is common to hate people this much
---
It was a different time. I think they went a bit too far in a few places though, like when Onyxia does a strip tease in her human form after you beat her raid encounter. How did they get away with that?
---
It upsets me how easily you discard my thicc orc female pelvis
---
If all warriors just wear plate, all warriors become tanks and you cleave just as well as before. The one holding aggro is the tank.
---
We use double the spells on rotation compared to classic
---
Battle-mages are my go to in every RPG.
---
prob played like 5 years ago where it was true
---
It’s gonna take quite awhile to get to 60 and yeah the rebuff limit is a thing but don’t rely on purely what’s best at 60. Warlocks is my vote because you prefer dps and mages are extra squishy so for a new player may become frustrating. Warlocks bring lots of utility to the game and kick butt at solo leveling!
---
Or just don't join
---
its for  dungeon aoeing and single target solo play, like you asked.
---
That's there in classic yes!
---
I just went to willitclassic.com and searched for Luna unit frames.
---
That's just an excuse for being an asshat to others. Wich server are you playing on? Just to be sure we are not on the same on
---
Well, your character in retail has also technically worked for it as well, you've basically taken down every big bad that exists so everyone worshipping you sorta makes sense if you think about it. Just makes for shitty storytelling when the 'hero' can never lose over a story that goes for over 15 years. If only there was some form of reset on the story when we begin again as a lowly grunt adventurer again.
---
A caster can only make use of the stats on a staff. A Hunter can make use of the stats and the physical damage provided. So if anything a hunter has more use of a staff that a caster does
---
I also raided as ele shaman, enh shaman, blood dk, feral druid, balance druid, holy paladin, prot paladin. 
---
All you needed to hear, trying to be elitist when you know fuck all about the game...
---
Oh yeh you are saying about the complex rotation of destro in retails how you use 4-5 spells as well
---
Rogues will save your ass
---
It was both. Vent vs TS is the emacs vs VIM debate of vanilla wow
---
Some like it, some don't, I loved it back in the day but I long since have it up for Auctioneer these days
---
If you're really looking for a server without elitism - Judgement eu is probably your best bet.
---
I transfered to Judgement from Mograine to escape the crazy queue times. I was sceptical about moving at first but the server as grown significantly over the last week. 
---
The main thing i notice about this realm is the amount of newbies on it. I have seen many people here that are completely new to the WoW universe. 
---
There is a much more casual feel to the server. I often run census scans and you can see obvious differences in certian class popularity compare to the more elitest servers. For example, paladins were ~10% pop on mograine, here they are 15%. Rogues are also far less popular here with only 10% pop, crazy low for a PvP server.
---
True, boob armor will just break bones/clavicle
---
Colourised: Night Elf resistance fighter takes aim at Forsaken Armoured Vehicle using improvised anti-tank weapon.
---
More like 0g since you can craft bags almost all the way.
---
This is how it should be.  Need rolls are only for an item you intend on equipping, not selling.
---
What a total gimp.
---
Pretty sure you understand all NPCs. Nessingwary  is a dwarf for example
---
Agreed. I used the staff from deadmines for a long time, and then I used the staff from SM library as well. The damage and stats are insane
---
ESOs sorcerer class actually makes one of the best tanks in the game.
---
I have never seen anyone call enhancement god tier for pvp.
---
Enhancer can work on the most casual level where enemies don’t know how to abuse your lack of mobility. They suck for everything else
---
Hey OP on keybinds you can find a tab called special action or smth like that. Those are your shapeshifts. You don't need them on your actionbar taking up space

There are too many viable options to list after 50+, check some pre-raid BiS lists to find the most optimal one. The above are relatively easy to get.
---
Poor druids
---
ret actualy does good dmg in lowlevel instances
---
its later on he cant catch up
---
I gank so I can get reactions out of people, kinda like this!
---
Honestly, if I ever showed up to a pug with multiple people from the same guild and they said “gonna put on master loot to be safe” I would leave right then since the chances are decent they are just locking down the loot for themselves.
---
You switched from 'getting payed 40k for playing wow all day' to 'getting payed 80k and actually have to work' ?
---
Pretty sure that was not worth it 😄
---
"Free"*
---
42 is actually low for zf as a melee. Also ret is trash lmao
---
the ones in felwood are not, the ones in EPL are.
---
Am I missing something, don't most paladins level as Ret? 
---
Is being vehemently Anti-ret while leveling through dungeons a big thing still? Lol
---
Lots of ally players commenting on this video. Keep beating them cheeks brother
---
I assume you work? You don't need to skip sleep to have 10d gametime over 15 days if you have no other obligations.
---
At least you’ll be the best flag carrier in the game.
---
you can use "/cancelform" instead of specifying each form individualy
---
Or to just go ele if he wants to stick to shaman which is a very strong pvp class and part of every top horde premade setup..
---
I've never thought to ask before now, are there random bgs? Does 'no group finder' encompass pvp as well?
---
Is fused wiring expensive?
---
Grey level players are no joke in PvP if they have some numbers, that's why you have to make sure they're never able to form a herd.
---
The mentality isn't that different... the "players didn't know what they were doing" is overplayed. People aren't retarded and wow wasn't the first mmo for many people, a high damaging PBAoE hellfire and slowing AOE blizzard is OBVIOUSLY going to be used this way. There was plenty of people trying to be efficient back in the day and these were simply using obvious mechanics of caster classes as they have been in other D&amp;D based games.

It was leveling routes that weren't as fleshed out, these were generally.. 'do zones in this order' and no where near the detail as quest order, efficient quest chains orders and objective pointers as todays addons.
---
I think blizzard should block LFG/LFM/group words in trade channel. 
---
I like when everything is sorted and this mess is impossible to sort unless blizzard intervenes.
---
Same with night elves and trolls
---
was that not a ghost mob? looks like a ghost mob.
---
Haha Nice. Question what UI are you using? Looks dope
---
You sound like me!
---
I'm pretty sure it's just a small minority that are already 60. Since 43 or so is the half way point I guess I'm not even half way there!
---
my Dad still uses one of these tube monitors lol
---
I'm all for fun specs like moonkin, but fire mages in MC is beyond that, doing 10% of the dmg of a frost mage is like a tank going with cloth armor and a staff because he enjoys playing the warrior of light. Theres boundaries with this. Unfortunately, fire is super bad in MC, maybe arcane is better? (Also, if you think kiting is a cowards way, maybe a ranged isn't your thing, as even fire mages have to kite)
---
What tank gear? Stam/str/agi leather is all you need. Pretty common while leveling. If anything you get a boost above warriors in the low 40s because you automatically get the equivalent of plate armor while warriors are still collecting theirs.
---
&gt; You comment on every thread about this topic crying about people losing boe items.
---
Show me all the others then?
---
Scoop most of us do our job and still have plenty of free time at work because we can't go home.
---
I just recently passed by that same place, hanged out for a while and decided it would be my retirement place. :) Isolated and quiet, perfect
---
so that's why i see mage aoeing elementals
---
If we are talking optimization a Troll warrior is considered the best horde tank race due to higher threat output. So more like 66% orc for the warrior.
---
I feel you. 
---
/Warlock Gehennas EU
---
That's a really weird way to write Sword of Omen.
---
They weren’t supposed to be in the game until later phases but apparently blizzard didn’t bother fixing sinew loot tables so this is what we got :shrug:
---
Flamelash - alliance side. The server is high pop with very short queue in the evening (like 15mins). It is a bit horde biased (60-40 H-A) so more alliance is welcome! So far server is great and the world 1st Eye of Sulfuras dropped here !
---
Fear Ward is nice and all, but shadowmeld into mind control is on a new level ! Plus starshards is fun as hell
---
sounds like a guild where no sane person would like to be in anyways.
---
Yeah this is not a vanilla thing, I remember people using it for fun when it was bugged briefly around Cataclysm I think
---
I remember a video where they found out how to go higher and higher with the charge, using the ramp + lifegrip from above with flying mounts.
---
I think the charge we have in Classic is some frankenstein version that combines old charge with new charge mechanics
---
So, in vanilla, it wasn't uncommon up to SM, and even later into ST and such to have an Arms warrior or Fury warrior tanking, even with a 2hander out if your healer was a legit badass.  So, keep the DPS spec for the questing, but have a sword and board on standby to tank.  Most will focus on 'of the bear' items anyway no matter if your spec for warriors.  Endgame is changes up, but even in Raids, if we needed offtanks, our Arms/Fury Warriors would sword and board it up and tank when needed.  They'd even pop them out fast if the tank died to save the raid.  
---
Break the mentality of retail of "This spec", you still have all the capabilities of the other 2 specs, without a few 11/21/31 point talents and a few fillers inbetween.  You're not as effective as a tank as a prot warrior, but you can still tank in a pinch.
---
Then I might aswell get a teamspeak server for less money
---
Created group, did not want the mage meta, then tank and heals left due to this.
---
There's more people on location. Let's say there's 100 players in Westfall - game will divide them into two "layers" of 50 players each. So they have same /1 channel, but could only see players on same layer. And each layer have it's own mobs and ores and herbs. If you join party with person from another layer - you would be moved to his layer.
---
Something like phasing from WotLK, but for the whole location.
---
Totally agree, you can also go for 2x Bone Slicing Hatchets, and enchant them both with +15 agi. They also drop from Strat. The chance of getting both Dal'rends are also super low.
---
Words from a fellow hunter.
---
See I just don't agree with your definition of need. 
---
A need roll means I can use this piece of gear right now and it is a direct upgrade to gear that I currently have equipped for my current role.
---
Your definition of need as I understand it is not actually need but fits way more under greed/want. 
---
If my role in the dungeon is shaman healer, then by definition I don't really need a DPS 2-Hander to function in my role. In my current role it's not something that is actually giving me any benefits towards healing. It's also probably not an upgrade over what I currently am using when it comes to healing. I WANT the 2H Axe for my off-spec leveling but do I NEED the Axe to maximize effectiveness in my current role? No not really.
---
This argument is exactly why MS&gt;OS looting is a thing man. It was the standard loot etiquette system for years. I know that we've had personal loot for 2-3 expansions but there's no way everyone just forgot about it right? 
---
Sure if I'm a healer shaman and I roll need on ravager and win over people who are in their Main Spec gunning for it, then sure technically within the rules of the game I am able to do so, but it is still bad loot etiquette and will piss a lot of people off over the long term and can absolutely get you blacklisted/kicked from groups. 
---
It pretty much boils down to you're technically not doing anything wrong according to the system but to people in the group that it affects you're probably an asshole.
---
I still think we have a high tourist population and the chance that all of them hit 60 is low
---
For world pvp, be aware that you cannot get a heal off during the stun against a melee with an interrupt. Use it to  root and get out of range before you heal.
---
Or use Bash - with increased stun talent it's great!
---
Yeah, even in all my healing gear I still manage to pull aggro off the tank when I crit in cat.
---
Yeah this is classic, Druid items are notoriously the most common drop
---
Might be from the Hydraxian Waterlords server.
---
The guild Southshore has a tabard that looks exactly like this.
---
You are right they do level as ret, but they also heal in dungeons. You do not need to respect to heal, you just need to have collected some gear with int on it to equip for the dungeon.
---
7d here with fulltime job. But it's been pretty much work-eat-wow-sleep(not) for me since launch.
---
What you say about spotting a low health target is true. Never let an opportunity for scoundrelism  go to waste.
---
if you go to holy just to take consecration, dropping it + Righteous fury + vindication aura should be enough as a very big aos threat to easily aggro the monsters.
---
Your problem  is the lack of taunt, which mean that if one of your mate take the aggro of a specific monster, you may have trouble to take it back
---
I got a census with 13k people scanned
---
Without the level 1s the most played is either mage or paladin
---
Then warrior hunter rogue priest warlock druid
---
Because not only class mechanics play into it. Stuff like swapping out gear sets, or planning and optimizing trinket/cooldown usage at specific places or times to ensure you get the most uses out of items, farming specific items like defender of timbermaw or crystal charge... all falls into the category of ways someone can push their class pretty beyond its strict mechanical limits. There's always something a player can do to make themselves stand out from the crowd.
---
To be fair, in legion my tanks had to do most of things mentioned in mythic+, but yeah, threat management and stance dancing are two big things that are missing in contemporary wow
---
Can we get this ported to the Unreal Engine, too? For, uh, reasons.
---
Guild on my server called something along the lines of &lt;Operation Furblog&gt; and they're all Furblogs, all the time. Constant Furbloggage.
---
I believe `/cancelform` will cancel any form, if you want to type a bit less.
---
Ice is really cold water :P
---
Population status is relative to other servers. They're also starting to reduce the amount of layers.
---
That is exactly how I feel. I used to play WoW back when I was 16. This game consumed my life for 3 years solid. I stopped playing after freshman year I think. Although, I did resub a couple of years ago when garrisons were a new thing. That was a one month trial then I quit again. The game wasn’t the same. It seemed... easier. There were so many short cuts, and QoL improvements to make life easier it was honestly amazing. Xmogs were a thing too so you always looked cool and uniform all the time. But... it all felt so cheap. I don’t know why. But it did. Fast forward to today. Around 8+ IRL friends got sucked into the hype and started playing classic. I followed maybe a week after and so far it’s been a blast. We reformed our old guild from 15 years ago. I recreated one of my main stay characters I really feel the nostalgia. While I am enjoying myself, I’m also 31 now. I have a wife and a daughter, another one on the way, and a full time job. I mean, the 15$ subscription is easier for me to find now, but the all-nighters I used to pull raiding? That much free time is inexistent to me now. At the end of the day though I’m just trying another 1 month subscription just to see how / if WoW even fits into my life now.

sap, kill totem, restealth, gank shaman
---
Tauren for PVP, NE for PVE :) NE for looks, Tauren for playing on the right faction. 
---
But yeah, war stomp is just so great on a druid, use it to pop a regrowth, root, just get distance, interrupt, sleep a pet, whatever.
---
[Here, I looked the exact other one up](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2ozak/what_are_the_rules_with_boe_items/). There is no fourth, at least not that I remember.
---
&gt; Might want to re-read what I typed.
---
You still don't get the difference about bitching about something and having a different opinion on a topic, do you?
---
Multiboxing:
---
A Person is paying for multiple accounts - in your case 3.
---
Playing on all at the same time and Controlling them at the same time too.
---
There is some nice examples if you search on this reddit of People Multiboxing with 40 accounts (40 shamans for example).
---
It Looks hilarious and probably is a lot of fun as well if you have the spare coin :P
---
Greed unless someone needs it. You're gonna hear other opinions though. Just...ask at the start
---
Well they already dropped the ball but they could have halted character creation of the more populated faction when the servers were filling until they were closer to balanced. 
---
Using faction queues would work as well. 
---
But blizzard couldn't care any less about faction balance. They never have and unfortunately never will
---
We had a Druid in our vanilla guild who was Feral, and he would Tank, DPS, and would Heal.  He was a superb player all around, and has been playing since Beta, and even has the same character still throughout the 15 years.  Top in PVP as well, got HW.  
---
Some situations deemed we needed a tank that could absorb big hits, and Tauren Druids have a lot of HP when they're decked out.  He also kept up with the rogues in Cat form.  He faired well while healing, and usually would focus on DPS in the raid.  
---
Druids are one of those classes if you're open to using all aspects of the character, truly are valued.
---
They prepared for years though, playing on 1.12 private servers
---
9/10 of the time mages never give me int buff back when I give them fortitude. I have stopped buffing them unless they buff me first.
---
No.. theres green items 10 levels higher than that.
---
Is my location and my selected server somewhat important? I mean should i check which server is located closer to me so i dont have too much delay/ping? It seems to me that for example looting and damaging mobs isnt quite responsive as i am used from private servers. I am from Czech Republic and i play on SkullFlame. Should i check this somewhere?
---
Depends on what you like, Warstomp is a good panic move leveling, also its good in PvP as an interrupter, not the best for druids since you have to go out of form to use, but decent so you can use it defensively or offensively depending on situation.
---
Shadowmeld on the otherhand is amazing for a feral druid, its like getting a rogues vanish ability for cat, which if used right can give you big openers as you will be able to effectively put out 2 savages at the start of a fight.
---
As a hunter you should avoid melee combat. Many people will tell you hunter is easy to play, and it is when you are solo questing in the open world. But a hunter can be pretty busy:
---
- weaving actions/spells/movement between auto shots
---
- managing dead zone + line of sight (especially in narrow spaces)
---
- manual control of your pet
---
- inventory space (one bag less because of ammunition).
---
It's not rocket science, but to be honest, none of the classes are - it's still a game for age 12 +.
---
Weird I don’t remember that being part of the classic experience at all
---
Reroll
---
Final fantasy XIV did something similar and that's the second most popular MMO on the market by far just behind wow
---
Traitor!!!!
---
I hope that’s your everyday and not vacation.. either way to each his own
---
Yeah when you're abusing hitboxes for this you're griefing not ganking
---
Yes!
---
From my experience as a druid (and later priest) in vanilla and now a paladin (But still levelling) in classic:
---
The most resilient is the paladin as he can take a lot of punches and has direct fast heals for which he can hold it up for some time. Can remove movement impairing effects with BoF and bubbles for the oh shit moments.   
---
The downside for the paladin is mobility.... that really sucks and no finishers for longer ranges. So annoying to run after almost dead stuff that isn't coming closer. But that is just for PvP.
---
Druids are way more fun. Movement impairing effect? Shapeshift out of it, run away and root the problem. Healing has a plus and a downside. No fast direct heals, but a lot of hots which will tick when it needs to. Also you can moonfire almost dead stuff.  Downside of the druid for me is that in dungeons, you can't be the only healer or be THAT good that no one dies. One battlerez really sucks. So much that I didn't reroll druid. (which I like very much)

I think it is because they keep patching it, and whenever the servers go down you go to the selection screen.
---
Yes, very much so.
---
If there's any money inside it hasn't been looted before.
---
I stated my opinion, you responded to it with yours. This dude tells you how it works and you bust out fucking insults. Shut the fuck up already.
---
It's a difficult skill to learn, but with life long experience in laziness, a lot of endurance and the blessing of our spirit animal, the sloth, nothing is impossible!
---
Have fun being on a dogshit server then.
---
Anyone playing classic with some misguided belief that classic was mechanically superior to retail had their head up their ass. Classic has a lot of charm but almost all of that has to do with the leveling, social, and worldly aspects.
---
As a Priest i prefer a druid tank anywhere outside of maybe raids.
---
I was referring to WW axe
---
I just had a tank take a sliver of damage on the first mob and one of the dps yells "Heal him you muppet!". I said man if you want me to spam heal every bit of damage you are going to be watching me drink a lot of milk and pull a lot of mobs. Idiot.
---
Go inside the mine, only the geo guys and miners will drop it
---
Wait.. World Chat?
---
Yes officer, this post right here.
---
Nice name lol
---
&gt;tanking so far has been draining as fuck. Not because it is difficult. No, doing everything correctly, which mainly consists of sunder spam, hasn't been difficult. So far, decent group members have been more than rare. I tell each and every group to wait a few GCDs before attacking and each and everx time they ignore it. More than often they also ignore assigned priority targets.
---
It's because in classic there's an actual burden of execution on the DPS to do shit properly even in trash pulls, something that got removed from retail long ago around late WotLK/Cata.
---
The reason healers and tanks are often in shortage is because most people don't want any responsibility for shit potentially going wrong, so they play DPS. And for this reason Blizzard long ago removed any remaining responsibilities they used to have like CC'ing and controlling DPS to not overaggro.
---
Classic brought it back and people haven't caught up yet...

Just because they're handsdown the best ganking class doesn't mean we should all play them. They're no the best class for BGs, pretty mediocre in dungeons and can't do raids without the other classes.

If all you wanna do is gank people 1on1 in World PvP then yes, roll a Rogue hands down. But chances are that there are other things important to you.

I play on a full pvp server, its populated sure, but i cant recognize what you are describing.

Maybe dont go to the most popular grinding spots?

I see, thanks for the explanation 😁
---
If it was an actual ninja hit up the person who runs your realm discord with proof. Also bring it up in world maaaybe.
---
You’re probably right though, I did buy the essences of the AH and I did have a friend help me with the 40 elite. But I also spent hours farming the tusks and exploring the zones, so I don’t feel guilty at all. If you’ve got friends around you that can help why shouldn’t you let them?
---
I believe it’s to make someone think about playing a different server that’s not as full as their current one, and thus to spread out everyone better.
---
Didn't knew that, thanks for explaining :)
---
Yeah, in EU only half the servers will be dead in a couple weeks.
---
kinda hot
---
&gt; Well to be fair, it's not as accessable as retail for it. 
---
Yep, aoefesting in classic takes quite alot of coordination and even some skill later on.
---
It may effect us differently? I know trueshot gives raw AP so buffs melee and range for all classes in the aura.
---
You pretty much only use dots and wand

Yours looks like a real warrior. Mine has a long cloak, goggles, fluffy looking shoulders, and a large glowy staff because that’s the only good weapon I could find.
---
Oh. Right. Yea you're correct for sure
---
Never thought that Classic would have such an nice and caring community. Too bad that I don't have the time to enjoy this too. :(
---
Yo, how many of you nerds got stairs in your house?
---
Holy flavour and not arcane, not really viable until PVP gear or BWL are in, because they need spell power. I mean, you can technically do it, it just sucks.
---
Other than that, also not really because a shockadin is more spellcaster than melee combatant.
---
Retribution paladins are closer to the spellsword archetype than shockadins, but they're still not what I'm looking for or thinking of either mechanically or flavourfully. Plus there's that whole thing where they suck right now. But that's a different issue.
---
You are welcome!
---
The first time I saw this was a 40 Account multiboxer and I was like 13 years old back then.
---
It blew my mind how he was playing with the totems of 40 accounts simultanously. Just Looks amazing :D
---
Highly recommend checking it out ;)
---
What a detailed answer. Is there a chance for the list for 2 handers? I’m a paladin and would like to know what can I aim for after my Verigans Fist.
---
Druid is way more fun than the others til 60. At 60....you're gonna wanna be a rogue
---
So just started warlock and people are saying it's super easy to lvl with vw. So what is my strategy? Single target or can I pull multiple at a time?
---
My last desperation is BoP the tank and bandage him :P  
---
They just stand there like "wtf?" trying to attack the mobs aggroing the rest of the party.
---
Breaking in to Hyjal was so fun ...... dealing with the elite Deamons chasing your arse
---
Druid, since if you really don't know what you want to do, the druid basically can do all of it.  Bear has it's perks, but Warriors usually do it better.  Cat is good, but rogues... yea, do it better.  Thunderchicken is good, but mages do it better.  Resto is good, but Priests are better for healing in all situations.
---
Jack of all, master of none.  Good class to play if your undecided, and you'll fall into an aspect you like while playing that one.  Might take til your 60 to find out, but by then, having that much free flow to do so many different things, is appealing to some.
---
It's very easy to burn out in Classic if you just focus on levelling. Take time to work on your professions. Meet new people. Do some casual RP. Things like this break the levelling experience up. A lot of people who hammer levelling will dig their own graves and burn out. Remember that for each period of time you are away from the computer, your character is gaining rested XP. So even not playing, your character is essentially getting better.
---
Thats how you baught weak primarch or weak marines? They should have used bolt pistols ro remove pain.
---
Nahh rogue in Tanaris

I really like the quillboar. Quillboar themed raid would be awesome.
---
If that works for you, go for it. I just don’t trust people who I don’t know to not screw me over with those kinda rules, nor would I expect someone to trust me if I was forming a group. I black list ninja looters and take the stance that you should only need an item you plan to use as an upgrade, if you plan on selling then it’s greed. The whole issue is why I’m not super interested in dungeon spamming as a lvling path and why I’m looking to mostly run dungeons with guildies and my friends once I get to end game, mostly helps get around the pug drama. (Hopefully anyways)
---
My name is Bound, and im an orc shaman
---
I do blame retail for the " GO GO GO AOE INSTANTLY GO GO PULL FFS" attitude I've been seeing from players.
---
This then makes people want to stack groups which can do exactly that I guess.
---
He didn't tell me how it _works_, he came at me with the usual _we pserver people did it like that so everybody has to do as we say because we are the best that will ever happen to you retail plebs_
---
Perhaps there’s a nether guard sub? There’s one for the server I’m on, you might be able to find a guild.

and i stumpled into it's front left foot

almost fall back on my chair, closed game, alt f4, reset, power off, thanks game for that night

Honestly, unless you're in a 40 man with few mobs per pull you don't have to have aggro on all of them. You're a living crowd control and damage soak. Keep the important ones on you, bounce taunt enemies that aren't that big a deal, can even hamstring enemies so they don't reach ranged members before death. It's really not that big a deal to tank in 5 mans outside some bosses.
---
I feel attacked.

In case you're still looking:  [http://classicrealminfo.com/](http://classicrealminfo.com/)

It is based on user submitted data, so it's not 100% accurate.

We had gearscore and it was fucking fantastic it took into account how good your gear was for your spec if you had the right enchants and gems ect you could have a higher score then someone with higher ilvl gear simply by using the right gear and caring enought to gem and enchant it 
---
1000% better then this ilvl shit we have now

Why not both?

Yep and you will make friends along the way.
---
&gt; Nowhere did he insult you.
---
Didn't say that, i was refering to that:
---
&gt; Ive encountered alot over years of pservers
---
It's because there's actually strong incentive to be nice to people now that leveling up takes serious commitment now, epic loot drops are rare, items and gold are valuable, and there is no cross realm dungeon finder, making the class you choose to play significant to the local community.
---
Just got home and checked an I got the 8.2.2 one too. appreciate the help! Downloading the right one now
---
Oh you did provide an answer for sure, though it was revoltingly meaningless, providing absolutely no insight into intelligently and efficiently gearing characters in any kind of context. I appreciate it sincerely.
---
Rank1 nova, coc, blizzard, arcane explosion, fire blast, fireball, frostbolt.
---
Nova and COC rank ups only deal more dmg and don't impact the primary use of the spell.
---
Blizz and AE for unstealthing rogues
---
Fire blast for instant nuke to pull a mob
---
Fireball to get a quick dot on something (rogues/druids)
---
Frostbolt to get a quick snare on a ranged or fleeing enemy
---
 Damn, I have never seen Thunderfury full.  It has always been medium to high population.
---
Paladin for raids since they got almost an endless supply of mana, buffs, plate, blessings...  Holy paladins are pretty OP in raids as far as buffs and defensiveness is concerned.
---
Priests however, are exceptional at healing since you got a group heal, HoT, quick heal, big heal, high regen (if you get spirit), plus fade for threat reduction, threat reducing talents (honestly, never used them, if you know what you're doing should never need them).  What the Paladin lacks for versatility for healing, they make up for with their assortment of buffs and effects/auras they offer.
---
&gt; Unless other people on my server are trying to name their characters after mathematicians too.
---
It's very likely that this is the case.
---
At Firemaw EU it's in Danish / Norwegian / Swedish; Morten logg på Skype! Which is the same only Morten instead of Mike and Skype instead of vent.
---
all i see in general chat now is people doing dungeon cleave, tried creating a new character in a fresh realm...hopefully people will be more relax there.
---
I really don't understand why they thought they would have to go for "full homogenization". PvP was great in Wotlk (less so in TBC, where healers were fucking immortal, although I admit I had fun with my disc priest, MCing rogues off a cliff). Sure, it wasn't completely "fair" or "balanced" or whatever, but trying to achieve that is a fool's game anyway, given the numbers of variables you have to deal with.
---
How is it possible to rush for t2 chest when bwl isnt out?
---
Again, happened on regular servers too. You'll just ignore that to push your shitty narrative though.
---
It's because it's the easiest class to level therefore the most prominent class to still be playing the game despite not knowing shit about anything. Every player on other classes that is equally shit would have dropped out or fallen so far behind that you won't ever encounter them, but not hunters, hunters got a pet to carry them.
---
For a mage maybe, you arent playing properly if you rely solely on Shadowbolt.
---
what is the addon name that shows all the stats on the right please
---
Destro was fine. My guild cleared heroic icc 25 and i was never at the bottom. I preferred demo for the buff though as later i was the only lock in the raid. 
---
Also just because something isnt doing as much dmg as fury warrior or fire mage doesnt mean its garbage lol. 
---
In regards to my earlier post i was saying about destro doing alot of dps, i was simply saying that destro's rotation in wotlk isnt much different to retails destro rotation. I dont see how you guys keep thinking i am saying that the destro was number 1 dps....
---
They sadly need T2 or PVP gear to be viable. Right now neither of those two things are in, unfortunately, PVP gear's phase 2 and BWL's phase 3.
---
I'd also consider holy-ret shockadins far more caster than melee combatant, and even if they were truly viable and melee focused (like for example...a straight up retribution paladin), I still wouldn't consider them to be the kind of spellsword archetype I'm after because they don't have that arcane flavour. They're still holy.
---
I'm not disregarding the existence of retribution paladins because they suck, so much as they're just not the archetype I'm talking about. Enhancement shamans are there mechanically, but they've just got too much nature flavour going on for my tastes. It's purely an aesthetic/class identity thing.
---
Can you explain how these 2 spells work?  I don't know when I need to use Dampen magic or the other one you get at the same time.
---
Oh really?
---
don't remember ever seeing that happen
---
9/10 of the time priest never give me fortitude buff back when I give them int. I have stopped buffing them unless they buff me first.
---
Oh wait... nobody gets a buff...
---
You can play retail this way if you really want. You are never going to get the "classic" experience because so much of that was based around ignorance at the time. You can never turn back the clock to 2004. You're never going to force people to play the way they did back then. Enjoy classic for the leveling experience and its charm but be ready for disappointment if you are expecting to relive "the glory days".
---
As alliance you got to go to Horde territory for 9 instances feels bad man :/ never should have switched
---
I hope worse than that. Keep in mind that that asshole personality likely carries into the real world too.
---
I think you overestimate how much blizzard log.
---
Cloth vendors for 25% more if made into bandages. If you're vendoring cloth for mount money, you may as well level First Aid.
---
&gt;Don't 'spect a warm welcome.
---
Yeah idk about your server but horde seem to be the only ones camping lowbies on mine. Might be a biased sample because they outnumber ally 2:1. No complaints here though, it's classic; sweaty players camp lowbies, and also pick horde for the better racials. Just makes sense really.
---
You get a discount to pretty much all services (except for resetting talent points).
---
Not on my girlfriends old Macbook Pro from 2012!  
---
Graphic setting on 1 and scaling to 50% to be able to maintain 60 frames and not let the CPU throttle.  
---
To be fair, I'd rather be able to play with shitty graphics when we are "on the move", than to not play at all :)
---
You could play Ashzara Mythic for decades and still won't be able to kill her with greens.
---
Right? I was on vacation in Spain last week, and after being on the beach for 4 hours, I enjoyed the cool breeze of the AC while doing some quests. 
---
My guild went absolute apeshit when I first logged in “YOU’RE ON VACATION GO OUT AND ENJOY IT!” Motherfucker I’m an adult and I will enjoy my vacation however I damn well please!
---
I am Frickinfrick! wHeN WILl yOu LeArN
---
Because the 90s apps were known for their terrific UX design?
---
All will fall to death and decay. Serve Nurgle and bring this joy to all
---
You know you shouldn't be using blizzard in "spell cleave" groups right? Your runs would be so slow.
---
In my experiences in Vanilla, when someone joined a group as a paladin to "tank" people would literally drop group.  Ret paladins got a lot of hate as well back then, but prot was possibly looked down on the most.  People who played Paladins either went ret/holy to pvp, or would go holy and raid.  Prot Paladins were gimped and unfortunately never saw a fix til TBC.
---
Again, it didn't, at least not in the servers I played on.
---
What is this "bis" i see everywhere?
---
I had some guy argue with me yesterday that we should keep the server-select-upon-login because it was how it was in vanilla.
---
Some people will go to unspeakable lengths to preserve the ExPeRiEnCe
---
You write all that without explaining your point and I’m retarded. Alright.
---
Lul
---
What a time to be alive, being a poor back then with my call center headset trying to get ts up and running.. the satisfaction of finally getting everything set up was worth it lol.
---
I'd say you should mention before the run Begins that BOE's will be needed and not the other way round.
---
It is common to Need on things you Need. And to greed on things you will sell/DE.
---
Why would we suddenly just turn it around?
---
Yeah there are Def more than one grp type going on atm.  Just don't run cleave groups of its not to your enjoyment.  Start a grp and fill it old style.  Plenty of non meta DPS classes will thank you and you'll fill the grp fast.
---
It was more around 400 spellpower with good gear ;P it was amazing, and it was also for the healers and balance druids and shamans as well. Lets not forget about them. 
---
+ the dps when you were just spamming soulfire was huge and very much welcome on some encounters.
---
I'm a tank and I deliberately avoid cleaving or "farming" groups. Or groups that say "fast run". Or groups that advertise in caps, or by spamming the channels.
---
Well to give you some perspective, I'm at 10 days and 3 hours played right now.
---
No better tradition then the tradition of alliance and horde constantly shutting down each others throats while in hillsbrad... elsewhere I could care less about killing anyone cx
---
Good to hear you are having fun!! My advise is look for a guild with an active discord and just join the Channel. Also be active in guildchat and organise dungueon runs and other stuff!
---
Yes they do and yes it works
---
That's odd. I had no life back in vanilla and was playing in a server first guild and I do not recall any AoE meta.
---
My groups would just clear everything fairly quick regardless because we knew our classes well and didn't waste time between pulls like I've seen a lot of people doing in Classic, even in cleave groups.
---
it's 2 clicks, I think you'll manage, nobody is that lazy.
---
Try turning off the Post Process AA and see if that changes it.
---
really so lets just let the rogue have shadowfang? that 500g-1000g world epic drop just give to whoever can technically use it? a low value blue can be greeded on because who gives shit about that.
---
So 2 spells?/Frostmage. Jk but really i would not mind having 50 spells per class or more even. that would make the game interesting again there is not much depth atm if you can play one class you can play them all
---
I mean afterall it says "Need".
---
And if the rule is unspoken you can't expect People to know it and say they don'T follow it beforehand.
---
It is NEED and GREED and not NEED if it's a BOE and for the rest it's as usual :D
---
Pretty skinny for an orc
---
The Hills are Thighs
---
When you're solo, always try to stick to single target because multi target pulls get risky in vanilla no matter what class you play. As a warlock or hunter, you just have the benefit that your pet will likely be the one to die before you do, and that might be enough time to get the job done. 
---
Voidwalkers in vanilla so not hold aggro as well as they're supposed to, so while they're likely the best pet to level with due to their taunt, you should be prepared to take some damage from time to time and try to avoid this by having your pet engage first.
---
Just go in interface options and select interact on left click. Then oress shift(v to display friendly nameplates and its solved. Dont blow this out of proportion if you can literaly just click the nameplate and use the flypath
---
As an alliance, this picture gives me anxiety lol
---
This rule already existed in vanilla and the only people crying are the ones like op and you.
---
Adapt or accept but dont cry, im not here to have a conversation with you just for the sake of it
---
I would fall victim to a Succubus :’(
---
Did something similar yesterday. A human warrior helped me out with an elite. He asked me to wait, so did I. When the elite respawned, we fought it to 30%, then I vanished and kept the alliance scum in stunlock, waited until he got finished for extra repair costs and then finished the elite by myself.
---
Because greeding is just setting yourself up to get ninja'd
---
ye I agree. Its all humans after all in most cases they only take the fight if they are 99%
---
sure they can win
---
Need on something the character you play will not wear and its not an upgrade is totally unacceptable, whether its boe or not.
---
Dont try and justify your greed.
---
I may join an rp server, ask some kind of leave or safe passage lmao.
---
Thx 4 the answers
---
Tauren gets 5% extra health, which is definitely a great racial. War Stomp is not only useful for PvP but also is a lifesaver in PvE; I’ve had multiple occasions with mobs spawning on me while fighting in cat form. In that case a /cancelform, war stomp + regrowth into bear form saves you a corpse run.
---
Talking of which, night elves have faster corpse runs don’t they? ;-)
---
Nice generalization /s.
---
Depends on the ilvl and how weighted each stat is. Items with wider distributions of stats will have more total stats.
---
Ahaha hahahaha I definitely do this!  And drinks as well.
---
It's an Everlast
---
I remember how cool these mysterious inaccessible areas were in vanilla WoW. I didn't even play long enough to see all of them unlocked as the game very quickly went down a bad path in WOTLK, imo, with cross realm dungeon finder.
---
&gt;Also just because something isnt doing as much dmg as fury warrior or fire mage doesnt mean its garbage lol
---
It's more the fact that demo and afflic did 3k dps more than destro not other classes, but what you are saying is true.
---
I believe that your exorcism crits against undead at least.
---
Why tho? They have stealth, mobility, heals, defense, root. They can change forms to adapt the situation or run away from a defeated battle. You cannot catch them or run from them easily. Yes  their damage is not amazing but along with mages, rogues I think they are pretty solid wpvp class.
---
Down voted for asking a question regarding the game pepehands
---
/target **insert name**
---
I mean.. your literal class weapon /is/ a staff to be fair.
---
Yeah, and needing 6000 GS to even be considered for a nm ICC was awesome aswell... Overall people required you to have a stronger itemization than what you could find in that instance.
---
In vanilla there are like a ton of abilities you rarely use
---
I mean, it is free. No asterisk needed. There are paid options, but it *is* free for anyone.
---
Thanks I will keep this in mind, it has been a long time since I leveled in a pre-cata zone and have forgotten more than I thought I did.
---
New meme format. Don't like.
---
As you were.
---
Is the skill find fish in classic wow? I can't remember if it was in vanilla or later.
---
Remember kids,
---
Mana pots are cheaper than repairs
---
I’m so glad I rolled on that server when it opened it’s a good one
---
It's noteworthy that we are playing a patch that has improved a lot of classes to a point where they perform better than they used to when MC was current content.
---
So not only do we pay better than we used to, our characters perform better than we're used to from when we last ran MC
---
I'm absolutely loving it haha, wish I would have played years ago but I can't complain
---
&gt; The only skills that, if the description is to be trusted, scale with weapon damage are the ones where percentage is mentioned, like ambush or riposte. Or what am I missing?
---
Mortal strike scales with weapon damage at 100%, just like ambush scales at 250% (or w/e the number is).
---
Flairs on mobile aren't working properly so sorry for the wrong flair. Mods need to include a special CSS list that allows apps to list them properly.
---
That's beside the point though, to claim that the last patch of an expansion was closer to the next expansion is just plain wrong
---
I love seeing dicks abusing what little power they have in a server because you just know things must not be going so hot for them if they resort to these things.
---
Guys stop taking puctures of your monitors. USE PRINT SCREEN BUTTON. So dumb i swear.
---
[There aren't tons of Horde quests there,](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dustwallow_Marsh_quests) but sure! Beezil's Wreck is a fun one; very flashy with lots of lightning bolts zapping around. You should probably stay on the east end of Dustwallow though.
---
With that logic, you could just need on everything and vendor it all for AH blues
---
You're probably being a little too dismissive but I share the sentiment. Every single person here is on a list and having their activities monitored by various companies. Do I really care that Discord knows how much WoW I play?
---
Sword of Omen is Horde only and this is talking about Alliance only quest reward.
---
Yeah, two entirely different abilities and heroic strike works like you said. As a warrior tank tho, you shouldnt really use hs since you need rage for otjer abilities like revenge, rend, demo etc.
---
Cant really comment on dps tho since im usually shoehorned into a tank role by guildies
---
amplify magic i use in melee heavy dungeons, makes healing for my girlfriend much easier.
---
The lack of stamina makes me wince a little :D
---
You still have to talk to them
---
Spamming general or trade chat ruins the social aspect. Just keep it in LookingForGroup and it makes it better for everyone.
---
Fuck LFG add-ons. Removes the need to actually make friends.
---
happy cake day!
---
lock here:  yes constantly
---
The way people just trade shit their class won't need is so golden. Love healing dungeons getting mana pots thrown left and right. I return all the health pots I won't use. Peak gaming really.
---
In vanilla, I always ran out of quests at level 55-57 and ended up grinding ghosts in western plaguelands in combination with dungeons. It was worse earlier in vanilla when Silithus was just empty with pretty much no quests though. I've never had any issues with running out of quests before that, but it definitely helps to do some dungeons in between the questing. Stranglethorn is also exceptional in how many quests and how much xp you can gain in such a short time.
---
http://classicrealminfo.com has some, but not sure how accurate that is. No official way to check what you want.
---
Classic isnt well balanced
---
Lul, we did
---
Noggenfrogger is good , active discord aswell with server events. A bit more horde sided but not too bad
---
Fair point
---
Long cloaks are the best. When you get your first cloak that isn’t a napkin it’s great.
---
I started using discord but it's a lot of flashy advertisements... a lot of gfx for just voip.
---
Ah yes, enslaved unsub
---
What is your solution for making people behave differently? The only reason people didn't do this back in OG vanilla was that people were simply far more ignorant and had a totally different set of values. You are going to find as much success asking people to behave the way you remember vanilla players behaving as you are asking the same for people on retail. The game simply wasn't designed well enough to discourage this type of behavior and people nowadays are smart enough to know how to exploit how borked vanilla was.
---
Strange, because defense stance demo spam hasn't failed me yet.
---
Send for Al Gore!
---
"love your mother ass"
---
My blood pressure just shot up reading that.
---
&gt; To say that PUG rules/loot etiquette doesn't exist would just be ignorant man. I get it that you're pretty heated about this but PUG rules/loot rules absolutely exist.
---
And judging from how badly you're being downvoted here on reddit seems like you don't get them.
---
Haha yes I've literally never had to do this as a mage. I'm trying to remember what 2006 was like
---
to be honest, I now understand why the alliance run ganking squads in the area..   Basically every other Horde quest there is ' Kill 15 farmers'  Kill 10 Blacksmiths...   Make this poison and feed it to a dog...
---
Those alliance are just heroes that want protect the common people!
---
HE WISHES HUMAN FEMALES WERE REAL
---
Guess Earthfury is not dead afterall!
---
Thats easy to say when you healing and dps spec share gear, I wonder if you are going to press grees on the maraudon wand if you heal that dung because you are not there as a dps and the wand doesnt give any healer stats
---
Haha nerd.
---
Welcome to a pvp server my dude.
---
The **only** use for Amplify Magic is to drop on a tank for a boss that has only melee skills, to boost the heals. Maybe drop on the party when you're killing something that has a non-magic aoe, but that's super rare
---
Agreed. Funny you mentioned trolls tho, I feel like people who play trolls and gnomes are the most likely to randomly gank you
---
I would hold onto mageweave and wool cloth in particular to sell on the auction house later in a servers lifespan.
---
I had more success by selling my stuff in the AH. Both cloth and leather sells way over vendor price. The real low stuff is bought out fast enough, so people will always see your listings, too
---
Im tired of these 10+ posts each day.
---
You really think ive invented the "all roll need on blue boe"?
---
And if you actually were able to read more than 2 sentences you'd comprehend my post which is offering solutions to this.
---
But apparently youre not
---
How else do you text to speech macro about your ROFLcopter?
---
The name is red for a reason! Alliance are kill on sight
---
This is my first time leveling in Vanilla, but I played from TBC up to Cata in retail. Maybe that's the reason why I don't feel completely lost all of the time. But I do notice some differences that I had to read up on. Yesterday for example, I've maxed out fishing and cooking to 150, went back to undercity thinking "Well, I can learn the next step at the same NPC as before". Nope... Turns out that's different now.
---
And I feel lost when trying to find dungeon quests. I still know all of the level requirements for each dungeon, but finding these quests completely escaped my memory. Something you don't need to worry about in retail because they packed all of the quest NPC's inside the dungeons. But here it's almost impossible to find all of the quests on your own while still have a character in the general leveling range.
---
I try to use no guides where not 100% needed. But I have always a quest database open just in case I spend again 45 minutes searching for a mob that, as it turns out, was in a different area than I expected. xD
---
I like it when I have to care about ammo, pet skills and shit. This adds the role play flavour to it.
---
What?
---
There’s a couple of old exploration spots I used to hit up in classic like this that I’m curious about.  I seem to remember both using noggin fogger to get there but also I remember somehow getting there just by walking up a certain hill no jumps.  Its been 13 years though...
---
 RemindMe! 33 Hours
---
Nice! 
---
I'm loving the classic dungeons again. It's nice to have dungeons that were built to be dungeons, and not built to be a Disneyland ride on rails. The feeling is so different. We used to have dungeons made to be realistic and part of the world. A dwarven city was a city. A monastery was a monastery. Now they're all just so obviously built to be a guided attraction instead of a realistic part of the world.
---
Biggest server population if you are worried about servers pops down the line. arugal is also horde heavy if thats your thing.

---
There's one for every class here if anyone else is interested.
---
he is actually the mage's apprentice;  he polymorphed himself as a chicken to hide in plain sight because his master is crazy and abusive.
---
Because they really wanted to believe that a huge amount of what they don't like in retail is that we aren't as naive as we were 15 years ago. It's the same mentality that leads people to say that smashing 1-2 buttons in classic is true hardcore raiding difficulty.
---
[Like this?](https://imgur.com/a/1AWR49T)
---
&gt;  I do not recall any AoE meta 
---
I'm not claiming it was meta, merely that it was done and was efficient if done correctly. I imagine that it takes a competent group - aka not that common back then even though everything was relatively easy - which wasn't that easy to find. Three competent mages? I know I had one mage buddy, a lock buddy then we would get a random third who was of variable degree of ability. If either of my good player friends were not around then it was less reliable - but my bbf warrior could carry if things went south to a degree.
---
Remember that back then there was no youtube, people did not record their gameplay all that much and there was no streaming. If you, as someone who had never done something saw some guy on the blizzard forums claiming XYZ most people would discount it as impossible/etc. Especially normies. The content wasn't hard (some was punishing, pre nerf/fixed strath/scholo with fast respawns for example - punishing because if players screwed up they had to reclear) but it was hard enough for most of the playerbase that five manning things was difficult.
---
How are you liking vanilla? I sort of regret not getting back off the wagon but.. time these days.
---
Chilling in bed at 2:00 am because I got work at 4:00 am fml

iLvl has always been there, it just used to not be shown. GearScore used iLvl as part of its calculations
---
You can use fp no matter how many people are at it
---
It started out as a simple concept years ago but people like yourself have twisted it over time. 
---
It’s not complicated. 
---
Need is for items that drop that would be an upgrade to what you are currently using, you roll need if you are equipping said item. 
---
Greed is rolled when you want the item to sell because you want the gold. 
---
Need and Greed. No idea why it’s all twisted now but I imagine it started when greedy pricks started rolling need in everything and over time the rest started to prevent from getting ninja’d. 
---
That doesn’t however actually change what Need and Greed means.
---
you wrote that you turned in the head right above? ;__:
---
In retail it's usually literally just "Hey, this objective we have that you already know is being made a bit harder because of these murlocs" or "these quillboars are bothering our farmers". I find the classic quests a LOT more entertaining. They are usually quests with their own little back story seperate from the single big chain, and they always make you feel like an adventurer helping out a citizen of this world.
---
I wanna add to that, I don't think classic feels half as grindy as retail. In classic your leveling experience is broken up by your quests. 1 quest is quite a task, you have to read, puzzle it out, travel to find the place, do the quest which takes way longer, and go back, with fulfillment at the end of each quest. In retail there is no fulfillment, and the quests are so streamlined and easy that the seperation between quests is so insignificant that doing quest after quest starts to feel like it does to kill mob after mob. It's so easy that completing all of your quests is just a matter of switch your brain off, and sit through the drag until you reach max level, which will be the first moment of real fulfillment. The entire leveling process feels like 1 long grindy quest.
---
Yup, definitely. I loved legion, but BfA was all of the parts I didn’t like from legion multiplied by 50 lol
---
Which rule, your "unspoken" rule?
---
You should clarify if you want to turn it around like this, because the other rule is quite literally spoken/written:
---
NEED vs GREED in their original word sense.
---
Carried implies that you aren't contributing.  When you are around 1-3% worse because of a few different talents you aren't really being carried.    You better be bringing every single consumable to every raid as well as being engineering or else you are clearly being carried.
---
This is awesome. Thanks
---
Lmao this guy rogues
---
You're right, I thought Neverwinter Nights utilized mana but now i seem to remember it went full DnD with spell slots per level.. Is thst right? 
---
What was the first cRPG that did?
---
And in any case, Blizzard went with mana instead of spell slots per rest for magic users, so that includes hunters anyway.
---
Try reading the entire post next time.
---
Good idea! I don't honestly remember how I managed this as a druid which I also got to 60 haha
---
To be fair, when I typed that comment, I checked a popular gold selling site and was quite surprised to see how little the gap is now.  The last time I looked the gap between the token and a gold farmer was a lot higher.
---
Well I know what I'm doing when I get off work
---
You asked for general consensus. You were given general consensus. Dont ask for apples and complain you didnt get oranges.
---
Somebody already explained you should be spamming sunder and not heroic when lvling anyway, heroic is straight up bad and doesnt add much to dps
---
Finding a group as a rogue has always been tough in every iteration of the game. You'll get groups for Strat if you have good lockpicking because no one wants to do the key quest. After that, you're just the "we need one more but I don't want anyone rolling on my cloth/plate"
---
I’m having lots of fun with the specific rogue gameplay, walking around in stealth mode stealing from every humanoid’s pockets, lockpicking, using sap to better manage a fight... I also find that making sure you have good weapons makes a big difference in terms of enjoyment.
---
I'm not trying to argue with you my guy. I dont care about reddit downvotes. They just mean a few people disagree. Its not like I got -500 or anything. We just have a fundamental disagreement. Nothing crazy.
---
Yea that is true, but for me I'd rather use something that I control and I know where the data ends up (eg. self-hosted VOIP) when I have the possibility to.
---
*Ight Imma Head out*
---
Amp is strictly to make healing better in dungeons without much magic damage.   It is also useful for trolling your friends who have poison/dots on them.
---
&gt;Never thought that Classic would have such an nice and caring community.
---
Until you turn on LFG chat, then it's one of the most cancerous community you'll ever see in a mmo.
---
Probably not as bad as the 'jeez don't you (ungrateful morons) all have mobiles??' guy.
---
There is always opportunity to sell for more especially if a tailor is buying up bulk cloth to skill up at that moment. But a lot of people vendor their cloth without thinking.
---
Hunters are in tune with nature and use magic to tame pets and shoot magic arrows.
---
This comment need more attention...
---
LOL thats 100% me
---
I bought no new skills after level 32 until I had my mount. I started selling stuff instead of disenchanting. Grind salthorn basiliks(?) in the shimmering falls a lot, they are just south of the encampment. Dropped a lot of greens for me and some pretty valuable greys which add up. Then I borrowed 20g from a guildie which helped of course, but I was getting 10g a day even so. Kept hearing about people who got 5g an hour or more, but never understood how that happened because I never got that even though I tried the methods they were using.
---
Are they all Britney Spears fans?
---
I’m jealous. Didn’t get mine until 36 because I was the highest level of my friends.
---
Not sure then, hope it gets sorted out
---
My solution is to clarify, if you didnt and got flipped dont address them as ninjas or atleast give a reasoning when calling them out.
---
I prefer need rollers over greed rollers in my grps because i know there will be no drama.
---
Bought my Lei of Lilies for 10g of the AH. I now have my own potion printer and I'm no longer required to live of donations. Still take them when available and exchange them for healing potions. I know you like them warriors!
---
It looks so hairy
---
Classic literally does have a long term future, you can’t base your argument around something that is completely false and pulled out of your ass.
---
My thoughts are: As long as you're having fun, it doesn't matter.
---
Funny thing is that move is built into both my STR &amp; MTR as in, whenever it's up I use it, totally forgot to include it in the rotation.
---
Was trying to do Maurodon Princess run to tick of the quest in my log. Each time I asked I was spamwhispered by about 20 melees who want the +hit ring from princess but refused to be in a group with other melees because they all wanted the same thing. 
---
All warlocks, priests and amges however wouldnt go there because she drops pretty much nothing caster relevant with a good drop chance and they are busy ZF spamming.

Might be a little late, but only buy the recipes you'll use for grinding profession levels or for gear you want as a personal upgrade.

How so? Doing full runs with people because it's a short instance but you get a lot of loot? Or is it one of those stealth runs where you sneak in, loot a chest, and reset instance to repeat it?

Yeah. Battle shout is kinda stupid, when tbc launched the threat generated was changed from 55 per buffed target to 50 no matter how many people got buffed.

I made the list in my comment myself, since I couldn't find a decent 1h list (like OP). Luckily, lists of 2H weapons are much more prevalent! I really like the one on [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live/guides/727/2h-weapon-progression-wow-classic-phase-1). It focuses somewhat on Warriors, but it should mostly, if not fully, apply to Paladins as well.

And if it changes it starts to head down the same path of WoW was doing in the first place.

Reddit is a fraction of the playerbase, and even less check it daily.

Advertising it here wouldn't do much, try advertising it in General channels, Trade in cities and World.

Last night I had a warrior tank LBRS in berserker stance with a 2hander. We had an all melee group and our rogues were using blade flurry and he refused to use sword + shield because "lack of focus". Needless to say the dude was being rocked by the mobs and as the healer this made the entire run awful. These cleave groups have destroyed the tanking community as they think they can pull all willy nilly like they're still in scarlet monastery. With the recent nerf to demo shout let's hope this is a wake up call to some of the lesser skilled tanks.
---
There's nothing wrong with that tbh
---
The real problem is that there's not only your party, but every single road gás at least 6 other people on the same hero level as you, maybe higher
---
If everyone can do that, let's be honest, it's not impressive at all
---
Yes.
---
Before Cata, the main characters in the story were Thrall, Varian, Jaina, etc. After Cata, the whole story revolves around the Adventurer (you). It devalues the story a lot because you know you're only one of the millions, and everyone is getting their ass licked. At least in times of Jesus Thrall we actually had a Jesus.
---
I know I’m late to the party but I agree with u and remember vanilla. the way u describe it was common etiquette.
---
imagine not transfering to emptier realms just to contribute to the queue problem :-)
---
&gt;Not sure why people.....
---
Then you really havent been paying attention here...
---
naaah dude, we only accept best classes, only minmaxed!!! and u better have few specitic talents,  no wasted DAMAGE IN ME GROUPS!!!!!! fuckin memespeccs NOT WELCOME we GOT NO TIME TO WASTE
---
Nearly everyone solo levels most of the time.
---
Interactions range anywhere from 2 minutes to several hours. The difference is that player interaction actually exists.
---
Of course people group on retail, but no one talks. Even if I love my group it's not like I'm going to become besties with my dungeon finder pals because they're not even on the same server as me. Friendship is completely deincentivized.
---
Here I am running around giving every person I pass buffs for free and this guy's playing 3D chess.
---
I hope you and went to do an dungeon afterwards...
---
Sounds pretty unreasonable thing for him to do if he agreed to it at the start of the run. Nothing wrong with selling your services as long as the whole group is on the same page about the situation.
---
The translation BM is honestly funny as hell. One of my friends found the translation for G A N G G A N G on horde and we spam that if we run by Alliance players. Usually gets a good /lol
---
I'm sure this is a dumb question and I'm missing something obvious, but my brother has made an account on oceanic, and wants me to join him. For some reason, the oceanic option does not appear when I look at the region list. I think I have the europe region list, judging off of a list I've found online. How do I change so I can select oceanic? I've tried changing my region when logging into the battle . net launcher, but it doesn't seem to change my in-game region list
---
If you just pay attention to saving money via selling everything, making bandages to sell instead of selling cloth, choosing quest items that vendor for the most, and not training all spells, you will absolutely have your mount by 40. I started paying attention to saving at 37, and had the gold a bit before I hit 40. Overall, I think people overestimated the difficulty of getting the first mount. I didn’t find it difficult at all. Just make sure to grind some good mobs like tigers or gorillas in STV on top of everything else. I’d be surprised if you don’t make it to 90g by level 35.
---
Technically still 8 because you need to hold Shift and 7 for the Slash, or?
---
wowhead has a BiS list... the quality of it varies from class to class though.
---
They do, I explicitly mentioned having a bad experience trying it out. Also way too many guides, too much information to sift through, which is why I came here hoping for more direct answers.
---
bikini armor best armor
---
Almost every person I've seen in this guild and Symphony of Souls are all toxic af. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I have a friend in a guild called The Council and everybody in there was super nice and wanting to learn. I'd shout out my own guild cause I feel it's the same but not gonna do that here.
---
Some might be more reliable depending on class. Maybe post your class to get more accurate suggestions
---
0.5 is acquired from upgrading the dungeon sets. The upgrade quests are not out yet. The blue set items off late game bosses are called Dungeon sets or tier 0.
---
Which means I, the Healer, will "generate" (get accredited) more threat.
---
That is a long deep rabbit hole I'd just look it up
---
What you're talking about isn't a hack. It was probably just the pet debuff exploit. It crops up every now and then. Corrupted Blood most famously among those instances, Ghuun also had an incident with it, I think Warlocks could abuse that one.
---
Boy, you must really be stupid.
---
That’s good to know. I was thinking that surely since it’s a big mmo that it shouldn’t be uncommon. I used to do it in Albion online and people were fine with it so must have just been that dude. I think he lost the roll for the staff he needed and may have just took it out on me...
---
Plaguemaw &gt; G’Huun
---
My bad, about 5% shares in Activision Blizzard and Discord is unknown strangely enough. Though they have invested in Discord according to their website.
---
Because it over generated threat, hence the hotfix.
---
It works fine, you just can't farm it.
---
Selling your tank skills for High end dungeons, sure.  
---
But for low level dungeons ? LOL - get out of here.
---
Apparently it was not a case of “just go..” since a lot of people were fooled. Including OP.
---
[laughs in stealth]
---
\*heavy oomkin breathing\*
---
As a warrior I hate this too.  It’s retailing the experience. People aren’t even questing...hell, then they get to 40 and bitch that they can’t afford their mounts.
---
Also I don’t want to cleave run GDI.  I want to do this traditional!  Tank, DPS, Healer baby! The trinity!
---
If the dungeon is trivial to you, no. If it's something you're barely getting by tanking, yeah.
---
You look like you were kicked from a guild with that tabard on
---
I have a macro setup!
---
Everytime someone posts LFG in trade
---
/2 There is a Looking for Group channel, simply type /join LookingForGroup or /join lfg
---
It procs overpower more often and helps making your AA more powerful vs ~20 extra dps and no AA swing cus of heroic
---
It dropped off of a Defias Looter at Alexston's Farmstead for me. Good times.
---
The AH blows. Can't sell any materials because everything is listed at vendor price +10 copper.
---
If you're on Westfall, hmu. IGN is Antonse. You'll have a home with our guild.
---
Basically it's just using a simple hidden whispering system. I'm registering new nameplates that appear, check if they are friendly players, send them a byte via whisper telling them that I am a merchant and eventually receive an answer. Next, if you are whispering a player with a request, he then sends you all the items he offers.
---
My unarmored epic mount
---
I'm currently in the same position. As much as I want to switch now, I think its best to show patience and push to 55 before respeccing into holy/disc. I have had little issues healing as shadow and it still provides me the choice to quest efficiently and defend myself in world PvP.
---
Stop vendoring your herbs, they will be worth something on the AH. Get an addon like Auctioneer and scan the AH to get the average price and then use it to post your herbs at its recommended value if you don't want to dig too much deeper into it.
---
You will also notice that quests from 30 on wards will start giving a lot more money and the rewards can be vendored for a good sum of cash too. My druid quickly got to 50g in no time from a few AH sales and quest rewards. 
---
Get an addon that tells you how much junk is going to vendor for and when grinding/questing if your bags get full delete something that isn't worth carrying and pick up the grey/whites that are worth vendoring (basilisks are a good example for high vendor loot).
---
Depends on the bandage. If you have enough for a single crappy heal, but you have a decent bandage. BoPing the tank, spreads the damage between everyone else, and you can heal the tank more!
---
In theory. Or you cause a wipe.
---
*King's Honor, friend*
---
I would go in mid 30’s and solo most everything. You get good drops, a lot of silk and silver.
---
Thank you for saying that, kept thinking that maybe it was different in WoW etiquette but yeah like you said they all said that it was fine before we went into the instance. Thank you for clearing it up in my mind :)
---
But I do not want to wait until very end of the leveling spectrum to get my mount, on Nost I didn't get it until my mid 50s or so because I had no clue that training professions and most spells (played Frost, but still upgraded Flamestrike, Fire Blast, Frost Nova, etc) as that was my first experience with vanilla WoW. This time around, I would like to hit 60 faster than I did last time (took me about 3 months) and have my mount way sooner. It doesn't feel like it's going to happen naturally.
---
I thought I had to run a long way when I tamed a tiger as an orc.
---
&gt; The idea of casting in melee while still attacking is a cool take that I haven't seen before
---
https://irowiki.org/classic/Hindsight
---
Im a healer and I start to hate melee cleave guys. Massive damage taken and always pulling stuff when im drinking my own purchased water. 
---
Ranged cleave is so so. You either fall asleep because no mob ever reaches a mage alive or your blamed for not healing the warlock through 30 elitemobs hitting him while he casts his AOE. 
---
I like quest runs. Best possible group combination in my opinion? 
---
Druid tank (no plate competition and doesn't try to use the ravager)
---
Mage (Water + food, I admit I'm an addict)
---
Whatever thats at best not melee or at least kicks and kills totems. 
---
I honestly prefer hunters and rogues over warriors. They bring more utility then just standing in every AOE known to man and facetanking everything.
---
Waaaaa..... and another one.
---
Captain also has "pets" in the form of dudes that can be an archer or swordsman.
---
How would this ever work anyway?

It was everywhere. Classic, and warcraft in general, was created during a time where everything was extreme gender fantasy. That's why every male character is built like someone who starred in *Pumping Iron* and every female character is an IG famous model.
---
I have the exact same schedule, get home at 17, play until 22 and play a lot during weekends. I'm lvl 36.

I've missed a few days this week tho.

Conspiracy theory time - trying to push people from taking the free server transfer by increasing queue times?
---
As a mage myself I always give stacks of water if healer asks for it. The reason why some mages give you lower tier drinks is because they are lazy and their current top tier drink costs too much mana with reduced production (we get more drinks per cast the higher level we are after learning new tier drinks) so they opt out for faster solution. Which they shouldnt cuz you are the centerpiece of the group. Its especialy a huge pain in the ass when you just learned a new tier drink and get x2 per cast costing you full mana deplete just to get 10 and you have 3 other people to provide for. You are fully in the right to expect water from mages. Just thought id share other point of view. Still skimming on higher toer water is just downright shitty.
---
All my bags 😾
---
Good thing i skipped that skill, not very useful for leveling.
---
Warlock pre-raid BiS sword drops from Princess runs. +1% spell crit is crazy good.
---

---
Bears are fine. I don't know if they have a taunt or not.
---
People are sheep and just blindly follow whatever shitty guides say.
---
Wait guys until you discover Reshade...
---
Yeah I’m level 20 atm and its helping me learn the aspects of tanking along with trying to be a leader in a dungeon with being the tank.
---
Pretty sure the meta is either Arms all the way to 60, or 2h fury to 40 and then respec to Arms for MS. Due to lack of +hit% gear while leveling, dual wielding can really be a pain in the ass. But this is just the meta, if you have more fun with DW then go for it!
---
Hunter lvl 38 here. Happened to farm some "elementals" and they just beat the shit out of my pet, especially flaming ones. Well at least compared to what other mobs can do.
---
I managed to het a Broken Tooth and have Growl, Claw, Dash + Stamina and Armor on him. All up to date. Should I learn magic resistances for him? Or am i just doing something wrong?
---
WHAT?!
---
" when you are on 10% mana start eating your tank "
---
Thanks.
---
And the horde is proud of you all.
---
I do have Auctioneer. It's currently trying to tell me to post my stacks at under vendor price. Already got an addon for that tho.
---
Exactly, lvl 60 with molten core completed + max professions, and /played is 9 and half days.
---
Professions only take gold, if u do marketing correctly, it is half free and takes less than hour.
---

Is this a bug?

Not a huge issue, but I don't really like using nameplates.

Any chance you could add some other visual indication that someone is a Merchant without me having to see everyone's healthbar?

“Hey adventurer, you down for a little Southshore and chill later?”

I was druid in vanilla and tried nothing else and sucked at PvP so bad because of it.
---
Later on I started to play other things, and mained warlock for a while til Cata, I noticed during this time I was MUCH better at PvP, mainly because I understood and could see their game better now that I've experienced it.
---
I'd say for serious levelling main and alts, pick a main and level an alt, you have to sink unholy hours in for more than that. but once one is levelled a fair way, maybe pick a new alt so you can at least sample the other classes. that whey when you come across them with your main, you are aware of what they may throw at you and are better able to react.
---
My First Aid is still rather low (just barely learned to make Wool Bandages) so I typically use cloth to vendor Linen Bags and White Dresses as I notice those give me pretty good money per bolt (2 silver and 4.something silver). I'll use my next batch of Wool on bandages and see how that works out.  
---
I'm sitting at 25g right now as of 30, I'm wrapping up Hillsbrad and unsure of where to go next, maybe STV if I'm in the proper bracket. But I'll come back to this thread with a screenshot of my cash stack at 35.
---
Imagine playing horde and crying about wpvp
---
It's always been very common to sell any kind of service to players, in every version of WoW, the most common is selling dungeons and raids runs - the group leader is the one deciding the rules.
---
The very important thing is to be clear upfront, which you did.
---
Those people accepted your terms by accepting your group, if someone still whine about your rules later, it's their problem, I suggest remembering their names so you don't end up again with them.
---
Don't forget needing every single thing that drops.
---
Can we have more posts about this shop everyday?
---
Not true. It was always Buff first, then make Food/Water if needed after a wipe.
---
"Int Buff plz!!!"
---
"I already did it..."

"Oh..."

Lmao I’ve also seen this primadona archetype with mages lately.
---
Gods gift to Azeroth
---
 You can still get under SW laughably easy, 
---
I’d imagine the same with IF airport.
---
&gt; The amount of "OMG MEMESPEC", "feral is stupid, roll resto"... the casters that go full nuke (searing pain ftw) when I pull and of course take aggro... its unbearable. 
---
Ignoring them and/or leaving their group as soon as they behave like that is the best you can do here, probably.
---
Focus one target, mark the target, and let all of those bloody idiots feal the cost of their ignorance (like, literally rep cost).
---
&gt; Are feral tanks in your opinion viable at endgame content?
---
I am a big supporter of the _play whatever feels fun to you_ faction, with a bit of the a but.
---
The higher you climb up the raid tier ladder, the less feral tanks you'll see. You can't get critimmune, and that's a bit of a  dealbreaker, no matter how much health you amass. 
---
You will struggle to find a raid tank spot.
---
You can, however, still tank all dungeons as resto, bears can do that.
---
Oh you lucky bastards you!
---
What's priest endgame money making potential like?  My profs are herb/tailoring atm.  Possibly doing ench when I'm 60.
---
Some of his points are fair. But stuff like "it's impossible to be a druid tank because of warriors." What server is this that's just overflowing with warriors? Tank is one of the most in-demand classes in the game and I can't find a druid that doesn't say "Sorry, DPS druid here."
---
They’re absolutely removing layers. I joined Azuresong on Sunday (medium population) and there were over 100 people running around Northshire Abbey. I’ve never seen anything like it. Needless to say I got nothing accomplished.
---
I would also love to know! I only remember CD M L M O, which if yelled by a horde should translate into NO A N A L

Is it a transfer limited to specific realms? Or can you choose the realm you want to transfer to?

Its because this game is crack cocaine. It sucks, its slow, its buggy, but its fucking addictive and I cant quit

uhm no I had a flatscreen in 2001/2002 in Germany I even have a picture of me playing on it

Close. Commute is only about an hour (hence the getting off at 5, home by 6 thing) thankfully.  But I do run most mornings.

Isn't that stance specific? 🤔
---
/assist puts your target as their target. It doesn't mean that they're offtanking.
---
&gt; Once layering is removed the server cap is artifically lowered and becomes 3000, the size of one layer.
---
This is speculation.
---
I haven't done SM yet/in ages. How does soloing GY work for a Mage? Aren't all the mobs elite or something?
---
When someone sends money isntead of Doing C.O.D shuld they also be reported that they didnt return the money ?
---
Gonna disagree with you there. A repair bill for tanks isn't based off of the quality of the mob that's hitting you. Charging a fee to fight stuff that you don't even need is absolutely fair.
---
Did someone say...
---
The dragons in Dustwallow. They drop a good bit of silver, lots of items, superior health potions at a decent rate, and there are two chests that spawn in the area at a decent rate.
---
Feral is a good tank for levelling. At 60 not so much and it is a meme spec at that point. 
---
But at 39 people should stop being idiots and let you do your thing.
---
Trying to guilt you with that shit LOL. This is no different then the guy at the gas station who says he needs $5 because he just ran out of gas but you remember seeing him last week also running out of gas and asking for $5
---
For me, one of the enjoyments of vanilla is the challenge of making enough gold while leveling to buy the mounts when I hit 40 &amp; 60.  Rushing to 60 with no mount in vanilla misses the point.  With that said, there sould be any number of ways a lvl 60 mage should be able to grind out 90G.
---
Bears are fine in Vanilla. The guild I was in back in Vanilla used them and it worked out just fine. People are simply regurgitating what others have said for years without actually experiencing a bear themselves. 
---
You'll be just fine. Ignore them. 
---
As for your guild, it isn't uncommon for a GM or RL to insist on a role. They're organizing it, after all. If they need a resto druid, and you're unwilling to fill their role and/or they're unwilling to take you as a bear, you may want to find a new guild.
---
Wait...
---
One per raid max. Plenty of raids don't bring any.
---
I'm using zperl
---
Would the best time to hunt him be after weekly server resets?
---
Do rare mobs spawn after the server resets?
---
YANAA. 
---
There's a market for it. Nobody _has_ to hire you. It was a widespread thing back in the original classic, with many tanks even running around with a DND message stating their rates.
---
"Greetings, friend"
---
you'll make them soon enough
---
You should have done your research before starting
---
yeah I also want to fuck shrek and donkey
---
Raids are always going to be limited to your rotation. In PvP and some PvE you should be using blink, shields/armor, polymorph, evocation, slow fall, counterspell...
---
I haven't played a mage since WotLK so I can't really compare the experience to retail, but the classes I do play lack a lot of depth they used to have.
---
Sounds like a sick azerothian band name..
---
People need to chill about this. I'm not directing this just at you but the whole Reddit, people are reeing as if people couldn't do anything if you missed the first 2 weeks, classic was specifically absolutely the other way around.
---
I've done nearly all of MC (rep blocked dousing) but there is nothing that will stop me taking some random dude to alt runs or off day raids even in a year's time to MC.
---
What tools do you actually use from that toolbox you have? From what I've seen there is sunder/shout spam and taunt.
---
You picked the tank class, tanks are in high demand, it's a video game: you did nothing wrong.
---
Run as Administrator fixed a similar issue for me.
---
If I was running a dungeon and we got to a boss and suddenly the party leader put it on master loot I'd call them out. It's one thing to run a dungeon under a set of rules that are there when you start, but to suddenly alter them during the run after you cleared through trash? If we did an entire dungeon and multiple bosses and got to the last boss and THEN they changed to master loot I would be talking trash about them on any global chat channel I was in and discord.
---
&gt;Probably shouldn't have taken this picture in the church...
---
Yeah, that character is too old, and too female for that environment
---
It is limited. you can only transfer from a few selected full servers to a few selected new servers that were added in just for this purpose.
---
Specific realm.
---
Specific. From busy to dead servers only
---
I am a lvl45 mage, got my mount straight away at lvl40. My professions are skinning and tailoring. At lvl40 I have 110g from vendoring leather since lvl5, from not buying skills that I didnt need (I only bought frostbolt, nova, sheep, shields, water), and from vendoring quest items and greens that I didn't need. I did not play the AH at all. I have an addon called Vendor Price which tells you which item to pick from quest rewards to maximise your vendor profit (i.e. if there are two items to pick, one might vendor for 80s while the other vendors for 25s). 
---
For me it was quite straight forward but I think most of this was down to Vendor Price and skinning. I didn't grind at all so can't recommend you anything there. I think to be honest that I had around 30g at lvl30, so if you start doing the above now then you should be fine and have your mount by lvl41-lvl42 at the latest.
---
But it's not like you're not enjoying the sun while gaming in the sun?   
---
I don't see how it's much different from reading a book for example.
---
Yep.

---
Because you're playing the class, not the spec. Being a plate wearer naturally makes you far more tanky than a cloth wearer. And as long as you manage right, you can tank. Without a tank spec in later expansions, you'll get destroyed. That's what I love about Classic, is that you don't *have* to be tank spec for leveling dungeons.
---
Well, that's fucking stupid if anything. That obviously what the 'Greed' button is for - you just want to make money by selling the item, and don't intend to use it. if you don't need it, and don't plan on making gold from it, you Pass on it.
---
I would like to point out that the population tags are dynamic.
---
If you always log in at 8 AM, all the servers will always be low pop.
---
Meanwhile someone trying to log in at 8 PM will be met by high and full populated realms mostly.
---
As someone who went from retail to classic for the first time, I can agree on the feeling lost part. I just end up doing whatever I feel like in my level range, but I do see that people in my guild who play less than me level faster than me because they know what's up.
---
Good way to ruin Classic quickly!

What’s the event?

is there a better addon to assume what material you get when you disenchant an item?

---
My advice: Don't change. If they pull aggro and run away from you then I just wave them and continue doing your job. They failed to do theirs (not pulling aggro) so they can hardly blame you for not babysitting them.
---
Hello, lvl 22 human rogue here, using swords. What are your favorite/most useful macros ?
---
Also, do some kinds of humanoids drop more locked chest than others when you pickpocket them ? I got two on some murclos in Wetlands, but none on elite ogres in Loch Modan.
---
This.. this is a joke right?
---
Don't forget the 512mb of RAM
---
Ferals are fine, especially for tanking 5/10 man content.
---
The problem lays with people who don't understand the threat mechanic of vanilla, or are used to retail zerg-fests.
---
I'm in the same boat - was tanking Gmomer the other day, and it was going fine. The healer and the DPS started getting twitchy, and kept shouting at me that it was slow and to pull the room. We then died twice in a row because the healer couldn't keep up, and because the frost mage did nothing but spam AoE from the start.
---
Seems dumb to me.  Single target dps kills faster imo.
---
Alts are the best way to farm rest xp.

If he is higher level and he is boosting trough the jungle i kind of get it.

But if he is same level, no he gets exp and sometimes a drop.

I have been in spellcleave from 30-50 now, and still with 4 mages in my group I mostly have to ask for buff.

I've had this problem too and searched so many times and just gave up. Have had it happen since legion on a few different pcs. Gonna try this fix, ty!

How do raid lockouts work in this version? IIRC you get locked to specific raid ID as soon as you kill any boss, but what happens if you join a raid that already started - you only get locked on next boss kill, or immediately?
---
The healing buff is super nice if Mages are aware of it, good on you for even training the spell.

You want to join the American region. You can choose that when you open WoW classic from the Blizzard launcher I think. Then after you launch the game, when you get to the sever list, there's a tab at the bottom for the OCE servers.

Get used to sitting up and wanting down a single target while voidie tanks. After you’re comfortable with this you could start chain pulling mobs so you’re never not fighting.

WotLK was the dark ages for healing, way too simple and spammy. Just spam one move and use your raid cooldown at a preplanned time for the most part.

What addon displays the +hit percentage etc?

Oh shit so that's the reason why my fear + bandage isnt working! Thanks man good to know.

i once cleared MC, Ony and ZG with 4-5 prebis and greens. It’s not that you can’t raid without them it’s that people prefer faster runs and tend to exaggerate on the entire prebis matter.

Frostbolt pulls off more and doesn't need a debuff slot.  
---
So does the entire rogue and warrior rotation.
---
Yeah, if there's non-elites in the pull you shouldn't have to worry about them.  If a DPS can't survive a similar level non-elite out in the world then they're just straight trash.  Tank should focus on the 1-2 elites in the pack and tell the DPS to focus down the non-elites first.
---
Holy shit! Did NOT expect to find this gem at a lowly question on a mega thread. Thanks a lot for sharing!
---
The guy nailed it in the first paragraph. I know how awful HS is, but really what other choice is there at lower levels?? One would think. Granted, I'm already level 31 which makese wish I found this sooner but still, really cool. Guess I can put it in practice at least for a few levels.
---
I'm only afraid I might misunderstand some of the info and still play it "wrong". Do you know what the last column (Sunder Threshold) means in relation to the skills? How do I interpret that exactly?
---
Also, as a side note, I really thought Thunder Clap was better than Clave at 3 targets, even more so as Cleave also takes place of an auto attack. But I guess they're not that far off? TC damage effctiveness at 3 targets is listed as pretty average.
---
Nothing technically wrong with it, but I would personally never group with a person "selling" their services. Similar to the way I would pay for other "services" IRL.
---
If you can get a group to agree then have at it (although I agree it makes more sense if you're at Max level end of dungeon). I think you'll have issues were 3 out of 4 agree so they bring you on and that 4th is pissed. Or the people already on group agree but they bring in a final player and they are unaware.
---
Plenty of horde that camp too. The novelty is still fresh.
---
Loot everything, auction the items you don't need, choose what to craft. Yes at lvl 28 i put 8g for 2 new weapons, training lw and poisons. But you have to invest. Scan the AH for cheap deals, that you can vendor or resale. Invest in bigger bags, this actually the most important, because after finishing couple of quest you will be full and would not have to throw some stuff.

I'm in the UK and play on US purely because the time I play in the evenings the US servers are less populated. My ping 130m-150ms.

Guys, this is no joke but, while I was leveling in Sulfuras, there was several full hispanics guilds and made like 3 friends who were hispanics. There is a chance that Sulfuras is the new Ragnaros. I am hispanic myself so it was a fun experience.

I wanna see this guys house.

I'd rather have a bit of a queue than play on a low pop server where everything on the AH costs 10x more.

Some warlocks wait until lvl 60 to do any of their class quests (except voidie at 10) so no rush
---
So that is why they want warlocks. Playing a lock myself, I was wondering, because while the damage from Hellfire is high, it is also somewhat risky.
---
Because its way slower and you loose 2 excellent keybinds. You use ur mouse and A-D
---
I've got it. Things that I would like to sell such as cloth/bolts of cloth/herbs/crafted gear (Spidersilk Boots made me like 20 gold on Nost at 3-4g a piece, but then prices started crashing, on my server they already are, everyone in chat is just basically saying same thing, the AH is oversaturated), my addon tries to recommend a price, then in giant red text says "WARNING PRICE UNDER VENDOR AMOUNT" so then I just don't bother. I thought Swiftthistle would be the big thing since Thistle Tea and Swiftness Potions I thought would be super popular, nope, it's pretty low, after like a week it's finally starting to crawl up to 1g a stack, but with everyone using addons to undercut each other, it just feels like a waste of time.

This phrase will never die. It is too good to let it pass.

Yeah I'm leveling on 3 servers at the moment to dodge queues

Hi, as Frost u should learn frostbolt, cone of cold, frostnova only Rank 1, and maybe scorch new ranks to finish off mobs.

If u run dungeons learn arcane Explosion / blizzard.

of course you should, it's your rage dump.

Nobody gonna talk about they compared shamans yo paladins?

I bet paladins cant even do this! *Hits 3times really fast unreliably*

It makes sense though. Open just a few servers to start, then if you get more players than expected just open some more.

Did not think of that! Very good points, thanks man!

I stopped reading there, this is too much. This guy doesn't understand what makes MMOs good, or even RPGs in general.

You don't.  You tell the mage to quit pulling, and if they don't, you boot them from the raid.  It's pretty simple.  Quit bowing down to their shit.
---
You snooze you lose mate.
---
I have no idea what are you going on about. The guy tagged a mob and invited the player so he could also get credit (which he totaly didnt have to but its a nice thing to do). Both got credit in joined cooperation. What are you projecting about. If i tagged a mob faster than you or due to your class mechanics i grabbed it from you and i invited you so you can also get the tag and you spit on me after that, id fucking camp your ass and tag every dot youve ever casted for the day. Your tagging rules are absurd and warrant a spit back.
---
My repair bill is roughly around 25-40s and I skip every drop that they need. I actually skipped the the blue axe and left it for the paladin because I asked them for the drops they didn’t need and the paladin needed this. I could have rolled need and took it from him to be the extra asshole but they agreed to what I said
---
\&gt;  If you are able to hold threat with sunders it's better though, since the enemies won't have any armor. 
---
Sunder armor has more cons though, a lot more cons. 
---
a) Needs more rage, 
---
b) Can't sunder while disarmed (altough, to be fair, you can't shout while silenced. One is more common than the other though),
---
c) I'm assuming since one is registered as a spell, and the other as a melee hit, sunder is more susceptible to "missing" than Shout is to resisting. 
---
d) Sunder also has positional requirements, you have to be facing the target,
---
e) Targets need to be close to each other in order to sunder them, while battle shout doesn't care about the position of the targets, as long as you can buff 5 people including you.

wats the addon with the char stats

Also with CoE, the arcane shot numbers go way up. Might not even need the sting to keep the DPS that high. Could possibly go way higher with just arcane spam alone. I'll have to look at the numbers for that and see what kind of damage that would do.
---
I just got really interested in this after reading an archived thread on the wow forums from 2006, a lot of interesting idea in it. Decided to run the numbers and now I'm going to run it lol.

Yes fellow human skins, we are people things also. Beep boop.
---
Where is this from?
---
There are several add-ons that will show vendor prices/AH price/fees/etc. in tooltips.  I can't remember the name of the one I use, but definitely find one to prevent yourself from making these mistakes, and also to capitalize on others' mistakes.
---
Lol thats not true dude. Its common to press need whenever you actually need the item. And when you do need it of course equip it afterwards if you’re at the right level. If you dont follow that then dont be surprised if people think you’re a dickhead.
---
I have Vendor Price (but I believe my AH addon does the same as it tries to show me what the AH price is as well). I've actually been ignoring leveling my Polymorph just because so far the 20 seconds is fine, I'm sure by SM I will want to upgrade it.   
---
Is it possibly worth dropping Herbalism for Skinning? I've basically very little money off of it in the past 10 days or so and they vendor for so little, while I've heard once you get to medium/heavy leather, the stacks sell for a decent amount.
---
so most of the people here want retail but in classic, than they'd cry about how blizz ruined classic because they've implemented retail stuff in it... geez... you're just biting yourself in the arse
---
Taming a lot of pets all around to get the most recent level of a special pet skill, fishing &amp; cooking or buying food for the pet, traveling around the world to get your special rare pet with better attack speed, spending one bag slot for arrows... just to mention some more thing.

Why would you need on something you’re going to vendor/DE. I’ve never heard of this until now (played vanilla/pservers and now classic).
---
If you’re in SM and a decent boe drops that is an upgrade for one person y’all just steamroll him or interrupt the flow with trading after loot?
---
Greed is there for a reason and I’ve never had any problems with the way ppl go about rolling.
---
Now I get why. You didn’t spec into Improved Blizzard. Its a must have for frostmage aoe farming. Pull a bunch of lower level mobs -&gt; frost nova -&gt; blink -&gt; cast blizzard on them to deal dps and slow them -&gt; blizzard again -&gt; finish the leftovers with instant cast spells -&gt; pick up loots

---
&gt;  I would rather you tell me "Hey at 37 I went to this zone and farmed these mobs for mount money, they had really good drops!" than "Google it" since Classic is a "solved game" there's way too much info out there available, and I don't like/want to sift through all of it to find the best/most practical.
---
Just want to get this out of the way: I told you to google because I didn't want to give you a specific location, not because I was trying to shame you for not researching it yourself.
---
Since you want specifics, the rock elementals in badlands are very good sources of money. I used to farm them back in OG vanilla for gold. The vendor trash they drop is quite valuable. By now though, many people are aware of these mobs and there may be competition for them as the good farming ones only spawn in about 3 different locations on the map.
---
Besides them, virtually any set of elite mobs that you can reliably kill will suffice. On my current character (hunter), I've been doing runs in Stonetalon Peak's *The Talon Den* because the mobs are gray by the time you hit 37 so I don't get any exp from them (I'm leveling with a buddy), they're easy to kill, and you can get about 7-8g per hour there. 
---
If you're alliance, this spot is not available, but any elite mob group will provide some pretty good money.
---
Yeah I like this list because it lists gear for totem twisting. I’m just curious if there are any pieces of gear that are better suited for PVP besides the BIS PVE pieces.
---
I know it used to be possible, not sure if it is now.
---
That's because retail showers you with epics and the only goal is to stack iLvl as high as possible without any thought towards itemization

---
The reason why WOW vanilla did not stay that way are people like those. They are the cause why so many things were kicked out of WOW. They are the cause why things changed to the worse.
---
The developers listened to them. The "efficient" guys. The "I play a lot of WOW" guys. The mad folks.
---
And so it went on and on until all things that were fun were kicked out of the game. Cause fun is not efficient.
---
You remember how they patched out everything that is unique making a pabulum out of every class and every race? They kept the "efficient" things.
---
Efficiency is the plague that must be fought.
---
There would have been other methods. By finding a countermechanic in dungeons and implementing it. But Blizzard never got on this path cause the guys that played a lot could be pissed if they take their "efficency" folly away.

Thanks a lot

Pffffffffft

I don't know about your server, but on mine the first-to-60 guys from several guilds got together and pugged the first run just because there weren't that many 60s in any of the guilds yet. 2 of ours were in that PUG and said it was more of a slightly controlled free for all. I imagine most of the warrior T1 pieces went to the folks who actually signed up as tanks rather than the dps warriors, so if several of them drop, good on the tanks.
---
How would you “lose” it?
---
I don't see the AH as an investment because I feel like the only way to make a significant amount of money is to simply be those 1%  types that just control the AH with their addons. I just want the cool shiny thing to get (in the case of Classic, my mount training) to pay my repair bills, and always have a comfortable safety net.

This. Feels bad when you just started to drink moonberry juice and they already start pulling the next group.

Probably the same guy who has an issue with layering.

Frankly it only sounds good in your head, in practice it's just a shitty idea. Going to a place like that to sit and play wow on a laptop is like going to music concert and than having your headphones on playing music from your phone. What's the point then? You go for a holiday to get some sun, fresh air, actually move around and use your body. If my wife or friends or in the future kids did that I'd be really pissed off.

Then there isn't really much to complain about. Sure, they're idiots for cutting into their own profits, but you have to take into account supply and demand. Linen is not exactly at a premium atm, and making more money from auctioning is worth it to most people. At this level of auction housing, closing is the absolute most important thing. Selling is more profitable than not selling regardless of how low you have to post your auctions because you get your deposit back if you sell.

You do not auto attack with frostbolt. You have to press the button every time you want to cast it.
---
You can auto attack with a wand  (if you have a wand, check spellbook general)
---
Or you can autoattack with a staff/sword which will deal melee dmg if you are in melee range bg supply rightclick but as a mage you should never do that not even to the mobs with 1% hp. Use wand for that purpose.
---
If i need it i need it, if i dont i greed it, really really simple system, if you think otherwise you should question your morals, and its just a game is not a good enough answer to you needing on a epic for gold.

However if the party leader says epics will be needed automatically before we start, then the ground rules have been layed out and i will need on epics weather i do or dont need them.

There's a lot of negativity in this video. They label these gamers as No-life nerds and the questions are asked so they can justify their actions. To mock them in a way, indirectly.

I mean, you have much worse in other MMOs nowadays.

I ended up with three different characters, all warriors, on three different realms. Mainly cause my guildmates planned to roll on one realm, my coworkers decided to roll on another, and my gf and other family members opted to play on a pve realm. So I'm split between them all. Sure I could have chosen some other classes but I just dig warriors and I love tanking :) 
---
I'm sure some will lose interest down the line, and I'll be more invested in one char over the others. But I'm in no hurry to reach endgame, just enjoying the world and playing with my friends :)
---
You find it hard!?

FYI on the imgur Mirage Raceway is tagged as PVP, when it is PVE as you rightly state in your post. Very interesting that Alliance outnumber Horde, and massively so on Everlook. Are PVE servers the refuge of us Alliance plebs?

Engineering is the only profession that directly benefits your character. Every other profession is purely trade oriented since everything you craft can be traded to other players so if you want a specific item you can just buy it instead of leveling the profession (exception being the 3 tailoring chest pieces for casters). However, engineering is not good for making money so it's better to level it once you have sufficient bank.
---
Gathering professions are the most straightforward, especially skinning is easy to level and has decent profits.

Everything about this picture makes me cringe a bit.

You should have parry, block and dodge as far as i'm aware, but I didn't get to buy Parry until lvl 10 as rogue, so I'm not sure if there is something similar for warriors.

Your pet build is fine in all honesty. Elementals for the most part hit much harder than other mobs, and unless you specifically spec your pet to be resistant to a certain element, they are always going to do high damage. If you intend to do vast amounts of farming on a certain type of elemental, then respecing your pet could be advantageous, however otherwise......they just hit hard.  (Note that some end game hunter gear provides more resistances to your pet). - A small bit of advice, I found buying scrolls of protection and using them on the pet gives them a good survivability boost when doing lots of grinding

For a low level dungeon boss and compared to retail stuff, yeah, this is up there with one of the harder dungeon bosses. Especially with an under levelled group.

Don't shit on this guys achievement. Nobody is impressed that you find the boss easy.

I agree with everything, but your point about transmog. I can see your point, but I think your reasoning has a contradiction - if visuals don't matter, especially for top player, then why is it important to see who's the boss? Who is it important for?

They are already offering a free 110 char boost if you hit 60 in classic.

Yes please.
---
ELI5 what does he mean?
---
Tank. Which is odd because I remember having the opposite problem during Vanilla. Good healers were hard to find; it was usually shadow priests or a feral druids who healed and tanks were anyone who could hold aggro. Then again back then, if you lost aggro on a mob people were upset. Now it just happens and bad tanks aren’t as noticeable. I rolled a priest specifically because healers were in low supply (good ones) but now you barely need them).
---
Imagine not understanding that even a medium pop server has more players in Classic than a high pop server had in Vanilla.
---
I seriously hope this is sarcasm haha. You have much more provocative armour in MMOs now.

Something of a phenomenon.

---
There are no reliable addons for that in classic, as they didn't add threat API until wrath. The best you can do is an addon that tries to estimate it based on your actions, but I think it requires other party members also using that addon so you can compare your threat to theirs.

I meant I ran into slightly less horde, which is to be expected considering I would spend more time in Alliance hubs

Interesting. I actually hadn't considered that, and will look into it. Haven't ever had a reason to use a remote desktop before, but hey here we are lmao. Thanks for sharing!
---
There are no achievements, and there won't be.
---
There is no tier 0.5, but I assume it'll appear in a later phase.
---
Whhh none were mages or locks who could summon. My druid and pally brothers in arms were all over it for me though.
---
lifefuel
---
Hahaha died when i read "rogue"
---
Outlaw mh and the dagger oh
---
Very possible. Myself and some friends hopped on on launch day and are still playing and because we are spending more time on it than retail, our retail guildmates are slowly moving over as well. As soon as we finish Eternal Palace we’ll probably be full on Classic.
---
You’re being kind of an asshole
---
I just did the succ quest as a l21 alliance lock - it was time consuming (long runs) but really easy.. I would say just bite the bullet and do it!
---
i was going to say "what a dumbass" but then decided to /lol over his body so he could see it before he released
---
So, a friend is going to start playing soon and I'm considering pausing my main to level with him a bit. My main is a mage, my friend is going to play hunter.
---
What class would you suggest that plays different from mage and sinergizes with hunter?
---
Honestly, with something so subjective as this, the only person that really has anything to say is OP himself.
---
lmao they stopped disclosing retail sub numbers like 4 years ago mate
---
I thought the guards would fuck you up when you attack someone in the town :-D ? How can they just stand there and keep killing people trying to take the FP
---
No worries :) i just think we misunderstood eachother a bit but no big deal :)
---
that's for richmons, a fresh lvl 19 won't be getting those.
---
An hour maybe with lots of deaths. My guess is he went from dun morough to wetlands, and from there he caught a boat to theramore isle, which then requires a walk through the barrens then durotar
---
Hehe that’s true I’m jk:)
---
Done!
---
H E E H E E S H A M O N A
---
This is the first time I've heard the term "ragebait", and I'm amazed that I haven't heard of it before now.
---
I think not, need: if you want to equip, greed to sell...
---
f.. the "I need for my alt or to buy another item with the profit"... the system is simple.
---
You can say what you want your grp will not like you if you are a rogue who rolls on mage blue items...
---
I appreciate the sutures holding him together. Haven’t made it to this dungeon yet, but now I can’t wait!
---
just delete the last part of the link
---
or click it and press the arrow back
---
I fully expect not to get those big full heals. I can dps at 20% life/100% mana, I cant dps at 100% life/20% mana. So yeah I'm going to tap down. Especially since my mana usage is mostly front loaded with all my instant cast dots. I got siphon life and life drain for when I'm worried about my own health. Just toss me you're most efficient heals when you got mana and we're all good.
---
Please don't tank without consecration, as others mentioned.
---
It's boring af for most people. Imagine playing a Zelda game and you already have all of the items.
---
For the horde bois
---
It's funny because Esfands guild has 2.
---
&gt;Raiding at 4am server time might make it quiet hard to find a raid group.
---
It is, i got the bright idea to play on NA from EU.
---
Sorry, I think I've led you astray on that one, was going off memory alone
---
Thank you for your answer
---
Queens English vs Trumps English. Pick one.
---
Trinket menu
---
What exactly has changed then? I know not one single MMO where I can have an fat old guy character. Or an ugly hag female.
---
At 25 or 35 (can’t remember which) you will be able to make green robes which might be worth something to a low level enchanter.
---
Before that, I think linen belts might be the most valuable at 22c.
---
The 6s linen bags are also valuable to low level players. I see most sell them for 1s in the general chat. You can make those at 45 I believe.
---
Sorry, I can't stop the kid in me from laughing at this title.  I don't know anything about rogues, take an upvote.
---
Level and gear being equal a mage will far out DPS a priest.
---
Put it together with gryphonheart items if ut still exists
---
17 inch laptop is huge though. But i suppose if you get it just to play games.
---
You could *try* doing some trickery with targeting target's target and then conditionally stopping the macro if the target is yourself, I'm not sure if it can be done though, and even if it is it would be hard to make it functional without focus frame.
---
youre playing classic for the raids? you made a mistake.
---
ya, dark meta was a gul'dan lore thing that a lot of warlocks wanted. It's been years and I'm still salty that demon hunters took my lock tank
---
All the way bb
---
Looks like you totally missed the point of this post and you are proud of it.
---
Balls deep
---
Warriors learn it at 6
---
From what I can gather from your post your complaint is that other classes can cleave better than some.  So? No one claimed classic was balanced- quite the opposite.  And mellee cleave (especially on horde with a shammy WF tot) is Def viable and right up a warrs street.  
---
Either run melle cleave or accept your class will level slower than some others.  Hell I can't tank as a cloth, but I'm not demanding my armour gets a buff.  Apple's and oranges.
---
I didn't though. Try reading it again.
---
Most retail players I have encountered are playing both, but classic more heavily. They will leave to raid do dailies or w/e in retail and then the rest/majority of the time they are in Classic.
---
hunter can solo dungeons easily. Also they are the best farmers.
---
Mage aoe farm when diremaul hits is extremely strong.
---
I love being a warrior. I've always been a warrior.
---
Now, though, our guild has two great prot warriors and three great fury warriors. They don't want me in the mythic raid. I wish I had rolled a Hunter instead, they want a hunter in the mythic raid...
---
All my friends are in the guild, so...
---
Watch Robin Hood Men in Tights. I think it’s on Netflix right now.
---
Yeah, because googling "Warlock t1 bis list" takes so much thought lol.
---
3g on ah right now
---
right on! Bring back dark meta!
---
&gt;The higher you climb up the raid tier ladder, the less feral tanks you'll see. You can't get critimmune, and that's a bit of a  dealbreaker, no matter how much health you amass.
---
Thats true about being critimmune, but doesn't the much bigger healthpool (compared to warrior) and armor of a feral make up for that?
---
Only thing I can see a feral being supoptimal is no anti-fear mechanism. In the entire game I believe 6 or 7 bosses have a fear mechanism, so not that big of a deal I guess?
---
Maximizing drinking time? Downranking? 5 second rule? Wow.. I never thought of that. Infact I usually set up a campfire and /sit before I even start drinking. Thanks for instantly fixing all my problems, you must be a really smart guy.
---
Tell me why did you choose human? Always wondered. We play human irl. In 15 years it never crossed my mind to play a human in wow.
---
So, why?
---
Exactly. Yesterday on EU-Dreadmist there were big fights like 20-20 sometimes , around lvl30-40 it was  fun. Ofc we won. FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Fucking epic

People tank without shields? Our main job is to survive the damage we are pulling!
---
I am an officer in the only raiding guild on my server and I have to turn down these applications daily.
---
Enhancement shamans who want to raid as resto but only want gear for their enhancement spec. Firstly the biggest issue is not your meme spec. It is all about sparcity of loot. We have lots of dedicated rogues, hunters fury warriors and off tanks who are all specced for raid, stacked on consumables and on time for raids. I am not about to punish them by adding loot competition from someone who isn't even gonna use the gear for the guilds greater good. When we have people geared we will allow off specc loot but you will have to show that you want to play for the guild and not yourself. I know people throw tantrums over this decision but it is just how we are gonna do things
---
Thanks :)
---
Why do you think at 60 feral is a memespec? Genuinly curious!
---
If you can kite well, you will beast fools.
---
A group of all level 30s cleared Cath on beta.
---
“Everyone will quit by level 30 except the private server no lifers”
---
Wow, I didn’t know about the deposit repay! Well i guess i’ll just have to buyout everything below vendor price and sell them on AH to make money. Thanks!
---
Also a note. With the right tallent life tap actually converts at a 1:1.2 ratio, so it is literally more efficient to life tap.
---
Our best and basically only cc ability combo doesn't work
---
...''just'' a bug
---
As far as body types in WoW? Very little. As far as what has changed in gaming in general? Bikini chain mail ala OP is no longer considered acceptable and correctly identified as looking totally ridiculous.
---
Oh, I thought you just really liked doing Scarlet Monastery..
---
I think the title is misleading, it should be "5 things *I think* modern World of Warcraft does better than Classic".
---
It's an opinion piece, not a particularly offensive one either. I even agree with many of his observations, except he fails to realize that what he flags as a "con" and puts him off is the very thing that attracts other people and helps them get more immersed. He also generously ignored many design flaws that are plaguing retail WoW that don't exist in classic.
---
In my opinion, there are good and bad things in both versions, but today is a good day because we get to choose.
---
If you get the opportunity, seize it.
---
please let me know. this sub is so freaking bad lol
---
that just was like: don't overpanic.
---
You can still hear it from the enemie's side so you know you've been distracted
---
ALL the time. And defensive stance is boring so why use that?
---
That only worked for you because of this bug where the tanks could generate way too much aoe threat.
---
If the hotfix is going to be as significant as I assume it will be, now you'll throw out your AoE, pull aggro on everything but one and die.
---
I didn't downvote someone for daring to earnestly answer a question I couldn't be arsed to just google, champ :^)
---
You encountered a bug with one of the very few things Blizz has changed in Classic from Vanilla.
---
I pointed out that, indeed, hightier Demons are one of the very few changes from Vanilla to Classic and have been nerfed, so if this experience isn't what Blizzard intended when they nerfed hightier Demons, then this is undoubtedly a bug cause *caused by that change*.
---
This apparently offended you on a personal level.
---
Next time just google it if you take answers you don't like personally.
---
what he said, i have been using my Succubus and just drain tanking for a while now.  
---
Once you get dark pact if you want to go down that low in affliction it really speeds things up..
---
Go ahead little Orc, smash now :) See what happens :D
---
I responded to your LFG reaction.  
---
But the same goes for your M+ question.  
---
People where asking and begging for Vanilla.  
---
Not Vanilla 2.0 or Retail minus flying or minus LFR , no they wanted Vanilla.  
---
Now they got Vanilla, which is called Classic Wow, and they are happy.
---
  
---
Now you must understand, that whenever people are suggesting changes or things to be added to Classic, you'll get an extreme backlash of the Vanilla community, because thats not what they wanted.... they have been asking for 15 years to go back to the originall WoW....  
---
And yes im in the #Nochanges camp as well...   
---
If you want M+  you can go play Retail ofcourse, you have it there, why dont keep it that way? :D
---
As long as you're not on sulfuras, it's fine. But please don't try to spread this mentality. Greed is for vendoring and Need is for upgrades. There's no changing the system just because you think, "Well I Need gold, right?" That's ridiculous. Roll greed.
---
Is Fire Shield Rank 3 not working as the tooltip says it should?
---
On the tooltip when you hover it, it says it should deal 12 damage. When the buff is actually applied to you however, it says it deals 9 damage, and the damage I see on my screen when being hit is 9. Is this a bug or something I'm just unaware of?
---
What server was this?
---
[I got you fam.](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11143/postmaster-malown)
---
200-300 personal dps is nice but do you know how much dps a debuff like annihilator or nightfall gives to the raid?
---
Make it a surprise.
---
Can't wing clip and kite if you can't hit the target because your weapons skills are low.
---
You're wrong OP. Each layer is a fixed size. Adding or removing layers changes total server capacity.
---
I made extra chars on my server so it appears at the top.
---
I agree it's a little annoying, but think of it as an intentional part of the launch. I believe the Devs did this on purpose so when your server is full and you have a queue you will have seen the other low pop realms and maybe be tempted to switch since you kept seeing that other realm on medium or lower every time. I willing to bet that after populations settle they'll change it to auto-log into your last chosen server.
---
My vendor mamoth
---
They already said that Medium pop is equal to high/full from old Vanilla.
---
I would have it where they disable a certain faction to be created on a certain server unless invited it by someone. That way you filter some out while not preventing friends from playing together
---
I assume you still have to press everything twice, as the first press will dismount instead of casting the ability?
---
I hate to say it but almost none my dude. Vendoring is not a viable strategy for tailoring. Your best bet is to try to AH some items which also is a pretty poor method throughout the leveling process, or hope that enchanting mats sell well on your server and that you have a way to get them from your tailoring crafts. The only one I can think of for vendoring is White Bandit Mask May be something to look into, if not, it’s at least the best vision dust recipe in game imo.
---
How is your threat management? I know locks have the issue where they do have a build that can put out huge numbers, but because of there lack of a way to reduce threat, they can't use it (at least not until phase 5 or 6)
---
Bruh wand is op I love wanding people. Dots and wand is all I do to kill mobs for the most part, I will shadow bolt if I fear them but no spell knock back and no mana cost is amazing for solo leveling.
---
r/whoosh
---
I'm not sure 100% but I know Cold Blood is practically mandatory so if you're going into the assassination tree at all go that far at least. Are you planning on going Dagger or Sword?
---
This is wrong, if by "best" you mean fastest and most efficient.
---
My little brother joined me playing Classic yesterday (he didn't play much WoW before). He barely even started his journey as a Hunter, and he told me on Discord that he got some random buff (PoF) so he helped the guy kill a mob. Touched my heart.
---
Only the login screen is from the perspective of Draenor.
---
What makes you think cleave would stop being effective in high level dungeons?
---
I love the details!
---
TS servers up to 32 slots is free
---
How do you get to 330 dmg arcane shot? Did you calculate spell power coefficients?
---
I created this addon not to replace the auction house but to have a nice complement that provides a different way to trade without the disadvantages of the auction house and reducing item spamming in the chat.
---
I'm not really bothered about speed, just enjoying the levelling and questing with occasional dungeon. Might risk the free transfer to a lower pop server in the hope that it's not quite as bad.
---
Smart enough to clear 5 man leveling dungeons without posting on Reddit complaining about the actions of 4 people to the greater population. This is basically vaguebooking but over a video game and it's the type of moronic posting that killed Retail WoW in the first place.
---
HEY! You keep that damn panda trash out of this subreddit!
---
According to the most recent census data that server is 55% horde and 45% alliance. That's a pretty normal ratio l as horde is more popular.
---
Don’t linen bags vendor for 2s though?
---
Perfect timing with the guy saying ‘So...’
---
The advice feels great! I have never even considered that! Thank you!   
---
Do I understand it right that I simply won't have enough training points to train all types of resistance?
---
Before launch I had a plan to farm small flame sacs in Swamp of Sorrows, but when talking to a friend the other day, he said that this is not as viable as people thought before launch is this right? I have skinning and herbalism, which should help.
---
Another hunter is a valid choice.
---
what does BuS mean ?
---
&gt;	week!~
---
Yes! And you will make plenty of friends in-game. Go play!
---
Which addon did you install? And how did you "install" it? do you see it in your addon list ingame?
---
For 1g80s I'll let him do whatever the fuck he wants to me lol
---
As a rogue who wouldn't do this I will agree it's true of other rogues.. friendly human rogue passed by me 3 times with no aggression last night, even waved. Then when I was at 20% hp and fighting a mob, boom he ambushes me. It was in STV on a pvp server though and that place is nuts right now.
---
Imagine trying to create an online mob dedicated to "owning" a specific place in a video game. I can't wrap my head around this. Are all these guys unemployed wellfare thieves?
---
fair enough I guess &lt;.&lt;
---
I see it only adding player interaction :S
---
One of the weaker 1v1 classes, but one of the best group PvP classes because of their range and annoying pets.  Great for peeling melee off healers, great dmg at range, and its a class that's easy to pick up, but difficult to master.
---
We stun lock and take locked chests without asking :)
---
Instant &amp; Deadly is PPM based. The rest are just a flat % on hit.
---
The real increase depends on the cast time of a spell. If I am not mistaken, if a spell is casted for 3,5 second, it gets all +healing. If a spell takes less time, it receives less +healing bonus.
---
I'll give you a dirty secret. I dont have a bank alt
---
Wow that is really suprising but awesome and I am indeed now. Thank you for that info. Where can I see this census you speak of?
---
NSFW
---
Opens in work anyway...
---
as far as i know there isn't one
---
Can confirm, have a buddy who raided with them on private servers.
---
They actually are, no exaggeration, grown EU men with no jobs and welfare out the ass. Their only goal is to dominate a 15 year old game. It’s actually sad as fuck.
---
Also they account shared to get world firsts, so there ony and rag kill isn’t even legitimate. They had time to farm pre BiS because they had a day and a half on every other big player due to them never having to log out and play in shifts.
---
Fuck Apes.
---
I would have liked the current tranmog system in retail to allow players to select male/female armor models in addition to hiding select pieces.
---
Seriously?
---
Welcome to classic. Where it never was abput the player but the class.
---
Assuming top of the game and BiS;
---
What classes would you normally expect to top off the first three slots of damage meter in raids:
---
* while fighting a pack of common elites;
---
* while fighting a single target boss?
---
Mage, SPriest, Fury Warrior in the former, Rogue, Warlock, Boomkin in the latter or am I way off?
---
I'm aware DPS doesn't matter that much and each class brings in its own utility and has a unique purpose, besides - APES shown us that raids are doable in very sub optimal conditions; *I am merely curious about class design*.
---
Once again I was running ST had demo shout x2 and I immediately lose aggro. Don’t feel like this is right to begin with.
---
W8 really? Are st cquests delayed until p2?
---
I see.. I haven’t played in years but I used to have macros for many of my abillities to position camera and player angle and auto select targets and cast delays and stuff. I thought it was in vanilla as well cus there is a macro settings.
---
&gt; Well first of all, your gear must match in color.
---
Don't give that advice! We all know this only causes Onyxia to deep breath more often!
---
My bear says hello.
---
Ahh wait till Kazzak starts roaming down there :)
---
Make sure you delete any "-master" after the actual addon Name.
---
Usually that will make it work if you still have it in.
---
Just make sure the Folder Name has the same Name as most files inside the Folder. If there is a -master too much just rename the folder
---
Ryido/Fuiko/tealeaf
---
Could you provide a source for this?
---
You can only sent mail to characters of the same faction on the same server (regardless of account)
---
The TOS, that you agreed to, explicitly states they are not required to refund/compensate you for any reason.
---
I saw a mage 3 levels lower than me who was sitting down to drink last night, so I 1-shot him with Ambush don't @me
---
i can farm tyrs hand as shadow pretty good, so no real money issues. close to epic mount aswell
---
You can get a lvl 59 green with +healing, which will roll higher. Although that belt is still really fucking good.
---
I added you
---
Classic, discussion over
---
Ya, sucks. LFG isn't used because people don't use it because people don't use it. :\
---
So does discord.
---
I always take my character's pants off before a roll for good luck, and it seems to be working great.
---
So, you’re the one who took my name...
---
Lmao some people are mad because you actually have friends. Enjoy your axe, it's gonna tear through mobs like butter for a long while.
---
In retail, if you roll need on a blue boe it automatically soulbinds it to you. However this is not classic. So EVERYONE should roll need on blue boe’s regardless if you need it or not. Why? Because someone who says it’s an upgrade or that they can use, don’t have to equip it and can sell it later.
---
Those were the rules back in vanilla, those are the rules that the people on my server do, and they work pretty well.
---
1-100
---
I believe their argument is based on the fact that removing layers condenses the spread of the playerbase. As the players are more clumped, the server required more bandwidth to communicate information between players and the other players in their vicinity. This could lead to the need to reduce the server capacity, had Blizzard not factored this in correctly when setting their original capacity.
---
From my personal opinion I'd say classic, since I like it more.
---
From an very objective POV? Try both and see what you like more
---
i've been reading all the guides on the internet and they say they are one of the strongest or better for wpvp. please explain
---
Exactly ! Playing classic warrior tank, you have dozens of button, and each one can serve at one point or another in a dungeon.
---
This is no mere "rotation", it's air traffic controller console clicking
---
Hunter class quest. Starts with Ancient Petrified Leaf drop from Majordomo in MC. It's the best experience you will have as a hunter.
---
I play solely on a cheap Walmart laptop. It’s a 15.6 inch and it works perfectly. I can sit in my recliner with a lap desk that has built in mousepad and it all fits perfectly.
---
It can be found a wowpop.appspot.com
---
Basically it's a website where people upload their data from an in-game census app.
---
Until you feel resistance.
---
/roll 100-100 somehow gets noticed way less, this is because of the amount of bots and they only roll in binary
---
They better have changed the name back the Nicker for Classic!!
---
It gives you the ability to get both of them to 30% before dying.
---
What does it do? It makes corpses. xD
---
yeah yeah we know from the 1000 others posts of this
---
Start with classic. Get to 60 and then you get bfa and a 110 boost for free.
---
Then go to bfa and wait for the next expansion.
---
What about instant cast heals like Renew and Rejuvenation?
---
Ravager arms dps tank is literally one of the core parts of the dungeongrindmeta but okay.
---
Do you want to PvP or PvE
---
Do you want an old - real MMORPG that feels like one. Go Classic.
---
If you want a convenient game for 1-2 hrs after work every other day. And don't Need the MMO part as much. Retail is for you.
---
They are both not the easiest to get into. It will take a couple of hours of playing. But they can both be fun in the beginning.
---
Most People here are gonna hate on retail. I prefer classic too.
---
But there is still a ton of People on retail so you could give it a try too.
---
You can Play both with the same subscription anyway. Try both :P
---
In your area!
---
If we're talking BIS and end endgame, it's mage and fury warrior by a decent margin. Once mages can start going fire spec their damage is insane. SPriests are never going to be high on DPS, they're just there to buff warlock damage.
---
I’ve been looking for an add on for exactly this.  What do you recommend?
---
I've seen 2 just on Firemaw EU.
---
If you like dressing up characters and play solo, then stich to retail.
---
if you like adventure and making friends then switch to classic.
---
I play both myself.
---
Finally have time to play classic wow. Is there any way to check what server balance is and where most people come from that play on those servers? Want to play alliance. I'm on EU servers and it can be annoying to be with people that mostly speak their mother language instead of English.
---
And I’m a pretty healthstone bot too, ever since I found a one-button macro to trade my current healthstone to my target (and also the macro that has my drain soul auto delete healthstones when my soul bag is full)
---
Oohhhhh, I understand now didn't quite see it that way
---
Someone who's melee with healing-capabilities: Druid, Paladin or Shaman. Druids especially should synergize very well, since they can seamlessly switch to bear to tank adds.
---
How are Shadow Wrath, Arcane Wrath and other similar suffixes supposed to work, especially in relation to wands? 
---
For instance, when you have some Shadow Wrath gear equipped and a shadow damage wand then the tooltip for your wand DPS changes but the actual damage doesn't. Shadow damage spells however, are the other way around - the tooltips don't change but the spells start doing more damage. 
---
Is this how it's supposed to work?
---
I mean if getting bit by a spider is what it takes to get a handjob then I guess...
---
P3 even, afaik.
---
like seeing a lone lock, I wouldn't bother with a CC in that situation.
---
/whistle TomTheWonderDog
---
The benefit of multiple characters so early on is self sufficiency in terms of crafting and gearing.  Obviously the con is it will take forever to do.
---
uhm no...
---
There is no cross-server or cross-faction mail in Classic.
---
Every mod which uses the LUA api is fine.
---
If you have to start an external application, it violates the TOS.
---
Are any alliance players ready to give up on pvp servers and switch to pve? I'm on kromcrush and it's hard to quest anywhere when there are groups of horde camping in quest areas just to kill alliance.
---
Prodigious size alone has no intrinsic merit...
---
The staff from scarlet library? I used that up to being high enough for herods axe. It's really nice actually. So much spirit!
---
lol..what happened there ?
---
Stop being intentionally dense, this isn't my own bias; this is the perspective of nearly everyone on my server forums, discord, and according to ServerCensus data
---
so so deep into ASS
---
Is there a specific shrine I have to praise the Random Number God at?
---
Deja
---
Am I the only one who gets slightly depressed knowing they don't have enough time in their lives to acquire this? Stuck at level 36 :'(
---
...What happens come Phase II?  This is their way of saying "Hey, if you don't like this, then we got free transfers!"  So...transfer if you don't like it.  This is a smart way of easing people into it, especially with Reddit whining about layering all the time.
---
My buddies voids name is Grimgarth. Party on Wayne! Grimly...
---
I agree it will not directly affect the population. However, condensing the playerbase increases the required bandwidth of the server. It is possible that the population will still be too high by the time they remove layers and this would lead to the need to reduce capacity.
---
It's a simple program, random number generator, now anyone who knows,  a rng isn't truly random, as mathematicians and software devs know.  But as long as everyone is using the same function, which in WoW you are, it's fair and you are unlucky or cursed.  You may also want to pray to the rng gods, but most other major religions don't like you praying to other deities.  
---
This shouldn't ever work, but you could always '/emote rolls a 100' or whatever the syntax would be.  The group should disown you immediately if you try it, namely b/c it's not convincing at all, and doesn't look right in the chat window.
---
Sorry no good answer.  Even if you were to dive into how their in game rng works, you'll simply know what is more likely to roll for everyone, not really helping or providing an advantage.
---
Helpful, hopefully.
---
Happy Hunting
---
No, this is intended. It's the same as unlearning professions: you have to skill them up if you learn them again.
---
You don't have to. Only thing you risk losing is the name of your character if your account goes inactive. If you're not overly attached to the name, then you're good. 
---
You may want to at least level to 5, however, to pick up professions such as Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring, Enchanting so that you can feed mats into them from your mains which should gather.
---
I did that yesterday and the orc lived with 5% :,(
---
I know right? I was having so much fun tanking heroics by the end of WOTLK...
---
It is common for people that play/played classic alot. We all learned over time that it makes more sense to all need but now we got alot of newbie/people that didnt play alot before and thats why i try to inform them before/after it happens. Yet it seems they expect the world to work perfect instead of adjust to dodge problem.
---
What if they weren’t referring to an in-game character?
---
This screenshot doesn't really prove many here seem to think it does.  In fact, it's equally possible that we're seeing the opposite.  We went from seeing very low queues earlier this week to suddenly higher queues last night.  Additionally, lots of mention that the servers seemed more populated.  For myself, I had to stop playing in STV last night because there were simply too many people doing the same quest as me.  
---
Blizzard inflated the servers to offset queue times.  It seems they might be reducing that inflation now that *fewer* people are trying to play at once.  They're could possibly be deflating the realms now to try and push people off to lower populated ones that might wind up dead in a month.

Why are you so passionate about turning off your PC?

The spam will go from Selling X item for 50g to HERPDERP NAME NOW BASED OUTSIDE RAZORHILL COME GET GREAT OFFERS . Your just changing item spam into shop seller spam. Its not helping if anything its gonna make trade chat even more annoying.

Wtf

MOAR DOTS
---
Everytime you press /roll, you praise god and he gives you a number. But sometimes he doesn't want to be praised and gives you 1. Because RN God is also a PMS God. Dual talent.
---
This is going to double my leveling process enjoyment!
---
I must make a macro.
---
Never spec into prot when you are leveling its a waste. You can absolutey tank as arms or fury warrior. 99% of all warrior dungeon tanks out there are also arms or fury specced. Use sunder armor to built up threat and demo and battle shout at the beginning for aoe threat. If you are rage starved and lose aggro on one target. Taunt &gt; shield block &gt; get a guaranteed block and trigger revenge &gt; use revenge
---
eeewww
---
FWIW, the skull/sheep stuff didn't even exist when WOW started. Most people played decently thought, because there were a lot of Everquest habits. Everquest was hard.
---
I only have one real complaint, and it's about class quests. Sure they have to be epic. Sure they have to exist, and not remove it like it happened to retail. But I think you should be able to do it at appropriate level, maybe have to group with a couple of other people doing the same quest chain, but that it.
---
What happens is that most of those class quests to get gear are so impossible to do without aid from people 10 lvls above you, that you just end up not doing them, and waiting 5 or 10 more levels to simply drop equivalent loot from a normal quest or dungeon.
---
And that's wasted opportunity.
---
&gt; Also, if you want to tell someone with a serpent sting that is pulling over 200-300 DPS alone that they can't use it, be my guest.
---
The issue isn't the dps, it's that if you would allow dots there are better dots than serpent sting to use.
---
Yo download questie and other add ons. I played vanilla when I was in highschool, but now I have a kid and two jobs. So having a better quest tracking and map makes a HUGE difference.
---
Afai no. Its only stats no weapon dmg
---
ok
---
I believe you are thinking of fordragon
---
Actually I was suuper surprised how many spells there are even in classic (hunter). I feel like it’s fine to have ALOT of spells, it makes the game really fun but you must distinguish between “rotational spells” like multi shot and aimed shot which are core and buttons you press all the time, and flavour/fun abilities that you only use sometimes.
---
The core abilities should always be limited to a certain number, cause you don’t want players to dance their fingers on their keyboard in a raid, but all the side abilities like tracking and eye of the beast don’t have to go on your bars so you can have introduce as many of them as you like imo.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, I'm going to keep the sp items I get on the way to 60 just to play around.
---
I am friendly with SW, and I don't think I was honored by then when I did it on my human
---
**Learn your place, mortal!**

Thanks for the answer, actually I knew this list, just wanted an add on for more confort / ease
---
Its about FD + FT....and it does not work properly.
---
There were 9 US servers on name res day, so I don’t know where you’re coming up with 4, and given realm capacities it was roughly the equivalent of 27 servers by ‘06 standards. Not to mention that leading up to and including launch day they had added I think 10 more servers. 
---
They still drastically underestimated its popularity which created a lot of bottlenecking, but not anywhere near the level to which you’re espousing in this poorly informed comment.
---
People in retail pay thousands of gold on some servers to look like this.
---
And probably OP's SO...
---
You mean where all the RPG went &gt;&lt;
---
And you need a healer, and dps.
---
Not one person in a group is more important than the other.
---
We all need money.

Flamestrike and CoC can crit and if you do them both right after a nova the damage is insane especially if you have imp CoC. Also, blizzard costs a ton of mana and doesn't do that much damage the main reason to use it is if the mobs still have a lot of health or hit really hard and you are squishy (especially if no ice barrier). The best opener imo is to group all the mobs, nova &gt; flamestrike + CoC shatter combo for huge damage then instantly cold snap and do another nova. Then another flamestrike &gt; CoC shatter and just spam AE to finish them off. It might rely on a 10min cd and be more risky but its insanely fast and efficient to do when it's up. if the mobs have more HP just start with nova &gt; blizzard &gt; blizzard then nova again when its up and do the flamestrike &gt; CoC combo then.  
---
This also works well on ranged mobs if you have ice barrier, where as blizzard wont work at all because barrier will break during a channel of blizzard and you will get huge pushback. Just need to pre-barrier before mount pulling then los re-apply barrier and nova when they come around the corner and open up on them with flamestike &gt; CoC &gt; cold snap &gt; nova &gt; reapply barrier &gt; flamestrike &gt; CoC &gt; AE spam the stragglers. Ice barrier should generally stay up long enough even vs casters to let you get that single flamestrike off.

Likable is subjective. She was clowned all through WoW by some large group or another. Recently people hate her for the mary sue powers and her hatred of the Horde, previously she was hated and called Thralls side chick for her positive relationship with the Horde. Cant win

I have a macbook pro 2017, and it certainly is not even breaking a sweat running wow classic on max

At 18 i brought my Orc Rogue to Westfall and farmed until i got my mask. Took about a full level. 
---
Now I'm 34 and have found a couple hats with stats. But my mask is in a place of honor in my bank. I'll probably get it out if i ever choose to live up my namesake as a Rogue and gank lowbies.

Hello Whittington, if you didn't know yet we have our own subreddit r/ZandalarTribe. I think this story would be more appreciated there, and maybe even one of the nice people you met will read it.
---
Everytime a blue BOE has dropped in a dungeon run everyone has rolled need and there's been no problems so far from my classic experience. I would roll need immediately and if for some reason the rest of the group rolled greed I'd address it after. You act like everyone saying 'roll need' is a situation where 4 people are rolling greed and one guy is rolling need and taking it. That's not something I'd ever do, but these are pugs and it's been BOE blue = need everytime it's dropped so far.
---
[Totally agree](https://i.imgur.com/ujwmbyk.jpg)
---
But you can pick up gray quests it just doesn't show up as a exclamation point, I tried talking to him and he had nothing
---
Oh hey, so Hunters are still busted?
---
They really did bring that classic vibe back,now didn't they?
---
:D  
---
That's what I love about Classic, the final bosses tend to really ramp up the difficulty (compared to the other bosses of the instance).
---
No, it's really just a preference. Companies can give their employees whatever titles they want, just like guilds in WoE. I work for a privately-held company that has a CEO.
---
According to the most recent census data your server is actually 52% Alliance and 48% Horde. Which is rare as most servers are heavier horde. You should be grateful.
---
confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.
---
Bear tanks are no warriors, but they are pretty legit

It was already a thing in vanilla so not hard to believe.
---
What I don't get is why didn't we have all of these back in the day?  If it was possible / efficient back then, then everyone would have been doing it.  Power-levelling and RMT was massive business back then.  What's changed?
---
Probably also longer, but I get your point.
---
Its not about that.......
---
Try FD + FT and you will know what people are talking about.
---
Xfire fuck that brought back some memories! Used to think I was the boy with the cool skins it had!
---
That clipping / geometry on the right hand side.. Having been playing classic (and enjoying it) I decided to see what bfa was like (it's free with my wow classic subscription so..) its impressive just how many aesthetic changes have been made, just how much work was put into all the cats redesigns and how jaggedy old stuff used to be.
---
Still love it though, Where's the fun in being a hero from day one? All those screenshots of your first adventure in deadmines /rfc, all that journey along the way until you arrive at the world saving iron clad badass toon your working towards just makes it all the better when you finally get there ;)
---
They monitor who you're talking to, how long, what other things you and those people did, what games you're playing, who you're playing them with etc.  They monitor your chats, your private messages, the links you post etc etc.  If you link your discord account to accounts like twitch or fb then they're tracking even more of your info like what streams you watch etc.
---
All this data is then used to either sell to third parties, or target ads at you, or sell to third parties to target ads at you.
---
Google a guide?
---
Why should anyone give you a lot of buts of infos when ypu could just read a comprehensive t
---
I discovered /ruffle isn't a thing in classic, either! How the fuck am I supposed to express myself to lowbies.i can't even.
---
Which server are you referring to?
---
&gt;max 30-40 dps
---
I agree with you but this point doesn't hep you at all. 40dps is like 20-30% less. It's fucking huge right now.
---
You may not enjoy pvp servers depending on your faction. If you're horde. Go for it. If you're alliance, maybe just stay on pve. The faction balance is probably close to 6:4 horde: alliance. It's very hard to level an alliance character without running into a 5 man group of horde at nearly every neutral zone questing area.
---
I have the same problem when I'm questing in a contested zone, it is what you should expect from a pvp server. But the thing that ticks me off is when they spam /spit or /laugh at your corpse.
---
Right, and pressing tremor totem every 2 minutes is somehow more skillful than actively using it in response to something happening.
---
From the wow wiki:
---
Cross-Realm Battlegrounds 
---
For the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you will be able to face off against players from other realms in the Battlegrounds. PvP Battlegrounds link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers!

Patch notes of the 1.12 patch "Drums of War"

If you'll use it, press need. Also everyone can press need on everything. People wanted vanilla, here's your vanilla :D

I really like the idea behind this - looks superb. Well done man, I'm downloading.

As this post hits 1000+ upvotes I'd like to thank my boss for finding the Windows 98 PC and Monitor. (Monitor is hooked up via my laptop for these photos to even be a thing)

Funny enough this is going to be my go to setup at work to play WoW Classic.

Support local businesses in your area, including Lan Centers!

Can you share it on here for me as well?

I'm going to say this one more time.  "YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T!"

Are you sure those were different guilds? 🤔
---
Skullflame-PvP has 27% to 73% A:H distribution. How bad will it get for Alliance when phase 2 hits and world PvP starts to give players actual rewards? How does faction distribution imbalance like this on PvP server affect to its player base in long run?
---
Yea I edited my entire post because I remembered there is a prerequisite.
---
A lot of that will still be possible, but things like single button rotation macros etc have been made mostly impossible to do, which is why auto queuing abilities through the macro system was clamped down on.  Basically it made botting too easy according to Blizz so that's why they made that change.
---
My vanilla solution was to zoom the camera to basically first person and walk into the bodies until I could get to the flight master to click. I never had issues.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA, Im crying. I really hope (seriously, from my heart) that you are trolling. I refuse to believe that it is possible to be this stupid/delusional. Hahahahaha
---
On kritonos too
---
Thanks once again Josh! Didn't expect an episode, however It's more then welcome at work.
---
More quest slots, 20 is just to low with all the cross zone questing.
---
I play both Alliance and Horde (I'm indecisive) so I have no problem going Horde for PvP purposes.
---
I’m really hopeful for next expansion, but I was hopeful for bFA lol. I’m optimistic blizzard will again see what people loved in classic and bring some of that go retail.?
---
Ya If I had that view, fuck playing video games.
---
You’re talking about retail here, right?
---
Tigers love pepper.
---
If your server is Faerlina, this has already been taken care of for you over the last few days, via your friendly neighborhood DDOSer.
---
They can, but trust me most people don't do it. And they can't do it until MC ends. You can also bandage them with some shitty linen bandage for half a second so they get the recently bandaged debuff.  
---
Also, if you pre-cast flamestike on the ground then dismiss the MC right before cast ends its a big opener.
---
This caused a bit o’drama on the Herod discord. One guy was saying that a remembrance in a game is disrespectful.    
---
Server discord is https://discord.gg/dkMAj86 if anyone wants to dig through world chat for it.

Huh, they "removed" Onyxia long before cata came out. Unless you had the mats banked.
---
I’m a lvl 23 warlock and did a Deadmines run, getting a blue staff from the group loot! But, I find I’m leveling relatively fast just doing normal quests and am outpacing the suggested level for Deadmines quickly.
---
Am I too high to go back in, and is there any reason to grind in there multiple times? It was a ton of fun and I’d hate to effectively do it just the one time.
---
&gt; With just 200-300 SP its doing double normal damage.
---
500 + 200 is not double dmg. Serpent sting gets 100% spelldmg bonus over the entire duration of the ability, not per tick.
---
like normal armor
---
That man has the face of an eternal friendzone
---
You can insist on seeing the item equipped on inspection, if they refuse, boot and write down the ninjas name for future reference and avoidance.
---
There is something called spell coeffients in this game. The increase depends on how big the coeffient is to how much is going to be applied.
---
Here you can find a quite nice list about it:

---
Just love when I feign death and my character just stands there. No animation. No combat drop. No resist. The ability just simply didnt do anything, but of course goes on CD.
---
My guess is to prevent auto logins/afkers. Since it already so overloaded, they don't want ppl afking on the character selection screen ether.
---
Dude it's the first thing I did when I found out and my god it's amazing. 
---
My Undead out here training for the NBA with those mosh-pit jump shots lol.
---
Not op but yeah sometimes. Like I didn't know about the tram so I was really confused on how to get to loch moden for a while. I enjoyed not being walked through the Quests at first but ultimately I got addons like questie. Bc it's just nice knowing where stuff spawns at bc it's super frustrating not being able to figure it out or finding a very small spawn of something for a quest and the respawns are slow or there's other people and im just like welp is this the only spot? Idk but I don't want to run around in case it is.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d36w4d/anyone_else_want_wow_classic_to_progress_into_tbc/). 
---
Guys Blizz obviously knows what's best for us. We think we do, but we don't. I mean just look at all the severs, they're basically all dead... Oh. Wait.
---
bonebiter is barely even an upgrade, it has slighlty more damage but its also faster, the stats add up to basically the same total number so its really about whether you want the extra str or stam.
---
I don’t remember the details, but there were some mats that weren’t from onyxia that I needed and finished up
---
One was on alliance and one was on horde, so yeah. Their names weren't identical but they both had the same meaning.
---
It’s all good as long they are okay with it. It’s just selfish, they all need money.
---
But make sure you use the exact phrasing as you did for the post title. Very important
---
You know it still exsists and works right
---
If you want something that is suited to wPvP then rogues have the clear advantage in due to stealth, sprint, vanish, etc.
---
Mages are a little more vulnerable but still great and you can escape with nova/blink.
---
For the average player, hunters are a little more difficult but you have a great toolkit and a range advantage over literally everybody else.
---
Warlocks are also a little more difficult because you lack mobility and but once you get some gear at 60 you get to enjoy being one of the best 1v1 classes.
---
I don't mind layering. This whole thing about bumping into people you know happens all the time even now with layering.
---
In any case I am not transferring queues or not. I've learned to queue up remotely and if it becomes such a big issue, I would much rather quit.
---
or free if you host it yourself
---
good point, thanks. i just will try druid tonight and see what happens. maybe just play both. after all i play for fun and i guess its enough time until phase 2 to have 2 characters at  60...
---
I think vanilla/ classic has more due to being able to use all ranks of your spells for better mana conservation. 
---
Playing priest and I have 2 ranks of heal, 2 ranks of shield, 3 ranks of lesser heal, 3 ranks of smite. 
---
Basically ends up as more.
---
They still fetch a good amount of money online. I feel like this is mostly due to Super Smash Bros. Melee lol
---
Night elf hunter is the best race class combo there is. I win 99% of the wpvp battles 1v1 that i start.
---
WoW is old as shit
---
Imo a rogue should keep locked chests.
---
They cant tell who is and isnt using it.
---
They eventually have to reduce server capacity to prepare for phase 2. I'm still baffled how they want to manage servers with high pop.
---
Bubble, then hearth. Not much more to it. The alternative is to learn how to PvP and try to kill the Horde instead of running. FOR THE BANSHEE QUEEN!
---
#What can I do for you?
---
Wanted to comment the same.
---
Isn't the max rank 12 sec?
---
My character sheet doesn't look like that?? how do i get that one!?

---
The site the add-on directs you too had been down. The other one I put the link for was created to replace it while it's down

I turn my camera angle so I’m looking straight down, then click on the flight master’s head.
---
Is this really high-poly enough to warrant an NSFW tag?
---
Oh look more garbage repost type "memes"?? (If you can even call if that.....)
---
Did this a couple days ago. Robes dropped and the druid who was already wearing them rolls need. So instead of me getting some nice new blue robes the druid now has a matching pair. Feels classic man.
---
Yeah, but as a hunter, everyone knows you never really do that because you're too busy not having ammo, you don't have a pet yet, you're melee RPing, or because we're all dazed.
---
I think one guild got it end of week 1 or early week 2.

&gt;? You go for a holiday to get some sun, fresh air, actually move around and use your body.
---
How do you know why I would go on a holiday? I go to such locations to do nothing at all. To move my body as less as possible, and stay out of the direct sun cause I burn like a lobster. Playing wow would not interfere with that, but since I like to do nothing at all. Even wow might be too much to do.
---
Is it a meme spec if the bosses and raids are memes too? I mean shit. People cleared MC and Ony with like half the raid not even 60 and fewer than 40 people.
---
He can like grinding but not have the time. It's one of his points in the article. Him pointing to positive things in retail doesn't diminish the fun aspects of Classic, imo.

you only need to purchase rank 1 tank skills from your trainer while leveling. even then taunt is either free or like one silver. get demo shout, taunt, sunder, and mocking blow which is a backup taunt and you have what you need to tank for now.
---
PvE servers don't count.
---
So you had nothing good to say about rogues?! :D
---
Wow that's awesome. Is it a free service?
---
calvin is clearly a gnome
---
I agree with this mostly, but what if, say, I'm level 31 and a level 33 upgrade drops. Is that a need or greed moment? Personally I'd need because it truly is an upgrade that I will equip, but I was in a party where someone else (who was also not able to equip) said this was unfair.
---
No self respecting warlock would allow themselves to be a puppet to a demon. Especially not for that low amount of damage.
---
Now you want to give me the ability to cast while moving I’m your gimp.
---
Damn right it is! /r/Earthfury
---
A few days ago I noticed a queue on Dreadmist over a day or 2, only small 1k queue but it's the only time I've seen it happen
---
&gt; something that got removed from retail long ago around late WotLK/Cata.
---
Everyone being way overgeared near the end of WotLK made everyone complacent with doing nothing but facerolling over their keyboard.  
---
Then when Cata (heroic) dungeons were suddenly hard again and everyone actually had to pay attention they all whined till blizzard nerfed it all into easy mode, a final nail in the coffin.
---
Yes it does affect server cap. Here is a simple diagram for you

I've played games that had Auction houses and player market trading just like this and I can tell you for a fact that the spam just doubles because its people spamming selling 1 item AND people spamming their shop location name and prices. Your not gonna be helping anyone and your not gonna change the atitude of players who have bought and sold items the same way for 15+ years. Stop deluding yourself.
---
I think "right up to the hilt" is an appropriate response.
---
Pilavpowa plays on horde there that's why horde is main
---
If you can do all that shit you're describing in what is obviously a very situational scenario it is pretty clear you're 2+ vs 1, in which case all of it is very unecessary and you can just kill the guy by mashing random buttons.
---
Well the two main points that kinda quell any argument. 
---
 #1 we have the best name
---
 #2 the factions are almost balanced at like 55/45 in hordes favour. Most are 80/20 or 90/10.
---
 Another part is there's no major steamers and no super try hards. We have a handful of 60's so far but not like 200-400 like some others alrdy. As a result I think the raiding and PvP down the road will be the most fun.
---
So a $2000 laptop that has specs as good as a $500 pc
---
&gt; The Aimed Shot, Auto Shot, Multishot combo
---
Just to add, not many players do it, but Scatter Shot is very useful to setup the above combo. 
---
Same as Beastspec Intimidation stun.
---
It’s not a ninja roll. It pretty universally accepted, unless it’s a guild run who has a guild bank, BoE Epics and twinkle items are a free for all.
---
Which addon is it?
---
Liar, you can't fool me!
---
(Yes, and I agree)

2 ubers for the titans 2 scholos for the power and wisdom was sent to me

Yeh, but what about playing wow on vacation? So you actually do something you love in a location  you love? I see it as a win win besides the glare that would give me a headache.

What's that add-on showing extra stats , it looks really helpful.
---
&gt;Are they stealth shrinking servers?
---
Not impossible, that might explain the huge increase in players in my zones i saw last night, tanaris and stv was packed like crazy if you compare it too how it was in the low lvl zones when i started playing last month.
---
Any chance to blizzard implemment a pool system in classic wow like jagex do in osrs?
---
If programmed correctly RNG is random.
---
Correct, you are one of the few in this thread that understands this.
---
Nope!
---
George get on IRC!
---
wut wut in the but but
---
I highly doubt 2% food will get people to play.
---
you dont need any consumables for MC, see APES
---
You are aware that this isn't exactly like vanilla, was right? There have been changes and there will be further changes if they make sense.
---
&gt;If you want M+ you can go play Retail ofcourse
---
I don't want M+. I want a simple LFG tool similar to how the one for M+ works. Like you can simply post your groups on there and people can join if they wish. It is basically just some sort of pinboard.
---
Leatrix! That's what I use, along with Auctioneer.
---
God, what I would give for just like a 10% buff to the shittest specs.
---
Imagine making ret pallys/boomkin/ele somewhat viable for raids.
---
First thing I would change would be to up the debuff limit to 30+ (allowing a hell of a lot more play styles for raids) and then retune the raids to make them harder. Imagine if you could actually raid as affliction warlock....
---
Hai :)  saddly no
---
Back in the days it was from Vanilla to TBC , it was fixed early in TBC because many people abused that thing in arenas or bgs. But surprisingly they didnt removed drinking/eating in combat lol
---
my guild just stopped raiding at 6/8M due to classic, i don't mind it as much but some of the raid team did for sure :/
---
Yes because then as he gets upgrades those upgrades would be enhancing the groups ability to clear, which then would mean he shouldn't be getting resto drops, as they would go to someone who would use them in their main spec.
---
This stance eases up once the raid is better geared and loot isn't so important on a per character basis, you have to start by gearing the raid, not individual characters.
---
my wife said 7 1/2 is enough for her.
---
Yeah, sometimes you STOP casting frostbolt and stand still.
---
Talk shit when someone ninjas. Masterloot has nothing to do with ninjaing.
---
try dancer! it's absolutely fucking baller with a simple priority rotation but really really nice flow.
---
I'm looking for a class to alt. My main is a shaman, which I'm planning to do raid and general wPvP with (Resto/elemental spec). What I'm looking for in my alt is 1) A class that's relatively easy and pleasant to level with, 2) A class that provides a different gaming experience from shaman, 3) A class that can farm gold well, and 4) A class that is relatively gear independent, since most of my gearing efforts will be funneled into shaman. Currently I'm looking into either mage or rogue, but I'm open to suggestions. Thoughts?
---
Ay I met this guy last night!!! I gave him 31 copper and wished him luck. He was walking around picking up litter and mumbling under his breath about people littering :/
---
Thank you for the information. Is there a list anywhere online that points to these to download? I haven't even thought of using a mod in about 15 years so I am rusty.
---
You'll be fine, H outnumber A in PvP servers
---
It's the aoe xp farming groups. They are the worst.
---
WHAT?!?!?
---
It took me 89 tries just to get power on the private Server i played on...
---
After that I stopped I gave up I couldn't take it anymore...
---
Congrats to you my sir. You are bound to make a lot of Gold rather soon :D
---
Why? For AB and AV it's awesome to have a stealth team with druids for behind-enemy-lines shenanigans. In world PVP, having the first-strike advantage is great. If you invest into pots/bandages and engineering you should have no problems.
---
Look at it from this perspective: No class is perfect for all PVP situations. If you reroll, you will discover that other classes have other drawbacks. Imagine being a warlock in a PVP fight, your pet was just killed, you are out of soulshards, you have already eaten you healthstone, and your soulstone is on cooldown. This will be the moment when you  think "If only I had vanish now...". (Not saying that one or the other class is better, being a rogue you could also die and think "I'd really love to have a soulstone right now".)
---
I get that there's no point trying to convince anyone on a classic subreddit that they might just be a tad bit biased towards classic, but this is def full on bias.
---
Say what you will about retail, but you have more abilities, that you use more regularily.   
---
Fact that it evidently means less to you isn't something I can debate, and don't feel a need to either, good for you if you enjoy classic.
---
What I don't get though, is the need to shit on retail with every positive comment about classic, classic evidently can't just be good, it has to be "better than retail".
---
Ew. For me this ruins a lot of interactions, seeing people suddenly disappear to different phases or not being in the same 'world' as friends.
---
Are you using any addons? Have you tried reinstalling or repairing wow?
---
&gt; Removing those layers does neither increase or decrease any population numbers, it just puts all those players into the same instance.
---
You are right in a sense, but by putting those players into the same instance, you increase the strain on the server, which causes lag. To counter the lag, you reduce the capacity.
---
That's genius, I've just been spamming tab and 3.
---
I hope you kicked them from your guild
---
I Guess you could make a macro but I have no idea how haha
---
First thing I do as soon as I enter a dungeon is start making a ton of water and ask who needs it.
---
People are so impatient to get the int buff and start pulling though.
---
So I sit there, drinking, give water out, start buffing while theyre killing stuff and drink again cause that AI is expensive. 
---
Never met someone in dungeons that doesn't buff everyone though. Am on PvP server.
---
Those fucking ghouls destroy me. Fire blasts that can hit like 700 and instead of focusing my pet with aggro they pummel me with 400 damage shadow bolts.
---
If you pull more than one then you may as well dig your own grave 😂
---
So he was in the cave for 2 hours camping your corpse. And you never tried to rez outside the cave?
---
Really if you're getting camped like that just log on to another character, rez sick, or die/respawn until you get to a safer area.
---
Could you clarify what you mean by combat daggers spec? Any example build would be amazing!
---
Except stealth, pve dps, stun, burst, and out of combat utility. Feral druid is literally just a mediocre rogue, because they're not supposed to do anything better than any other class. They're supposed to be jack of all trades master of none, and that's what they are.
---
Heeeey wait a minute...
---
I'm sure many of us have had experiences of somebody "needing" a BOE epic, only to see them list it on the AH.
---
Then,  the whole twink thing came around and a single BOE drop could mean a whole new wardrobe or the cost of an epic mount.  So things got real fuzzy from there.  Is +6 damage for you for 4 levels worth more than an epic mount to me later?
---
Anyways, we're not at that price point yet, and I like to see gear used and not squirreled away for later.   So I say need it and equip it while us folks that want money greed it.  Just as the system intended. 
---
I do like the idea that needs get automatically bound though.
---
What is AR
---
Hurricane Dorian took out power to my city for like 3 days, and a lot of other cities on the coast. That may have had an effect.
---
You need 200+ spellpower before you start breaking even with aimshot builds. I honestly just hate aimshot so much, part of the reason I wanted to find a way not to.
---
Thermaplugg's left arm from my first gnome run! It got double the strength and stamina than my current 2H. 
---
I tanked most of my dungeons with 1h/shield but also like questing and exploring with my 2H.
---
I mean, top guilds have used account sharing for years upon years to achieve world first kills, Blizzard knows this, Blizzard does not give a fuck. Same goes for the audience.
---
What add-on for the unit frames?
---
For some people, the idea of the character they play being themselves is very appealing. And seeing as we are humans, a human is the obvious choice for living out that fantasy. I personally don't play a human, but I can def see why someone would want to.
---
RP server?
---
Realm first?
---
Until the started whining and the devs listened to them.
---
&gt;found an old swifty video that shows him using the item and it doesn't seem to work that way.
---
They changed the item because of his video and the people who began abusing it afterwards. This was well before BC.
---
As a rogue make sure you do the following quests:

How is that trolling? Literally the most common complaint about retail is that every element of what defines a mmorpg was removed. Yeah it isn't a game.
---
They’re tasting you and getting your scent for the hunt
---
Jesus fuck so THAT'S why that fucking owl literally replaced me as the tank in those SM runs.
---
FUCK OWLS
---
You actually get less threat since you shoot a lot of fast and small damage.
---
This would be a great way to encourage more people to drift away from the higher pop queued servers...
---
... remove layers so the queue times rise.
---
Speak for yourself. That makes it all the better for me.
---
somehow, it's still more interesting though.
---
Your ideas are so fresh
---
Given they've said medium now is like full in vanilla... There's probably 6-10k people. Estimating around 15k when they intentionally increased server capacity, but they may have brought it back down now.
---
dumbass
---
Option 4: Tell them your Lockpicking Skill is too low and after clearing the instance get back to dat chest, lul!
---
1. Mostly correct, however INT doesn't give damage - it gives mana and a bit of crit. But while leveling it is the correct stat to focus on.
---
2. You'll make more money if you just keep grinding and questing on your main.
---
Which pro is that
---
I know it's a joke but still, how stupid of all the things to say to someone you choose that. Should be promoting this game as much as possible and you never know when someone might just be like "ya know what fuck it I will."
---
Casting time: Slam
---
Pally tanks rejoice! Warriors getting fixed to no longer edge in on the one thing we do well!
---
It's always +healing or +spell power \* given spell coefficient. It's not always 100% of what it states.
---
Lol im in the magic cleave mode, no need for a healer with 3 mages a lock and a druid lol
---
Lets break the flying mounts legs
---
Yeah, but people can chat across multiple layers. That's what the person you replyed to considered a cheating.
---
We go hard
---
Hol up...
---
Discord has a paid mode that many people use and it includes advertisements. 
---
Could you provide your source? Everything I've read about them seems on the up and up.
---
This is like saying you dont pay steam monthly so it's obviously stealing information about you and selling it to people. Like, maybe, sure, but doing that certainly would harm their other big ass and 100% legitimate way of making money.
---
no thats bullshit, there is no way that there was patch every single time i have logged in.
---
Now diss it to get rid of the "unknown"
---
You need an auto clicker program for that.
---
Yes but there is basically no great that Hunter's can't benefit from
---
Activate your windows
---
Yes, except for the fact that the entire purpose of layering is to increase the number of players who can be comfortably logged into the server at once. The server maximum is defined by the number of layers times the player limit per layer. It is not a static number, which is obviously why we are seeing queue times rise as layers are being reduced.
---
drop the comma
---
Can I ask how a warrior tanks those mate? At low level I could imagine it being a nightmare for a warrior to hold that much aoe?
---
I would be happy if they just added new content to classic at 60 - new zones, quests, dungeons, raids.
---
I actually don’t downvote anything. Any I my history are from my daughter playing with my phone.
---
I actually tanked Vanilla through Cata. Demo was actually a solid threat builder, though it was used as I described it. I wasn’t aware that tanks were currently literally just spamming demo, I figured it was hyperbole (since so many often try to oversimplify things). I was wrong, I have no problem admitting that.
---
However, it doesn’t change that your original post was made entirely from feelycrafts with literally zero actual supportive evidence. You lucked out that you ended up correct. But we still don’t know how much of an impact it actually had, since they released zero numbers or explanation of how it was performing wrong. Then your need to come back and try to rub it in was just plain unnecessary childish.
---
XP was released in 2001.  The rest of your point stands, though.  I used a big-ass, 21" CRT until around 2005.
---
What was his story?
---
These bots are getting really advanced. They almost seem like people, scary.

What are the best professions for a Rogue if u want to make gold?
---
They really are! So cool with all factions. I saw this photo in an article and  totally saw my chill but helpful guildies in their faces.
---
It's really interesting how quickly video games went from a nerds and children only thing to not only completely normalized but the most popular form of entertainment.
---
Warrior PvP is rough without intercept and mortal strike.  Hang in there and you'll get better.
---
Disarm is really good against rogues, but it costs 20 rage which you'll lose upon changing stance unless you have 4 points in tactical mastery talent.
---
Earthfury Gang  represent!
---
Forgot if engineering has it, but I know bs has it.
---
I’m not a first time player but honestly had no idea. I must have been real bad at this game back in the day.
---
Yeah cause Combat rogue auto attack + poison does no dmg... I gank priests of my level and they cant even fear me.
---
Thanks, when you say "underleveled" how do you determine that reliably to avoid attempting them before you should?  The quests we had were yellow.
---
Do whatever you want. I have my friendlist and my hunter isn't my only toon. (chuckles in healer)
---
Those are some precise numbers. You must have a PhD in Math.
---
This sounds like the best possibility for me and everyone out there!
---
Second option!
---
If you are playing warrior, the plainstrider is probably the one asking.
---
It’s pretty annoying. I was one of the first 60 locks on my server and honestly it can get annoying when you’re not somewhere where you can get more. Like if you’re fighting off horde in redridge you’re kind of screwed after a few fights because you’ll need to go get more soul shards and the nearest mobs are in burning steppes (which is actually pretty close but you get the idea) it can be quite annoying and I even keep 30+ in my bank just in case but if you’re not in high level zones for a while it’s easy to run out.
---

If you level in stranglethorn it will be like you’re actually at the beach!

Typical hunter, trying to find a way to roll need on everything equippable :P
---
I felt like I was nitpicking when typing my comment tbh.
---
I like Elvui, it’s nice and clean looking and customizable.
---
no
---
This community...I love this community
---
Now that's epic.
---
Isn't that abandon? As I can recall a pet I dismiss?
---
That's another discussion. Financially, it is free. Which is what I assumed he was questioning, and not the ethical question about your data...
---
I'm just guessing here... Is the spell used the one that you're reading the tooltip of? Check spellbook pet tab
---
They’re really strong, but get weaker with each gear tier. They’re the strongest right now because your aimed shot + multi shot hits for 2k while casters have 2.5k hp.
---
Again, its not my fault you’re sensitive.
---
Yeah that’s how it’s been in all the dungeons I’ve done in game and nobody has gotten upset. People here are pretty stuck on the need if you want to use, greed to sell but they’ll change their song after greeding on something like edgemasters and it gets ninjad.
---
TBC fixed a lot of stuff too.  Honestly I'd love a server which is basically classic but has the level 70 cap and TBC talent trees - but just doesn't actually have outland because flying breaks the game imo.
---
What's Heartseeker popation like? Is it a ghost town? Horde vs alliance ratio?
---
https://youtu.be/NsLKQTh-Bqo
---
You turn it on and whenever it rotates back and fourth the screw driver part hits the space bar so you jump.
---
Wtf man.. Just say your skill aint high enough, that u never trained it and when the dungeon is over, run back and take it!!!!
---
Thanks that's a helpful guide of levels.  Is there a method you use to determine those numbers?  or just in your experience this is the levels YOU would try them at?
---
I've dealt with them back in WoTLK when I started so no major sweat off my back.  If you arent raiding then keeping like 10 on you is fine.
---
It's also always nice to have a thanks when you res someone while passing by, it even sprung in little rp chats sometimes
---
Every civil and considerate person IRL will be/act the same - for the most part - in game.
---
Sadly, the opposite is also true.
---
i heard that the scalatinjg things matters in raids, not in pvp.
---
I'm a tank and I'm always being moaned at by the healer to go pull more and stop wasting time. I pull a few extra than what I'm comfortable with and nearly die as a result.
---
Taurens have better herbalism, warstomp, and more health.
---
Nightelves have better dodge, better stealth,  smaller hit box, and faster runs back from the graveyard.
---
Some would argue that Taurens make the better Bear druids and Nighelfs make the better cat druids.
---
With restro being a toss up between the two.
---
I loved that show. Brings back so many good memories!
---
My wife won't let me bring my laptop to the Maldives next week during our holiday :(
---
At least with today's hotfix on AoE threat there's been significantly less people looking for cleave/xp farm groups. Thank fuck for that
---
Nicenice
---
Beat us all to it. Hahaha
---
I mean I ask every dungeon "you want me to sheep?" and I'll be happy to sheep every single pull. but when I hear "no need" and tank pulling multiple packs at the same time and encouraging me to aoe? I ain't gonna pass that oportunity up and start sheeping only when we overpull and shit hits the fan.
---
Just do it intelligently. Tell your people are you staying or going and everything's gonna be alright nooo?
---
I’ve always wished I could play a Quillboar they’re so cute
---
If you have 1 mage use rank 1 blizzard it will apply the slow and let the tank start kiting while the demo spam continues.
---
I don't think so. You would need iron/heavy stone to level efficiently up to that level, or a huge amount of bronze, and tin is still quite rare at that level.
---
as opposed to a ton of spell you have access to but never use on classic?
---
please tell me how often you fireball on your frostmage...
---
On vanilla I had my mount at lvl 52... No shame in just going forward
---
No free healthcare? Medicaid and Medicare exist and we spend the same amount of public money per person as any European country...

PvE happened on a PvE server. Welcome to Classic.
---
Oh no he ninjaed 2 silver 😟
---
Join a guild.
---
Absolutely my thoughts as well. I wanted to roll on a High/Full pop server because when the hype inevitably wears down (whenever that may be) I want to still be on a server that finds itself Medium/High all the time. Also I am in no rush to hit 60 so if I log in at 9pm EST and have to wait 20 minutes that's not so bad, a hell of a lot better than waiting 2 hours on one of the biggest servers. I have other games or something productive I do in that 20 minutes and it's fine with me.
---
“I’m about to go on break, better stare at my blank screen for a few seconds first.”
---
Ye and even if he gets his +3 int upgrade for 5lvls.
---
Since when is +3int, especially during lvling, worth more than 200g?
---
If you pick up the stone talon flight path it's no where near that bad.
---
It’s not simple because people are greedy and even if they say it’s an upgrade , they are most likely just going to sell it. That’s the point that your missing here.
---
Yeh it was really good, also the bosses with adds where you could finnish of a random trash to then just keep on soulfiring for certain amount of times etc :D My favourite demo lock ever made honestly. 
---
ALso the tanks hated me during aoe. demon form, immolation aura, rain of fire/hellfire + any trinkets etc. Damn that was alot of aoe lol
---
As a matter of fact I do! My dude below guessed right in regards to contrast, I do it through the GeForce overlay (alt f3 if you have it, super convenient). 
---
I’m also using the new Sharpness tool I believe they added recently, and it takes the game to the next lvl. You’ll have to mess with it a bit to get it to look natural to you, but it’s so worth it. 
---
I’ll jump on in a bit and see how I set mine up and let you know if you’d like :)
---
Shouldn’t you be looking for a job and not being a worthless leech on society who’s never felt a woman?
---
But on normal there is pvp if you turn it on right? The servers still confuse me...
---
I have macros setup for all my healing abilities:
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast \*insert spell name\*
---
showtooltip shows the spell icon and info, cancelform.... cancels whatever form you happen to be in, cast name means it will cast the highest rank of that ability available. 
---
Very helpful to have these macros on healing abilities, since as a Tauren and getting swamped, I can do my ground stomp that stuns and then get a regrowth off followed by a rejuve with minimal "oh shit" time. Or just laziness in not wanting to click out of the form to begin with.

oh that's cool. So those APIs allow hidden whispers?

Ah. It sounds like something I should probably postpone till post-60 then, and meanwhile just pick up my racial mount till then.

Thanks for the input.

Looks like sandstone actually
---
Catch up was for BWL/AQ yea?
---
I miss my flying form as a Druid, felt so unique and loved flying over zones looking for pvp and enjoying the view.
---
Well that is probably true. No idea what the exact Definition is. 
---
For me a casual is someone that doesn't Play a lot and someone that Plays a lot and is not efficient is a casual pleb. :D 
---
Efficient and inefficient is quite obvious...
---
I mean I really don't care how People Level. If they have to they can also layerhop I honestly couldn't give less fcks xD
---
I just hate all the Drama. Let People be. And do what they do. right?
---
If People choose not to spell cleave that is fine if People choose to spellcleave or whatever that is fine too.
---
It is one huge game with loads of opportunities it would be Kind of sad if everyone would be doing the exact same and no one actually takes Advantage of all the possibilities. :P
---
I like the cleave Groups because you get a fast Group really easy and I only want 1-2 runs in each dungeon :P So it is +/+ for both sides :)
---
Oh course he plays all day HE'S A PALADIN 🤣
---
Hit 40 yesterday and still 45g short of mount (bought riding since was in town)... Thinking best bet is to just continue questing as normal to get the gold unless ppl have a better idea?  
---
I am a LW so could grind mobs and sell the leather but was trying to wait until closer to 42 to do that on scorpid mobs in Tanaris since need a lot of scales to make upgraded mail gear.
---
It does cost money to "sit your ass at home." Ever heard of rent or electricity?
---
Try this if you're bored sometime.  Open up discord and then open up a youtube playlist with autoplay enabled.  Say key words like hamburger, big mac, hungry, etc.  And now you have mcdonalds commercials playing in your YouTube.     
---
It obviously wont work with all things but my friends and I had a fun time messing around with their recording algorithms.  Always wondered how discord was free...
---
Xp an hour
---
As long as my vanilla char wont be gone.. I mean it should have copy of my char. But vanilla realm stays up to with my char and progress, if it just progresses, removing classic and my char will change his gear n hellfire im out again
---
I saw a warrior jump down from the boat just as it loaded. I think "Lol, have fun swimming". Then I see the berserker stance quest island, target the warrior - level 30. Whoa! Was super impressed.
---
You only use one seal?
---
Next time ask them for some fried green pertaders mmmhmm.
---
*subtly disables Healbot*
---
The fastest way to level is to do specific quests and grind mobs solo. You grab all the quests in an area, walk there and as you're going there you should be killing every mob you encounter. Same thing for when you go back to hand them in.
---
Theres been several times where we pull a room, kill everything, and then I ask where the boss is, only to have found that the boss was in the mass group that we pulled.
---
1 more level! I've been using 1h and Shield the entirety of my leveling though. I guess I may have to change that in the future.
---
Indeed, my bad.
---
Server?
---
TBH he’s probably not on my realm /faction so IDGAF what he does. Not sure why you’re on Reddit crying over a lvl 40 green.
---
The PVE servers are just minecraft right? Or did I miss something?
---
Seal Fate daggers build is good for pvp and ok for pve, but it requires really good gear though.
---
I mean obviously it's pretty hilarious if people actually whisper you ingame that "you're doing it wrong!!!", but I don't really get why anyone would want to go hard meta and try to "speedrun" (without actually getting even close to world first though) a 15 year old, fairly easy game.
---
Looks like you're jerking off and shooting cumbolts
---
I completely missed the talent in the Arms tree that lets you retain 25 rage upon switching stances.  I'm going to respec into that and I feel like that will solve a lot of my issues with charging in and not doing anything.  I should also be able to switch for overpower or mocking blow etc.  
---
I really appreciate all the advice you've given me!  I've saved those macros and been using them on some mobs while grinding.  Hopefully I can incorporate them when I start doing WC in a few levels!
---
could stand to be a little skimpier but agree
---
I think only enchants like crusader that give you an actual proc buff work like this.
---
No hurry to kill 15 year old e-dragons
---
Oh right! I always forget ESO is a thing. Ok, that makes one MMO out of many :)
---
So just need on everything is what you are saying.
---
Blizzard said they are lowering layers as more people quit the game, that's why its full.
---
You can obviously see the sting is triple the dps you are putting, it's pretty clear what happened. The dps does not move up or down between the two regardless. Also, going spellpower scales way better. This is phase 1 dungeon stuff, imagine when ZG comes around and you can get hunter SP gear, a trinket and the arcane infusion.
---
This build is obviously viable.
---
Rogues are moving target dummies when they can't stun you. Have yet to see a rogue give me trouble unless he was lvl ??.
---
Uncultured ally smh
---
Im getting tired of telling people "on it, wait a bit". I sometimes get random whispers while i quest from people around me !? saying "give me water!" Yesterday i got a whisper from someone "portal me to TB", he wasnt even in the same zone with me so i told him "i cant" and his replay was "why is that so fucking hard to push a button?" Me "im level 45, i cant even learn TB, 2nd you are not in the same zone as me, and 3rd you can always ask nicely". While i was typing all that for nothing as he already ignored me.  So yea... i feel you magebro.
---
Who cares, the community and rivalries are already ruined by layering. Crossrealm bg doesn't change anything at this point.
---
&gt; So I looked up a translator and figured out that Tomaz is Portuguese for Tom in English.
---
Source?
---
da FCK did I just read...  
---
I mean he has a few valid points, but stuff like " In modern WoW, every class has distinct specializations that change what  abilities I have access to and sometimes what role I play in a group." really blew my mind... I mean he is talking about a game where it wont matter sh... if you are warlock, mage or hunter, they are all generic damage dealers.
---
Very, Very slowly

Mate Im sure you could have used remote desktop thousand of times, just wait till you have it installed
---
Speaking of two stealthed rogues.  There were two outside of Hammerfall late last night.  Killing any Horde player coming or going.  The guards would try their hardest to chase them down, but they would laugh and vanish.  I came in on a flight path to turn in a quest.  I saw what was happening and stepped outside the gates as bait.  Sure enough on come the rogues.  Down goes earthbind, Rogue uses vanish (it's not very effective), 8 Hammerfall guards use gang bang (it's super effective), goodbye rogue.

The rest of us do

Asked yesterday but would like some more input. For pure farm on a PvE server (got a warrior main with herb/alch). Hunter or druid and what prof? 
---
Cheers.
---
Here's a hint, almost every single change in retail that people complain about was due to players.
---
 I would join an instance as a tank when the mobs are not red anymore. You can't get carried to the same extent a low level dps would. Also for a healer of course having mobs be red means very little except aggro radius. 
---
 So a tank is more restricted when it comes to what level to join an instance( if you want a smooth run that is). There are so many advantages to playing a tank though so it's a small price to pay. Having it easy to find groups and getting healers on your friend list more than make up for it.
---
&gt; But seriously, tanking so far has been draining as fuck.
---
glad its not just me. I've always been told tanking is the easiest job, and maybe in retail it is. But right now, tanking multimob packs is intense. Way more intense, APM heavy then even healing mythics in retail.
---
What spells are you using for your main heals? Most efficient for mana are heal and greater heal.
---
Definitely, you’ll do much more damage with a 2h.
---
I like it because I imagine them raging , just like you are now. Oooooooosh its great
---
2h/day with weekends off and level 55? Well, you're really good with that, congratulations.
---
Or, you're not telling the truth and just have to prove your point. In that case, shame on you lier mage.
---
Or, maybe...  Think about it...
---
Players could stop being jerks (like many of the Classic community are) and not body block flight masters?
---
Nothing ethical about it - they make money off your data therefore your data has value and you give it to them in exchange for the service.  No part of that transaction means that it's free, therefore having a * next to "Free" is perfectly apt.
---
Btw doesn't boats and zeppelins supposed to have at least some NPCs on them?
---
SHAME ON YOU
---
LETS GET HIM A LIFETIME BAN LIKE HE DESERVE FILTHY NINJA LOOTAH
---
I got ElvUI for the first and good damn is it hard to understand what everything does. There are so many options you can easily get  overwhelmed and frustrated. I've spent litteraly hours trying to get it just right.
---
Right now I'm trying to figure out how to edit the tooltips, like when you mouseover someone. Anyone know how to do this within ElvUI?
---
The nearby mage also sells a chicken pet for 1g.
---
I just got it yesterday at lvl36. Had to farm the mats for 4 hours (the tusks included, stv is a mess right now).
---
In the end, a horde warrior helped killing Cyclonian (I am playing Alliance).
---
Since then, leveling has been much easier. Mobs just...die if I hit then a few times (I can even solo 2 or 3 mobs át the same time!).
---
You can actually fight two mobs your level as a warrior, even without sweeping strikes. For 3 mobs you'd need to either retaliate or use a hp pot though.
---
I play on a Horde dominated PvP server as alliance. It literally takes me an hour to do 1-2 quests because we are continuously corpse camped. Believe me I would rather be out in the world questing but it is much easier to just sit in SM for 10 levels.
---
Because the alpha male thing to do is clearly to take it in the ass and accept getting stole from. 
---
Low effort justification dude.
---
Look,  normally I'm not the guy who blames streamers for everything. I think some of them are entertaining and some are knowledgeable. They usually have their place.
---
But i do believe this spell cleave, or even melee cleave, dungeon farming bullshit is streamers fault. Well, to be more precise, more the fault of their viewers who just do whatever they see without thinking. 
---
Big streamers can fill their groups with specific classes instantly just from their viewerbase.
---
The average pleb like me doesn't have that luxury. I see people trying to find Mages for spellcleave for half an hour. I make my own group and take anyone around the right level and fill the group, including a healer or tank, within minutes.
---
Spellcleave is stupid. And twitch viewers (as a group) are stupid.
---
The focus functionality is there. Just the frame is missing, you can /cast [@focus] spellname
---
Don’t get sick over there buddy. You’ll go broke.
---
Then you are lucky. For most hunters the macro does not work and it ruins pvp for us. FD doesnt drop combat properly. For some FD doesnt even show an animation, it goes on CD doing nothing. People are pissed on hunter discord.
---
Leveling without growl or greater Stam is kinda brutal
---
What is wrong with them?
---
That does not affect their ability to artificially limit server capacity as they remove layers. They have never confirmed nor denied that this would be the case as far as I can tell.
---
Did Tom Howard rereleased Skyrim in it already?
---
Maybe in a time when just purely having more stats from a higher item level piece was strictly better in 99% of scenarios, but that's not even remotely the case in classic/vanilla and it really has no place.
---
Nothing generates more IRL rage than when someone pulls for me...

How about instead of being passive aggressive you open your mouth and actually talk to people that you need a mana break. 
---
I know social interactions with other humans are hard in a game like wow, but give it a try.
---
&gt; But as long as everyone is using the same function
---
That's not really a requirement if the RNG is good, since a good RNG is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random uniform distribution from the outside.

I have no idea how to explain it but it was in an admin scripting class I had a few months ago. The teacher showed us 2 ways to make random numbers only one of them was truly random and the other was "predictable" determined by the previous value.

Yeah just use weakauras.
---
Track buff, slice and dice, show duration, presto youre done

Lmaoooo I can’t unsee that now

I legit hate the text chat in discord and I hate the persistence of it. I want to login use voice for raiding and logoff and not ever think about it until next raid time. Discord is this whole thing where people talk on it even when they aren't playing and its supposed to be a whole community thing and I have no interest in that I've got enough on my plate.
---
It’s easy af. Don’t let people tell you it’s hard. It may be annoying at times but you can get some shards real quick.
---
Only if you can keep your toons on classic, while also copying them over to a BC server (only once per toon).

ANAL [Rogue Talent] Deep Ass
---
I was on vacation with my husband, brother in law, and his girlfriend (we all play classic wow) when it launched we spent the early mornings playing, activities around 10-3 or 4 and then played most of the night with the occasional dinner with the family break. It was the best way to spend my weeks vacation if I’m being honest.
---
Cool video. Thanks for sharing!
---
yeah i'd do this early morning before work while i was taking a shit/shower. not really wasted time.
---
Guck foons
---
Wait is their a server that hasn’t? Wtf?
---
bro that quest is so shit. you have to go to LBRS, spend 2 hours in it, then get out with a fucking debuff that freezes you in place randomly. you are horde fodder like that. or alliance that is
---
I liked Plasma TVs as well, some of them were really, really good.
---
looking for an out of the way grind spot i can use for a warlock i am lvl 44... I am playing alliance a full server and mob competition is high and i find myself fighting for quest mobs in peak times to the point it feels like a waste of time even doing the quests.
---
I was getting pretty decent exp grinding outside wolves trolls and moonkins outside of aerie peak but i think its about time for me to move on from that spot.
---
i am looking for a spot that favors alliance a bit so i can avoid a few ganks and keep my exp per hour up... mobs being humanoid are a plus! any suggestions?
---
Honestly that's probably not even the worst thing they can infer - it's just one that we know about.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in a dark basement in Facebook HQ there's people who can strongly predict or infer what you'll eat for breakfast 3 days from now from their giant pool of data.
---
Exaggeration clearly, but you get what I mean.
---
Lvl 120?! Wow!! Imagine the talent trees for that!!!
---
Hope you’re using a mouse...
---
There’s no way to emulate true random.
---
Chestnutz: yolo master legend, rank Norris
---
&gt; My point is that players should use their classes in creative ways to  avoid repetitive grind while leveling and annoying corpse runs to kill  15 boars with 1 sec cd spellbreak. 
---
That's...how the game already is. I don't see the need of implementing any of your ideas, if you keep dying and doing corpseruns, you're clearly doing something wrong.
---
If a hunter rolls on crimson felt or briarwood, we're fighting IRL
---
I am not a healer, I am the tank.
---
Why does it have a 7g disenchant value?
---
If you dont want to bring your skills for your „Team“ why should they invite you greedy one? =)
---
My personal Opinion: if the rogue unlocks, and takes it for himself, i will not invite him again, there are plenty fish in the sea.
---
ASK yourself, what would you do with a mage in an instance who wants 1g/stack water&amp;food?
---
Lol, is this real? Is this how you communicate?
---
Yeah 6 levels make a hell of a difference, he has better gear stronger skills higher chance to miss your attacks just puts you at a big disadvantage. The guys a coward and probably can’t kill around his level. Try and leave the zone and do something else for a bit and then comeback. I know it’s a hassle but it’s better than getting camped.
---
Will try later, thanks!
---
A pool system? For what exactly? For teleporting?
---
Honestly it’s a lot easier to kill 2 mobs as a warrior than 1 once you Get SS
---
so /dance?
---
Oh look guys, a retard! Haven't seen one of those in a while
---
&gt;ush up and try to mine it at least once.  
---
&gt;ReplyGive AwardsharereportSave
---
in retail a node that spawns can have multiple people use it without affecting the amount mined per person (it's basically your version of the node and other players have their own version).
---
You say getting that weapon upgrade from uldaman boes takes longer than grinding 100g at the same lvl?
---
You definitely never played wow alot.
---
But ye i will let my friend walk around so you can go and upgrade your 2h just 4lvls later in zf.
---
I never experienced someone actively lf a boe in a dungeon run, and if they would they would say, before drop, which one exactly and they would get it. Fact is this never happens
---
Who the heck has 100g to blow right now? A VERY small percentage. Literally this whole entire thing is your opinion..
---
If your confident players, your could play something that heals and his pet can tank instances (as long as you get some CC in your groups). I always find that really fun to do with guild members.
---
.
---
I understand that but majority of WPvP dropped when flying became easily obtainable.
---
Mage Frost Spells should all have 30% aggro reduction due to frost channeling as well.  Blizzard also slow rolls threat.  
---
Alarmingly I have done quite a few AOE groups and I rarely see my warriors even USE demo shout, never the less spam it.
---
It was a different time. The quest where Raimi had Jaina round up a lynching mob and hunt down anyone in Stormwind with dark skin was really hard to watch as well. You couldn't get away with that today.
---
Imagine actually taking this much time to write out a thinly veiled erotic fan fiction about your friend on some forum when you could be playing the game instead.
---
Head to Tanaris
---
Umm, what’s the add on he uses to change the nameplates/enemy health bars? I really like it.
---
You can't escape the slutmogs, even in classic
---
I’m staying shadow. I’m just gonna focus on being a known spriest on my server. And for 5 mans, fake it till you make it baby! just join as a healer and prevent wipes and you’ll be fine
---
Ok?
---
So I keep seeing posts (as in i've seen two) that say something along the lines of "I lost/won a bis to a double 1 roll, ama".
---
Is the implication here that it's interesting that the same number, and one at that, got rolled twice in a row? It feels like in those posts there's a general idea that the person who won didn't deserve the odds, and the person who lost deserved better, but when I asked people said everyone who rolls need gets all the same odds.
---
So if everyone has the same odds, why is a double 1 roll significant? Is it any different than some other rando in a guild who needed to roll a 5 and a 74 and rolled those, aside from being 1 and using the same number twice?
---
You didn't even list faction dude
---
this thread is going down the shitter
---
I saw him last night for the first time ever! 55 elite just hanging out there lol. Really cool seeing new things after you think there is nothing new left to see.
---
Yes, all this just to open some doors!
---
Yes i will need on your t3 set m8 and will delete it instead of vendoring.
---
How can you say what reason do I have to go on holiday?!!!! I'm not really gonna argue with you cause this topic is not interesting at all, I just want to address the fact that I go on holiday for my own reasons and I spend them as I want, wheter it is by rafting on a kayak or lying on the couch with AC all day, that's completely up to me lol
---
Furthermore, your idea of vacation full of activities and stuff pisses me off quite a bit: vacations, to me, are meant to do nothing but relax, and a couple hours of wow by the pool sounds very relaxing!
---
Level as prot. Having no problems killing 4 mods at the same time.
---
WHOA buddy, easy on those bold and brave statements ok?
---
The classic experience
---
Too true
---
No need to leave if we don't invite you in the first place. It's so liberating to not deal with Nazi tanks with illusions of grandeur. I mage tanked all through an, now I'm doing zf. Mmmm good good stuff.
---
Hey, if you want this - go retail. There you can do stuff solo. Absolutely without communication. It's classic, it's about building bonds and it's about MMO.
---
Maybe classic just isn't for you. And it's normal.
---
We'll see how the demo shout nerf changes this. However if mages actually waited, the tank could hold threat 100% of the time.
---
Leaving a comment really doesn't mean I care. Nice try lil guy
---
ALLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
This game is meant to be played in group. It’s a social game. It would be very disappointing if it would be possible to get good loot on your own.
---
I mean yea, it is kinda annoying. But i feel like this is not anything they should concern themselves with at the moment.
---
 I mean, what effort are 2 more clicks :D
---
doesn’t look too bad from the photo
---
Sounds like you're playing wrong
---
Level 20 now. How long should I stay questing in The Barrens and where should I go afterwards?
---
Ok that was easy
---
I had a similar experience with a Gnome Mage last night (I know, I was just as shocked as you).
---
I was trying to solo King Bang as a 42 Enhance Shammy and things were not going great.  The Windfury Gods were not smiling upon me.  From behind, frost bolts start slamming into King B.  Help has arrived, my savior, I turn to invite the friendly Horde mage only to find a Gnome instead.  We finish King B, wave and dance together.  Then I stay, and wait for the respawn and help the little booger get his done.  I thought to myself, "have I been misjudging gnome mages this whole time?".
---
Then the next gnome mage I ran into immediately attacked me while I was already in combat with multiple mobs.  Nope, gnome mages still fucking suck.
---
This is the classic experience, there were jerks back then and there are jerks now.
---
Your comp isn't optimal. You should replace a mage for a warlock. 
---
Also sticking to warrior tank and priest healer is pretty stupid. Feral druid does the same job if not better than a warrior (and for trash grind replace the warrior with another mage or warlock) and rsham / rdruid are also perfectly fine replacements for priest. 
---
So yeah, people complain because they have trouble finding groups because of that stupid mentality. You think you're a hardcore player but you're not even lvl 60 and you don't even know your comp isn't optimal at all. I'm pretty sure runing standard comp wouldn't have slowed down your leveling or really marginally.
---
Closest thing we have right now - http://classicrealminfo.com/ 
---
The data is all user submitted, so I wouldn't count on this being 100% accurate until more data has been uploaded and/or the person running the website has had time to prune off all the level 1 accounts that may be skewing the data. It's probably a decent starting point though.
---
Hey thank you so much for that, to be honest I've been trying to get my internet improved for 2.5 years but where I am it's taking it's time due to problems with ISP's and laying down the lines for better internet. I'm praying it's soon though because I get so frustrated by it as it hurts my content alot.

Thanks again for the kind words and have an amazing day!

---
Oh damn, forgot that was their dance. Nevermind then.
---
You can’t obtain it yet but you can prepare for it. If the Guild agrees to get him t2 chest first he’s done 90% of the legwork required. Then he just needs to be there when it drops. So you’re right I used the wrong word but the sentiment still applies.
---
Taurajo to dustwallow goes north to crossroads too.. then flyes same bath back down again.
---
Then why bother spend the money to go on holiday? Why not just save the money and stay at home and rest so you could save money and retire earlier?
---
You get both from the quest.

---
It wasn’t like that in vanilla and I’m not sure why it is now. Perhaps it’s because my character is on a super high pop realm
---
You seem to care quite a lot based on your initial reply. In your first reply you call him a tryhard and say he's wasting his time, your second post you say you don't care how anyone chooses to level and that cleave groups (AKA tryhards) are a good thing.
---
&gt; It was a horrible way of doing it, they knew they were going to need more than four servers and only someone who intentionally wants the game to fail

Here comes the conspiracy theorist again

---
Yea, that’s just not true. No way you’re 55 with 32 hours played. 16 days since release. I just had one of the fastest levels so far going from 57-58 and it took me just under 4 hours with 50k xph. If you’re going to lie at least make it something reasonable.

Alright, you have a reading problem. Good-bye.

I believe this is happening, Westfall was a lot more crowded than usual yesterday. Would not be surprised if the server is running on two or even one layer at this point.
---
Man I used to play an enhancement shaman in PvP and pallys were the only class I had trouble with consistently. Enhancement is like playing a fucking toolbox and you goddam golden bois have an answer to every single thing I throw at you.
---
Awesome so you have zero issues when you were looking for raiding group
---
I'm not sure the exact level, but you will leave The Barrens to quest in Stonetalon Mts.  Then come back to the Barrens for the Southern quests, after that 1k Needles.
---
There’s kind of a big reason why she’s telling you to stop being good and do something else and not because of some, “not everyone needs to be a hero” message.
---
I assume the Azshere FP fixes this?
---
its a long run but its not far into the boundary
---
He clearly doesn't know enough about sand.
---
I really just need to make a macro explaining vanilla tanking for everyone to summarily ignore.

Myzrael is a good PVE server. its Pacific Time and I am on East Coast, so if I log in early its not crowded. and its just hitting high, by the time I log off at night.

I prefer using Clique  on retail and classic. Very simply to setup, easy to use
---
I joined a couple of horde doing this last night. Turns out they were getting semi-camped by a couple alliance scum that would only attack when they had pulled an elite. I ran over and killed each of them a couple times before they finally ran off.
---
&gt; levelling to 60, making a guild, leading a raid, tanking a raid, downing the bosses giving instructions 
---
No opinion on asmon here, but ALL of those things have been vastly easier than they would be normally because of his popularity.
---
I don't see how you could deny that; infinite people to: dungeon grind, give him gold, join his guild, look up strategies for him etc. Again no offense, but his 'instructions' on the bosses are.. not very thorough
---
Regardless, it makes sense the main tank and raid leader should get bindings before anyone
---
If you're Horde and can get the quest done, the Frostmaw quest gives you the Spirit Hunter Headdress. For the neck slot, there's not much available until the mid 30s that aren't random boe greens. There may be some available super cheap on the AH though.
---
I've never been camped. On French servers seems like the pvp is generally along the lines of "kill on sight, but kill only once." plenty of times I've been killed by higher level players who let me be after that one kill. Plenty of times I've been ganked by a dude my level, got revenge on respawn, then just continued questing next to each other without fighting
---
I'm lvl 44 and haven't found an upgrade yet!
---
It's really your fault if you join a dungeon group without having spoken to a mage earlier that day and stocked up on water...that's just common sense. Only a chump pays full price for water
---
He was probably travelling to the Shimmering flats quests or Feralas for the FP. Both of those are much higher level than the center area of Thousand Needles.
---
Yes, but do you read more than the title? I said the nostalgia died.
---
I also said the game is awesome and I'm still playing so obviously not playing due to nostalgia.
---
I have a pretty good idea of the male fantasy I am on reddit lol
---
This comment killed me lmfao. Love it
---
Ooops sorry I should specify - EU region/timezone :)
---
The amount of fucking morons that don't realize they're literally going to have to lol
---
Your rank is based on other people in your faction. The more people that try to sit out of WPVP, the easier it will be to rank. I would guess a higher % of alliance players will get the high level pvp gear, but not sure about the long run.
---
no, they'd have just stuck with sharding the start zones like the original plan instead of spending the cash to make the new layering tech.  
---
if all they wanted was megaservers in the end, sharding starter zones was the far better solution, it was already available, would have caused less exploit issues, and have a much more seemless removal.
---
so no, there's no plans for megaservers, when layers gone anything above vanilla-sized realms means a queue, and anything majorly above means transfers to new realms.

You would not have had access to that locked chest without the help of everyone in that group. Likewise they would not have had access to it without your help. You are letting your greed overlook this fact and its a bad look.
---
Don't do this... Everyone should do everything they can to keep everyone alive every pull. Being a passive aggressive drama queen exercising your god complex serves no one.
---
Let's say it that way: There is a good reason Blizzard has many game designers and a even better reason you are not one of them.
---
Infernals did not get summoned like other demons in vanilla, to be precise, warlocks would lose control of them after a time.
---
Used to be that infernals would just start killing everything around them when you lost control, but now they just vanish after a while if they can’t kill the lock. There’s no more collateral damage 🔥
---
See, guys? Here's the irony: He's asking why wearing a warrior badge.
---
Just the tip, leave them longing for more.
---
I’m just very glad I don’t live in NA. I’m very privileged for that. I would be mad too if I lived in a dirt poor hate and crime infested shithole called America.
---
He’s lying lol. There’s no way he’s 55 with less than a day and a half played. World first was 3 days 9(?) hours and he aoe farmed/later hopped. Just someone throwing out a retarded number hoping they don’t get called on it to prove their point.
---
They opened a lot of new servers on launch day, people insisting on playing on Herod or Whitemane were the problem.  But whatever, thats old news now, there is no point in more arguing about that.
---
boring
---
Arcanite reaper
---
The best gear that you can achieve from dungeons before raids
---
Also, a new weapon would more than double my kill speed at the moment. Weapon is super important for warrior.
---
Wiat there were spaceships and aliens? Thought BC was just demons and Blood elves fucking things up
---
Good rogue should alway beat warrior. Bad warrior will beat bad rogue though.
---
Yes that's a good point about the specialisation I'm mostly questing and adventuring my way to 60 with the odd dungeon when quests lead to it. So the axe is what I will get, thank you.
---
I would recommend finding a group or guild to level with to help offset the imbalance. That's the risk of signing up for a PvP server, though. Mob grinding is pretty effective at leveling and there are great videos that take into account how busy servers can get, maybe check that out.
---
I can take 2 mobs. It’s 3 that gets frisky.
---
I understand the concern given how dead servers get on retail (even medium atm is just... literally no economy at all, so few players).
---
Low will probably be equivalent to med-high back in the day, so even with SIGNIFICANT player dropoff most servers will be more than ok.
---
Ugh. The screen glare.
---
Oh that makes sense.
---
I thought that there were over 100 people rolling, so there were two rolls to account for that. I thought the winner was rolling a 1 twice and the loser was rolling something completely random.
---
There may be a bunch of people in retail thinking "why bother, the hype will die down in a week or so".
---
Now maybe "shit, all my friends went there, guess i'll try it".
---
I know we've had plenty of people who literally were like "no fucking way am I doing that again" suddenly transform into "hey guys what's up so I rolled a character on xyz..."

Social pull is working some skeptics, I think.  Maybe not that many, but who knows?

Axe it is!

Kill 1 mob in 20 sec as arms or kill 4 mobs in 4 min as prot 🧐

As a dagger rogue, I’m a big fan of 21/0/30 for cold blood and preparation. Gives me a pretty strong PvP build with PvE capabilities. I recommend this build if you’re trying to play more casually and not go super hard into raiding/pvp. Now if you’re using swords/maces/axes then you 1000% want to put most of your points into combat with a few into assassination. You can send me a private message if you’d like to know where I put my points into and whatnot. Just let me know!
---
Another point is that with a good priest a lock will out damage a mage 100% if it's destro spec. Hellfire is insane.
---
Stockades is in Stormwind. Deadmines is in Westfall.
---
I leveled my first aid for almost nothing because bandages vendor for more than the cloth, so you get a skill point and then sell the bandage for more than you paid for the cloth

*laughs in orc passive*
---
so... you dont want someone to report players abusing the system to stop players from flying... got it.
---
I find this hard to believe.
---
If your pet is engaged in combat at all, feign doesn’t remove you from combat and doesn’t allow you to drop a trap. 
---
You can pull mobs, you can feign and they’ll run away, but you can’t feign while your pet fights and drop a trap.
---
That’s not Blizzard-like
---
you need to stun lock them. They will try to fear you as soon as possible so you need to make sure to interrupt them every time. Do not attack their pet.
---
My Paladin does it all the time so long as it's 1 on 1.
---
No love for rogues.  Fine.  Be that way.  See if I save you when mobs peel off and go for the casters.
---
That's what ganking is... Characters at much higher levels raiding newbie zones killing and camping them and often killing quest givers to boot. Its not like this is unique to classic. It's actually worse I'm retail, since they can drop on you from above on their flying mount. If you don't want to deal with those people your only real recourse is to roll on a non-PvP server. Or I suppose you could whine on Reddit and the forums more. Keep a list of everyone who ever ganks you and curse the heavens for how unfair it is that people are doing to you what they do to literally everyone else.

If ur downloading from the creators git, download the addon from under "Releases" instead of copying the master branch as would be implied by the "-master" at the end of the filename. This is cos if the addon is being actively developed, the master branch might not always have a working version of the addon.
---
I'm in love with this guild name. Best I've seen yet.
---
On Ashbringer I met 2 rogues leveling with each other named Corpseganker and Corpsecamper
---
If you are taking a warrior you're doing it wrong. Just take another mage.
---
this is so on point hahahahaha
---
It was going to have that anyway.  Even if they are for some reason suddenly outclassed, they will still be the safest DPS your raid can bring.
---
There's nothing "bad" about being something other than a fucking Mage.
---
In fact I'm glad I'm not. Less competition for end game gear.
---
My guild's main raiding team has 13 Mages on. Only 3 Rogues.
---
I prefer my odds.
---
Can confirm. Am druid, and lick gnomes.
---
Its only working 60% of the time (I do know that it can be resisted) and trying to do feign death +  trap is super glitchy and random, which is a necessity for dueling warr/rogues and being one of the most unique mechanics for hunters to control their fights.
---
Lol don't paladins leave priests and druids completely in the dust at all gear and tier levels?
---
Sorry to hear, haven't had that experience myself.
---
They're 8% faster and they can't dispel magic til level 42.
---
You sir, deserve an upvote for the actual advice and not more ass jokes.
---
The innocence. Before we knew how hard cleaving would hit us. So much to learn
---
I actually use hunters in spell cleave in SM as the priest. The AOE ground slow was amazing and helped a lot. In fact my best runs were Hunter, lock, 2 mages, myself.
---
I prefer to pop DVDs
---
I did this quest with a group of friends yesterday and it had to be the most infuriating run of LBRS ever! The poison you get constantly throws webs on you and your party members. Now, imagine every person in your party is doing this quest! We were webbed for 3/4 of the dungeon hahah
---
You focus one mob while running until the 2nd mob drops off you. Requires a swing timer and some finesse. At least, before sweeping strikes.
---
Fuckin scrubs.
---
“TeamViewer”
---
lol.  So true.  Even in my early thirties, with sweeping strikes it is like... I don't always die, I still sometimes die, but not always.
---
So how is it even an issue ?
---
If i had a lvl 8, lvl 18, and lvl 28 warrior i wouldnt mind showing you that its really not that hard. I only have a level 49 one, and with sweeping strikes its just easy.
---
But its really not as hard as you make it sound. I mean of course there are situations where it would be hard, like if you're not full health, have a bad weapon, or the particular mob is just really tough (Like the Ironjaw basilisk in Stv). But full health, average gear against your average mobs, you dont require anything special to happen for you to survive. You'd be at 35% health or so, sure, but you would be alive.
---
I did just reroll on a new realm, and i was gonna level a few characters to 15 or so for proffesions. If i do level a warrior, i can show you that you can kill two mobs before 30.
---
And interestingly seems to be medium at all times while grobbulous is medium during GE day and full in the evening.
---
So your phone stays in your basement?
---
Personally I just don't like the idea of spamming dungeons to level. That isn't a "blizzlike concept" none did that in vanilla at least none who played efficiently, and spamming dungeons to level is a big part of what people hate about retail.
---
Or /u/xynaats, instead of using /trade you can "/join lookingforgroup" which will add you into the actually channel for looking for groups \^^
---
Show up to dungeon...summon 2 people.  Make 5 healthstones.  Make a soulstone.
---
8 shards there.  You obviously want some extras just in case so there is your full bag of shards.
---
Works fine for me at lvl 34.
---
I use ElvUI, too - but I didn't really want to sit and manually go through setting it up for hours and hours (because it can take that long), so I just downloaded Preach's setup that he made available to everyone, and then tweaked that just a little to get it how I wanted it. Played with it for a few years on Retail, and when ElvUI for Classic came out, I just exported/imported the profile.
---
Disarm and hamstring are your big advantages in PvP.  Retaliation is good against fast auto attackers if you have it off cooldown.
---
I'm leveling a priest and a hunter right now. My priest will be more for dungeons, raiding, and pvp, while my hunter will be for farming and other solo adventures. Started a warrior as well who I'm only planning on playing when he has full rested xp.
---
I play on a laptop, trying to minmax slice and dice and it’s hard for my eyes to be adjusted to the top of the screen. Sorry.
---
I was running an arms warrior and avoiding tanking cause I didn’t want to level as a prot warrior. A few dungeons with tanks that don’t understand pacing, positioning, or how to listen to the needs of the party changed that pretty quick. Now it’s on to the torture of leveling as a prot warrior.
---
are they? I stopped questing and just did dungeons for 16-22 and just dropped like 9 green quests because i thought theyd be a waste of time now :(
---
after the second "wipe" my thought was:
---
"how about asking in chat for more people who are also on that quest"
---
you made it more difficult, than it needs to be :)
---
Stay classy Alliance.
---
I forgot about this boss and did it earlier. We wiped the first time because I was healer and got silenced.  Then we did the whole warrior taunt and line of sight thing to a TEE.
---
Have you gone to Hillsbrad Foothills?
---
Just know that groups will boot you for that - the lie and come back for ut method is known.
---
Yes, even if the quest isn't green, any quest with Green mobs is great.
---
In addition to what other people are saying, it might be worth investing in a swiftness potion. A brief bit of CC + popping htat and running away can often be enough to get you to safety.
---
But really, avoid Hillsbrad and north STV. Most other areas don't have the most ganking in my experience.
---
There's a global looking for group channel you can join by going into the chat settings and checking a box.  You can also find people who don't know about this advertising in city trade chat.
---
&gt;It's really not hard at all. I regularly fight multiple mobs at the same time as a warrior. 
---
And so do I. And it absolutely is hard.
---
Yes, not quantum mechanics hard. But its much harder than any other class.
---
&gt;Stuff about rage
---
Correct. There are a lot of shit players playing the game. That doesn't change the fact that warrior is the hardest class to level. Nor that killing 2 mobs at once as a warrior is not easy.
---
Also, fuck knows why you are talking about pooling rage as if its some magic cure all that just allows you to instantly kill mobs and somehow become immune to all damage. Yeah, pooling rage helps, thats kinda how you play as a warrior if you aren't completely dog shit. Won't save your ass from death though thats for sure.
---
Was helping my mate with a few quests yesterday, hes a gnome mage only a few levels lower than me. But if I saw a horde I would stealth and stay very near my midget friend and essentially use the squishy mage as bait and obviously the horde see this poor little gnome mage and immediately think FOOD! Little do they know I'm creeping in the shadows. They charge/engage and as soon as I hit them with that cheap shot they know their end, you can see them start to panic and regret their decision as their health goes from 100-0 real quick. It was a hilarious few hours.
---
Since the server population label change, there has never been a mention of medium being "many times" larger than anything. This number keeps getting larger and larger based on conjecture.
---
The range on "medium" also seems ridiculously high. One "medium" server currently has 4 level 60 players online, while another has over 50 across multiple classes. This is not including brand-new realms either.
---
At this point, only in-game metrics are reliable in determining if a server is healthy. The population label is only useful when it displays "Full" to indicate a queue, and even then it can range from only a few dozen to 6000+ people waiting.
---
If people are after short-term relief from prime-time queues, or simply prefer a smaller tight-knit community, new realms are perfect for them. For those looking for long-term activity and ease of grouping, however, it's easy to understand their attachment. We still have no idea what player retention is going to look like.
---
Moonkin form doesn't exist in classic
---
You don't need a mouse for classic. It's slow enough pace.
---
Heh, next thing you ll say is that you don't ninja need cloth drops with +heal/+spirit on them.
---
I know there's a lot of people that don't have time for 30 minute ques at minimum for every match.
---
Cross server stuff had people literally begging on the old forums back in the day.
---
It's massive qol increase.
---
I have never played on private servers, so this was retail. Not really sure how to do it anymore, but it made good bank iirc
---
&gt; You cant dispel yourself while blinded

Wasn't there a smart dismount addon that worked for druid forms too?

Gotta go fast.

The "Pet Control (Call Pet all-in-one)" macro doesn't revive or mend pet for me.

You do realize the healthcare in all countries is earned, its literally paid for by peoples taxes.

*Succubus licking her lips*

I level a few classes mage been the main and I just always sit them in a inn to get rested and when they have enough I grind it out and switch the extra xp helps a lot with leveling alts through zones you’ve already done
---
Except when you’re trying to collect raptor hearts
---
Hunter:  "thanks, this is good advice"
---
Also Hunter:  Rolls Need on Dal'Rends
---
Not sure why you're being down voted it was. Ever since BWL one of the most popular strats for Nef P1 was to stand there and shout to get all the adds to stick on your tank.
---
I disagree. I played on a PVP server briefly during BC and getting ganked did nothing but ruin my enjoyment of the game. I dislike PVP games in general, so if I'm avoiding something that I dislike that ruins my enjoyment, I can't possibly be missing half of the experience. There's plenty of misery, challenge, and frustration to be had in the PVE experience.   
---
And I'd *really* dislike it right now when half of the game's challenge is competing with a billion people for the same half dozen mobs for each quest. FINALLY finding that one last boar you need and then getting ganked mid-fight? No thanks!
---
As somebody playing as a frost mage I also hate this Meta, I just wanna enjoy the dungeons like I used too not speed run everything :3
---
Wasn't even thinking alternate timeline, just a "this shit's happening while some adventurers have fucked off to Outland".
---
How do you get glare on a LCD/LED screen?
---
Unless there's a glass/film covering it you're not going to get any glare.
---
I'm not a rogue, but my opinion is that if you can open the chest, it's yours to do with what you will. If you're a nice person and want to share, that's awesome. This should all be decided before you open the chest though. It's not cool to change your mind just cause it had something you want. :p
---
Good PvP breakdown. Thank you.

Your ability to open locked stuff is part of why you got invited

Are the queues even bad anymore? Last night I only needed to wait like ~30 minutes at about 6pm central. Perfect time to read a bit while eating din din
---
It is, but it's a lot more annoying that just running at enemies faces and straight up killing them.
---
It's going to be especially annoying until you get distract.
---
I thought Devilsaur gloves were.? Or maybe that's only for Orcs.
---
Ye, I can understand that.
---
NOPE, this is why ppl hate retail. Let the classic be classic
---
Druid healers are always wanted. Druid tanks, not so much, but this is more to do with them being hard/time consuming to gear well enough to raid than an actual condemnation of how good they are (spoiler: geared and having the right items they make great tanks). Druid dps as cat will always be inferior to rogue, but you can try hard with engineering and other consumable to be better (plus people always like another innervate/battle res in play). Boomkin just don’t.
---
Enjoy. I get 1-3 hours at most a night. Sometimes no time
---
Ashbringer and ZT are pretty good
---
30 is good enough for 2 mobs
---
sweeping strikes and cleave are busted af to murder 2 mobs
---
/FLEE
---
I think some of your experience may just be attention bias - you notice every single healer looking for a group, and almost never pay attention to the DPS who can't find a group. I'm leveling a paladin and so can heal or DPS, but have had to heal every single dungeon run I've been on. If you're playing a healer, you won't have trouble finding a group. 
---
Because classic has such a well-established meta, the most in-demand classes also happen to be some of the most popular. If you play Priest, you'll have no trouble finding a group. If you play rogue, you'll have no trouble finding a group. Pretty much everything except Druid and Shaman have clear value in classic raiding.
---
Then you aren’t doing AOE farming groups. You’ve missed my point.
---
Retail: an actual rotation. Classic: spam one button
---
What is post 30 bis?

\*heavy Mind Control breathing\*

I prefer the 20% chance where everyone needs over the 0% chance if I greed and someone else needs “because it’s an upgrade”. Is that really so hard to understand?
---
Here is the quest chain: [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2933/venom-bottles](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2933/venom-bottles)
---
You first go to one of the villages in the Hinterlands and pick up a venom bottle.
---
Then you bring it to Tarren Mill.
---
From Tarren Mill, they send you back to kill some Spiders in the Hinterlands. Make sure the second you get the undamaged sac you bring it straight back to TM right away, it's on a 30 min timer. If the timer runs out, you gotta kill more spiders. It's a pain.
---
After you turn in the sac, then it takes you to Sen'jin Village.
---
Then from Sen'jin, you get a quest to read a tablet from Zul'farrak. The section where all the little bugs are. Read the tablet. Stealth classes can go in without a group and read the tablet.
---
After you read the tablet, you go back to Sen'jin and get the quest for this spider. 4 of us ranged from 50-54 killed this spider. THIS GUY IS NO JOKE, it's difficult. Get a full group. Tank and healer highly advised.  
---
After you kill the Spider you return to Tarren Mill. Then you get a follow up quest at the end of the chain: [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2938/venom-to-the-undercity](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2938/venom-to-the-undercity) | Rewards are disappointing but this exp is awesome!
---
Must be nice to be a coddled alliance baby who gets carried through the game!
---
So slimy
---
What was your healer doing? I find it rather incredible that your group would be dying on the first pulls of RFC, an introductory dungeon that can be easily cleared with something like a shaman pretending to be a tank. With you, it should be a breeze even if you did have problems holding aggro.
---
This is true, but highly gear dependant.
---
If I got a copper for every time a hunter pulled extra packs with their pet or by lazy tab-targeting I'd be at gold cap.
---
It’s a great post. Way to add to our ‘community’.
---
In vanilla, it was just called Perl, and you can find it on Twitch with the rest of the addons.  Xperl was the name of later versions.
---
End-game warrior tanking is pretty much spamming Sunder Armour while you watch Netflix.
---
I get like 3 hours a week :S
---
Well im sure he is but at least he in the raid hahah
---
&gt;i can show you that you can kill two mobs before 30.
---
Can people on the internet really just not read or something.
---
I clearly stated that its possible, just that its not easy.
---
Someone posted a spreadsheet for Tanking levels for all of the dungeons. Would anyone be able to link it to me? Can't seem to find it.
---
As a Shaman, every class is hard to kill.  I do okay against Mages and Priests.  Hold my own against Rogues and Hunters.  Mostly lose to Warlocks.  Not enough encounters with Warriors or Paladins 1v1 to know (doubt it goes well once they have plate).  Druids are the bane of my existence.  I have no good way to stun them or even slow them.  They can't kill me to easily, but catching them is almost impossible for me.
---
Aoe ground slow from traps I’m assuming?

The good old 90/10 split for that awesome PvP experience.

What gives you gold while doing a BRD? The grays? Some specific items? Would you mind elaborating a little mate?

My girlfriend always says she’s gonna do this to me?

Let's not divolve into name calling, let me explain my comment. Yes I do believe that Blizzard can make a mistake, I even suggested in an earlier post that it was a possibility albeit unliklely. What I don't buy is your simplistic explanation " Blizzard fucked up, thats that". It's not as simple as that. There's a reason that Blizzard believed initially that your account had participated in some kind of transaction that would get your account banned but after further review they decided to overturn that ban. Either there was a specific circumstance which appeared to be an offense but after further review they decided it was not or it could be they just felt that the situation was not in your control and therefore you were not at fault. I suggested a scenario in which that might have been the case and the fact that they told you that wasn't the case doesn't necessarily rule that out, they might not be forthcoming about that, they wouldn't want you to think their 2 factor authorization logic has any flaws now would they?
---
I've been a software developer and software support analysis for over 30 years for several large corporations and in my experience the explanation is never that simple. In fact in most cases it's quite complex and typically the fault lies in some recent change that would cause some unforseen circumstance. The fact that Classic WoW is still only a few weeks old is suspect, there might be some "new" situation that their software that detects suspect transactions might not account for and they will need to make some changes to account for it. The fact that by my count there were at least 3 people including you that said their account was banned within a 24 hour period for the same reason and with similar circumstances (recently hit level 60 in Classic WoW and perhaps each spent 900 gold on a mount) lends creedence to that idea.
---
That's just my opinion I could be wrong, but let's be clear " Blizzard fucked up, thats that" is just your opinion as well.
---
If the player base stays high like it is rn they will absolutely speed up the phases, and they will release TBC and WOTLK legacy servers.
---
They’re trying to stop private servers, and if they want to do it successfully they’ll offer a better product in vanilla, TBC, and WOTLK legacy servers with actual support that you don’t need to PayPal some weirdo across the planet for a service.
---
Players want WoW pre: sundering from CATA.
---
You mean they pretend to not have leveled lockpick to get them when the dungeon is done?
---
MacBook Screen have glass covering them. As the person you replied to said "You don't get glare on LCD/LED monitors.... Unless there's some sort of a glass or film cover."
---
Is it worth it sticking with one (1) guild currently? I'm almost lvl 20 on Benediction, Horde druid planning on doing some end-game content if I have the time. I'm currently in one of the larger guilds the realm has to offer - about 500 members or so, with 50 being on when I was playing last night from 5:00 PM-5:00 AM.
---
Also, I'm running Skinning/Leatherworking for leveling/farming/BiS pre-raid LW gear. How does this sound? Should I swap to Mining/Engineering after I ding 60/have crafted my BiS gear?
---
A lot of the BIS for mages you get outside of raids
---
Just do whatever feels fun as long as it is for your level. I think questing is faster than dungeons but  a good mix is better because a) it's more fun and b) you get better gear which speeds up everything.
---
Just enjoy doing it!
---
Why do you say that?
---
why not play what you like? It's classic, find joy in the game and those that want to min/max the extreme side of the spectrum of raiding need to go to retail raids. where you have guilds only having "XYZ" class/specs period. i've been declined guild applications by just saying i'm a shaman.  Just tell the guy if he's enh he rolls enh, if he wants resto loot, reroll and roll on healing gear. idk just my two cents when it comes to classic raiding. I'm having more fun playing my class, rather my spec. have him do a hybrid enh/resto spec so he can do his damage and cast chain heal for the melee group.
---
The fastest way is to heal a spellcleave dungeon group
---
Maybe we can finally find out what the night elves did with archimonde’s skeleton after it got tangled in the roots of the world tree
---
Turtle have shell shield, that reduce by 50%( not sure about the exact % I think it was 50) for 12 second, so maybe you can make it work, or atleast tank for 12 sec and burst as much as you can
---
&gt;competing with a billion people
---
On the flip side, on a PvP server you can clear out the opposite faction that are grinding the mobs you're going after. I don't wPvP much, but being able to take control of a good grinding area by force is why I play PvP servers.
---
My company uses both. GoToMeeting for trainings (GoToTraining actually) and WebEx for customer calls. internally we use Slack or Teams.
---
This is a little extreme but if it legitimately makes you feel better about getting rekt from time to time then more power to you. 
---
He was probably just a normal guy doing normal guy stuff like having fun murdering people in an open world PvP setting. Or wherever.

 [https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/243159](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/243159)\- system requirements for WoW classic. Literally any PC with dual core and 4 gigs of ram and external graphics can run it. Even integrated graphics can do just fine if they are from this decade.
---
PvP servers are notoriously Horde dominated, just like PvE/Rp is heavily Alliance. Has a lot of factors from Horde being considered “cooler” to Horde having extremely powerful WPvP racials. At the same time, BG’s tended to be Alliance favored in the past due to how strong Paladins are if coordinated well.
---
I feel like we have to sit these people down and explain to them what jokes are.
---
The same people who complained when people posted pictures of their snacks pre-launch because they weren't being healthy. Like what a bunch of fucking dweebs.
---
I'm personally not advocating for the removal of "useless" spells from you spell book. But I think it's dishonest for people to say things like "retail has so little abilities" when objectively in retail you're **using** a lot more unique abilities than in classic. The problem with retail was the pruning of niche and unique abilities like hibernation and mark of the wild, abilities that might be rarely used but add uniqueness to your class.
---
One scenario you might have 15 spells available and only really use 2 or 3. The other you might have 7 spec specific spells available but utilize all of them consistently. The former gives you 21 spells in total even if you can only access 7 at a time. 
---
Anyways, I prefer having all spells available but I think it's dishonest to act as if retail has "less" abilities when my rotation in retail for every class is significantly more complicated than the 2 buttons I press in classic.
---
&gt;It would suck if I had to choose one or the other.
---
Off topic, but you've never had too, feral like all hybrids offer a ton of off healing in retail and always have.
---
Yep, if I'm out to pvp I will honestly wait for the selected opponent to heal to full before engaging that was everything can be evenly matched.
---
If you send me 15 bucks a month I’ll start my own private server for you!
---
ahaha literally watched this episode again last night!
---
For what it's worth, I spent the whole gold to respec Disc from Shadow and farm dungeons. You'll run them so much that you'll get whatever gear you want from them. All depends on how consistent you can be with forming good groups. 27 Priest.

I left mostly because of the scaling mobs.
---
Everyone acknowledges that FFXIV is a casual game. So is retail WoW at this point. And if we’re being honest, Classic WoW was the “casual alternative” to the MUCH more hardcore MMOs available at the time. FFXIV wears its casual badge with honor.
---
Claiming the combat is slow, however, is disingenuous. You MIGHT get that low an APM with Black Mage, but the classes with haste buffs and oGCD attacks like Monk, Ninja, Bard, Machinist, Dancer, and Dragoon can easily exceed 45 APM. At the upper end, a Bard with a proc string can go over 70 APM, forcing you to double-weave your attacks just to fit them all in.
---
But no, I’m sure your superficial and biased opinion is more valid than someone who’s played for the better part of six years.
---
Not on a bop weapon
---
To say that YMMV is probably the best way to answer.
---
lately I've been running on a 2015 i7 with 16GB RAM and the 2GB AMD R9 M370X.    I run with the "classic" graphics quality, then turn up the liquid detail to 'fair' and set the particle density and ground detail to the lowest..  
---
For the most part i get 55-60fps, and things run smooth.. However when i walk in any depth of water or if there is anything generating a lot of smoke, things become a bit choppy.   I also have an issue where starting a little before 8:45 (realm time) frame rates also start to fluctuate between 25-60 depending on what direction the camera is looking. This lasts for about 30 minutes.   I don't have any background tasks running, at that time to point to a I/O bottleneck.  I think it has something to do with the way the sun light starts reflecting off of surfaces at that time, maybe the shadows.  
---
I didn't have this problem before OpenGL support was dropped, nor did i have this problem with the first few major retail updates after they started supporting 'metal'.  It was the last big update to Legion where things started to get noticeable.   Now i just take a break around 8:45 and wait it out..

Do you have alt1-5 at the beginning of the next bar?

Just keep in mind it's the same company who's president told us we thought we wanted to play this game but we really didn't. 
---
Makes it seem at least a little more likely they are blind to what the players demands truly are, no?
---
Actually when I bring a rogue it tends to specifically be lock picking skill, DPS is usually competitive around my level so utility is what brings people to my groups over others. The reason you're scenario is massively different is because Ore/ skins/herbs do not have the potentially to be worth a couple hundred gold. If I skin something and you want the 1-2 leather from it you can have it. You'll get maybe 1s from it.
---
No it’s not, you can do nothing and get it.
---
Just encourage all of your melee friends to reroll mage!  Then walk into raids with less melee to compete with for gear!
---
I too am a gnome shaman
---
You can do that sure it just wont be free, we just hit medium pop last night
---
I stopped 60 farming at sm when BC came out so I can't speak to later levels. I'd imagine you could do a  45-50 instance slowly. 
---
Rogue stealth farms are great but why sneak past when you can melt through the whole dungeon in one pull. Seriously, the hardest part will be rounding em all up.
---
Are you still able to find groups out in the world and/or for dungeons? That's only my main concern really. My toon is a mage and there are some quests I can't do by myself.
---
There's 2 rogues
---
Light's Hope Chapel won't have an innkeeper or repairman until phase 6
---
Yup did the same thing my first time tanking, then the next group a DPS ran up and lit em all up and I was just crying
---
To be fair, still plenty of corpse running leveling on a PVE server, but it’s mostly your own fault instead of someone else’s.........
---
Imagine live as a paladin where your seal can be missed, dodged or resist (:
---
That thing is gonna burn like Hell
---
Enchants
---
Spirit is always useful when you stop casting and use the 5s rule to your advantage.
---
Of course, Mp5 is always better, but saying that Spirit doesnt do anything for some healers isn't exact.
---
Bro don’t even bother asking. People can feel high and mighty about how you have to share the locked chest but honestly blacksmiths that take in a skeleton key don’t get shit for this. I’m a Druid and I say don’t ask for permission ask for forgiveness. Don’t open the chest when you pass it don’t mention it and just drop group after the dungeon is over and open chest before you hearth out. If it’s your class skill, and you don’t have to be a saint. Plenty of other satanists out there doing the same thing. Don’t let people shame you for siding with yourself because in the end all you can really trust is yourself! But yeah if I was a rogue I’d keep that shit unless it was a guild run then I’d probably open it up to everyone.
---
fuck I came here to literally just say "balls"
---
I love seeing people steal devilsaur off eachother. +1
---
WOTLK was 11 years ago right?! Legion is only a couple years old?! How old am I?
---
Us too, although I'm not sure all the mobs are supposed to cluster around the centre like they did for us - but we managed, hooray for Soulstone.
---
Best is subjective, but I personally have done a mix of both because I meet more players and have fun in the world. For the quickest, healing an aoe dungeon group would prob be your best bet.
---
That is pretty damn good too haha.
---
is this going to stay this way?
---
getting 60 quickly wont solve your burnout tbh. better to take a break and come back later.
---
Imagine never having played wow before so any drop in pop on my server will feel like the world's shrinking
---
This post is eye opening to me.  
---
If I come across a locked chest and the rogue thinks it belongs to them simply because they're a rogue they're getting kicked from the group.   
---
Miss me with that single player shit
---
Sorry man I don’t know enough about cloning to help.
---
What is that?
---
Class uniqueness also means that there are things they can’t do is all im saying 
---
Some classes are good for dungeon aoe farming others aren’t
---
He's level 16, the only other seal at that level is crusader, which isn't needed as Righteousnus is generally better.
---
You sir, are doing it correctly
---
Whatever is marked skull. 
---
If the tank isn't marking then target whatever he charged into or pulled first, that's probably his main target. If he's not doing that either then ask him to mark. If he doesn't want to mark then just kill healers/casters first and try to interrupt them. They aren't gonna hurt you too bad if you pull aggro.
---
Damn he's lucky! He always have someone to level with!
---
Phrasing!!
---
Perzactly. Not sure why my comment was down voted, guess people are butthurt about actual safety. You don't leave electronics, especially with batteries inside them, out in direct sunlight.
---
But earthfury was dead right?
---
You get 0 HKs right now and it is glorious
---
also remember wowhead isn't right about everything... Like how it lists the enchanting Artisan in the tower in Elwynn forest as an Expert enchanter.
---
It definitely depends on your methods of leveling, paths you take, zones you pick etc..
---
I'd wager most, if not all, of the streamers hitting 60 and clearing MC etc.. already have done some form of dungeon spam with AoE clearing groups, for hours and hours on end, so they'll generally level faster with the same amount of time input.
---
Duh yeah, those that enter mc/ony
---
But it isn't immersion breaking in retail at least. Your character has been through all these raids and you should be acknowledged for your heroic deeds. 
---
The issue with retail wow is that Blizzard want both. They'll have NPCs refer to you as champion, then immediately have said NPCs get you to do some monotonous task. Now that is immersion breaking. 
---
I think that's why a lot of people loved MoP because we were brand new nobodies in this new land our exploits meant back to them. 
---
It's very jarring having to go pick up nuts in Legion so I can get some AP so I can save the fucking world. Are the NPCs really withholding stuff from the person who can stop the Legion invasion as it's ongoing? Are they clinically insane, why don't I murder you, you stupid Dryad and take the AP off your corpse. Who is going to stop me I already killed your daddy Cenaruis.
---
Ahh fellow altoholic, I’m guessing you’re rolling a mage within the week..  I’m thinking of rolling a rogue today xD
---
Alright thanks for the help.
---
I was just curious about whether or not I was missing something. Seems that I'm not.
---
Thanks again. :)
---
/cast jizzmissle
---
I made this mistake once in vanilla...once. It was such a harsh lesson I never forgot it!
---
You know you can just ignore people too. I personally think rushing the game is a waste of subscription money because you're rushing past content, but if that's what you truly enjoy, then do what you want.
---
If it’s an upgrade at all, even a tiny bit you need. I don’t see why people would think this is a problem.
---
To each their own. I respect your decision.  
---
I was on Herod(PvP) yesterday and my lvl 19 druid was getting ganked by lvl 60's the whole time on LakeShire. I asked for help on chat and a couple of guys started going "I hate this, I want to level, these guys come and gank on low levels".  
---
Man, you signed up for this shit when you chose PvP. As weird as it sounds, I don't mind getting ganked by lvl 60's. Sure, it makes leveling slower, so what, I'm not on a race to the finish line.  
---
I keep my cool and try to think of things to outplay the Horde gankers. Since going 1v1 is suicide the resorts were:  
---
* Outrunning them in cat form (if I was lvl 21 by then);
---
* Staying close to the lake to use aquatic form to get away;
---
* Shadowmelding if I saw them killing alliance players in front of me, since I was probably not on their camera's field of view;
---
* Telling guild and general chat about the problem, and asking if one of them could run to StormWind and warn about the situation (which worked!);  
---
Anyway, this makes gaming so cool for me. Please, Herod horde, continue the ganking, this makes the whole experience so much more lively for me.
---
Afaik it the only vanilla item with that effect.  Good on you.
---
I would definitely need on that and I am a warrior. Very useful item to have
---
Yeah, have a cold drink and stare in to the ocean
---
Dude it isssss. Gotta love good questing music
---
If I was in your shoes I would grab the sword since I’ve already invested in sword spec + human racial
---
Yeah no problem having people help out. I believe it is but I haven't been able to confirm it yet. First time going alc in vanilla and I'm the guild alchemist so I'll eventually be getting everything. I appreciate the advice!
---
I cant wait for more people to get to 60. As it stands now I struggle to keep a supply of gold because no one needs consumes yet.
---
Healers first, casters, melee dps.
---
Ahhh my brain said that in the dwarf voice
---
And helmets too (my cow looks silly in all of them)
---
Is there one?  Or is that the Badboy one ive heard of? (thought that was more for blacklisting people, though?)
---
I have chat windows set up for various different chats, but i like to keep lfg in the main window because you never know whats going to pop up there (obscure elite quests, etc).  Its just moving so damn fast that it blocks out everything else.  At least i can switch to my whispers tab or w/e to make sure i didnt miss anything....but its still annoying.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294995/classic-wow-harvest-festival-good-quest-experience-and-free-food
---
It really is contextual. In general you want to attack whatever is marked or whatever the tank is attacking. 
---
If you’re the tank... it depends. 
---
I’ve found that if my group can’t/won’t cc casters, casters have to go down first.
---
This is correct, except for when a green quest is *right* at the level before it becomes grey. That's when the drop-off starts, but even then it's only slight. (-20%)
---
Invite layer please.
---
You play rogue yes? I see blade fury? So u like what lvl man?
---
Warriors are the only class that really counter locks due to fear immunity during berserker rage
---
paladins are better for main tank heal, but priest are more than fine for this too, and both add different buff.
---
Same thing for the druid, who also have a battle rez
---
So go back to retail to lower my queue time please :)
---
Why do you have to bring your negativity here?
---
Most of the time you only need maybe 1/4 of your mana bar for any one pull, if everyone is the appropriate level for the dungeon. If proper level, a tank will not die in the time it takes you to get to at least the minimum amount of mana to heal the current pack. Letting the tank die because you insist on getting max mana is just plain fucking dumb and childish on your part.
---
Same! I like that I actually recognize all the guild names and players after seeing them so much.
---
I can give u some pro advice
---
So it should be cheap shot ambush backstab backstab death!
---
After much thought, i'm going the other way on this:  You should have greeded.  Need, in most people's minds, is stuff you will equip right away or when you hit that level.  If it's not an upgrade, then really everyone has as much right to that piece of gear as you do.  It doesn't matter what you do with it, you all worked just as hard for it and can do whatever you want, either go pearl diving/questing/vendoring it.  Just because you know how useful it is doesn't mean you "need" the gear.  Maybe you deserve it more because you think you will use it rather than vendoring it, but that's not the same thing as "needing" rather than "greeding."  Instead of taking advantage of other's potential ignorance, take the time to educate them and roll the same way as everyone else.
---
Also, if you rolled need after everyone else declared greed then that is totally indefensible.  You know you are getting around the usual deliberation process where there is a real question of what to do.
---
The thing is by the time they remove layering a lot of the player base will have moved on i figure
---
Wow same, we are balanced motherfuckers aren't we?
---
Unfortunate downside is that people will overwhelmingly roll the strong classes in 1.12, including the one good hybrid, the Warrior, in excess and and weak classes will be extremely underrepresented.  My favorite class is Shamans but they are so weak in classic that I rerolled a lock and the difference is amazing.
---
And yes, the warrior is a hybrid if we define a hybrid class as being able to fulfill multiple roles. It goes to show how bullshit the hybrid tax concept was.  I'll be shelving my shaman until battlegrounds come out and then he'll strictly be ele PvP while my lock is for raids.  Unless we do some kind of vanilla+ class balancing, at least on some specific servers, we will have ridiculous class imbalances where easily 60%+ of all players will be mage/warrior/rogue.  Personally I love vanilla for the levelling and 5-man dungeoneering so it is annoying but not a dealbreaker.
---
Can't wait for a TBC re-release though!
---
Grats yo
---
Oh my god this is the bane of my fucking existence. I can NEVER do it on time. 
---
And the amount of times I almost die to a job a few levels lower than me because I keep missing, or they keep dodging or whatever. 
---
If I pull more than two mobs, I just run now. I’ve been farming as much cloth for bandages as I can, and I’m also frantically running around asking mages for food and intellect. They pretty much all say “uh you’re a warrior, why do you want int?”
---
And I’m like, “cause I need to keep my weapon skill as close to capped as possible and int increases the speed in which that happens!!!!!!!!!!!”
---
And they give it to me. 
---
As much as I hate it, I always enjoy playing. Except when I die constantly. 
---
I guess you just have to pick and choose your battles. 
---
/endrant
---
Are there any other class specific late game weapons like this one?
---
Yeah, when you're the only MMO out there that has multiple billions of users they probably felt like they had to appease the large casual crowd.
---
Alliance must have a hard on for killing lowbies at this area. Had a ?? Hunter and ?? Priest show up in the same area on the same quest. There was altogether about 10 Horde doing the Wyvern Egg here and we all ganged up taking them on. Some of us died in the melee, but so did both of them. I think they came in looking for easy lowbie kills, but turned tail and ran. We chased the hunter down the ramp and killed him a few more times. I think the priest spirit rezzed, one death to lowbies was enough.
---
lol I used to fake \[Beating Gloves of the Monkey\] in guild chat. Gets em every time!
---
In all those years, not once did I ever think to do this while in a group.  Awesome pull!
---
That's ret in a nutshell (sorry), best bet is to try and keep your weapon current!
---
Imp Conc aura is nice for organised PvP. But I wouldnt relly on it.
---
If a group boots a rogue just for not opening a chest, then good. Put those people on a list and never play with them because they are a bunch of a-holes that I wouldn't want to play with in the first place
---
No need to be deep prot while leveling, arms and fury builds are fine
---
Great answer. lol
---
Pm me please where you found it. I haven't had any luck.
---
seed of corruption ?
---
And that's missing the point. ilvl shouldnt be a rigid end all otherwise you get retail wow.
---
Hey man when your dick doesn’t work anymore cause, I mean, well you’re dead, you gotta find creative ways to satisfy the forsaken mind. 
---
The Jizzmissle shall do for now.
---
The level of pettiness in your response says to me that you know I’m right and you just aren’t man enough to admit it.
---
Y'all noob. Sword and board, shield block, rend, revenge, starting from 14-30 you can 1v2 mobs your level no sweat.
---
these responses are missing the point i tihnk. i remember my time and experiences in every zone ive been thru and it was the same in vanilla. in retail...none of it matters and its just not memorable.
---
Are you afraid of the music?
---
That's how I like both.
---
Relevant
---
Can just send the void walker to attack the boss and wait outside the doors. Let him die or sac him, and everything runs to the courtyard. Have the tank pick up the boss while you aoe
---
OK I personally don't feel like shadow priest is bad in dungeons, especially if you can get a decent amount of last hits. BUT there is a few things to note.
---
1. Mind blast is a lot of threat and if you don't maintain threat/use fade, you tank on bosses will not like you / your healer won't like you / you won't like you (Spell push)
---
2. Please don't pug as a Shadow Healer,... Now yes it CAN work but shadow puts out a lot less healing is more mana inefficient with heals, heals are slower etc.... your more than likely going to slow the group down because you have to drink more / can't do as big of pulls. 
---
3. You are going to have to battle a stigma of Shadow Priest not being good in PvE, it is just how it is.. just play the class how you want to, perform well and people are bound to remember you and not hesitate to bring you back in another run.
---
You are correct, however Perl and Xperl look a bit different and in OPs screenshot it's got the thicker Xperly looking skin :)
---
It was pretty telling how they all thought it had no effect on them and then as soon as you ask their friends everyone is talking about how they never leave their room, they don't get any sunlight and they barely see them anymore.
---
If you paid with PayPal it can take from an hour to 24 to process
---
This would be Mulgore's chat wet dream.
---
Why are you fighting mobs 5 levels above you?
---
Thank you :O
---
If you don't kill the pet, you die. This is the only advice in this thread that will work, but still not necessarily against Demo locks.
---
2 attacks on each target, so yes, 4 attacks.
---
no, the hunter is really a different beast. A mastered mage or rogue are dangerous, but you can deal with it, a mastered hunter is a murder machine
---
31/8/12 old school punk build - can't go wrong. I am pumped to go Hemo Swords myself like my man Ming did:

The music alone makes the view worth it
---
If I lived there, I would never play video games again
---
If you are talking about cleave groups it definitely has my buttflustered.
---
There is no such thing as "game time for classic" it's just a wow sub that let's you play retail or classic.
---
Do you have more than one account? Did you buy the time on the appropriate one? When I go to buy time it prompts me to select which one I want the time on.
---
You are moron
---
Alright thanks
---
Haha most definitely. But here I can just post and go on my day. Irl I get the “stfu about that kids game for once”.
---
how do you get it
---
Started two days ago, and the starting zone on my medium pop server is very active.  People trading, questing and chatting together.
---
So glad I'm a tank. Never looked for a proper group for more than 10 minutes. Could probably go after 1 minute, but I'm intentionally avoiding those shitty cleave groups.
---
That's an arbitrary affirmation :P
---
Wasn't there some integration with wowhead in game? I feel like this came on around the twitter integration time. Really I'm looking for an add on or something in game that I'm able to look up stuff without alt tabbing.
---
Yep, thanks! Appears we’ll be good till level 58 with this method, so get as much as you can before then. I’m gonna be buying tf out of runecloth too and hopefully I’ll get exalted in about a month or so haha. Good luck and thanks
---
*pushes up man-boobs*
---
Just because it's not hard to level doesn't mean you're being efficient, lol.
---
I quit at wrath. What's the joke?
---
Touché
---
Shid I'm an idit
---
The other two players killed it, rogue came in and CC'ed them to steal the skin.
---
Are you sure you chose the right wow account in the selection?
---
Playing as a UD Mage like in the old days, I'm currently lvl 24 and have done SFK a few times already.
---
I haven't touched Camp Taurajo quests yet, and I've got quests sending me to Stonetalon, Ashenvale and Hillsbrad.
---
So, what is the best route to take? I got to Tarren Mill already to get the flight path, was thinking of skiping camp Taurajo quests, Stonetalon (I remember disliking the zone) and go straight to one of the others, maybe Hillsbrad since I did Ashenvale on vanilla. Am I going to miss on anything relevent/better leveling paths, or just going Hillsbrad and onwards with some instances in the middle is good?
---
Thx in advance.
---
Made it to level 18 solo on my warrior before I gave up. I paid so much money in repairs ;_;
---
This is why classic is awesome. Old folktales created and being living breathing stories in the World of Warcraft.
---
Why are people in dungeons? Greed, they want to upgrade their loot, gain exp for themselves, get gold, etc. With all these rogues wanting to be selfish I'm starting to think I shouldn't bring them into any dungeon they don't honestly bring alot to the table, they can't res, if the group wipes they vanish and just sit there, they don't give me mana regen or anything  else thats useful, dps is really just on par with other classes. The one thing they bring over any other class is lock picking. (not saying this to be a prick its just true)
---
  If the leather was in a dungeon, I probably wouldn't even skin it, but if i did and it was worth a decent amount sure I'd roll. I'd go off as far as to ask people do they want to roll per skin or on the stack of skins.
---
WTF
---
I’m a warrior lvl 21 (alliance human). I’m having trouble finding a good 2h sword to level with? Any suggestions? The closest I’ve seen is a pretty decent 2h mace I picked up in Dead Mines, and I hear that you can get a preety good hammer from Smite in DM? Should I give up on the sword and just train my 2h mace/hammer skill and go with one of these?
---
From questing without a mount and no blink or movementspeed buffs as a wariror, to questing with a mount is such a good feeling. You earn everything in classic.
---
Sweeping strikes, retaliation, cleave.
---
ez
---
That's good. The first couple of days was 12k+ around 5:30pm est and queues were over 5 hours. I never even got logged in before switching servers.
---
I think this is completely normal. I have to do this every time, all the streamers I've watched have to do this every time, and to my knowledge all my friends have to do this every time. I don't think this is out of the ordinary at all.
---
Westfall was full for the first time last night, at least when I was attempting to enter.  There was no queue time however.
---
Well that's not happening.. Although it is a valid point.
---
Yeah, normal servers still allow for world PVP, you just have to flag yourself for it.  You can manually flag yourself for PVP or simply attack an alliance NPC or PVP flagged alliance player.
---
I’ve done my waiting! 12 years of it! In retail!!!
---
This was the obvious joke being made by OP
---
When WoD came out we coaxed a bunch of our friends who never played before to join. They purchased the game, boosted up and began playing the new expansion. We ended up raiding in a group full of RL friends. They eventually quit, and didn’t return for legion or BFA. When classic launched, we got them. And it’s been hilarious to hear the complaints and questions about the game. Especially from some who pushed further than me in an expansions raid content.
---
No.. I... I just don't like Techno
---
Dude absolutely has to be trolling.
---
“Heh nothing personal kid”
---
(Damn you’re good, and you could even say you can’t estimate if you crit or Not) still, you can estimate regarding the class and the stuff.
---
In Original WOW the Bow transforms into the staff, you don't get both at once.
---
thanks, answer i expected honestly.
---
this only works if you are tank or healer
---
lmao instead of "literally just cast frostbolt"
---
And of course you are heavily oversimplifying retail rotations for the sake of your argument.
---
what a galaxy brain comment.
---
"reduced to" lmaooooooo reduced from what?
---
What did you expect?
---
I am a level 28 mage. I think I hit a questing wall and might just have to run dungeons to level up. I can't find a zone with quests around my level for good exp. I finished all the quests in Duskwood, Redridge &amp; Wetlands. Ashenvale and Darkshore have low level quests, so I feel like those will be a waste of time. Any recommendations on a good zone? Thank you!
---
Tauren totem
---
Doesnt work at level 40 any more any idea why ?
---
Bruh check the balance tree
---
&gt; I'm starting to think these test were done in too much of a vacuum, where you're not threatened by ganks, and there are enough mobs everywhere for you to freely run non stop slaying.. but that's not really the case in classic pvp servers.
---
this depends on the server, besides the clusterfuck that is STV (which i actively avoided) there has been very little issue with PVP happening and mob spawns 
---
I in general agree with you, maybe Best was not the correct term as no its not 100% best, its just buy far the easiest to deal with for most people.
---
I always level as full subtlety. It's viable but it is potentially slower than a combat swords guy. But there's also much less competition for daggers. You get some real goodies like stealth being more effective (untalented stealth is nothing in comparison), giant ambush crits on castsr mobs/players, improved sap (makes sap usable in dungeons, great for solo), and later preparation which is a true game changer. I level as full subtlety and then I dip into combat later for things like reduced cool down and improved Sprint, kick and some other goodies. Basically makes it much harder for you to be caught with your pants down and is great for surprise PvP. There's definitely better pure pve builds but it's my favorite "tackle any challenge build".
---
Under your username on the login screen, change it from wow1 or something to your account name.
---
Hey ... some burgeoning psychopaths kill stray cats. Others camp virtual corpses to inflict as much suffering on another for kicks.
---
Thank god for PVE servers. At least I can *choose* when to PVP.
---
Pretty sad to see how you look down upon people who do what they like and feel superior to them.
---
Your "playstyle" is going to be the same no matter what talents you pick. You're going to be spamming SS and then Eviscerate.
---
Combat is the best tree for doing that.
---
It's not a bad idea to have some alts on deck soaking rested xp and then putting a little grind time on them every few days
---
Ultimately, I want my entire sheet to be filled with lvl 35 alchemists and tailors for the cooldowns on arcanite and mooncloth
---
How’s prot working out for you?
---
I thought Rexxar was Steve Blum.
---
Annoying as a mage to agree with what you say.  But the sheep thing is true for everybody.  I'll sheep a healer that isnt being focused and some idiot will go out of their way to. Attack it.
---
Yep, I can't go back now after having a second screen. I used to have to make my game window smaller and jam a video and wow onto a 27inch in TBC so I could farm elementals and watch tv
---
100 dollars will get you a 23inch secondary monitor
---
Wow! Thanks a lot.  So the condition should be before the cast line.
---
Was in a group the other day with 2 hunters, mage, warlock and my shaman. Hunters would use eyes of the beast to pull groups and lock, mage, hunters would aoe.
---
Mods apparently have deleted any mention of it in this thread. But If you google for "WoW Goons" you'll get it.
---
It's from Something Awful. A website about old-school trolling. Looking at the layout of the website, and the "benefits" they offer for the different tiered memberships and coming out going "it's 100% real I can't believe this" is exactly what they want.
---
Anyone have any tips for frost AoE grinding? Im a lvl22 undead mage on my main, been struggling with it a bit. 
---
My issue is mainly in pulling &amp; the rotation I guess? Been trying the farmers in Hillsbrad. I'm either successfully pulling and then going OOM after nova-blink-2xblizz and maybe some arcane exp. OR I'm pulling 1-2 then running into another group on accident that I'm not rdy for trying to get a 3rd mob (been limiting myself since I often botch the pull and need to drop aggro) &amp; missing some with frost Nova. 
---
Talents are according to the icy-veins guide but I feel like I just really need cold snap to get that 2nd Nova off when necessary. Should I just start with green mobs or git gud?
---
Then play it all. Whatever you fancy at the time
---
I can tell you that regularly carrying Swiftnesa potions on me has saved me from people about 10x, no one expects it and especially annoying classes played by people who like to jump you when you're fighting mobs like rogues and hunters don't really have a slow to stop you
---
I escorted a lv 11 troll hunter to Dun Mouragh to tame a bear yesterday. This was how it felt
---
To be fair, it applies to any table top RPG even predating DND but it's probably most popular due to DnD
---
im not sure you understand.
---
It litterally made everyone go "wth?" and walk over to it, basically seeing their advertisement.
---
Seeing someones advertisement == useful.
---
To give a serious answer, I would go all the way into Assassination. I am currently doing the same.

Lol that post's suggestions aren't that bad tbh. Evocation at 10 is a bit much, and I don't know about Crusader Strike, but rest seems fine to me. This shit literally matters like for 3 hours before you're replacing this stuff anyway, and it emphasizes that level 10 power hype.
---
what level should I be able to solo WW axe quest? is it worth waiting to do it solo or should i get (pay) a high lvl to help?
---
You pretend anything really worked as intended in vanilla
---
My MAIN AIM is solo grinding. This means being able to clean dungeons and aoe farming. This points mage - hunter.
---
If my aim was only healing, I'd stick to paladin.
---
If my aim was only tanking, I'd stick to warrior.
---
If my aim was only pvp, I'd go rogue.
---
(you can pvp with warrior &amp; druid too etc. but rogue is much entertaining in pvp. same thing goes with pala, much more entertaining than druid healing......)
---
Hmm... Warrior has a better endgame overall but hunters are easier to level.
---
Since you already reached lvl 31 I would stick with the warrior and plan on levelling the hunter on a later date!
---
I can feel the rage from here! But this is precisely why PvP servers are awesome
---
I've rerolled from a 27 mage to a 21 paladin and now I'm debating between a hunter or warlock and whether to go on PVP or PVE.
---
So you're saying he's from an English speaking country but doesn't speak English properly?
---
Well not sure what the percent is - but these servers can hold a hell of a lot of players compared and the 'zones' are just being layered currently for player experience rather than because its a requirement due to technical complexities.
---
You say you're not going off of vanilla but then you say "Yeah, WoW didn't become the sensation it was because it was just an average game. It's actually a really well designed and well executed MMO. "
---
It became a sensation because of vanilla dude. How old are you? Do you not realize what vanilla did to our pop culture? BFA didn't do that. Not even close.
---
You don't share my opinion that it uses predatory gambling-esque tactics? Then what is titanforging? Why do people join the same dungeons over and over and over and over until they get that ONE piece that is SLIGHTLY better than the other, only to be replaced the next patch cycle and rendered completely obsolete? That is the meta now and it has been for a long time, so you can continue the cycle over again and pay them more money.
---
Meanwhile in vanilla I get to get 5/8 nightslayer as a rogue and whip ass in a PVP spec from here until the end.
---
It keeps you locked in a "chase" the entire time and you never really get to step back and go do your own thing. You log on, do what they've laid out for you, then you wait for the next day.
---
Lets not even forget all of the bogus microtransacitons. You can't call retail wow an MMO anymore. Go say "retail wow is a well designed and well executed MMO" to a standard MMO fan like someone who plays EverQuest or some shit and see what they tell you.
---
I played every single WoW expansion, the only one I didn't was BFA because the removal of PVP servers absolutely disgusted me. It was the final straw, and while your opinion might be different than mine, whatever, that's fine. 
---
I'd like to find someone who has experienced the game in the way that I have that doesn't agree with me. Retail has become a corporatized product with the goal in mind to squeeze every little cent they can out of people. 
---
Go look at their youtube page. All of their videos have an insane amount of dislikes to like ratio. ESPECIALLY the ones when they announce a "new mount"
---
People know.
---
Also serpentblooms spawn outside the dungeon entrance as well. I also run a holy priest and I got tired of running WC to be left with getting maybe one or two. I ran around avoiding combat with the elites looking for them.
---
It is perfectly fine to greed on gear that you want because you need money or for disenchanting that's the exact purpose of selecting greed. No reason to pass unless there will be no benefit to you getting the item.
---
Its definitely not the norm. I played on a heavy Scandinavian realm in classic and lots of scandi guilds on my realm now and 99% of the time they speak english. Plus they are normally chill and easy to get on with in groups so they are not a problem in my eyes
---

Those are wow rubber halloween masks? What's the source?
---
The warrior has been my favorite so far, I just got discouraged. Guess I need to nut up or shut up. 
---
I'm gonna be real sad I spent so much time on the others if it's the case. :p

/cast Shoot Wand
---
Is now my new favorite macro, friendship ended with the Shoot Wand button from the spellbook.
---
&gt; see APES
---
People who are 60 now are obviously the more hardcore and mostly better players. Wait til average joe starts wiping on the 5 dog packs.
---
Agreed about the level 40 drought. You have to do a ton of traveling and minor 1 or 2 quests here and there, mixed with a few dungeon runs. Once you hit 45 and can do ZF and tanaris quests it takes off again (currently where I'm stuck with some friends, we just hit 45 last night)
---
I’m the same vein, paying attention to the tank is usually the healers #1 job. It won’t kill them to communicate if they need to stop. Putting all the blame on the tank alone isn’t the answer. Both can do more to help out.
---
I only do dungeons. This way I always have a healer. :-)
---
Um, is that title NSFW?
---
With beefed up overpower, dodge is better than a hit
---
I feel this.  I feel like I had a bigger issue with it long ago than I knew.  I didn't play constantly, but I did always come back to it.  I'd set a goal, accomplish the goal, then I was good for the day or two.  
---
Ever since, I've not played any games for a long time, I haven't beaten anything, bad I always felt bored very early on in any game.
---
Now that classic is out, I feel like my free time is more open, im getting more done, and I'm just as hooked as the first go round.  
---
It strangely seemed to add some sort of odd structure to my life that I missed...
---
&gt;I'd like to, but my friends play on this realm, who have other friends that also play here. Not so simple to just get everyone to transfer, and I'd like to play with my friends
---
Oh I'd transfer immediately if I didn't know anyone on this realm and just played solo, but I don't want to ditch the friends I play with, who started on this Oceanic realm when there was no other PvP option at launch. Now they don't want to leave either, because they have other friends there too. Really wish we had more PvP Server options at launch in Oceania. There are 2 others now (One Med-High, other Low-Med), but it doesn't seem like people want to leave, probably for similar reasons to the above :\\
---
Awww. I have a pizza themed hunter in retail. Spider with this same model (from the mine in elwyn) is pepperoni, white bat from tirisfal named mozzarella, and a turtle named crust.
---
Got the Leaf in Vanilla on my guild's last ever MC run before we started on BWL. Stayed up until the sun came up the next morning doing the quest. Was so happy to get what was BiS at the time (before the crossbow from Chromaggus), and an achievement in itself. Equipping it set you apart from other Hunters, because it showed you knew how to play your class. I still x-mog it on Retail. Can't wait to get it again!
---
Don’t worry. You’re invaluable to all of us other classes when you’re picking the locked chests for us in dungeons :)
---
This was done with 0 help, 0 buff and average gear.
---
Still no taunt or way to immunize crushing blows though.
---
From just a damage stats perspective, cruel barb is better. I don't know how often the leg procs, though. Maybe test them both and a dummy and see what gets you more dps.
---
And your offhand should be a fast dagger, usually. Something that can proc poisons frequently
---
You guessed it! And after that the whitesaber mount
---
Woosh
---
Exactly people feel entitled to nodes they choose not to level. 
---
‘I don’t care about ores BUT those locked chest have loot -I- want so gimme gimme gimme
---
It's fun,  not good lol
---
Those medicine men in STV are such a bitch if you pull two of them.
---
Getting hunter leaf.
---
I've had way more tanks be druids than warriors on Pagle Alliance.
---
Yes. And isn't there another black market auction house in winterspring?
---
Assuming he sold his account after a couple nights of hard partying to ring in 2005 and, like all college kids at the time, immediately purchased Netflix stock on 01/03/2019 when the markets reopened at around $1.50/share he would now be sitting on about  $24k. 
---
Heck yeah!
---
Thanks I’ve just started to listen!
---
Windfury in the beginning, but should be overtaken by SoC with Vengeance. - If I'm not mistaken, Vengeance should double dip; +damage to **physical** and **holy**. Which to me, reads that my weapon's damage will be boosted (which immediately boosts SoC, because it'll hit for 70% of that). But then, because SoC is hitting for Holy damage, that Holy damage should get boosted again by Vengeance.
---
Is it just me or does Horde have better access to lower level dungeons? Alliance may have Stock, Dead Mines and Gnomer, but that's about it. The rest seem to be located in Horde territory. 
---
Not complaining. I'm Horde, but feel bad.
---
So, you are saying you are in combat and begin death doesn't drop combat while YOUR pet is still fighting... and that's broken? That's how the game works... you are in combat. JFC
---
which game do you think has more simple combat rotations and also more complex dungeon mechanics?
---
Retail is leaps and bounds ahead on both of those metrics
---
Skeram and Herod homies come on over to Earthfury!!!
---
Okay then, but just because I disagree with you doesn't mean you should stop defending your position... but as far as I (me not you) am aware - what you are saying is untrue and a few blue posts also confirm this.
---
I’m in a guild of 40-50 real life friends and acquaintances. Of those who I’m close to (about a 3rd), one logs on on weekends and makes a new character to 20 then tells me he is done playing WoW forever (until next weekend), I’ve got another who has made it to 36 and is “over it”. Everyone else is addicted and is planning what they will do at 60. 
---
There will be drop off, but from my own anecdote, I’m seeing a lot of possible retention
---
Yeah as a priest I do this as well if mana allows it that is. And always on the zeppelin as I’m not using my mana for anything so why not hand it out to everyone.
---
More like half the spells lol
---
With lots of open auctions I had internal error as well with the mail not showing up but I logged out and then back in immediately and checked the mailbox again and the rest of my stuff and mail came in
---
Glad I'm a rogue cause I'd wait for some to drink and fall behind to plan my attack, was hilarious seeing the raid come back and try to find me
---
And did your raid let your ninja any locked chests?
---
Iirc its something stupid like 49 or 59 agi per crit for hunters. Usually better off with AP and flat crit items.
---
They intended to make them focus based but could not get it to work for the release of the game. Mana was a fall back. Source: [@1:10:20](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/04/12/episode-99-luke-lafreniere-talks-nost-kevin-jordan-talks-hunters-pvp-news-hunter-pvp/)
---
Void walker tanked the boss.  Then they pulled Morgraine out far enough that they could kill Whitemane before she ressed him
---
works with autos hot as well
---
As a priest, I stopped buffing hunters. I don't have the mana to be throwing fort on everyone so I just buff the pet and carry on
---
Thing is the voidWalker will die too quickly, this technique allows to gain time while all the mobs are packing up so that’s its easier to aoe down.
---
Are you for real? You've likely havent played a warrior in a long time bro. Rend is shit. You won't even see it on the top warriors bars. Lol
---
Thats the hardest part of the choice for me, I really enjoy solo content, I like to be able to go off on my own for gold and other such things. I don't have a problem doing it with others as well, I just like the choice.
---
Mad season and smooth mcgroove are 2 super chill and knowledgeable streamers. Highly recommend.
---
Wise words from the Hodge Twins

"Just leave them nuts hangin out"

😂

I'm doing it right now. Started as an Ambush build. It's really freaking amazing starting in the mid-20s. You can have pretty much all your essential talents at 27. Feel free to change out the fillers like "Master of Deception" and "Elusiveness" for whatever your preferences are. It would look something like this:
---
Also, at 30 you can go pure Hemo. It is also fun, although your kill time is slower. Because you can keep things stunlocked you take less damage, though. I do a lot of grinding and I almost feel like Hemo levels faster than Ambush because of almost no downtime between pulls. Plus, it's a PvP spec so it's wonderful for ganking Alliance. Hemo uses less energy than SS so it becomes the primary combo generator. It looks like this:
---
Combat Swords is definitely more efficient but for those of us oddballs who just like using Daggers, Ambush or Hemo builds are perfectly fine and more fun to me.
---
Take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm only level 34 so I haven't tried either at higher levels yet.
---
I have done the Ambush build in dungeons and I was usually highest damage on single target pulls. On bosses I would use Vanish to get in a second Ambush. I havent tried Hemo in dungeons yet but I suspect it will be poor damage.
---
I haven't tried Assassination at all yet.
---
Good luck!
---
Personally, I don't need cloth if there's clothies in my group unless non of them need on it. But for me healing is a side gig that I just try to maintain a solid set of gear for. However if you're healing and need on cloth, individual people might have and issue with it (especially if they lose the roll) but typically people understand if it's an upgrade for you and for a role you're filling they can deal with it. I just personally take pity on those poor cloth wearers.
---
No. They said Medium pop was full.
---
Good shit my dude! I just got my mount last night as well. Any tips for Broken Tooth hunting? Still have yet to tame...
---
Man, I miss "HK: Private" popups.......
---
It will come. Soon...
---
It wouldn’t look weird to have the staff moving in the hand while a fireball is charged. This fits well with the fantasy idea of a staff being a conduit of magic.
---
With the wand, yeah, dual wield. Why not, that would look dope.
---
For things like crafting or mining, just have the staff disappear momentarily, like it’s on the ground, nbd
---
They're gonna, good riddance tbh.
---
Well, yes, I think he or she could.
---
voidwalker was tanking the boss
---
Damn so movie ticket prices doubled in 15 years?
---
Whats sap
---
Vuh do, healbot, honestly I prefer the default raid frames over any addon with mouse over macros or clique
---
I'm not sure why yours wouldn't work it should work the only difference in mine is that you won't unshift yourself instantly by spamming it.
---
Literally cant see it. Dark as fuck
---
I'm just here for the jokes
---
Thats true but I mean that they did not even get their "final" talentbuilds, that blizzard would build on unlike mage for example.
---
The vast majority of my deaths from rogues so far have been ones 10+ levels above the zone just camping low level players. I honestly don't know how that's even fun for more than a couple minutes but I've seen multiple do it for hours on end.
---
&gt; What do high level enchants do?
---
Add stats or chance on hit effects. Crusader is a popular one for melee classes that gives you a chance on hit to increase you strength by 100 for 15 seconds.
---
&gt; And are you paying people to enchant for u then?
---
Yup. Cost varies depending on how hard it is to get the mats for the enchant.
---
It’s incredibly frustrating!
---
Get a redragon. I have had all of these other mice, g600 and 2 nagas. They all broke in a year. Nagas weren't comfortable either. My redragon has lasted 4 years and is much more comfortable to use than either of those competitors, AND it's less than half the cost. Can't beat it.
---
Toggling autoattack makes both weapons hit. Make sure your offhand weapon isn’t broken as that coulf make it unusable. Since it’s a toggle, hitting it multiple times would toggle your autoattacks on, and then off. Make sure to use it only once or even replace it with a macro that is simply /startattack if you want to spam your autoattack bind. 
---
Putting weapons on your action bars will attempt to equip them when you press on them, not autoattack. Keep in mind that using an ability like Sinister Strike will toggle your basic attacks on.
---
You will probably meet someone you can chill with while you are a low level. Met a dude my second night playing and we played for almost 6 hours together in the barrens. You could also meet people through a guild.
---
You are a godsend.
---
Barrens &gt; Stonetalon/Ashenvale &gt; Southern Barrens &gt; Thousand Needles (around lvl 29)

What a time to be alive
---
Except when my bags are full I'm usually miles away from a mailbox and when I am actually near a mailbox I'm also near a vendor and can sell the shit anyway.
---
And some things only give melee AP, like the Strength stat or Blessing of Might.
---
I really like PerfectRaid: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4673-PerfectRaid.html

Ya only similar thing recently in retail that I can remember was when you could find that void touched flower in the emerald nightmare in legion. Left some mystery as to what it meant for the future.
---
But it was super hidden and not that amazing.
---
Until you know, you raid and ever need to change tanks
---
While overall true, I don't think this will be the case in Herod. They had multiple chances to change servers and they still have queue, so people refusing to leave are planning for the long game and unlikely to have moved on in the near future
---
Thank you
---
Pro tip for all melee classes: level up your unarmed too. Getting caught disarmed as a warrior is basically like miss/dodge/parry for 5-8 seconds which means dead.
---
Can't blame anyone for trying to relive simpler times.
---
I play horde. My main was undead rogue in vanilla, shits broken af with PvP spec if you have all your cool downs. They’re great in small world PvP skirmishes and duels. 
---
Fortunately that is balanced out by their relative ineffectiveness in organized PvP.
---
I haven't been able to find a simple add on to show my DoT durations on my target. Is there a way to do this without a complete UI overhaul?
---
All great suggestions, I definitely keep busy while waiting, usually household chores or punch out a bit more work :P ... I'd transfer away, but my friends are there, who have other friends there too. Understandably no one seems to want to move and or not be able to play with their mates lol. Wish we'd had more PvP realm options in Oceanic prior to release! Ah well, we'll see how many folks are still playing in a months time.
---
Thats a very good point, I seem to end up solo in front of a group all too often. I need to make more friends!
---
Are you the leader of 1-BDI?
---
Well dang.
---
Void walker can do it if you don’t have a tank
---
Secrets the vine Cancun Mexico??
---
You can select a class between mage &amp; hunter. Same aim, different damage type and play style. But warrior and hunter are on different sides of a scale. Want to rambo thru pvp battlegrounds? Warrior. But I don't think a warrior will be efficient on mob grinding &amp; solo dungeons. Also, no feign death aggro reset etc.
---
Dang.
---
i WaNt tO pLaY wItH sTrreeeeeeMeRs!!!!
---
Dungeon farming. It aint fun but goddamn is it fast.
---
Got to 51 in 3 days played
---
You can just make new account and add one month of game time to get a new classic account, so it's not like getting banned is a big cost.
---
yea MH was a 2.9. OH was a 1.8
---
1. Int is your primary stat but getting Fiery/Arcane/Icy Wrath affixes will directly incrase your damage.  I didn't mage in Vanilla but I imagine stacking Fiery Wrath modifiers on your gear will make your spells hit much harder.  The problem with those affixes is that they generally only apply to one school, and gear that increases all spell damage is more rare.
---
2. You can't level with gathering professions.  Gathering nodes don't grant XP.  Money becomes more readily available if you just keep your gathering profs up to date with the zone you're in so that you're gathering the highest level material you can.  So you should be gathering as you quest/grind in the highest level area you can access.
---
UGH! You must be fun in parties!
---
Took me *forever* to find that out back in the original Classic WoW :)
---
I wish I had the time this week. :/
---
SEND ME BACK!
---
FASTEST ZF SPEED CLEARS ON SERVER LF 1 MORE MAGE
---
Personally, i think voidwalker is poop. He does like a third of the damage of the succubus, and is terrible at holding aggro. The only reason I would have him out is for sacrifice in PvP situations.
---
I highly recommend going with a drain life setup with the succubus. Once you can get 5 points in fel concentration in affliction you're set.
---
Its a bit weak until you have a few higher ranks of drain life, but smartly alternating between wanding and drain life after you dot your target, combined with life tap (and eventually dark pact) means you will never have to stop to drink outside of bandaging occasionally
---
It has nothing to do with entitlement. You know how often I see people not run back after a wipe. How many people expect me to drink my water top them off. I've had to spend more gold to keep my heals, and damage abilities relevant so outside the dungeon I can do damage, but I can heal inside the dungeon.
---
What an exciting modern world we live in today!
---
im lvl 29, what dungeon should i start farming
---
Really? My friend thought he came up with this name half a year ago and is very original.
---
If you change the default setup of the wow client maybe. And it still is griefing.
---
I agree, I spent my night levelling my fishing to 150 on Tuesday. Saved some lowbies from death several times. 2 people asked me for help with a quest nearby. Found out after grouping that we were guildmates, lol. Made some money off the nodes I fished up, lvled my alchemy, and am now selling the elixirs I made on the Auction House. Have had a blast this week!
---
69
---
Add free faction transfers then.
---
So frustrating. Spend more than a decade begging for this game and then find stupid ways to avoid actually playing it.
---
I have been leveling with some friends but I have out leveled them by about 10 levels at this point.  Is there an experience penalty if I group with them to do quests or dungeons to help them catch up?
---
Ghost Saber, a lvl 20 cat from Darkshore has a unique skin that is partially transparent. It has a smallchance of spawning from clicking Cat Figurines in the Naga ruins in the northern part of the zone. Humar the Pridelord is also a cool pet in the Barrens right next to Ratchet, lvl 23. If you really wanted, you could probably snag Echeyakee, but that requires a horde player to summon it. 
---
Broken Tooth didn’t seem too heavily camped when I camped it or passed by, there was usually 0-1 players on Skeram-NA, and we’re full most evenings.
---
Rogues of equal level of gear (pre nax) was a fair fight for me as a feral Druid. 
---
9/10 Druids do the error of trying to cast anything and not going bearform (pvp trinket + bearform and rogue is in trouble).  
---
I know we are not in p2 yet but pre getting the trinket I often survived long enough to go bear + frenzy Regen.
---
Im at work so I cant access the AH, was wondering if someone can give me rough prices on some Enchanting supplies? 
---
Server: Kurinnaxx but can be any server just trying to get an idea of of the prices.
---
Greater Nether Essence
---
Large Radiant Shard
---
Dream Dust
---
Any help would be appreciated!
---
I know. Just wasn't sure if I should spoil for the OP.
---
Perhaps. The private server community was notorious for playing hard for a couple of months then quitting until fresh reset though. Hard to predict what those folks do imo
---
While questing, any player that just types "inv" in /say and then follows that up after 2 seconds with "INV" is automatically 100% never getting an invite. I don't care if it takes twice as long for us both to do the quest, at that point I want to delay your progress.
---
20% ROI, musta been a subprime loan
---
All classes should be able to train in all cities.
---
Warlocks can’t train in Darnassus either.
---
I am definitely "in the know" so hear me out:
---
They're planning on bringing transmog and barbers in the next DLC (called stages? or phases? idk) right before they bring LFG and flying mounts the stage after.
---
Your taking this classic experience to a whole another level.
---
What other activities you speak of good sir ?
---
That moment when overpower misses
---
Well that's interesting, thanks for the correction :)
---
It's not an asshole move but I don't exactly see how your customers are getting their money's worth.
---
but if it's worth it to them, it's worth it to them.
---
personally I would never, ever, ever group with you under those terms.
---
It lasts for a little while doesn't it?
---
I don't play rogue or blacksmith - and as far as I'm concerned you can take the chest, just a perk of being able to.
---
Or I would find it quite amusing if you auctioned off access to it to the highest bidder a-la storage wars.
---
I love the salt we put out, it continues even after ganking.
---
Love it, perfect cut
---
Use your e-mail as your account name...?
---
i had one before i knew it's gona be like this ... i wish i could trade it
---
Id prefer healer or tank to be honest already have a lock dps, ill def check our your guide thanks!
---
I quested (ran a dungeon here and there) my way to 40 and had around 100g by the time i got 40. From just vendoring trash/quest rewards and selling some greens i gotten on AH.
---
Also used skinning since lvl 5 and sold them to vendor.
---
As long as you realize it's a problem, you're on the road to recovery!
---
Havent sat in a que since 2nd day of launch when I created a char on Kirtonos lmao
---
The dungeons are packed with people, AH has tons of items, guilds are recruiting. And there is 0 streamer nonsense!
---
I dont understand how people still decide to play on Herod and the like
---
Nothing wrong with alts, other classes are fun, but are they as fun as being a 2-3 shot plate wearing killing machine everyone runs from?... that's up to you
---
Cross realm was added in 1.12, a patch released in late 2006. That's much closer to TBC than launch Vanilla.
---
This isn’t even remotely true. As a mage who has been in some great groups, the XP per hour isn’t even close. You can ding in a little over an hour if done correctly, that’s significantly faster than questing. As for the traditional groups, how could they possibly be more efficient? AoE farms clear the dungeon significantly faster..
---
I just turn on party raid frames in the interface options and use that with Clique.
---
I want to be able to! It feels like I'll fall so behind if I don't pick something to stick to at least for this opening period.
---
Questing is faster for XP, dungeon for stuff and gold. you'll need to dungeon farm for mount anyway, but that can wait level 35 or so
---
As a mt in wrath, threat was already dead well before cata.
---
That‘s the whole point of that subreddit
---
Addon by yours truly.

---
If you rotate your alts you'll always start off your session with a good amount of rested exp.
---
Then they can’t reduce layers.  
---
They shot themselves in the foot adding layers/ increasing server population when the rush was real knowing they’d want to remove layers entirely later.  They’re in a situation now where removing layers will likely remove subscriptions because who in their right mind wants to sit in a 3-7 hour queue to play?  
---
I’m wondering if server “groupings” would be the solution, kind of how they did server merges before but in reverse:  open multiple new servers directly attached to one extremely overpop server, for example, and forcibly relocate percentages of that server to each of the new ones to spread out the load, but keep them integrally connected in the world, guilds, etc.  basically Johndoe becomes Johndoe-newserver but is still connected with their friends, guild, AH, etc on the new server.
---
Everybody always sleeping on the Warhammer.
---
You'll know all about deep ass rogue builds when you are oom drinking in STV.
---
Also when a friend you brought pulls 3 extra mobs on accident.
---
I'm not the guy you were talking to, but the servers in vanilla had a hard limit of how many people could be on at a time. And the discussion from the team at last year's blizzcon contradict what you are saying. I could be wrong however. Which blue posts back up what you're saying?
---
So far, leveling as a warr is hard because any decent player can kill me in PvP, as the only gap closer I have is intercept and almost all ranged classes have a way to create space after that (or in the case of a hunter, to be always outside my intercept range).
---
Dying to mobs from the same level as I am? It only happens when I keep chain pulling even after I'm 1/4hp. The last time it was hard was against those welps in redridge. Now I'm 35 and trying to quest in STV
---
Send a whisper to the spammer then you can right click their name and report
---
We got full guild runs
---
FFXI player Bazaar system.
---
Hmmm, it's kind of hard to say. It's a PVE server, so i only really have experience with Alliance in certain zones that have quests for both sides... so far, that would be Ashenvale and Hiillsbrad. I've seen plenty of Alliance running around in those zones. That's all completely anecdotal, though.     
---
The Horde side is very healthy though. All three major cities are always bustling. I'm mainly in TB since it has Druid trainers and it's a direct flight from Moonglade. Even there... which is a ghost town in Retail... has so many people running around. I love it!
---
/w the character’s name, right click the name in your chat, then report.
---
Does your atlas show dungeon maps? Mine doesn't work
---
This lol...I’m never in a place where mailing is more efficient than selling what I have to and than only mailing what’s left to AH and now I don’t need to waste time sending mail back and forth to just sell it anways
---
how exactly do I make all spells mouseovers with clique?
---
Tooootally forgot about this
---
I find it hilarious that the people who use lvling guides are also the ones who should be using it the least.
---
For some reason, no one ever goes around a bridge.
---
As a night elf hunter with traps... well it wasn’t pretty. 
---
Death to the Horde!
---
I've been making good gold with skinning/leatherworking on my rogue.
---
Since the mount item is Bind on Use, you could technically acquire the mount without being exalted. Still can’t use it without learning the right mount training though, and that requires exalted.
---
An undead caster walks into a bar with a red dragon whelp on her shoulder. Bartender says, “Hey, where’d you get that?”
---
“The Undercity,” the whelp says. “They got em all over the place!”
---
The difference is the loot inside. Upgrades are the big thing, Mostly the blues that can drop in. I've been fortunate that every group distributes it as needed. I got one blue in a locked chest but it wasn't worth much. I gave the rogue 10s as a tip. Nice people will get karma in the end. People don't seem to realize how much a little respect will get you and how one jerk move could drag your name through the mud.
---
One way to think of it is that Druid can cover all roles in the game to a degree. So that's a pretty big bonus towards playing him.
---
Rather than spending gold, go spend some time grinding dungeons.  You will get upgrades from there more frequently
---
Where is the best place to grind gold for my lvl 40 mount? I am 5 bars away from lvl 40 and got 60 gold. Need help!!!!
---
Hunter leveling is so smooth and fun, it just feels nice the whole way so far.
---
Looks like a 15 Touchbar so 2/3 years old max?
---
how is that related to your claim that it's the people's own fault they cant get invited into groups because of their class?
---
Instant cast healing over time spells, use the duration in seconds divided by 15.
---
So Renew is 15 seconds, it would add 100% of the +11 healing to the total healing of the renew. Not per tick.
---
Yes really lol. Blizzard themselves confirmed they kick people who just sit in the same spot resetting AFK timer to free up spots for legitimate players.
---
Dont let me get my main
---
It gets really really hard to hold agro on anything more than 3 levels higher than you because your agro skills keep missing or getting dodged/parried.  So i would say be 18 minimum, but if you don't end up going till 19 or 20 that's fine too, you won't have out-leveled the dungeon yet.
---
Make sure you have some kind of ranged pull before you go.
---
Just... go around the bridge.
---
I already killed you three times and hunters can’t swim ;o
---
I heard the sap sound effect in my head when I read this
---
Thwap
---
Ya there is a 20 second log out even if you alt F4 so they aggro you within that window
---
I was just saying that somethings dont get replaced for a while is all, sorry for the confusion
---
They didn't mean it's literally an arithmetic sum of the stats, just that it's a culmination of the stats on an item.
---
32 hunter that suddenly was not so fun... started a priest, reached 18, healed Ragefire Chasm and now planning to heal today or tomorrow Wailing Caverns. I will be probably leveling both characters at the same time so changing things help.
---
Been done 100000000000000 times
---
John Staats claims that this is not true and that the dark portal location was undecided so they just placed it in different places to see which one worked the best. 
---
[https://youtu.be/5axDqZUAUNQ?t=4490](https://youtu.be/5axDqZUAUNQ?t=4490) This is the interview where he says it. There also used to be a dark portal in Loch Modan.
---
buff stamina then, you ape
---
I'd say they do. RFC, WC, SFK, BFD, and SM are all much more convenient for horde.
---
To be fair you should get up and walk for about 5 minutes every hour
---
Honestly not that many mages in my guild or in the guild I was in before. Way more warriors.
---
Seriously I wouldn’t do it for a long period of time but I totally see myself questing a couple hour in the train or whatever
---
1. Install the new addons
---
2. Exit the game
---
3. Quickly restart and login
---
4. You will not hit the queue.
---
*laughs in stealth*
---
Reselling isn’t filthy, it ensure sellers as whole get the correct value.  When a bunch of people are under price their goods, that means everyone who’s taken the time to understand the value of a good get ignored.
---
Is there an addon to show the vendor price of items in your bag in the normal mouseover box? I know Auctioneer does it, but I would rather not have a whole extra box displaying.
---
You’re the 10th horde player to tell me my own faction is good against me in PvP. Good, go kill those alliance warlocks
---
I think I'm gonna do the warrior and when I'm feeling burnt out just do the mage or Hunter so I can have a gold farmer close by.
---
As far as I know I have them both. I'll have another look when I get on. Do you download them from the twitch app?
---
Paladins are just spam heals on main tank. 
---
Priest has way more utilities and can main tank/raid heal.
---
Disponible en SAP.
---
Does it have all the indicators and stuff though? The most important part of my party/raid frames is that they indicate who has various hots rolling, who needs a dispel/decurse, who has certain debuffs/conditions, etc. I'm honestly curious, I've used 3rd party frames for so, so, long.
---
Great Vid!
---
More like a Pleasure Totem.
---
absolutely nothing. He either got killed by one or doesnt know how to play one. Hunters are great in vanilla.
---
If you're Horde and playing with a Shaman don't have a Poison on your main hand so you can benefit from Windfury Totem. It's a good idea to ask if the Shaman will be using it, though. I don't kbow if it's only an Enhancement thing or if any Shaman can use it. I assume Enh only but i have never bothered to check.
---
Otherwise I typically use Instant on mainhand. If I'm grinding a fair amount of casters I'll typically use Mind Numbing.
---
If a mob *can* run away when at low health, I use Crippling on a fast off hand. Always. There's nothing worse than fleeing mobs on a Rogue. They tend to aggro more mobs.
---
If there's no chance the mobs I'm killing will run away, I use Instant on offhand as well. It's good DPS. 
---
Deadly Poison is almost never used because it really has to reach 5 stacks and go for its full duration for the damage to be worth it. Mobs die too quickly for this to ever happen. It shouldn't be used on raid bosses because it takes up a debuff spot and the raid can only have 16 on the boss. 
---
I have never used Wound Poison. I feel like it's more of a Possible PvP thing.
---
Single button swords-dagger swap macro for if you're running dungeons or just want to Ambush/Backstab:
---
/equipslot \[noequipped:One-Handed Swords\] 16 "name of MH sword"
---
/equipslot \[noequipped:One-Handed Swords\] 17 "name of OH sword"
---
/equipslot \[noequipped:Daggers\] 16 "name of MH dagger"
---
/equipslot \[noequipped:Daggers\] 17 "name of OH dagger"
---
If you're using a dagger offhand with sword mainhand swap the first two lines.
---
...
---
....
---
1. no.
---
2. You can just have the jump be every other minute. it takes no time at all to have the macro move you randomly in a direction every other minute.
---
Thanks !
---
If you just close the game, your character is still logged in for 20 seconds. As long as you aren't in a rested area like an inn or a city, you will always take 20 seconds to log out, whether you alt f4, close the game client, or just click esc -&gt; logout.
---
Level 20 intensifies.
---
I’m very indecisive, and find myself making a bunch of characters. Is there a benefit to leveling one character to 60, then branching out? Or is it better for me to keep trying new things until I’m satisfied, then level to 60?
---
Classic cast I believe
---
This is part of the secret.
---
Engineering for some extra damage, and potions, all the potions you can get your hands on. Defense, Troll's Blood, Attack Power, Healing, oils and weapon buffs.
---
Don't forget food buffs like Dragonbreath Chili.
---
They also had to raise the pop cap just because people were using afk tools to stay logged in, but weren’t actually playing. Now that queues aren’t as bad, perhaps less people are logged in afk so they can actually reduce the pop cap back down?
---
yeah that's what I do too. Plus I've had to use sacrifice so many times that it's worth keeping the vw out just for that.
---
Touche amigo
---
I was set on getting her at level 37 so I parked my character at 50,24 in Badlands and used Eagle Eye on the BT spawn locations. 
---
I logged in at random intervals and checked if she was up (while I was levelling an alt). Unfortunately I was only able to do this in the evenings, as my job doesn't allow me to login before that.
---
After the second day doing this I was already rather demotivated, so I decided to wake up at 4 am the next day and see if she had spawned... I checked... and... there she was! Just east of the Uldaman entrance! Ran for it and tamed her, I was so happy! :D
---
I used no layering exploits, as I didn't want to cheese this "one time experience". :)
---
It doesn't work if you're crit in the back arc also.
---
My take on this is 
---
Vanilla
---
+ class diversity unique selling points
---
+ spell down ranking 
---
- fewer working specs 
---
- long ass dungeons (takes a lot of time to clear).
---
TBC 
---
+ all specs are valid
---
+ heroic dungeons 
---
+ karazhan 
---
- pvp gear is best tanking gear for druids 
---
- flying.  
---
- power creep 
---
- raid in 10/25 put different need on tanks/healer ratio 
---
Wrath 
---
+ 45m dungeon runs means you can go in and run a quick dungeon without submitting a full evening to it. 
---
+ DK was fun but to op 
---
- vehicle encounters is so boring 
---
- more power creep 
---
- instancing 
---
Cata 
---
- Destroying Azeroth
---
- random zone kill by deathwing
---
- instances created so many that questing with a buddy was not working.
---
A rogue learned this the hard way yesterday. level 40 rogue tried to gank me a 43 spriest (with bubble) i /lol feared let her do her thing, feared her again healed up, let her do her thing feared her again. Ran around a tree, ate and drank, Bubbled, next thing she knew she was dead. MB , VE, SW:P, MF she had no chance to even attempt to run. I killed her a few times to teach her not to try to gank people who mind their own business. She got the last laugh, after killing me while I was afk,  she brought 4 friends, to lock me down and kill me. She made it to the KOS list due to being a coward and needing a gang to beat one person.
---
Yes it shows renews, shields, poisons, etc. for me.
---
You wrote that entire book to agree with me lol Congrats on getting a high PVP rank when nobody knew how to play back then. I mean, something like 0.3% of guilds cleared Naxx whereas a good majority cleared it in pservers. I'm not reading the entire thing because you're trying to justify your stupid decision. Do what you want, I don't care that much. Play daggers, get destroyed, cancel your sub. The less nubs on Classic the better.
---
Is it still racist if it's spelled wrong??
---
Not bad
---
!remindme 5 hours
---
Mage: Pulls 50 mobs by accident  
---
Mage: Disappointed. Only pulled 50 for aoe farm
---
To note, this isn't some secret feature in the game, /join allows you to make or join any channel you want.
---
It's an unofficial channel, lookingforgroup, same as the old channels classes used to make in their guilds during raids. 
---
Same as world. These are nothing more than community agreed upon global channel names. If everyone left the channel, it would cease to exist until the first new person rejoined it.
---
druids suffer similarly.  
---
There are exactly 4 locations for druid trainers.  3 of them are in Mulgore, (Thunder Bluff). 1 is in Feralas.  Every time I level and gain new spells and abilities, i have to start my pilgrimage to TB to train up!
---
So annoying!
---
It’s not some deep quote. She’s trying to stop you from poking around and finding out who she is.
---
I think you will have to go back to Org but you can search for pet trainers on Classic WoWHead to verify that.
---
Ah I see thank you
---
I took the trip down to wetlands and got one on the seventh pull. Unforch no one wants to pay the big bucks for her yet :(
---
Same boat bro... got a new laptop and everything just to play freaking wow.
---
Oh yeah how's that work out for him?
---
As someone who played a sub rogue, I can tell you if we don't want to fight we can be really slippery if we have our cooldowns up. Blind, (improved) Sprint, gouge, vanish, and preparation means you'll have to kill me real quick or I'm gone.
---
had 11K on Faerlina last night during peak, took about 3 hours after work.
---
Ok that makes sense, damn
---
Yeah let's fuck over all those people who want to plan in advance so they can play with friends.
---
Last time I ganked a lock I pretended to run off after I downed him, restealthed, looped back around, and one shotted him right after he popped his SS. Cannibalized his corpse even though I didn’t loose any hp. Gnomes are delicious
---
Name of your sex tape
---
Seriously wtf?  Is this?  
---
Retail has made people softer than fucking 10-ply!
---
To elaborate, most armor and weapon vendors will be your repair spots. There is usually one at each quest hub in the zones.
---
Um... ok?  I was just saying I was on my phone implying I mistyped BiS.
---
Are you alright?
---
[Technically we’re both wrong ](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294502/wow-classic-realm-update-august-16th-herod-and-shazzrah-massively-overpopulated) 
---
Here it says Med has a higher pop than the most populated realms during Vanilla. So it’s probably somewhere between 2x and 3x. 
---
Either way, the point was a vastly larger server capacity allows for them to use less servers so the 11 initial servers doesn’t seem as absurd as people want to make it.
---
I was about to say the same.  Honestly I tend to be the one buffing and getting nothing in return.  I've even had a few demand water and run off without giving a Fort buff.   Just crappy people everywhere.  Some really awesome and nice people on my server though too!  I've had a blast regardless of any bad experiences I've had with players.
---
if you use ELV UI you can move it and well everything
---
its called the objective frame
---
*Ahem* buy keys or bombs if you want to open locked chests otherwise you feeling others should just do their profession for you IS entitlement

This is hilarious. I love video games

Not a mage

Selling essence of the archmage got me my epic mount early!
---
Perfect farm for a shadow priest
---
Got 20-25g for essence of water last weekend xd
---
Yeah I guess I'm going back to Org. Someday. 
---
Current plan is to just level without growl cause I hate myself
---
One punch man
---
Check out weak auras 2
---
I didn't say they could get invited to groups, I said they couldn't get into groups, and see your problem is you think those 2 are the same thing.
---
Make your own group and you're instantly in a group, problem solved.
---
Yup! You can always change professions later. Save up mats...and send them to an alt.
---
You dont need to do dungeons for gear. Still had westfall legs at level 38 as a warrior. Just enjoy questing and the world.
---
The thing is, if you're suspicious of them, then you're screwed either way, because they can also screw you over with group loot. Maybe you're only giving yourself a 20-50% chance of not being screwed over, but they could still screw you over almost as easily.
---
hell if it's a particular drop off a particular boss and you are dps, they could just boot you from the group right before the boss, having used you to get up to that point but not want to risk you getting the loot.
---
there's a million ways they could screw you without using master loot
---
Leatrix has an option for this
---
Someone said sometjing racist and you messaged them why?
---
Not sure if trolling but search for classic Paladin discord on google lol
---
What servers do you play on? I'm a mage on Skeram and I often have people walk up to me asking "Can I please bother you for some food?" and they always tip 20-30s lol. Never had anybody be anything but extremely polite.
---
Where do you farm for emeralds?
---
No achievements at all in classic.
---
Tier 0.5 came out late in original vanilla.  It will come out late in classic as well.
---
If I remember correctly, Tier 0.5 comes out in Phase 5 (the same time that AQ40 opens).  But don't quote me on that.
---
Why? Because role play should make sense lorewise at the minimum? Its a sandbox world with established principles, when you role play, _generally_ you adhere to those established rules and principles. Including the principle of having your RP fit the lore of the world.
---
Charge doesn't trigger frost trap anymore
---
I should do this, make tons of bandage to bandage my mount, IF I HAD ONE
---
I prefer:
---
“You are the main character of your story; the main character of the story you are not”
---
This sub surprises me everyday.
---
With people pugging MC all the way through Rag already, I don't feel the need to rush a main. I can take my time and get to 60 in a few more weeks, I'll have plenty of opportunities to get my gear once I'm at top level. There hasn't even been an announcement for Phase 2 yet and the next raid isn't until Phase 3.
---
Nope. Google - directed to a site - download zip file - etc
---
Im not saying you cant rp a beggar _within_ the rules of the world man, its really simple. For example, you wouldnt rp a beggar asking for US dollars. You wouldnt RP a beggar that knows more than they should know. You wouldnt RP a Forsaken beggar mage talking about SM in the past when SM didnt exist. 
---
Roleplaying is indeed about building your own characters lore and backstory. But it has to FIT inside the WoW universe man. Its not gatekeeping. You wouldnt RP a fucking Super Saiyan just like you wouldnt RP that you worked at Scarlet Monastery...BEFORE IT WAS THE SCARLET MONASTERY.
---
Exactly.  I mostly identify with your 5th point.   They catered so much to the casual player that they ruined the community because they made it too easy, too accessible and easy to everyone.  It was a money grab because at the time their subscriptions were dwindling.  
---
I get it, but it ruined the game for more serious players and its why i left after TBC.  Fucking participation trophies...and i am a millennial!
---
If you want to solo out in the world on a PvP server, you will need stealth I would think.  So I would say rogue.
---
That way you will be able to pick your fights, and will be able to stay hidden when a large group of enemy players is nearby.
---
Skip it
---
I've fought a couple druids in duels so far, only one in the open world. A good druid seems like I can't even touch them! Granted I was around 25 for my last bout. Those fights did make it seem really interesting though, it's like stance dancing on the warrior but entire different kits!
---
Welcome to the club!
---
No it’s awesome. They’ll still lose every AV getting AoEd to death on the bridge and have long BG queues for their one mark. The pain is only temporary:)
---
RIP ass
---
If you've run this dungeon once you know that a new player and/or dumbass could light all the candles in that room. If you don't use the way there to type 'dont light the candles' it's on you.
---
3 hours, just play one hour on each. :D
---
This guy Dad jokes. I am totally using this on my friends in discord tonight haha.
---
My bar is currently set at "just don't go out of your way to be an asshole or insult someone" but a lot of the community can't even manage that. Part of it seems to be the population on layers being too high. Part of it is that I guess there are folks who haven't matured in the last 15 years. The actual new players have all been pretty nice.
---
Just trade me 10g before every thing nstqnce run then.
---
That could be accurate and obviously affect things quite a bit. I’m going off of my memory on the larger servers though.
---
Is this Diablo 2 graphics? Never seen that on Wow before.
---
Definitely! Unless you *miss miss parry dodge Overpower miss miss* all five
---
Not the 1st time lol
---
Almost lvl 39.
---
Ignoring the fact I can only play about 1/10 of what I would actually want to, been great.
---
Why do YOU get to decide the pace? Did they vote and make you captain? I doubt it. You don't have a mana bar. You offer zero utility. You do nothing but slow others down by being there. You do negative damage. So which one of these attributes makes you the shotcaller? If they want you to pull fast, then do it. A tank is the most worthless group spot in the game pre 60 and you should realize that instead of being intentionally difficult.
---
I had a 27 Rogue on Faerlina before queue became 4+ hours and started a Shaman on Netherwind that is 30 and a alt Warrior that is 15 and ready to be twinked out!
---
Along with the Felsteed, there's a small chance it could have been [Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13335/deathchargers-reins#modelviewer:10+0)   
---
It's a (very) rare drop from Baron Rivendare, in Stratholme.
---
Most likely a combination of all of them.  Quests from 1 region alone in higher levels aren't enough to get through level range typically.
---
its like 8 clicks to setup, it basically does it all for you
---
all you have to do after that is move things
---
I've been using vuhdo in classic.
---
This...everyone’s always looking at me to sap but if I sap then I unstealth and die...

The whiny bitches in Hodapp's Twitch made my night. o7

I’m proud of you for now wasting your time at the airport. Never give up and never stop grinding
---
lvl 38
---
Myself playing WoW for almost 15 just learned that right now from reading it.
---
Not my cup of tea
---
Ye ole reddit Whelparoo.
---
yes. you need to rank up in pvp to get these. They aren't easy to achieve.
---
You’ll get one! Never give up, never surrender.
---
We're The Seventh Legion on Old Blanchy! Come say hi sometime!
---
If your not pulling two packs at once are you even a tank
---
Because hardiness is next to useless.
---
Well considering the only utility rogues have is lock picking guess we won't be needing them anymore.
---
My experience with this is that I naturally did this out if nowhere, Im forgetful at but somehow that nugget of info surfaced even though I hadn't played wow for like 6 years
---
If they can both use it, then they can both need on it. They're not going to be solo tanking and solo healing when they're questing/levelling on their own, so the 2h weapons are more than likely their bread and butter. As a tank warrior, I do normally need on 2h weapons because that's what I use for everything except for dungeons. If I'm running with another warrior or Paladin (in any capacity, DPS or healing) then I fully expect them to need on the same gear as I do.
---
Do you have an image of your setup by chance
---
Druid is the best class guys, no contest. No gear roller coaster, can heal and stealth and tank, travel form and passive cat form speed boost, the only class that can swim fast, almost zero downtime except for really bad pulls, and they can teleport to Kalimdor whenever they want. Not being on top of the DPS charts in raids, who even cares?
---
I think Classic will overtake retail in the future. This is what people loved about the game. It took effort and time even though it can be a grind sometimes. Best MMO ever made
---
It always means go for me.
---
In that case doesn't this mean all the tanks will be freed up from the spell cleave groups to do normal runs?
---
Definitely!
---
Kromcrush?
---
It's only temporary, gotta keep telling myself that. Totally off topic but I cannot wait for AV, I'm super excited for it's return.
---
+5 Morale
---
FFXI was a game where you generally wanted to build your raid comp to deal with the enemies you were working with.  Astral burns worked on a LOT, but BLM burns were huge, Dynamis Lord with DRK and kclubs, King Vinegaroon with TP Burn and Chainspell stun.
---
I think this kind of stuff is very common in MMOs, that part of the game is having the classes prepared to do all this.  Either by having a roster that can multi class or one big enough that you can bench people.
---
I don't see this being a bad thing though.  Also really loved old BLM Burn parties.  I'm sad that people are getting so bent out of shape about people having fun in new ways.
---
That's what you get for playing alliance on Herod. Herod Horde ftw
---
I farmed it at 35-36, except fire elementals and got some help from other warriors on elite part. WW skill would really help you on farm.
---
Wait, that's a thing?
---
This is miserable xp/hr. You're locked after 5 so that's max like 25-30% per hr...
---
I see this argument a lot and it's pretty dumb. 
---
 Since mc is easy people should bring useless people into their raids.
---
Bunch of flaws here.
---
Mc is not the pinnacle of raiding.  
---
The people clearing mc in these raids you are watching are very experienced raiders.
---
Why would a raid want to bring someone who doesn't help the raid over someone who will contribute?
---
If Rogues asked for consent first they'd never win though.
---
lmao 
---
classic good

retail bad

39 Mage and new to WoW. Ive been using staffs/wands since the beginning but have been having some nice offhands dropping. Im not sure if its better to stay the staff route im currently on, or at some point make a switch to dagger/sword and offhand. Is one superior to the other?
---
Nagaz Stole My Bike.  Ftw.
---
fuck this makes me regret switching from mage to warrior one week before launch...
---
Wowhead has a guide that lists BIS for each class / spec combination as well as alternatives
---
Prolly right. Don't want to hurt some gaylords feelings.
---
Don’t pedestrians always have the right of way though?
---
I guess when literally half the players I see in the world are playing warrior I shouldn't be surprised to see a daily post overstating how hard it is to play. 
---
Vanilla warrior is the most wildly overturned class in the history of the game. The small price you pay is that it's a bit harder to level 1-40 if you're by yourself. 
---
But it ain't rocket science, and we certainly don't need to the daily reminder.

I'm 36 Warrior, and I have no % hit or crit gear, and I know Warriors in the 40s without any as well, so I'd assume it's 50+. 
---
I believe you would generally get your first trinket around a similar level. Maybe high 40s, if you do the carrot on a stick quest.
---
My group had a mob flee and were stuck in combat, so we were okay but mana was always low from no drinking. Someone lit two fires at once. We wiped. The good thing was it cleared the combat and we found the missing mobs. We made it pay.
---
It’s not ideal, but it will do.
---
Yeah, they created classic on 7.3 servers
---
Seize it, and go all in.
---
That should be true, but at later levels, quests turn grey later.  It is technically 5 levels difference.  If the quest is level 43, it starts getting reduced xp at level 49.  I was going through green quests in feralas at level 50, and I noticed I was getting the 20% decrease per level outside of the 5 level range.  
---
I think this means quests have the extended green color mobs are receiving at higher character levels, even though they should be greyed out from being more than 5 levels below the character.
---
30 rogue. Started when it released. I play for a few hours after work.
---
Which is why they made retail the way they did.  Some of us like the vanilla wow.  Dont like Vanilla?  Play retail.  Its not hard.
---
How do you do that? Is it some translation tool or you have to discover how to do it yourself?
---
Without alliance you wouldn't have anyone to pvp against. I don't get this way of thinking.
---
If I was a lion and you were a tuna, I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you, and then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.
---
Man you are crushing it on speed for a paladin then.
---
Dont compare pvp to ganking by a group
---
Sounds like pugs suck if you're going through 3 stacks of water. I run almost exclusively with guildies and I go through maybe 5 water per run.
---
I believe its the cold and lack of sun light :P
---
Playing on an Acer Predator at 100 FPS with modern graphics on. GREATLY enjoying the game this way personally.
---
I’m just leveling with guildies and friends and having a good time. But the Druid is now my highest level, so maybe.
---
SoS, west part near Deadwind Pass exit.
---
That's how you pronounce the desktop environment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME
---
have an upvote
---
yea except nobody is going to just delete their level 60 character to make a new one of the opposite faction on that same server.
---
Warlocks can sacrifice their voidwalker, get a shield and cast hellfire without the mages backup. Especially with a priest healer, giving them another shield. 
---
Also warlocks daze and stun the shit out of mobs when AOEing when they are specced destro. Eye of Kilrogg pulls almost as good as a warrior. 
---
I’d say it doesn’t really matter if you have a warlock instead of one more mage in your group, if you have 2 other mages in your group.
---
These are relative to the highest population servers. This means nothing.
---
I'll have to look into it some more cause I've seen some of the other posts about it too. Didn't necessarily think about the imp gouge too. And I haven't been backstabbing in PvP because people know how to turn on a dime with their mouse now. Rarely do you see people keyboard turning like you did in vanilla. I feel like this build was made and popularized when keyboard turning was a thing as its a lot harder to stay behind someone nowadays. I'll have to try it out a little bit later this week when I'm playing cause the more I think of it the more I'm liking it. Comboing from a 5 point kidney shot into a thistle tea backstab should do some solid damage.
---
I'll bet you OP averages at least 10h per day since release.

I play on a refurb 2013 MBAir with minimal issues. Obviously graphics could be better but near flawless other than that.
---
I followed my friends onto a server they were playing on. All 3 DPS players went mage.
---
51 Arms warrior here. Just got my Trasher Blade from Maraudon, wondering if I should go fury until pvp phase? Should I go back and get the sword of omen? Or should I stay arms until 60?
---
I got a 2019 MacBook Air.
---
It runs great on Classic settings. The game is not really demanding.
---
FPS will probably drop a lot in a raid setting, however.
---
I feel this on a personal level. 
---
Last night a friend needed a layer hop while I was questing in ungoro. I underestimated the poison the flowers give to you and 3 times in a row was brought to less than 5% life. 
---
My buddy goes "uhhh you alright?"

To which I reply, "yea it's just how us warriors like to level. Need to feel close to death to feel alive"
---
Feels bad seeing on Kirotonos as Alliance
---
I ussually take the chest for myself.
---
But i allways ask if ppl want the stuff i don’t need or can’t use.
---
If i get gear i allways throw that in the group those who want it can roll else im keeping it.
---
I rolled a mage after thinkin about it for 3 months and now i consider a reroll cause i hate being the mainstream class
---
Screw you. That looks amazing.
---
Why would you go all the way to booty bay when you could go to Grom’Gol?

Not the boat, the zep to gromgol, then swim.

I thought they pretty quickly changed that to “soandao makes some strange gestures”.

Apparently I'm a ultra pleb and didn't even look at image b4 I posted it. I'll take a better screenshot once I'm home from work. #ManyReasonsWhyI'mAnoob and this is one of them.

My Hunter friend started his own groups for every instance run he's ever done (because he never gets invited to cleave groups lol).

You'd probably get ganked a few times in the tunnels, being severely outnumbered.

Thunderbluff should have been the main hub!!!!
---
I use the classic "y o u lo se" after killing annoying gankers.
---
I main a druid, and there's very little that he can't do, as long as he doesn't mind not doing it very well compared to classes that specialize. Levelling is fast (or would be if I didn't have that stupid "grown up" stuff to do now). Cat form with spec gives +30% speed at level 21. Travel form +40% at 30. Pop a regrowth between fights. Aquatic form makes questing underwater easy. You can always tank or heal in a pinch. And, let's face it, shapeshifting is just plain awesome.
---
Basically the global world is instanced and only a fraction of your server population is in your instance at any given time.
---
I for real had someone open trade with me, while I had no mana, and THEN say "water."  F all the way off.
---
How are you going to reasonably convince a group of friends to transfer to a different realm, all of whom probably already made nice little connections within the current realm? It's not easy to persuade, especially when you're already comfortable with the current economy, alliance/horde ratio, and every other little distinction that makes the realm what it is.
---
Far better passive points in combat for leveling, greatly reduced Sprint and Evasion cd's with Sprint breaking roots, no positioning dependence on our combo point generator, less skills to train, a disarm, superior mob grinding with Blade Flurry and AR and two insanely strong quest reward weapons that last nearly 30 levels.
---
Ambush crits are fun but the added utility and passive mitigation boosts granted by Combat on top of a 30 dps sword that can be gotten as early as level 35 it's a no brainer.
---
I mean, priests have pw:shield to prevent interrupts, not sure about the other 2.
---
Same here. At 37, I am able to farm most of the stuff for WW weapon without going too far out of my questing path. At 30, I'd struggle against the trolls and dump gold on the charms.
---
I got Loksey's staff from SM. That's been good enough for me for my mid 30s.
---
I'll probably spend another hour farming elementals tonight, then I'll find a group to kill Cyclonian and get my WW hammer!
---
Wow posting spoilers dude?????
---
YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME!

It’s not original. I remember seeing this guild name used in Vanilla

Waaaaaaghhh!

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHH!

Guy's been sitting in STV for over two weeks ... waiting.

Yeah I’m not crazy ? There’s so many horde it’s insane
---
How does it run on your laptop? What processors/ graphics card (if any) do you have?
---
It really is. And here's the thing: even if you resist and goof it up say 1/10 times... that's still 9/10 times you're pickpocketing when you otherwise might not do it. It adds up so quickly.
---
I agree that it was not an add-on that did this but that it may of been something extra that came within the zipped add-on folder.  The more I think about it I don't believe it was a remote login.  At the time I was moving the mouse only and it was opening wow so quickly it was as if it was all through commands like a script.  It is possible that it has been something on my computer for a long time but in the last two weeks my system has been only used for wow classic and installing the add-ons.
---
Mages are just clearly so much stronger than other classes when you are running instances.  They are almost as valuable as finding a healer (obviously a healer is more required but you might have a harder time finding 1 mage).  In old vanilla people used to try and mark cc, but now people are realizing on the bigger 5+ mob pulls you can just use mage + other aoe to aoe them down.  Mages are the super class in classic.
---
Hmmmm this is one of several times someone has told me that after 40 and getting mortal strike the tides turn and it feels better. Think I have to at least stick it out until then! 
---
I didn't realize shifting was such a mana drain, do you know how fast it ooms you?
---
Just depends what you find and what stats they have. There are some cool off-hands in the game if you come across them, so it's good to keep the best 1-hander you find so you can swap if you find a good off-hand. Mostly you'll find staves though, there are some great quest reward staves.
---
[use this](https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php)

Yeah I remember those at least
---
I need gold, milk away.
---
To be fair, I think every RPG in the existance of the gaming era is about having bigger numbers.
---
It's not ping pong
---
Who cares if people use addons.... enjoy the game how you want buddy.
---
Hahaha nice! Thanks! Seeing this makes me happy 😁
---
You're partially right-- the magnetic field causes the static on the outside of the screen. But it can also mess with the colors displayed on the screen. The monitor would sometimes show color variance, or a "shadow". Degaussing would fix that, and reset the field.
---
Not much what's sap with you?
---
Thats crazy.  YOU THINK YOU DO!!!!!!
---
Exactly this, I find it funny tbh, horde is now the most popular faction yet (obviously most people are normal and dont really give a fuck about factions) all the edgelords still think they're the shit because they play horde. Without alliance your horde is pointless and vice versa.
---
Sounds like some bullshit honestly
---
Oh you classic hordies, never change you toxic cesspool of everything that is evil in online gaming, you :)
---

---
Just FAP lul
---
&gt; The people clearing mc in these raids you are watching are very experienced raiders.
---
Not all of them, as i said, some of them are already cleaned up by pugs.
---
&gt; Why would a raid want to bring someone who doesn't help the raid over someone who will contribute? 
---
Why would a raid would waste time to try to have a perfect optimized raid comp when he doesn't need it at all ?
---
Exact same situation here! I'm not really sure if I want to be part of a dedicated raid group but I'd really like to get this bow. It's cool how after the initial rag kill you can get the sinews from world drops or bosses at the cost of more farming time
---
No, you don't have to go through there if you literally swim out the bay and stay near the shore.
---
You need to turn autoloot on in the options, or you can add two lines in the macro to turn it on,do the action, turn it off, but frankly there's no good reason to NOT have autoloot on.
---
Meh. Combat leveling is less fun but I think it is more efficient than anything you could do through sub.
---
I like how you matched your pitch black outfit with the pitch black enviroment, very cool
---
Real question, why would removing a layer increase queue times?  Is the max number of people on a server just the max number of people allowed in a layer times the number of layers?  Was it spelled out like that?  I thought layers just spread people out, not increased the total capacity.  Phase 2 gonna be a nightmare...
---
Right, i enjoy PVE and i used to be a MC and BWL MT in vanilla.  I also PVPd but i just had to respec sometimes or PVP with a bunch of guildies and healers.  When we did it as a group we dominated.   
---
It all depends on what you enjoy but i don't think having 2 specs is the answer although maybe making it a bit cheaper to respect would be good.  
---
I like the idea of a high bar to be able to change specializations.  It makes a person really think about and consider the decision carefully instead of just bouncing around all over the place.   
---
High end raiding guilds HIGHLY valued how their tanks and healers were specced and even paid to have them specced that way.  I dunno, i just preferred it that way.
---
So sick of this statement. **Ganking low levels is not PvP.** I see way too many people saying this in order to justify their trolling behavior.
---
Look if you get your kicks out if killing lowbies that's fine. Everyone enjoys the game in their own way. But you cant pretend you're PvPing when one spell takes out your enemy and they cant even hit you back.
---

Mages are possibly the easiest enemy for me to kill aside from Warlock. I don't mind at all. All it takes is one good Windfury proc.
---
"Tanked" it twice. Wont be a third
---
This one should work

I am leveling as arms and simply switch to shield n 1 hander for when I tank. My gear is the same for the most part. In dungeons you want to make sure your group is focusing targets down. They give u a couple of seconds to build aggro. And use sunder armor. I have had no problems unless I have a bunch of DPS who unload all of their top spells on different mobs as soon as the fight starts.
---
It's a reference to this artifact of the Internet: [Cold Steel](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/teleports-behind-you-nothing-personal-kid)
---
I guess I don't see the problem. This is all part of the Classic WoW experience.  The exact same thing happened when the game first launched, there weren't nearly enough servers; except you also had to fight the servers lagging and crashing out on top of being full.
---
Does a duck with a boner drag weeds?
---
You still have the armory next door that you can rotate between the two.  Also, I don't know if each person is locked to 5 or if you can reset the group to reset your number of dungeons.
---
When it’s blue it’s in low power mode
---
I don't know about your specific server, but it's a pretty good bet that any PvP server is going to be tilted towards horde. They always were before, and every wow census result I've seen confirms they still are. The only real question is whether it's a slight 55/45 split, or a more extreme 65/35 split.
---
Paladins got it
---
1. Yes
---
2. Depends in my experience. If you get greater esssences, they usually sell pretty well. But if you get dust, you are probably better off just vendoring the item. Shards don’t sell well either.
---
3. AHs are all connected but you’re probably better off parking it in IF, just in case someone wants to trade with you, they’re more likely to be in IF.
---
They're soulbound as soon as you use them.
---
Wasn't talking about sub, was talking about ass

Interesting.  I  wonder what all that affected

Vudho works
---
yeah im not sure why they attacked me, I was fighting a different mob beside them, I'm playing warrior so i guess i could have battle shouted or something
---
I know this game isn't really easy. But I'm struggling super hard right now and stagnating off of it and it's taking the fun away, which I previously had a lot of.
---
 Is it supposed to be this hard?
---
 I'm lvl 20 NE druid, did all my quests in darkshore and got sent to ashenvale, however I almost die do every single mob and most of the quests are orange or red for me. I had a short stint in stone talon mountains which was a bit better but not that much. And after that it was back to getting my ass whooped in ashenvale. I'm glad I'm not on a PvP server, because most of the people I encounter there are horde. I have never played WoW before so I'm pretty sure I'm doing something wrong. I would love to get some insights as to what I can do better.
---
Is this from 2006?
---
Living that zero xp-waste life.
---
Right! I’ve been meaning to try an RP server. But right now I have 2 level 12s on different servers. So I’m really telling myself to play with those toons. 
---
But I can be down for some RP. Sounds fun.
---
Sodas team of autists raided all the way to darkshire
---
I was farming at redridge and get 1 shot by like 10 people
---
There is also a Keybind available to Interact with Target, and you can /target &lt;name&gt; and then press keybind.
---
I didn’t even know you could see opposing faction guild names while hostile
---
Try and do a /who on the name, if it's not up there it's probably an Enemy or NPC, also IRC the name+server for PM is with a dash and not underscore e.g. "Myname-Server"
---
Became and alc just for that baby. Fucking mages-War
---
Drew, c'mon bro. Just play the warrior. It's on the top of your character list.
---
I played a rogue in classic. Back then it was 17 into assassination and the rest in combat.
---
Yeah, I had to go up into the hills where the panthers/raptors are where the trolls are higher level and packed in closer together. Everywhere else was farmed out.
---
There were a few people killing trolls there, but it was enough to make the fighting easier and not so much that you had to sit around waiting for spawns.
---
If that was there intent, they should have made quest markers for NPCs green instead of yellow and should make you opening quests green. All of that being yellow definitely gives players the impression you’re supposed to be doing yellow quests.
---
Free action pots are hilarious in wpvp. 
---
Warrior charges me, instantly gets feared, and I wave and keep running to wherever I’m going.
---
Oh wait, I've just remembered a peculiar thing: there were some threads where people wanted to cover up undead bones on player characters client side, so they copied some chinese files that do this on their clients. So they must have an english-texted client that has some chinese fiddly-diddlies and maaaaaybe that somehow fucks with their demon names!
---
I don't sheep anything because paladins consecrate immediately and hunters volley and multishot and warriors cleave and whirlwind and warlocks and priest throw a dot on everything and you get the idea.
---
I just did the horde poison the dog quest and I was like wait, are we the baddies? I mean sure alliance are scum... but... torturing dogs?
---
Thats really interesting! A lot of what I have read and seen talks about how druids were forced into the role for the most part so that makes me really want to reconsider giving them a look! 
---
Also I know this time around we know how easy these first layers of content are and don't need optimal raids so I'm sure everyone is a lot more chill taking whatever.
---
I think Bigglesworth seems to be the tops at the moment.  It's big enough to be high pop all day, and only full at aroun 8-9pm EST.  When it is full it is less than 15 minutes wait.
---
Huh. Just a couple nights ago I wandered the Barrens as a mid 30s Gnome Mage licking every Tauren I could find.
---
Yeah, but there's better options for the debuff slots with 39 other people in the group. Curses, dots, shouts, all take up a slot. One paladin being a little more mana efficient isn't exactly priority #1
---
You're gonna be the one ragged after he milks you  ( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
---
5 agility 5 stam leather chest? ooo eee ahh ahh
---
They are still one faction only. He's probably on a reg server and popped himself pvp for whatever reason. You also get flagged if you buff someone who is marked pvp.
---
dude this is fucking awesome, I was wishing for something like this the other night when I was debating between finishing up Stonetalon or heading to Ashenvale and not knowing where was best for my level, this is exactly what I needed. Thanks!!
---
The real hero of the night was DELARYN, that Alliance Hunter somehow hid from the lot of us for more than an hour on the boat. You are the true winner.
---
Thank you for sharing the macro 🙌🏻
---
joke would be funny if it was actually an enemey with red nameplate.
---
What? Really?   
---
This fucking sucks. I was looking forward to the real vanilla experience of server vs server. Fighting the same players was awesome, people would get reputations for being very good (or bad).
---
Idk, the ability to cheese enemy spellcasters with Wards is pretty nice. I played my mage through a decent chunk of legion after a long break and I actually kind of forgot how much I missed having those kind of skills in my toolkit
---
Sounds like he thought you were afk and gonna get a free kill.  Once you moved he realized he was screwed.
---
I farmed the Murlocs outside Menethil Harbour.
---
I mean, if someone is within a level or two of me, I'll fight them happily, and I enjoy it. I'll even wait for them to heal up because I want a fair fight. But running around a zone looking to camp someone when you're with a group of over leveled for the zone toons is just ridiculous. It's like playing a game on easy setting, hell "toddler setting" even. Pvp servers are fun for the challenge of competing. It's not competing if an Olympic swimmer races against a toddler: it's a slaughter.
---
Maybe. Didn't seem that way from the video based on what their friends were saying.
---
Got my mount yesterday, it was such a rush!

Followed up with artisan cooking and fishing, and accidentally had enough raw spotted yellowtail to bring me to 293 cooking :D

These people don't seem to realize that a board room doesn't give a shit about their  classic experience.  This is just "new IP with surprising engagement statistics" to them. 
---
Find me a game lead willing to walk in front of that board room and say "alright guys,  our plan to increase subscription numbers now that we're out of original patches is to never update anything again" and I'll eat my fucking pants.
---
The messages are Blue.. whispers are Purple.. So I guess he added him to Battle.net and messaged him? Seems strange.
---
Instead of grinding out levels on mobs you can just switch zones. As you get further along you'll need to visit up to a couple of zones a level to avoid grinding mobs.
---
Or you can grind mobs, you do you.
---
Imagine playing alliance  LOL
---
Fun fact: if you get on a boat full of the opposing faction and they kill you as the boat leaves, the guards won’t touch them, and then you resurrect as soon as you get to the new area and they can kill you again, once again without any guard interference. Then when you run back to your body and resurrect, they can just laugh at you.

Keep in mind that "rare" doesn't really mean "unique", sometimes the opposite. Common skins like regular-ass Nightsabers often end up rarer to see as pets than highly sought-after beasts like Humar.

I randomly help kill mobs, save asses, give water, and buffs.  It's the polite thing to do!
---
&gt;Yeah, but respeccing to go PvP between raids was probably not covered by your guild.  
---
Nope, but the guild bank would usually pay to spec me BACK to prot if i had respecced myself to fury between MC or BWL runs. 
---
But that's the price i paid for being a highly valued tank in a high end guild.  Its something that most players didn't achieve.  Thats part of what makes raiding in vanilla so difficult yet so rewarding, its one of the sacrifices.    
---
Imho having one spec puts a LOT of value on the individual members of the guild and their abilities. (i am speaking in the context of an end-game guild)  
---
Don't get me wrong, i can see what you are saying AND why you are saying it.  
---
I just feel differently is all.  It doesnt mean one of us is right or wrong, we just view it differently.  I am very curious about how they will go about patching and adding content of this reboot after the initial updates are done such as BWL, AQ and Naxx.  I wonder if they will implement something like you are talking about.

You better get used to providing food and water for people on demand without any please or thanks once you get to 40 man raids.  It's a pretty established standard to just open trade with a mage when you need it.  There's just too much shit going on to waste time with the pleasantries.  In fact,  when I first started raiding I always asked nicely for it,  and the mages would always tell me "just open trade next time, dont bother asking".

Just hit 39. Been spending gold a ton and am at 22g. Any good places for a 39 mage to solo farm? I'd like to have a mount tomorrow or the next day from grinding. At this point I won't be spending any money except for gear repairs and flights
---
I try to split my time evenly between running around questing in the world and running dungeons.  Keeps it from feeling too grindy.
---
I think I'd jump off the pier and try to swim under it if I saw this.
---
Ill take a pupa card thanks
---
Hey guys &amp; gals! What is the fastest way to get a friend up in levels? Iam 45 and he's 10, he started late due to vacations and is a tad too lasy to grind levels on his own...
---
Is dungeon speeding viable to boost him? Thanks!
---
Once you get cooking you essentially kill 3 mobs at a time. Fear one, vw tanks the dotted targets and you keep him on whatever you are shadow bolting.
---
Basically, but trolling is done for fun, not monetary gain.
---
Do you need dragon for black dragonscale gear? If so there’s a market.
---
I want to roll a druid but the pvp doesn't look too fun and is going to be a big part of my time at 60
---
56 with no bank alt checking in

Shield Slam?
---
It wasn't that way when the game released. They added it after about a year. You must have just missed the memo.

\*Hello

I'd definitely get into a tank and spank with her
---
What add-on are you using for the extra stat breakdowns on the right?
---
Hey again, still having trouble with the Mara farm. Goblin and princess dead easy now, but I can’t get Rotgrip down as he tears through voidie in about 10-15 secs. I’m about 2/3 prebis and am/ ruin. Any ideas?
---
Ah yeah I guess that'd make sense. At the very least he had to agree to it I suppose?
---
Quite a few - here was a picture last night at 10:35 EST:
---
https://i.redd.it/2p0pbly0t2m31.png
---
But... the nipples have rotted off.
---
Could this have been an honest mistake?  Perhaps the gnome saw a red npc and thought he was assisting some lower-levelled horde by attacking it? 
---
It doesn't make sense that he would attack that, as he's at half health with a Rez Sickness Debuff. Gnomes are supposed to be smart....
---
I will give my perspective on this. I played exclusively PVP from vanilla 2004 until I quit retail in ~2011 and again briefly 2014-2015. I enjoyed the endgame mass pvp battles that occurred, I didn't even mind being ganked while leveling too much when I was a teenager/early 20s.
---
 Now that I am older, full time job, wife, baby, house to maintain, etc I just don't have much time to play the game. If I have ~1 hour to play before bed or before work I don't want to spend the majority of the time as a ghost running to my corpse because someone higher level than me gets his kicks from killing lower level players. I don't even know if I plan on sticking around for months and months so this is may very well be my entire experience with classic leveling from 1-60. I may not even get to 60, gear up and enjoy the mass pvp battles I used to like so why would I want to have a worse experience?  I am enjoying the hell out of pve servers right now, I still do the odd pvp, but I can choose when to pvp. If I just want to pick some flowers for 20 minutes I can pick flowers for 20 minutes and don't have to watch my back the entire time. To some people this might be missing the point, but for me this is what I wanted to do in classic. Many people agree with this which is why pve servers are not all low and dead, they are high/full.
---
The way to level lock once you get your spells is by doing two and three target pulls though....
---
that's why you have stuns, and crippling poison.
---
but I mean, backstab is a thing on retail too, and sub rogues are played in pvp as far as I know.
---
you cant just stay facing the rogue forever.
---
I did.
---
People just love to shame any chance they get on the internet
---
&gt; I think you can tell from this thread that *most people* just have everyone roll need on any BOE blue or anything higher than that 
---
I'm not sure tbh. This thread is about "is ninja punishable?" (and it's not) so the first comments are about that. The comments about "everyone should roll need on a boe blue" seem to get more downvotes than upvotes.
---
I'm playing on a french server so it's probably not representative of what happens on US servers but here everyone roll greed on BoE blue. The ones that roll need are the one who equip it right away which i'm fine with.
---
The biggest EVE Online channel I was ever spoke to in Mumble (iirc) and had upwards of 2000 people in it
---
Yeah about a week. Started 2 days ago. Oh well.
---
Alright, you're a locksmith
---
It's more that people on the West Coast are starting to get off work and log in.  6EST is 3PST and the server time is PST, I believe.
---
The problem on my server is not the faction split (it's about 60% horde, 40% alliance), but rather the faction attitude. From what I've seen, horde are ready to fight at a moment's notice, and ready to back each other up. Alliance, on the other hand, are timid. I've been attacked not 50 feet from an ally and seen them run away rather than get involved.
---
For first phase or two - hemorrhage+eviscerate.  It shreds.

Winrar is being a lil bitch and won't work without purchase and I'm sure as hell not purchasing

Back in vanilla my brother was playin' a Warr and he'd tank Undead and Live Strat w/his Arcanite Reaper. As awesome as that weapon is I got soooo annoyed cause every damn charge pull he had a charge macro where he'd yell, "Arcanite Reaper...HOOOOOOO!"
---
&gt;  Barely take damage,
---
True, but they can be crit tho.
---
You need to talent into Tactical Mastery (Arms Tree) to keep at least 25 rage when changing stances.
---
Is there a way for me to move the combat / drop logs outside of my chat?
---
I hate how it shows up in the same chat as my normal chat.
---
Okay so for those of yall wondering what my settings are, I went in to take a quick vid and just show everything and the difference it makes, but it won't show the overlay, and for some reason i couldn't take screenshots either. 
---
So that being said please refer to this awful picture of my setting from my phone,

Then watch this so you can see the difference it makes, it's worth. Idk why I had to do this so werid btw no idea why it's not showing up.

Whey? Gaze?
---
Yep this. Had a guy the other day ask me my played time and when I said how long he replied “damn you afk or something?” And I said no I just enjoy the quest and do a lot of explorering and grouping. And he said yeah I’m level 30 just got here in a day and some change. I think I was 32.
---
hell yeah, but like top comment. that glare tho
---
Yeah that's the layering for ya even with it nerfed with so many people phasing away from combat  it creates faction heavy layers
---
Pre level 50 it doesn't really matter, the tanks job is to save the healer mostly. Especially before 30 it's damn near impossible for the tank to hold everything, and it just slows down the run if everyone waits 5sec every time. Just don't run away from the tank if you get aggro, run to him.
---
Same for me, I play mage on Golemagg
---
DO YOU UNDERSTAND!?
---
Subtlety can work if you're a patient leveler. But your burst is strictly tied to you being stealthed and BEHIND the mob, which means there's gonna be downtime spent positioning yourself correctly and waiting on your Distract cooldown if it's down. If you can do this, you might end up killing a single mob faster than combat.
---
Tip: After the first wipe say in chat "alright now that the first wipe is out of the way we can do this". It elps to immediately resolves the tension
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I'm over here killing ally while my horde is fighting amongst themselves 😭
---
Used to think need if you need, greed if you sell. But I'm starting to think just need on these rare, expensive items. As a different comment alludes too, why should that class the item drops for automatically get to have the item?
---
I was also in SM Cath and blue BoE robes dropped and everyone greeded but the priest needed, they asked and I said if it's an upgrade - fair game. Well, we were talking after the dungeon and they decided to fill the remaining group members in on their BoE World epics that they got earlier... One being a robe faaar better than the blue they just 'needed'. Has me not trusting anyone now who 'needs' a rare BoE drop.
---
I’m at 35 and feeling the burn lol
---
stealth isn't all that effective against a warlock or priest who knows their shit in world pvp. first off, you're going to have DoTs and you, so even if you kill them, no stealth - and in case of a warlock, say hello to soulstone. for the same reason, they have a bad habit of taking you with them, and returning faster to their corpse... then all you need is a "/cast Shadow Word: Pain (or warlock equivalent) [rogue name]" macro, set to an easily spammable key, so the moment the rogue resurrect, there's already a DoT on them, denying stealth... and let the corpsecamping shenanigans begin.
---
I wasn’t going to since the op didn’t seem to know who she was but someone already did...oh well
---
There lowering the cap. They said they want a more or less linear decrease from launch to phase 2 where there will only be 1.
---
I think you should try a hunter.
---
All of the advice that people are giving is great, but one thing I used to do when tanking in vanilla, is literally just tab target then sunder armor, tab, sunder, tab, sunder etc. It works pretty well if you have the rage for it.
---
What’s the joke?
---
I'm pretty sure originally there was only a single AH for each faction (Org, and IF). A later patch in Classic did bring them to all cities. I forget which patch though. But Ironforge used to be the main Alliance hub because of the AH, until eventually Stormwind got one.
---
And yet:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10004/shadoweave-robe#taught-by-npc

Not here! It’s just inconsistent!

And the equipment would be much better presented like so: see the ‘Bonuses’ section 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Justiciar_armour
---
your definitely wrong about point 1, druids excel at tank healing, also you failed to mention the biggest advantage to feral tanks which is superior TPS. Source: ive mained a druid across 2 servers clearing all content including KT as resto, feral tank and feral dps.
---
Yeah, you can
---
Set rolling rules ahead of the dungeon.  That way everyone has a clear understanding on rolling.  I would state this especially if an upgrade BoE drops for anyone.
---
I already tried both. All I see is just the top menu. I don't see the + icon for more options.
---
It's strange.
---
You only ever roll need without question on stuff your current class and build uses. You can need stuff for off-spec or alt if you ask and the party's fine with it, and rolling for sale or to give to some other player is greed by definition. Whether it's BoE or not has no bearing on it. 
---
Kick that mage and blacklist him for ninja looting.
---
They're not red, so it's not the opposing faction.
---
Fastest leveling: Frost Mage/Frost Mage &gt; Warlock/Priest &gt; Warrior/Healer &gt; Druid (Feral or Resto)/Rogue
---
Most Viable at Raiding/Dungeons: Warrior/Healer &gt; Druid (Feral)/Rogue &gt; Druid (Resto)/Rogue
---
Most Fun: Warlock/Priest &gt; Druid/Rogue
---
Theres an item you can use that will kill you in flight so you die in the zone and res there. 
---
It is called the crystal of zinmalor
---
One of the biggest shockers for me was the amount of weapons with no stats on them in MC.  I swear I remember most blues by 50 having something on them.
---
Only truly rose tinted surprise so far I think.
---
I am a feral druid.
---
I guess I gotta find new zones then, I'm in no rush but I prefer questing over grinding.
---
Dual wield tanking actually was/is a thing too late game once raids are on farm
---
I assumed it was people in retail. If you google topping they say like 1g for portals 10g crafting a 100g if epics
---
You ALWAYS go all the way in the ass, people may say that other options are better but nothing compares with the fun, joy and glory to stick to the ass.
---
Keep an eye out on the AH I managed to get all three whelps for like... 50g... seems a lot at the moment but they can go for up to 500g on some servers.
---
Everyone is selling low at the moment to afford mounts. If you need a whelp now is the time without grinding :)
---
Thats a Straight up shit advice. Druids got a massive buff for tanking in 1.12 before that they sucked, which is why druid tanks didnt exists in original. This time we are in the 1.12 patch from the start and druid tanks are amazing for most Things. People also got a lot more knowledge about everything, så people realized that druid tanks are very good now.
---
That’s really not numerically true.
---
It's not even close to the same thing. 
---
The corrupted blood thing was hotfixed when Vanilla was live. 
---
Classic WoW is not a version of WoW that needs to be fixed (unless of course something deviates from what it was actually like, back in the day). 
---
Why is that? Classic WoW is not a new game. It is a recreation. *ideally* it should be recreated with all its warts. Infernal Fire AoE aura is one such wart.
---
same i leveled my professions and an alt a bit just to change the routine a little bit. I still focus on my main but i can go back to my alt if im burned from those quest/zone
---
Troll mage of course. Ill update the original post
---
I saw him doing it in Org as well. The reason that I found it creepy and sad is because we are not on an RP server.
---
I haven't done it personally so I can't give advice from experience, but I have heard that warlocks only really solo princess and the goblin. Avalanche is possible but not very consistent or time efficient and rotgrip isn't possible or at least too hard to be consistent. Hunters supposedly can do rotgrip, but not warlocks afaik.
---
They also re-added mark of the wild as a pvp talent, so I didn't pick the 2 best abilities to use as an example.
---
Well met!
---
\*10 lvls above my friends who I started day 1 with\*
---
 YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS BEHIND
---
Yeah. But a lock with stam focus will be next to impossible though. Even with fear immunity.
---
It’s flaired as Humor just because it was funny seeing him take down the leader of a huge raid and them having no clue what happened lol
---
Just received the Skeletal club, lvl 19 blue mace. Should I hold to sell on AH for battlegrounds?
---
ive honestly given up trying to sheep in dungeons unless they ask for it.
---
they \*always\* break it
---
I have 7g at level 30. Seems like everyone I ask has more around 25g or something?
---
What am I missing? I haven't been buying all the skills, just the ones needed.
---
Is everyone doing a lot more dungeons than me for gold? I haven't bought anything on the AH yet, but I haven't really sold much besides cloth...
---
Then they should do that instead of forming groups if that’s important to them.
---
Complaining about getting ganked is purely a PvP experience therefore the right to complain and vent about said frustration is wholely part of leveling on a PvP server. 
---
If people don’t like the complaining then they can move to a PvE server where it doesn’t exist. 
---
This started as a sarcastic comment but it makes too much sense so. Yeah.
---
Even in zg/aq20 you can generally not care too much  as everything will generally be slow as molasses because well.. you're pulling large enough groups that someone is going to blizzard.
---
Search for a UI import string for ElvUI, I currently use one Bellular posted in a video about his UI a few months ago. I imported it and tweaked it to my liking.
---
This. I accepted one of those incites once to see a 5 man group. Okay sure 5 people = more tags. Oh its not on free for all so we're literally all running together in a tight cluster so we can loot when its our turn rather than spread out so we're about as efficient as 1 person. Nope i dont wanna spend 3 hours on this quest thanks.
---
But you can beat Ashzara at base difficulty without greens, right?
---
They changed the content scaling scheme.  Mythic is designed specifically to have to play previous raids, with numbers constantly being increased.  
---
Ragnaros and Onyxia were the normal raid back then, and the later raids in the progression were 'mythic'.  Comparing two different content progression designs here.
---
I felt the same up until I got my mount then felt reinvigorated. No more walking slowly between quest hubs - that's my main burnout. Doing 2 quests in Arathi then realising I can't come back for another two/three levels as i'm too low. Mount makes it feel much quicker to do that.
---
Struggling
---
Desolace, Hillsbrad, then eventually into Badlands
---
 you have to handle it each group as it comes. I do bring it up at the very beginning of a dungeon, or whatever happens happens, and you decide from there if you want to play with those people in the future or not.
---
Well, if the average player can get to level 60 in about 12 days played, and you play 3 hours a day, you could theoretically get to 60 in 96 days real time! You have plenty of time to play any of the characters and get them to 60 with time for endgame content too!
---
Think the comment was intended to be him talking as you.
---
I see the resemblance
---
I know it looks frosty - which I love anyways. But I assure you, it was mage Brita filtered water from the fridge
---
How is heartseeker..
---
Im really wanting to move but still debating it, Faerlina is such a great server.
---
Hello fellow rattlegorian!
---
THANKS!
---
Wow such trash. If it's not for your class or it's not an upgrade, roll greed. Leave the " ermahgerd everyone needs gold" in retail.
---
I am a known altaholic in every MMO i play, so its truly a wonder that ill hit 40 tonight on my mage while only barely making 1 alt (got a priest to 13 to level with some new warriors in guild, they steamrolled ahead so I havent touched it since). Leveling is much more of the experience in vanilla, so dont feel ashamed of going slow because youre leveling multiple characters. Especially if youre doing different profs on all of them and leveling those up,  itll be a huge boon later to have your own alchemist, tailor, enchanter, etc all on your character select screen.
---
I didn't say no one had done me a favor in over a decade, I said I haven't personally seen that gaming community in a while. I am not condemning all of humanities gaming community, or saying that it's not there, simply that in my experience I have not seen it like it was when we played Vanilla.
---
arcanite reaper
---
lmao some people are so ridiculous with the loot thing and whether to need or greed.
---
now i feel good about that quest
---
As somebody who did most of the bosses in MC as a bear tank, I use this analogy: 
---
Warrior = hitting a rock with a stick
---
Druid = hitting a sponge with a pickaxe
---
The warrior is going to just outright block more, but the Druid is going to take those big crits and shrug them off. Most of the time.
---
As wiz said. No hk in this phase.
---
How disrespectful.
---
But 1 agi = 2 ap for hunters afaik.
---
I believe you can also swim far enough away from Darkshore coast that the same thing happens, you die and show up in Westfall.
---
Good mages own hunters and rogues. Bad mages will get utterly destroyed by us. That's what I meant. All the band wagon retail to classic converts saw that mage was (arguably) the highest damage pve and (arguably) the best pvp class, so naturally they are all playing mage. And since all of them are so used to spamming dungeons in retail, the spam dungeons in classic too. If you lvl up doing only dungeons, you never figure out how to play against other classes in pvp. It all makes sense really. Now of course there are good and great mages out there who aoe dungeon grinded, they are just the minority!
---
He played every expansion tho

Drop the 5 points from Holy Power and put them in Anticipation

You might want to run deadmines too after getting some of the quests :)

I always found ff14 was more chill and more emphasis on visuals. I played black magse, samurai, monk, and paladin so maybe those were the easy classes but man it was brain dead

I just looked, 1200 lvl 10, 1150 lvl 11, 1160 lvl 12, 950 lvl 13 etc. seems to add up to me?

---
There are a couple of ways to go about this efficiently, but you'll want to try some out and see how they work for you. 
---
1. Setup a macro to assist your tank.  At the start of the dungeon target your tank and type /focus. Then this macro should work
---
   1. \#showtooltip attack  
---
/assist focus
---
2. Use target's target in the default UI to see what your party memeber is attacking.  In your game settings  (I think under gameplay or display) there is an option for "Show Target's Target" or something like that.  If you enable this you should be able to quickly target your tank and see what he's attacking quickly.
---
Let me introduce to the Human Being
---
I was not so lucky.  Left stv because it was 5-1 ganking so figured I'd go north.
---
Maybe you are running a outdated version? If not try loading your UI without it and then reload it again  with it
---
Depends on what you mean by viable. It's possible but you're making it way slower and harder for yourself.
---
Damn very sorry to hear pal, hope you get well and can leave hospital soon! Not really qq'ing lol this is a meme, tagged as humor, and not meant to be taken too seriously :P
---
I probably would. Not being able to do it is the largest deterrent of people engaging with a form of media. It’s a stupid question honestly. I’d think that most people who are able to play piano enjoy it, and most that aren’t able to gave up and got frustrated before they got to a point where they were able to enjoy it.
---
I don’t like reading books, because they take too long, which is directly related to me not being a “good reader” and read slower than others who enjoy reading.
---
Its not unfair, or even personal. I don’t go around finding people who don’t like games and tell them they suck either, but when someone engages me and says “why do you play games ur an adult” it’s usually someone who can’t play games competitively/fully

Yeah i got that as soon as i could, it made things better, but im still struggling. Alright, bouncing around zones it is then!

Not completely true, there are some tailoring items that are BOP once crafted.
---
I feel like an actual upgrade should take priority over needing for gold, but you can't really enforce that with pugs
---
Voidwalkers in classic look so much cooler than retail for some reason. Maybe my graphic settings are just low
---
This is disgusting and I love it. Can't believe how simple that macro is and yet how much utility it offers.
---
I can tell that you completely missed the point.   
---
Whether you want to admit it or not the difference between the current Retail community and the community that existed in Vanilla 15 years ago are worlds apart. What OP is saying is exactly what I have seen and experienced also. To attest to the OP i'd like to add that I haven't added an in-game character to my friends list in almost 10 years of playing WoW. In the first week of playing Classic I have added 10+ players to just my in-game friend list because the community in Classic IS that much better than any other major gaming community out there. The majority of people are playing Classic because they WANT to play Classic and they WANT to re emulate the community that was so amazing 15 years ago.

But even so, that isn’t that user friendly, maybe your just used to it, but come it to this and tell me how you feel:

I saw them in 2001 but they were significantly worse for gaming. They had low resolutions, poor refresh rates, poor color accuracy, and a ton of ghosting. In 2000 we had CRTs that ran 1600x1200 at 100 Hz. LCDs were a step backward for a long time.

If you're on an RP server using a non-RP name or if the name is purposely offensive you'll get a name change sooner or later.

PvP is not about relying on chances, it is doing the best with what you have.  The procs help but don't rely on it.  A 1/5 chance to proc on a cooldown ability is good but if you are find mana is your biggest issue, use your talents to help in that area.

trust me, you're gonna be backstabbing a shitton

He's saying alot of people that play specs that are better in pvp than pve join guilds to get loot for that spec and then gquit once they are geared so they can pvp.

Hi Hamster, I can understand your concern but worry not, this isn't anything like that. It merely organizes the sea of LFG posted by people so you can easily find the group that's right for you!

Something like this for deep prot:

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVzxzZVZxizsx0zio
---
This goes for improved revenge, but could also put those talents in improved sunder. This build also adds the utility of improved shield bash, which will come in handy in dungeons, but you could put those points elsewhere.
---
In arms definitely want anger management. I added a point in improved charge to help with opening the pull with charge. Then some extra points leftover to decide.
---
Honestly you can do with fewer points in prot too. Baseline in prot is probably this:

I suspect that, contrary to modern cynicism, classic is going to start growing its player base. If you look at the history of player numbers, they were growing fastest in Vanilla and BC. There's plenty of conclusions to draw from this, right or wrong, but one this is very clear: classic has the potential to increase player count. Compare it with BFA and Legion (which people generally liked) the numbers were estimated to continue dropping the whole time after the respective launches. These two expasions did not have this potential. Lots of people will decry that the commercial landscape has changed and that players want instant gratification these days. Blizz execs will probably be the loudest such voices behind closed doors. But if they could've made BFA grow, they would have. If this was the correct evaluation of the market, it would've worked by now. I bet you history will repeat itself and Classic will start steadily growing because it's the kind of game people want to go back and play more and more of.
---
Shimmering flats is good at early 30s.  Lots of quests all nearby each other and the terrain is extremely easy to navigate.  Good for a quick level at least.   Make sure you grab the FPs in Thalanaar and Gadetzan while you're out there.

As a melee DPS I would wait until you are 33-34 before heading to STV.

What areas would consider the best for aoe farming gold, grays and cloth?
---
I know that, I am arms at the moment. But as I said, I'm getting up there and looking to switch.
---
Aaaah, nothing like waiting for years to go back to vanilla only to circumvent everything about classic with exclusionary streamer blasted power leveling strats....
---
&gt;XD
---
&gt;Cringy
---
This is actually a pretty good throwback to 2004 when you think about it.
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
The guy added him, then he wanted to see what he’d say. Why are you acting like this is some conspiracy theory? 😂😂
---
there are like 2 classes in vanilla, they're all mainstream
---
OP you need to get better at healing.
---
This isn't a tank problem, its a you are using inefficient heals or are overhealing massively.
---
You need to play better.
---
Sweeping strikes should help you out a lot, sweep an execute from a low mob onto a full health to bring into execute range / hit real hard
---
Spirit is obviously a priority. Just like I've clarified earlier this isn't something that is happening every time I run a dungeon but sometimes people are asses so I wrote a post about it. Usually mana isn't a problem.
---
Especially when mounted. "Okay I can run right by this mob no problem right?" One hit dazed, proceed to get followed halfway across the zone while running at 50% speed.
---
Leveling 2 characters at once? Masochist
---
Do /join LookingForGroup thats the built in one. /join lfg is player made. Whenever the current admin logs out it switches to a random person. This can be kinda volatile because they can ban people and theres no way to unban them. It only takes one asshole to get admin to blacklist the whole server. Just use the blizz created one.
---
I feel like I'm "hardcore," but I only lvl 40. People who are 60 and already doing MC. /Clap
---
It's possible that a GM might be able to help you.
---
A lot of people don't. I am not one, but there are many.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
As Kelosh said, you can just macro.
---
On my hunter I used
---
 #showtooltip Hunter's Mark
---
/petattack
---
/cast Hunter's Mark
---
yeah I also tank with ravager but some groups insist...
---
If you kill young tigers and panthers in STV they have a high drop rate for bristly whiskers which vendors for 7.33s and then you can also farm leather on top of that
---
I just realized people dont know basic things like that the other day.  Said I was lfg for something and someone whispered "tank?"....and I'm a rogue.
---
Classic as a whole is 1.13, that's not related to the phases. I'm pretty sure it was added in 1.7 but I'm unsure if it's active yet, I'm guessing not.
---
Hello! I'll run through my first dungeon ever today: Deadmines. I'm a level 20 Gnome Mage. Any tips? What should I know and what do I need to bring?
---
Appreciate the help!
---
anywhere just hear the stealth sound
---
Got the alert on my phone “tornados imminent, seek shelter “. I decided I had enough WoW for the evening. Lost power 5 min later.
---
At least now you know they do it from behind
---
I also don't care enough.
---
&gt;How did they get away with that?
---
What do you mean? Have you ever played GTA? What are they even getting away with? I am so confused.
---
Pls follow me
---
omg, 2 key binds, its too much to handle!
---
Yea I was killing quest NPCs and vendors in Crossroads on my rogue last night. ‘‘Twas glorious.
---
&gt; blizzard said in a blue post that Medium servers are the same as very high population vanilla servers a few months ago.
---
They said medium pop servers have more players than the most populated vanilla servers.

And that was during name reservations, not after release when the values were adjusted.
---
And I love his videos
---
yeah i decided not lose my job or get divorced so im only like level 20. To be fair though I'm leveling a prot warrior
---
Huh, how interesting. Never knew it worked like this in WoW, thanks.
---
Technically higher ranked FNs do more damage but while leveling, its better to conserve mana and cast rank 1 than try to eek out a few more dps
---
hey believe what you want. its simple as that i killed him on my pally he added me right after and opened up with the N world. camped him on my hunter and he kept it up not much to say there. if i was on my home PC i would have recorded the whole thing.
---
Do Stonetalon. Get 115 from Briarthorn in the first area, then you can get Steelbloom at 115.
---
Can also get to 115 in the barrens from Briarthorn.
---
I did, and what you're saying is wrong.
---
&gt;Layers are only opened when the current layer has reached it's threshold, not the server's threshold.
---
Also Felwood, Searing Gorge and Azshara.
---
So the 2-3% of druids out there are smiling smugly...
---
believe it or not, rogues, hunters, and druids can makes groups too
---
I play on Atiesh and i havent ran into a queue in awhile but it has been constantly at high and i could see it getting a queue again.
---
=P
---
I can feel his anxiety growing.
---
You got 120 bucks to throw him?
---
So i went to the harvest festival outside org, but didnt see any quests? what gives?
---
I saw a hunter that tamed Grubby(a pig you gotta kill for a quest in Red Ridge). It was actually pretty call and my addon marked the pet for the quest so overall I cared.
---
"low level plainstrider". The low level plainstrider isn't hostile.
---
"LFM &lt;dungeon&gt;. Cleave is stupid AF. Play the damn game."
---
More points
---
It's also one of the most camped areas in an otherwise fairly free zone. I think a lot of the basic guides funnel players there, plus the dreamdust quest, ao you'll end up making more gold and XP killing literally anything else in the swamps. I reccomend the squishy Swamp Things, chance to drop rare herbs, low armour, and they don't hit very hard.
---
then it should be dropping any time now.. lol
---
Thanks so much for this wicked guide! One issue I found is that there can't be spacing between the spell name and the parentheses that include the rank. They should read "Healing Touch(Rank #)". Looks like its just an issue with your Button 1 macro.
---
For me transmog destroys immersion. Gear just becomes stats and part of the excitement of getting good loot is the appearance of it which is sort of lost when you can transmog
---
EGBERT, PICK UP THE CAN ON YOUR SIDE OF THE STRING.
---
Always need on BoE.
---
Opposing faction is purple if they are not pvp enabled.
---
Thanks for the build. That looks close to what I was aiming for, though I'll probably take one point out of tactical mastery and pick up piercing howl. I fucking love piercing howl.
---
Just curious, is improved revenge not desirable? I figured a fairly common 3 second stun would be good in 5 mans.
---
Was stunned to have to wait in a queue for a bit last night, pretty awesome though
---
I can't speak for the accuracy of the recommended items but I've seen this site mentioned a lot: https://sixtyupgrades.com/
---
Correct, but there are many in the Classic community that are saying that the Classic community is golden and the best community in gaming. That is incorrect.
---
Oh shit, didn't think I would get a response. Awesome thank you!
---
Ohhhh that makes too much sense.
---
What is the Horde/Ally population. Right now Skeram is 70% Horde and it sucks.
---
10/10 post
---
Hahaha, TFW my own freaking guild gets featured on reddit. :)
---
We took a vote on names. This one was the clear winner.
---
It is an opinion though, or at least the looking like shit part. It’s definitely over saturated but I think it works well with the whole fantasy setting. I personally think it looks better than stock.
---
Dude you are obviously doing something horribly wrong. You should easily be able to pull nonstop in dungeons if you are a good healer.
---
Stop blaming other people and get good.
---
There is almost as many warlocks and we're not quite as wanted in dungeons/raids. My guild has more active warlocks than mages, actually. You'll be fighting for gear either way; play what you like more.
---
It should just translate what it can and replace what it can't with "??" instead of giving you a big nope when it can't do part of the translation.
---
I lost DKP for this
---
Nothing worse than being a mage and people in your dungeon group go “give me water mage.”
---
Awesome, thank you for the advice! I will try that. I was thinking of doing all the low level - mid level quests in Ashenvale and group up for BFD, think that would work as well?
---
I'm well aware of the 5 second rule. As I've stated earlier this isn't something that is happening every dungeon run. It happens rarely but it's enough to piss me off. If a tank runs a 2h and pulls groups of 5+ elites because they are in a rush you often wind up spamming a mana effective heal during the entire fight which leaves no time for mana regen.
---
That's not at all what he asked for.
---
Nah, it's only burned down in game after you do the burning of teldrassil quest, I'm p sure.
---
Man I did BFD last night and I told the group to not touch the candles when we were still pulling the trash around Kelris.  I always assume everyone else is an idiot who just picked up the game 10 minutes before we grouped.
---
The same reasons warriors are the only tank.  If you’re making the perfect raid group with 40 full-time dedicated people decked in BiS maybe you won’t use this over something else.  I was a pally OT through aq40, we had a bear MT, ret pally, shadow priest, even oomkin, things get used differently in this case, and having 1 paladin cover the healing of two allows you to take off-spec people.  I’m here to have fun, not micro manage 40 people to perfection for world first raid boss kills.
---
Go into your game folder and delete all your add-ons and try launching again?
---
Hmm mostly upset because he was doable on unofficial servers. Oh well

---
Cloak of Shadows isn’t in Classic
---
Gotta grind that cloth now.
---
Everyone’s missing the point. Yes, she’s Onyxia and she’s looking out for her own interests.
---
But the comparison to retail is what stands out here, where everyone calls you ‘Hero’ and treats you like a god.
---
It’s better storytelling that many NPCs talk down to you in classic. Being under-estimated or mistreated is a great motivator.
---
Alliance side? It was *much* more expensive last night (~90s per charm). 
---
Anyway, for all the other reasons stated I doubt I'll bother; I'm hitting dungeons as soon as I log in.
---
Why do you have one single toon......
---
Yo bro if you go just north of the cave of yetis, right be where the AB battlematsers are, keep going north and you'll run into the alteric valley yetis, they're a little bit higher level, but muuuuch easier to farm for yeti fur
---
Hey guys :) This is my first time ever playing WoW. I am currently a level 13 rogue. When choosing my professions, I decided to go with mining and engineering.  I like mining as I see its potential in making gold , however, I'm not into engineering that much since I'm not really looking to do any PvP at the moment and don't see how it would suit me in any other way. So, my question, should I keep leveling up engineering (already level 50) or switch it to something else whilst it is still early
---
&gt; If you are at the beach and playing WoW, then you went to the beach to play WoW.
---
Uh, no? If you are at the beach and playing WoW and do nothing except play WoW the entire time, then sure, you went to the beach to play WoW. If you are on a vacation at the beach and spend an hour out of your day playing WoW you aren't at the beach to play WoW.
---
&gt; I'm not "stretching" to make that connection, you're just in denial about it.
---
No, you're definitely stretching. You may not be bright enough to see that, though.
---
Is engineering worth it?
---
I'm levelling a warlock and cant decide on professions.
---
Tailor + Mining/Skinning
---
Tailor + Enchanting
---
Engineering / Mining
---
All the cool gadgets just seem to have incredibly long cooldowns, but it might be worth it for the stun bombs for pvp?
---
What bugs me the most about this is, as a geographic realist when it comes to fantasy worlds, if Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms are supposed to be on opposite sides of the world, why are there no ports on the **eastern coast** of Eastern Kingdoms? Why do ships from Darnassus travel all the way around the top of Kalimdor to get through to Menethil? Surely a harbor built on the other side of the cliffs from Nethergarde or one built on the coast of the Swamp of Sorrows would be extremely beneficial.
---
Classic left this impression that the two continents were only half of the world and then Blizzard changed that halfway through. I always had fantasies back then about what was on the other side, new continents, new races, new civilizations and enemies. They could have done everything they've done with WoW to date the same way except made it all one gigantic continent on the other side of the world.
---
In reality I just think WoW would have been better served with one huge expansion rather than several small ones. I understand that Vanilla took years to develop, but Blizzard left so much wiggle room in the original geography to add shit to while they could have been working on a much larger expansion the entire time. We could have had Karazhan in Vanilla, and all of the Cata stuff. Northrend was obviously a necessity because it was already established lore. But now it's all so uncreative. "Heres a new set of islands we didnt know existed until today go explore them oh yeah theres already established Alliance and Horde cities and bases here but dont worry about that too much."
---
Instead Blizzard killed WoW with a million cuts by incrementally increasing the power every couple of years and making everything before current content irrelevant. Imagine a game where you had dozens of max level zones, all added in slowly over time, rather than 1 or 2 max level zones per expansion with all of the past ones made completely irrelevant because your character is a god now.
---
Your home or delving into despicable foul practices. Choose one
---
I've done SFK plenty of times. The trick is getting through wetlands and Arathi or bypassing them both by swimming. Once you get the Southshore flight path, it's just a matter of crossing half of Hillsbrad and Silverpine.
---
Scarlet Monestary's easily the worst though. It's either a hike from Southshore or trying to make it through Western Plaguelands.
---
Sorry, but I've experienced it first hand.  It does happen.
---
I love it, same with a mage rounding them up then things going tits up.
---
If you join this chat prepare for lf mage.

I had a 41 rogue and 42 Druid gank and camp me last week when I was 29 with my rogue. I am  now 51and they are 44. I have friend who play their faction. I make sure to find their location and gank and camp them once a day. I’ll do this for the rest of classic. GOD I LOVE THIS GAME!!!

I decided to transfer over there last night. Most people are in the low zones still but I saw enough LFG gen chat to suggest. I'd consider this server to be on par with like day 2-3 of the official release.  Most of the people are just going to start new toons and level that way. Give it a few days to get everyone out to proper levels.   
---
\~Fausty, Orc Shamwow
---
I would keep it until twinkling is more prevalent. Might fetch a higher price
---
And at level 10, which is the lower end of Alliance players in that region.
---
I am honored with the faction.  My server is one of the newer ones so nothing moves on the AH, if it does your pretty much giving it away just above  the vendor price of the item.  I have two banks with stacks of stuff that would more then get me there but no way to move it. 
---
Guess I'll get my grind on.   I read a couple days ago Swamp of Sorrows is a good place for making money off grey drops.  While I can confirm the items were nice value, there are a ton of horde NPCS that randomly roam and aggro you.   As a result you get flagged and for me a near by Horde group hands your ass to ya. lol. 
---
This is my first time on a PVE server. I was all about PVP back in the day but now end game it's almost entirely based on who has better gear.   So I went PVE.   After making my corpse run I realized just how fortunate I am to not have to deal with that much any more but more importantly being able to pick PVE talents for efficiency for the first time.  It's like a whole new game. My alt is a prot warrior. I wouldn't be caught out in the wild on a PVP server with a build like that! 
---
Think I'll grind whelps, I like grinding those because when they are casters they will switch between you and the pet while staying at range so you can divide the damage up, sharing the load for less down time.  Also, in days past I've received a few blue items off those guys, it was always a staple to grind those in blasted lands.   
---
Because so many people are playing around the same level right now I had to compete for those. Think i'll head to Dust Wallow tonight, they might be a little high for me (whelps), worst case I'll just mow down rapters, spiders, oozes and crocks.   I like that zone right now because not many quests so you have a big open area with mobs in close  proximity.  That should work till I ding 40.  After which I should be able to head to ferals I think.
---
How I get this item as a Horde player? I almost did all the quest in badland ( Broken alliance ) and ( Regent step 2 ) and I didnt get this item
---
only naxx, everything pre-naxx is going to be a breeze because of the timegates
---
item level addons are not cool
---
What if we use the in game voting option that OSRS has? Players vote to have things in or not. Pretty self explanatory.
---
GET TO THA CHOPAA!!!!
---
&gt;Balance DPS is better than feral but worse than mage
---
Other way around. Balance dps is on roughly the same level as ret paladin, feral is somewhere above that.
---
Nah they just opened up free server transfers so a lot of the people who normally had 1 hour queues moved to lower pop realms.  My realm was usually medium/high pop and it was also full with a 10 min queue last night.
---
I think it was 6 wasn't it? But yeah guild recruitment channel exists as well, although I found it's not used that much at least on my server.
---
Because those people are on your side buddy.
---
Wsg is based around a battle between the border of ashenvale and barrens
---
I really wish my friends and I hadn’t picked skeram, and especially not skeram alliance
---
The first wc1 orc mission is setting up a base in the swamps of sorrow.
---
&gt;You can literally just drink while the tank does tank things for 10-15 seconds easily.
---
And now imagine that on a difficult pull or if the group accidentially adds something.
---
&gt; But is it the most effective way in pvp combat? that's unlikely
---
It's literally the most effective thing they coulda done in the scenario, what else is a mage to do in a pvp scenario where a priest made their kill target friendly?
---
I did yes! There are straight up UI’s you can just download? I guess that makes sense lol. 
---
This is just how I’ve always done it, it seriously takes like 5 mins max
---
Codex isn't a leveling guide though. It just shows quests and where their objectives are.
---
Unless you aren't referring to the Classic Codex AddOn?
---
But hiding in dungeons and spamming frost bolt would be exciting to you? I guess we just don't see eye to eye.
---
Yikes
---
hang on tight to the bandwagon, its gonna be a bumpy ride
---
Same, I also get really bored playing one class for too long so as a result I have a level 25 Druid, 24 Mage, and 22 Priest. :\
---
Was running through Ashenvale on my gnome to get a warlock quest done and see an undead warrior one level lower than me. I dot the mob he is attacking, run up and wave.  Without missing a beat, he stops attacking the mob to attack me. I /sigh at him, dot him up, sacrifice my voidwalker and stand there as my dots and the mob attacking him kill him. I then /sigh and then /sorry at him before continuing on my way.
---
Sometimes peace is the answer. Making friends with horde on a PvP server is half the fun for me. The other half is killing those that refuse my friendship.
---
I’m a level 16 shaman. Is that too low level for RFC?
---
Do you think its worth transferring from a high-pop server (Pagle) to another to make end-game grinding less competitive? (Like felcloth grinding)
---
I have noticed that when fighting higher-level mobs, like 4+ levels higher, not only do my spells get resisted more often, but even when I land one it does less damage.
---
What is the mechanic that scales the spell damage?
---
&gt; Do you know how easy it is to identify someone who is fake afk if he or she only does 1 action repeated.
---
Do you know how easy it is to hide that?
---
&gt; I did this by typing /lol in chat through remote desktop. First 4 times it said: you are no longer afk.
---
&gt; Fifth time? They deffo caught on and got afk booted.
---
Try space bar.
---
&gt; Obviously no one here knows the exact function they use to determine afk, but its for sure more than a mere count down timer.
---
For movement, it is 5 minutes. Fact. You are welcome to prove me wrong and record it.
---
I gotta say I was grinding there for 3 hours the wiki is definitely off on DRs or I am insanely unlucky.
---
why is that funny? to 10 year olds? it's fuckin racist lol.
---
Doesn’t work in classic, you have to drop and re learn
---
You like to enable jerks and enjoy agreeing that the Classic community is terrible. I understand. Thank you for assisting in proving my point.
---
Enemy Faction
---
lol OP shame deleted their post already.
---
Slice and dice
---
kek
---
I tried Improved Revenge and wasn't particularly happy with it's performance.
---
1/ It's a 45% chance on top of an ability that requires a proc to be usable.
---
This basically means the chance to stun is even lower since I can't use the ability whenever I want. (I won't waste 10 rage on Shield Block just to proc revenge while killing trash).
---
2/ When the don't happen... no one in my party dies...
---
I mean stun one mob out of the 3 mobs that are hitting me isn't adding anything really. And bosses can't be stunned so it's a waste there.
---
3/ I acctually don't want to stun the mobs. I want to get hit to get more rage to press more buttons.
---
So yeah I do believe it's a waste of talent points. Improved Sunder Armor is better since you already spam that shit, now you can spam it even more.
---
Good bot
---
That's half the fun, getting around mobs or sneaking by them if you just want to. I love being sneaky.
---
At lvl 40 lmao
---
Thanks, OP! Laughing in bus full of people, looking embarrassed. Thanks, now I'm crying out loud. Can't stop laughing, this made my day.
---
It just depends on what your endgame is going to be.  For my alt shaman, I'll take it all the way to 60 as Elemental and stay there for dungeons and PvP.
---
If you're going to raid you'll have an easier time finding a group as primary Restoration spec, but some guilds to have an enhancement slot.
---
You must let go of this illusion that the game is only fun 60. Or its at its peak fun at 60. Enjoy the ride. Play casually make sure youre always getting rested exp when you log out. Ask groups if they wanna do another run of a dungeon after completing it. If youre getting burnt out at 34 Id say try to get the lvl 60 out of your head. It will take forever if that is your goal. However if your goal is to get full scarlet armor at 34 (just random example), time will seem to go by much faster, and leveling wont seem like a chore.
---
Cries in Shadow Priest.
---
Oh Lawd he coming!
---
Are lower ranks more likely to break or is that just a thing people say?
---
Haha /s
---
I mean, he had a lot of options that he didn't utilize. Which made it all the more fun.   
---
\-Blink to me instead of away, nova.

I just imagined this person was living the original classic experience. My auto attack with the hamstring taking 1/2 his health also probably added some panic into the situation.
---
Some people consider both to be bad etiquette and some people don't care.
---
That's how the game goes.
---
It's something like 30 is a third, 44 is a half, and 50 is two thirds.
---
You can download a working version on curse where you usually get your addons. Just look for where it says game version and pick the one that says 1.12 or whatever it is.
---
He's in the other faction, he already chose death!
---
I have to agree there. They often refer to current WoW/Live as "retail" - which is a dead giveaway of a pserver player.
---
Uh what?  Is there some magical entrance to Deadmines I don't know about?
---
Yup one for every class. I don’t have the links. Ask on the classic wow discord which can be found in the sidebar
---
I want to change mine up but I’d obsess over it.
---
I remember something similar way back in original classic WoW, a naked, flagged orc named "Bait" running around in Westfall.
---
And people just kept falling for it...
---
Boo for you bringing you fel taint to lush fields of Mulgore! Begone!
---
Don’t be so gullible.
---
Taking it from another faction is totally fine in my book.
---
Being a dick to your own faction is where the "dick" part begins
---
The answer to your prayers is the 30/0/21 ele/resto spec. You can google it for the details, but that spec is totally fine at healing 5-mans and also PVP and solo content. Raids are a bit more iffy it's fine for some shamans to heal as ele/resto, but your raid leader will want some people to be deep resto for mana tide, so you'll want to get your raid leader's permission for healing a raid as 30/0/21.
---
What did you ooken say to me?
---
The LookingForGroup channel on Fairbanks is hopping. I try to remind trade chat about it every few hours to get even more people to join.
---
This right here. Kill Alliance on sight no questions. No quarter.
---
...i can't believe you just tried to compare wow and osrs. Osrs has 4 actual combat skills total: strength, attack, magic and range.  Each of which are exclusive to different types of weapons and armor. Its pretty easy to show a summary of the one stat that something affects. 
---
WoW has significantly more stat values to account for.  All of which you can easily view by pressing c.
---
If you need everything to be super simple and just a point a click stick to osrs. This is not better in anyway. 
---
Wowhead isnt inconsistent at all.  You linked the page for the actual robe not the recipe/plsn. Why the fuck would the recipe peice be listed here?
---
Shadow weaving isnt a meme build and top level guilds take one priest with shadow weaving to raids
---
That's still better than slowly clearing your way to the mob and then having someone from your faction decline a party and steal it anyway.
---
What's a paladin?
---
I got the Dark Whelping while doing the quest in Badlands for the Fiery Blast weapon enchant. 
---
It goes for 50-100 on the AH on Herod. Dont know if its sellable yet tho. Seems like the same 6 or so on there.
---
But I'm a force of evil for good... have any extra souls layin around?
---
Exalted with your home faction barely happened during vanilla let alone while getting to 40.  These guides are based on private servers not on actual players from 2007.
---
Personally it depends on class, I don’t steal shit from warriors, druids, or paladins regardless of faction. These classes tend to have a harder time leveling as they don’t get any real PvP offense until late in the game (or sometimes never).  I feel like BMing them is just adding insult to injury as leveling for them is already hard enough on a PvP server solo.

Hi, /u/Saproling1

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3am4t/does_anyone_rp_on_oceanic/).
---
Did you pick it up from the trainer in the Undercity? I wonder if the trainers in UC and Org make you go to different places. Maybe abandoning it and picking it up in Org would change where you have to go.
---
I'm in a similar boat.  I'm focusing on a solo character but have a group character I play almost as much.  The only thing that drives me forward is all of my friends who are almost twice as high as my main.  At the end of the day, just do what you want, only the hardcore people are raiding right now and there'll be plenty like me at 60 just getting into it when you get there.
---
Well, grinding to 60 is the most stupid thing one can do, I don't intend to offend here, but to let everybody know this game is about the journey. Yesterday I was leveling my alt 13, we did some RFC (4 guildies) and it was very fun. Now why would I let my lock 37 into rest to play a 13 UD war?
---
Simple, the journey in heavy pop servers is not satisfying now, everybody is retail minded and rushing to 60. There's no BG yet! Way better to level slowly and making friends along the way.
---
About the game difficulty. Guys this was launched more than 10 years ago, stop trying to compensate your retail frustrations here, go FF14 for that. Classic is a place for people whom wanted to replay a MMORPG based on W3 with a nice community, we did not come here expecting a super hard challenging content. But a well designed content based on RPG/Lore aspects and not a lazy crap made to level you up fast and lonely.
---
Hard truth, Classic is not for everybody, you are compensating your frustrations in it, not going to end well. The game is old and won't change, move on.
---
Also, DON'T RUSH TO 60!
---
If you ask and equip right away, no worries. But epics, even subpar ones, should be handled fairly. I also don't mind selling and splitting the profit five ways.
---
A lot of people are going to post here and talk about the differences between patch 1.12 that Classic is running vs 1.0 on vanilla, and how this results in classic being nerfed to faceroll easy mode, whereas back in their day it was Dark Souls Online. 
---
Truth is, vanilla was never hard, just like Classic isn't hard now. They're both just tedious and time-consuming. Most of the "hard work" was just getting to 60 in the first place and getting geared up to the point of being able to raid. But once you got into a 40 man, you really could just auto-follow people as long as 20-25 of them were actually doing their jobs. 
---
If you're looking for challenging endgame content, I don't think you're going to find it here, unless your guild wants to push for server/world firsts or some other self-imposed goal.
---
Enemy faction does it= that’s part of life
---
Same faction does it= they can be reasonably sure you are trying to loot that. So they are being rude.
---
You're also on first name basis with the Dragon Aspects lol. You also kind of kill her dad, soooo...
---
Had someone get mad at me for not healing them after they pulled and tagged a bunch of quest mobs. Not my fault they were dumb.
---
Man I loved Trillian. 
---
&gt; People: So are you on AIM or MSN or something else?
---
&gt; Me: Yes.
---
Just the tip.

Why in the world would you need 7 subs???? I have 5 but like most so I can run instances solo but it's not a necessity. 2-3 casters is about as easy as it gets.
---
Are you selling gear on AH or just vendoring items? I've been stockpiling all my leather and unsure what to do with it to make money for my mount at 40, currently level 29.
---
God f-ing dammit. I tried so many times over the years to make this guild name but it never stuck.
---
Being killed by an opposing faction member does not do any damage to your gear
---
Damn, that's cool as hell that they put in a 추석 festival.
---
That's the thing, *once* you get close to level cap and get a couple of purples on you, you start to look more "badass hero of the world," but it feels earned and all the way there you just look like a random dude.
---
It gives a sense of... \*ahem* pride and accomplishment for getting to the top of the pack.
---
"What are you doing?! She bit me on the arm!"
---
"Sshh, no talking."
---
how would you know how many are playing classic vs retails from sub numbers alone?
---
Lol it’s how some people act when they’re physically unreachable. Don’t worry about it man
---
Blaumeux had a queue to enter last night.
---
Are you playing during off times?  I do think population skews horde, but depending on layer I've seen tons of people on both sides.
---
Definitely try grouping more to get layer swapped.
---
I know, it's madness!
---
Go cut a tree
---
Same. I’m justifying playing as much as possible to try and “get it out my system” before I start uni again in 3 weeks. I want to play a warlock mage rogue Druid and hunter so I’ve got no chance
---
You can copy paste the shows url into VLC and play with it windowed in your wow screen, but it will be pretty small in comparison. I use the splitscreen method on my second monitor and that works well for me.
---
That's what I was leaning toward, sword spec until I get to endgame and then re-spec to dagger. I'm a pretty new player (played in BC/WotLK, never got to 70) so a lot of this is either new to me or long forgotten.
---
In classic you are either on a pvp server where you are always flagged for pvp in contested zones or on a pve server where you can manually flag yourself for pvp. Either way there is no exp buff.
---
Thought about this after I posted actually.
---
I mean basically all the dungeons you'd take 3 mages if you could.  It's a little ridiculous.  I almost exclusively go with groups that are at least 1 mage, then fill in with mage/hunter/warlock.
---
Would you mind copy pasting/fragmenting the relevant part of the blue post and going through exactly how you reached that conclusion. I simply am not following and am interested in following your logical steps.
---
In Classic there is no XP buff at all.
---
MS is so good Greg Street nerfed it to make his ideas better!
---
Now seriously, Warrior is very gear/group dependent.
---
Hey man, we only roll against each other 'til 40. Then you can have all the leather you want ;)
---
!Remindme 9 hours
---
Engineering is an amazing profession, and the only one that gives you a  advantage in pvp. It's very expensive, however, and I wouldn't take it without mining to mitigate some of the cost.
---
I'm currently mining and skinning while I level to make some extra gold, and I plan to transition to engineering once I hit 60.
---
Skinning is arguably the best moneymaking profession as it adds passive income to most beast kills. It's also not a bad option if you want to be a tailor as some patterns require leather.
---
&gt;Can you also check if the problem occurs if you disable all other addons?
---
It does.
---
Sounds like you need a new weapon and probably to grind on some lower level mobs.
---
Take up skinning and go kill lvl 7 boars and skin them.  Sell the skins, probably to a vendor because I doubt if light leather and leather scraps are worth posting yet.  Buy a green "of Strength" 2h'er off the AH with required level 10 (or whatever you hit while skinning).  Then go on about your day and wreck face.
---
Not anymore. There is an internal cool down on it now.
---
[Bro...](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Preparation)
---
realm and faction?
---
Funny, I never played wow before classic other than a week on henhouse, according to my flair I'm rogue but I decided to go mage. Spamming dungeons is also me, and yet I'm pretty sure I can shit on a lot of players without problem. Just because someone rolls in a way you disapprove of doesn't mean they are bad.
---
On henhouse good hunters had a good matchup vs good mages.
---
I dont wanna hear complaints about warrior life, rogue life is: miss, miss, dodge, parry, miss, dodge, dodge
---
&gt; I leveled to 60 doing BG's from the moment I unlocked WSG (back when you had to queue at the instance!) right through to AV.
---
Homie, BGs didn't give XP until like late WotLK or so.
---
We are in the same boat. I’ve probably put close to 13 hours into this guy over the past 3 nights. At this point I feel like I’m in too deep to give up.
---
Buh dum buh dum buh dum buh dum DONT DO IT.
---
Interested in retail?
---
"#NoChanges"
---
*mage exists*
---
"Nerf mage they are OP"
---
I agree, they are money, if the person who wins wants to equip it and forgo the gold that's their choice but everyone needs gold.
---
Oh, missed the MC part.  I think you can even talk to someone while mind controlled.
---
I think it’s the vocal majority that did. If you got a pop up on login once a week per account that said ‘hey pick what you’d like to see/ or pick none of the above’ then you get a vote from everyone. 
---
If most of the player base wants something then it should be that way. Obviously the options picked by blizzard should make sense. This would be post Phase 6. And it could be like ‘ wanna see the emerald dream stuff that never made it or the Mt. Hyjal content?’
---
Well 100% im not letting a rogue who cant open a chest roll to use my key so jokes on you
---
I’m new also but from what I’ve heard yes, warriors have the worst leveling of any class due to no self sustain and lower damage. But it gets better and eventually you’ll be one of the most coveted classes that can both tank and DPS.
---
Yea dude. Greens, blues, and greys at that level vendor for quite a bit of gold.
---
I’m having trouble levelling at 36. I’ll go all the way to a zone just to do like four or five quests and then run out of quests my level
---
Must be it. I've been buying all of the alchemy recipes. No mats from AH, but I'm sure the recipes have added up.
---
Think I'll just AH my herbs until 40 then go back and farm herbs to level it up instead.
---
That'll be coming to an end soon as warrior aoe threat via shouts was a bug that's being hotfixed.
---
Of course, and being addressed as ‘Hero’ where appropriate can also be rewarding.
---
But it’s easy to tire of “Hero, you’re just in time! Please, PLEASE help me!”
---
“... I can’t remember where I left my basket.”
---
Doesn’t take the merit of what you guys did; best of luck with the addon.
---
I'm at level 30 and I've never had to surface for air. If I start hitting a point where I'm really underwater that long sure, otherwise I'm good.
---
Run bitch! RUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
---
Ooooh Arcanite Reaper finally medium. That free transfer is starting to look more attractive.
---
The end game is competitive, what the hell are you talking about? If you don’t level fast you won’t be able to join a guild that is downing bosses, by the time you equip yourself in pre raid bis, other people applying to a guild will have epics from their previous guilds. Good luck, but you need a reality check.
---
I'm 44 and didn't do any dungeon farms and been mostly solo questing.  I find it alright, my guild set realistic level 60 within a month considering most of us are adults and have to work.  It would be a tad faster if I didn't have garbage luck on drops lol, but that's the game.
---
So dead game in 2 years because their is only so much you can do? I like it!
---
No, they break what you think is the core design. Projecting your opinions onto others is absurd.
---
Its because of the veiled sea. Its said all those who venture west of kalimdor or east of eastern kingdoms never return.
---
If I remember correctly there us an undead horde NPC to the east of duskwood in the broken watch tower, almost to DWP
---
In this particular case I asked him nicely not to do it 6 times, told him 2 times that I would stop healing if he continued to spam it and as a result he died 4 times before he actually stopped doing it (which slowed us down more as I had to rez him).
---
This. I don't trust democracy anymore. Stupid people are the majority. There are definitely some changes I'd like. I wouldn't be against the barber shop. Hell, I wouldn't be against a graphical upgrade if it was entirely optional.
---
Unfortunately it opens the doorway to madness. I want to know if all else fails, I can always go back to baseline classic, warts and all.
---
Ravager can proc ravager though.
---
We just did it. Mage made a portal to SW, flew back to Burning Steppes and back inside the instance; took like 15 mins.
---
Worth it.
---
You don't use those channels as they are player owned/moderated. LookingForGroup and Trade don't have any such restrictions.
---
Those people signed up to get ganked, not ninja’d
---
Yes senpi....
---
GW2 has definitely evolved on this one too. Not in having less revealing skins, but just also having them for male characters. I guess I'm here for it
---
Thanks! Most things I've read are along the lines of "sword spec, but use the best weapon you can find for the first ~40 levels", meaning if I find a dagger that's an upgrade over a sword/mace/fist/whatever I should use it. Is that the general consensus? Or would I be hurting myself NOT using a sword/mace with combat sword spec? Sorry for the dumbass questions, I'm full of them.
---
Yep I remember doing a quest in Wetlands. Got ganked by a warrior and hunter right after tapping a bunch of my health away. I came back and killed them both, then camped their bodies for a few more graveyard runs just to establish my dominance.
---
If you end up as combat daggers or assassination there's no difference.  The human advantage would be for combat spec with swords/maces only.  
---
For humans, the racial advantage simply makes some gear decisions easier/more flexible.  As a gnome, you can still reach hit cap and get weaponskill items.
---
Low population is the best because that's how it was during vanilla. You didn't always see people but when you did you can either get down or just ignore each other but what's also nice is you probably seen that guy 50 times before. High pop servers are not the vanilla experience
---
Okay, come on now.
---
Surely you can infer that I meant I was doing BGs while levelling?
---
Raids are organized, people understand warriors need to build threat in Classic. And most dps rotations are 2-3 buttons. It’s too difficult and the game is a lot simpler. Don’t worry about dps meters. Just know that rogues will always do exceptional DPS and fury warriors become the best dps in aq40/naxx. But those raids are probably over a year away, so play what you want and don’t worry about the specifics. Every class is viable in its’ own way in Classic.
---
To save for world drops and other gear pieces. Investing in professions. Loan out to your boys that are still leveling.
---
Vindication.
---
Also rogue life lol never seen a worg block or parry so much xD
---
I think that’s the smart play. 
---
Amusingly, their original plan for Taurens didn’t include any mount. They had an ability called Plainsrunning where they would just run until they gained 60/100% movement speed. I don’t think it ever made it to live - they added Kodos before launch, but Plainsrunning is still in the original game manual.
---
Laugh in warlock
---
So they brought the 3 sec CD from BC into classic?
---
Now slowly add back add-ons and see if any cause the issue again and report it to the author if it is or seems to be a bug
---
Since last week a blue post said all realms are already down to single digit layers and they are planning to not have layers  by phase 2, I think it's a moot point for now.  I also I can't imagine that layers could match spawn timers if the mobs are kill at separate times.
---
Combat Daggers. Seal Fate Daggers kicks ass but is shit until AQ/Naxx
---
Dungeon group pulls 8 mobs
---
Ravager: procs when there is 1 mob left with 10% hp
---
He might be talking about keeping it fed and/or happy in addition to the combat aspect. Also if you want a different pet you have to start over and get new food/skills, etc. These are things no other class need to worry about. Warlock pets just need their skills updated and a soul shard.
---
No they changed it back. Status is indicative of numerical values now.
---
Rattlegore !
---
There are no female orcs.  Just varying masculinities of male orcs.
---
Yay, another case of the you think you do, but you don’t.
---
Just sit there and suffer like you’re supposed to instead of trying to exploit layering to get what you want.
---
When you only have 1.2 gold, do you bids and then log in, collect and only have 80ish silver its pretty clear
---
In a perfect world where you could design your own items, you'd still want Agility over anything else.  98 attack power and 1% critical "costs" 63 item budget, where as 49 agility only costs 49 item budget.
---
In practice there are a finite number of items and they are rarely optimized.  Even Naxx gear, which is nearly perfect, has improper itemization such as strength on rogue items (instead of attack power).
---
So start a guild? Why are we posting here exactly?
---
Lots of gamers don’t know games are supposed to be fun.
---
devs have said that he will be leashed, but the other world bosses can still be kited!
---
Better threat and at lower levels the mobs don't do enough damage to need a shield.  Also a shield becomes better with talents, talents they likely haven't speced.
---
"No, I haven't made any friend online.." 
---
*stares into the void*
---
Same here! I’m excited to go how and try this build out!
---
It is the easiest class to play poorly.
---
I’ve got the auctionator addon, which add toolbar info on items in regard to their disenchant value. It doesn’t seem to work though, as the other day I replaced a wand and the addon told me to disenchant to get a small glimmering shard which according to it was worth around 1g at the time. The wand had a vendor price of 60s, so I chose to disenchant it. When I went to put the shard on AH they were going for 20ish silver, so I lost 40s. How do I make sure this doesn’t happen again?
---
Agreed on the spec balance but I abhor Draenei/blood elves as well as flying mounts which is a shame because Outland was cool (but also means nobody is in Azeroth).
---
For some reason I was convinced you had to light them all for them to come one at a time...it was only after I happily clicked them all, that I turned auto pilot off and instant regret kicked in
---
Awesome thanks for the explanation!
---
You can be mature and use profanity. You are concerned with professionalism, which is not synonymous with maturity. A gaming subreddit is also not a place to concern oneself with being professional. (Pssst, it’s also okay to use profanity and say something is “fucking dumb” in a professional setting, just don’t be unnecessarily and habitually vulgar)
---
So if you wait until a healer is 1/4 mana and pull, they shouldn’t have to stop drinking until they are about 1/2 mana. If them only needing 1/4 mana or less holds true, they can begin drinking immediately and gain another 1/4 mana as the tank pulls (or more if they used less).
---
At this rate, your healer should maintain enough mana for every pull, with a little extra in case mistakes happen. They can possibly end up gaining mana over time.
---
Can be used for anything, anywhere.
---
Nah, that guy's wrong. There were only the two until like 1.09
---
Can’t warlocks curse of tongues each other and talk?
---
Very true. But, that reason made it kind of silly in retail when Pandas of different factions couldn't talk to each other. I think they eventually changed it so they could.
---
Correct on all counts. The downside is no mitigation abilities, no block/parry (can dodge tho), and can be crit. In addition to no polymorph, they can shift out of bear and immediately back in to cancel any CC or slow (except stuns/sleeps). They also provide a 3% melee crit aura, so they can buff their melee group.
---
Flexibility doesn't really do anything when other classes do those specific roles better.
---
Also if having fun is the only thing that matters, why are you posting lies about how viable druid is? It shouldn't matter to you if druid is awful in almost every way.
---
Forced votes  are worse than no votes at all.
---
Have you every worked in help desk or Helped a relative  with a computer?
---
You can have a perfectly worded pop-up that exactly explains what is going on.
---
People just click whatever button makes it go away, over and over and over. never bothing to read it, or put the check mark that says don't show this message in the future.
---
They don't read the message, not even part of it, they just lock for the close option, if it's not there they look for the "ok" button, if it's not lit up they click something randomly until it does light up.
---
They don't even remember that they clicked it to make it go away.
---
Why is it frustrating? People enjoy games in different ways. Some people like rushing to max level so they have everything and can go do whatever they want, world pvp, dungeons, raids. And "find stupid ways" all this was in the game back then too, people just sucked at it and didn't realize how easy it could be to do things like this. Sure, the only thing was 10 man dungeons were bugged, but even then there's still 5 man ZF exp groups, AOE grinding, BRD/UBRS grinding to 60.
---
Really there's nothing wrong with hitting max level a different way than you did. Can only do so many "kill 20 buzzards for their parts, but actually you need to kill 60 of them because they won't always drop it" before I say fuck it and wanna grab a few free levels from a dungeon farm group.
---
No, it's not.
---
Nothing wrong with letting dinguses die. They’ll listen or they’ll rage quit. 
---
Your group is better off either way.
---
If only druids had typhoon, that would be one hell of a fun knock back right there.
---
I literally just had 2 people leave my ready-to-go RFD party without saying anything after most of us had reached the instance, and they were close by.
---
Is that retail behavior or something?
---
Usually I go about 6-7 inches deep depending on who's measuring
---
What I have not made my mind about is the meeting stones. On one hand I like that Warlocks are infinitely valuable to summon the last 2 people to an instance, but I liked the update in late Vanilla that let you teleport people to meeting stones with 2x people there.
---
Just a related conversation
---
My LookingForGroup devolves into Barrens Chat 2.0 at times :(
---
Other than dotting and shadow bolting, theres not really much you NEED to do but I'll drop a few helpful hints for groups.
---
You def wanna be a distance away from the mobs you're fighting, try and hang out near the healer. If anyone backline is gonna pull aggro, itll be you or the healer. If the healer pulls, and the tank is oblivious, you can rip threat with some searing pains pretty easy if you absolutely have to. 
---
Soul stone your healer in a 5 man and try to keep it up, prevents anyone from having to walk back
---
While leveling you'll probably want to invest enough points into affliction for in the very least imp life tap and imp soul drain. Try and get the last hit on a mob with your dots while soul draining and you'll get a big boost to your mana regen 
---
Draining soul all the time will give you bunch of soul shards to make health stones for your party. I generally just give one to the tank and heals, or any dps who's ripping threat alot. Always keep one for yourself for if you need more health/mana and the healer is getting low
---
Learn a balance of when to life tap and when to drink. If you're at full health, tap once or twice just so natural regen favors you more. If the healer starts getting below 50, cut back and depend on your own heals and slowly lifetap. You dont need to cap your mana, just have enough to do a cycle or two. 
---
Imp is mostly the go-to summon for groups, especially without experience. Hell just stay back by you throwing fireballs and buffing the whole group with blood pact. Once you're more comfortable, succubus can be used to help with crowd control by seducing one
---
A mod or macro to delete soul shards after X (whatever you're comfortable with probably 12 since that's the first soul bag you get) helps with inventory management. 
---
Warlocks have no threat dumps, so once you get some gear and start hitting hard enough to pull off of tanks, you may have to stop and wand every now and then for the tank to keep up with you. 
---
TLDR version: 
---
support your party with health and soul stones
---
Manage your mana and health in accordance to the healers
---
Try not to rip threat you're a squishy man-skeleton
---
Yup. The server stability and launch has been good but they really fucked up by releasing such a small number of servers for the initial name reservation.
---
you added an extra Zero
---
Well, good news, you can now watch [this awesome old machinima](https://vimeo.com/5241163) without it being a spoiler.
---
So basically LFG then :D
---
Have you done a scan of the auction house?  Go to the More tab when at the AH and do a full scan.  The info should populate after that.
---
7 and 8 are whelp groups
---
Guess I'll die
---
Nothing new is being added to the game why would you make suggestions.  There are chat parsing addons that essentially do this.
---
Have you tried rolling with those groups? They occur on both sides and if you pickup the kill quests in stv for example they'll basically autocomplete for you will you roll around.
---
I’m saying it isn’t as important to the community that cross realm BG’s don’t exist because you could only ever fill half a BG on a single server whereas you can fill an entire raid.
---
I may have to go train mc now. There's more than one use.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+deep+into+ass+should+I+go
---
18 can tank it. You will be fine. Don't worry as much about miner agro (as a 19 priest I could solo them with just my wand) just worry about the elites. Pull small groups with your gun and watch your healers mana. 
---
Patrols spawn after bosses. 2 elites which you can tank but will chew through your squishies. So watch for them or just wait for them.
---
The boat is the hard part. Groups can be pulled from afar (especially if you have level 17 or lower in your group) so take it extra slow.
---
It's only anecdotal, but for me, I am completely invested even though I am a working adult with kids. I've played on and off since 2007, and I've subbed and ubsubbed on and odd since then.  I haven't felt this way towards any other game I have ever played except when I started in 07. I think about it at work. I make lists of shit I need to work on and craft and fish. I want to play every minute.  I have many other obligations, so I can't play as much as I want and I'm only level 30, but I will 100% continue playing for months or years to come.
---
 I have zero interest in retail because it's really an action game now. Classic is the best MMORPG ever made. In some wayz, it is superior to Vanilla because both Blizzard and players have the hardware to maximize player experience.  It is a true RPG in a way that retail hasn't been in many years.
---
I think there will be a minor decline when people hit max level, but I would be really surprised if there is ever a dramatic drop off.
---
Blizzard has done an extraordinary job making Classic damn near perfect and their only misstep so far has been in seriously underestimating how many people wanted it.  They have thought for years that it was just a fringe minority. They were wrong.

This is excellent! I’m always worried that the person spamming their group request 5 times in a row is going to make me miss a group I’m looking for, and if I scroll back, by the time I go back to the bottom the spot would be filled.
---
Out of curiosity would you be able to ask your GM about the viability of a similar addon for trade chat? As a rogue I wanna scan chat for lockboxes that are linked so open them for people, but haven’t found a way to do that. Not trying to get him working overtime or anything, just wondering if something like that is hypothetically possible lol
---
I'm guessing areas where mobs respawn almost instantly when you kill one, meaning you can grind on the same spot for hours. Unsure though...
---
There's literally been a Ragnaros kill with people below level 60 and others where most of the raid is in greens, this isn't needed. 
---
What are you removing from the debuff list for it?

People can write guides for anything and everything it doesn't make something good.

Then I looked up how to get there and realized I was right the first time around.

I agree, I google stuff for quests and Wowhead is just terrible to navigate and figure out what I need to do or if the quest has any pre-requisites or is a pre-requisite for anything.  Maybe I am using it wrong.  Navigating a bunch of comments to answer my quesiton stinks.  Runescapes Wiki is better.  Yes, I have questie.
---
First off, thanks for not jumping down my throat, massively appreciate that. 
---
What you linked is actually really useful and helpful! Bookmarked that own!
---
I’m not too proud to admit I’m wrong, clearly the table feature is there! 
---
The trouble with the written guides is they aren’t catered towards the new and levelling player, great to know my BiS, but I want to go out on an adventure to hunt for my next BiS for my level kind of thing
---
But your link looks like it will help me do that! :) so thanks

Yeah he "forgot" he cursed him because he never actually did it. Magus Tirth is a crazy old alcoholic and Plucky just poly'd himself to get some peace and quiet, as evidenced by his ability to switch back at will if you /chicken him.

Most hunters can't walk and talk without wiping the whole group so I don't think they should be dancing while shooting.
---
[Stoneskin gargoyle cape intensifies, white and slightly longer than your average cape]
---
I did the same thing and lit them all.  Thankfully I managed to aggro half only and make two pulls out of it and not wipe.
---
Omg an honest-to-goodness, non-satirical huntard! I've missed you guys.
---
think of it more as an identity / emotional, not about ease of use. 
---
i want my character to be me, and not have some ai / extra thing i have to control. Having a pet on your screen splits your focus / identity, even if it's really easy to use. pet positioning / summoning / dismiss is all overhead i don't really enjoy.
---
If you don't mind, great! i just don't really enjoy it so thats why i roll mage or priest for caster class.
---
What's next hit 60?!!
---
beh gud

Try the add on Guidelime. Sevenleaves has a really quick and efficient 1-60 you can download and use with guidelime. It’s awesome

Sorry.

One of my favorite things to do with those types as a Druid was Faeire Fire them. And root them if I had time to get it off.
---
Oh noez! Stealthy is locked out of stealth now! And stuck! (And since FF doesn't do damage, roots have a high chance of sticking until the guards get there.)
---
The difference was less obvious with Rank 2 and Rank 3 Demo Shout, but you're just wrong that it didn't affect threat.
---
I wish I could upvote this x1000+ times...
---
Charge in, Tclap, back to Dstance, shield slam and revenge main target, then start sunders. After that, tab + sunder until dead, toss in shield slam and revenge on main target as you tab back to it. Tell them NOT TO AOE. Single target the main kill target only.
---
people that need a group to kill one person, you deserve no honor and you dont know what honor means
---
QOL changes are coming to the game per devs, as they should be. A chat parsing add on is nice, but I'm talking about a native solution.
---
As the other guy said, it's consumable, but it's also on a 5 minute cooldown, and I'd prefer to save it either as a way to drop agro in combat when feint is on CD, or to save myself from a repair cost if the group is gonna wipe.
---
Two garroted tbh
---
I can't speak to overall realm pop, but generally even these medium pop realms have plenty of population that it's no issue. Way higher than original vanilla.
---
As far as faction balance, current census data says Heartseeker is 52% Ally / 48% Horde
---
At least you like a challenge. Life would be a lot easier for you if you just rolled alliance.
---
its the players fault for not moving.  
---
In top hours in one of the new "fulls" servers i have like 20 minutes max, in Herod like 3 hours.
---
Wow, you found the joke!
---
its balanced out by all the horde in STV
---
The music is definitely wrong for the undead dance :P
---
44 damn
---
How do you get companions? I thought you had to purchase blizzard games or expansions.
---
Having played Wrath recently I can guarantee you that there was more than 1 "meta" build for each spec in PvE. As a matter of fact, a player dedicated to even a single role might rotate between 3 or more spec/glyph combos between different fights and gear levs for optimal play.
---
It's P1, you aren't getting HKs.
---
stonetalon is a fucking disaster as well, at least it was for me. It made ashenvale seem safe comparatively, there were at least 10 horde at the venture co area on both chars I tried to level through there.
---
Never even got the flight point at the peak, hope I don't need it for anything later..I already have nigels point so worst case I'd just fly there and run back in I guess
---
It's not a good strategy for making money, but that's not what OP was asking. They were asking what's the most profitable return when *leveling* tailoring. So the main point is not to make gold, but to level tailoring and get the best return while doing so. And in that regard, selling what you make on the AH is definitely the best return if you can actually sell it.
---
I'm sorry you didnt have much luck with the azure silk set but that may be down to your server. I made more than 30g while leveling tailoring by selling azure silk items alone. Pay attention to when you list the auction and for how long. If you're posting items for 8 hours at the end of the night, stuff is probably not gonna sell as well.
---
I typically post for 8 hours at a time and try to time it so that the majority of that 8 hours will be during peak time.
---
Why does that bug you? Unless you're gonna ignore buying epic mount, you gotta find a way to make a buck. Same goes for everyone else. Money equals time so someone basically idling (sacrificing their time they could be farming something else for) to provide a service means it's totally fair to ask for some compensation
---
Just a meme dude, not to be taken seriously :) that fair tho most other pvp servers are majority horde
---
I do that because that's how Blizzard refers to them.  Look in your install folder.  There's a classic folder and a retail folder.  I've been playing since vanilla; never played on a private server.
---
Yikes.
---
Unless it's a RP-PVP server in which case there are probably more Alli
---
Yeah I've healed this way ever since the default raid UI got changed. Its simpler IMO and works great. I've healed plenty of mythic raids and gotten AOTC in teo expansions this way. 
---
The big thing is, finding what you're comfortable with though. As long as you find the tool that works for you, healing is always the most rewarding job.
---
I have no issues with 6 plus pulls on my warrior
---
Warlock is objectively a funner class in any case.
---
When i first started i was really paranoid about that. So i did try to keep up everything... even if i had, say, a Green Staff but a Grey Knife.   
---
Since then, though, i just use whatever has the best stats. It kind of evens out. I keep around the best versions of each just so one doesn't completely get left behind. 
---
To be fair, i'm very new to Classic. I started in Wrath, so i'm not sure how imperative it really is. As a Druid it's also weird because we don't get weapon levels in animal form.
---
Well we disagree i guess you do you
---
Could be. I've been on PVP servers so long I've forgotten what PVE is like. Lol.
---
druid would tbh

Is there a macro to select the nearest *lootable* corpse?
---
You don't *need* anything in shadow for leveling until shadowform, and even then I didn't respec till 44 this time around. At 44, you get the new rank of mind flay, which actually does enough damage to make it worth casting; and it lets you invest 4 points back into wand spec.
---
Before that, I went disc, which IMO is a better leveling spec till shadowform.
---
Gratz mon!
---
There's a lot of Benedictions in the game already, pretty easy to get tbh
---
Dude, I raided 6 days a week with 3 different guilds all of legion. My opinion still stands.
---
Totally feel that, and it’s frustrating as a lowbie.  But on our outnumbered server I felt good about leading the charge of level 30-40s as we took back northern STV from the horde.  From what my friend told my and 2 other 50+ player’s work bought like 2-3 hours of ally dominating onto the farming and quest spots there.
---
Unfortunately you have UD rogues who live their life to just grief lowbies and don’t go ganking with some purpose in mind :)
---
Edelgard is an anagram of Edgelard, thanks for attending my TEDx talk
---
Cool
---
As far as I understand, it does keep shooting! You might be double tapping the bind so you toggle on then toggle off? But for me, I press Q, and it keeps shooting until I press Q again or move. 
---
I’ll have a play around with the macros when I get home from work to see what I can do re shooting after a spell! :)
---
All the way in.
---
I believe 97 were online at the time last night.
---
He says 
---
&gt;until level 60, when rock becomes an unstoppable killing machine and also beats paper, and would beat scissors, but it can't find scissors
---
This is not true. Warrior loses to most classes 1v1. Especially rogue which beats warrior in a 1v1 90% of the time, unless the rogue has 0 cds or gets ultra unlucky with rng.
---
He also says 
---
&gt;Scissors beats paper
---
When rogue loses to a lot of the 'paper' classes
---
When you have enough to pay him back, just give it to another player who needs it for his mount and tell him to do the same with someone else.
---
You won't feel in debt anymore and everyone is happy !
---
I’ll have a play with the macros when I get home from work! :)
---
you still gain rested xp outside of inns right? It's just slower?
---
For 15 years I thought only damage, heal and direct threat generators produced threat. And I have been tanking in raids all those years... Wow...
---
1). Not everyone tries to min/max to the neckbeard degree and only does melee/spell cleave. Their damage is perfectly fine.
---
2). Mages have sheep. Rogues have sap, blind, gouge, cheapshot and kidney shot. As a whole the rogue wins out in this category unless a pull lasts obscenely long.
---
3) If they are tanking. Pummel is learned near lv 40, and most casts don’t give a dps time to identify, assess importance, swap gear/stance and interrupt unless they are super on the ball (most aren’t). Also gouge can be an impromptu pseudo interrupt with low cooldown.
---
So no, rogues aren’t only brought for their lockpicking unless explicitly asked (such as a group without a shadowforge key).
---
N I C E
---
You fought noob rogues.
---
I've found myself not nearly as shy to ask a nearby player for help on a tough mob. Haven't been turned down yet. Thanks all of you :)
---
What??
---
you can deposit money in your bank, none of these are fake just extremely low effort
---
Anecdotal situation. You don’t represent every player as you would think.
---
So is your position that Blizzard didn’t massively underestimate the demand at multiple junctures?
---
As a warlock, seeing that probably 50% of the server is mages pleases me. Free kills, free kills everywhere.
---

And I fully understand that as a hunter. I seriously contemplated NOT playing a hunter in classic, because I remember how difficult this was to overcome in vanilla and TBC. Getting denied for groups just because I'm a hunter, even if I was way overheated and just grinding the heroic for a mount or rep. Then nostalgia reminded me that I haven't played my mana hunter since I quit in WotLK. 
---
The issue I see with those 75% of hunters is their poor pet management skills. The pet management is what I find most fun in the class and what I feel like I excel with, but so many hunters leave on growl, just set things to attack, or leave their pets on defensive in a dungeon (idiots). If hunters lived religiously by the creedo (sp?) of spam follow after you kill a mob or when it's close to dying as a runner and manually tell their pet what to do, hunters would be much more reliable and trusted. 
---
Don't get me started on these guys' inability to understand spell weaving and auto cancelling.
---
If I hate the dungeon: until I have the gear I wanted.
---
If I like the dungeon: until I'm bored
---
I don't think ultra shredded men are a female fantasy. That's more male power fantasy. I wouldn't say Classic WoW catered to female power fantasies much from what I remember.
---
There are so many Priests because they're arguably the best class 1v1 overall. Do what you like, don't mind others, and make sure you find a guild in which you are the main/best healer!
---
How would you describe Wow experience on Mac? Considering how good the screens are?
---
Gratz but I prefer the emerald dragon.   Took countless hours back in the day and looking forward to it being by my side once again.
---
niceee
---
Yeah that’s not gonna happen. The point is you need to talk to people. If you don’t want to, sorry, this is not the game for you. Hit up zone, hit up looking for group, hit up a major city, personally message people that are the right level. This is literally what we all asked for. If you’re not down bro, honestly, I wish you the best. Cause this only scratches the surface of things you’re not gonna like about vanilla.
---
Well I’m glad you’re here to help me, you prove my point more than I ever could. Everyone, here we have Exhibit A: The Current 2019 Gaming Community.
---
Just a heads up, doing a /who warlock stormwind
---
and asking for a summon would probably be the easiest way in the future :)
---
New player leveling rogue, i can say i love rogue. Also because for me its easy, spec into combat and spam sinister strikes all Day and do fairly good if not very good dps.
---
Those people are the retail players. They don't understand that people remember things and will know who's an asshole. Those are the players that either won't reach 60, or if they do, won't be brought for raids.
---
SoR reckoning paladin, if your procs go off.  4 reck hits, all with the ability to proc 2 hits from ironfoe, and 1 from Hand of Justice, each of which have the ability to proc the other for the lottery chance to proc someone to death in 1 go.   I haven’t tested it, but I will eventually.
---
You’re comparing apples and oranges. LFG destroyed the community because there was no communication and groups became disposable. BGs always has automated group finding. Cross-realm is arbitrary.
---
Go to a PVP server.
---
This one lets you spam Sap as a rogue and instantly target &amp; sap enemies if they become targetable (great for rogue v. rogue or rogue v. druid).

---
The context is class weapons though. So there’s an inherent, unspoken, understood premise of the conversation, being that it’s a weapon that’s only obtainable by one class.
---
Someone asked if Warriors have a class weapon at 60.
---
I replied that QS is the closest thing we’ve got, but that paladins can get that too.
---
I didn’t mention: Rogues. Warlocks. Hunters. Mages. All those other classes that can use swords. The implication here is that only the other class I mentioned is relevant.
---
So when someone mentions having it and pissing off warriors, everybody but you understood what class they would be.
---
Ugh this so much. My partner has made an alt for every class and then some. I just want to play with you!
---
WC isn't a big deal because you generally level fast enough to get past it...except a quest chain from TB has a reward in there for a baller caster staff or agi sword.  The rest are pretty meh.
---
I generally try to load up on quests so even if I don't get a drop after a couple runs I'm still getting exp and make a quest reward upgrade.
---
Personally I wouldn't worry about it until progression slows down in the 30s, when you're stuck with your gear for more than a week.
---
I got rage whispered + ignored by someone trying to snipe quest tags from me in a field of alive quest mobs. Sorry, I'm going to watch the deathmatch between you and the NPC as a spectator if you're going to be a dick about it. If you can't handle it, maybe don't pull with low hp + mana just to steal the tag.
---
It will not become dead, none of the current realms will
---
Honestly depends on class and gear needs.
---
I imagine a Hunter or Lock or Druid might only do them once for the quests, and then get back to questing, unless there's a particular piece of gear they really want.  As a Warrior, I find myself doing them several times each to help pad out my levels, as it's a thousand times easier when I outlevel the quests by a bit.
---
Where do you train dual wield for enhancement shaman?
---
:(
---
Idk, I've seen too many bad warrior "tanks" swinging a 2h weapon with their backs facing groups of enemies to be aight with this
---
Whitemane for life
---
&gt; "Warrior Class weapon."
---
And yet it isn't, because Paladins can wield it
---
Is that the one on Herod? I think he got me several times near the yetis.
---
The version I saw posted had the 2nd line as “/cast !shoot”. I’m not sure what the ! does though.
---
Its a fantasy story man, chill.
---
*slow clap*
---
Hope it's close to what you are looking for. If you find any others you are enjoying drop back in here and share. I've been searching for others myself.
---
I want to say the World first for Classic clearing of MC was done sometime last week. 
---
People have no lives it seems, hahahaha
---
Tactical Mastery enables that strategy, and mashes some other things easier, like dancing into battle stance for a mocking blow or overpower, or gong berserk for a quick whirlwind. It's nite absolutely necessary for tanking, though. It's fine to just stay in defense stance and you can do just fine. I leveled 1-40 as pure fury, because i like it more, and never had trouble tanking even large pulls. Just bank rage toward the end of fights so you got some at the start of the next one. Hit random critters as you pass them for a bit extra. Keep blood rage up always. He'll it's actually safer that way since you won't be tempted to airways charge at groups that might pull more than you want and you can master the art of range-pulling.
---
Why are they the worst? Worse than Epoch of Thought? Because that’s the worst guild name I’ve ever seen
---
Well I was asking because I have it on a few servers from before I knew what server I was going to play on so if by chance they played on one of those servers I would give it to them if they still wanted it because I would rather the name get used.
---
Basically you want a Slow and hard hitting weapon for the main hand (which means a sword or mace with a speed that is the closest to 2.9) and a fast off hand (can be anything closest to 1.5). The reason you want that for a main hand is to maximize the damage with your abilities (they all use the main hand weapon). A fast off hand will maximize your poison damage since it will proc more due to the speed of it ( basic math  more hit = more poison application chances)
---
The DPS stats of a weapon should only be used to compare 2 weapons of the same type for example 2 main hand slow weapons. the reason for this is that a lower dps slow weapon will be better in the main hand then a fast high dps. 
---
Take my current weapons for example. My main hand is a Sword, DPS : 15.6 , Speed:  2.7, DMG: 29-55. My off hand is Dagger, DPS: 20.5, Speed: 1.9, DMG: 27-51
---
Even tho the dagger as a higher DPS than the sword its damage range is lower than the sword which means if i were to use that as my main hand weapon my abilities will hit for less than the sword
---
It’s something you can mess with during flight paths :)
---
Are there any deals currently going on with game time?  Or is the best way to do it through Blizzard and just purchase the monthly pass?
---
I always worry that there is some cool deal going on, or promotion that I missed out on.
---
Almost 50/50 per classicrealminfo
---
.......which is exactly what the guy was saying?
---
Like, now we've come full circle. Congratulations lol
---
AQ gear? Nah, if you want to switch from combat swords to say hemo daggers, you can consider doing it as early as MC if you are lucky with drops. Perditions Blade (from Rag) and a Core Hound Tooth (Major Domo) will last well into AQ and are considered BiS for dagger rogues for a long time.  
---
I personally wouldn't consider anything but swords until you have both of those in your bag though.
---
honestly speaking here though, Holy Paladin/warlock combos are the best. it's like the Warlock has his own personal infinite battery
---
Same feeling when my Rogue gets all its combo points only to miss the Eviscerate five times and die.
---
It's just a comment buddy, not to be taken seriously. That is just what forums are for.
---
The highest pop servers are seriously fucked
---
I asked a mage if he could make me a single stack of water and ill tip him because I was all out and needed to keep questing, of course, all with due "please" and what not.   
---
  He told me only if I paid him 5 gold, because I "interrupted" his aoe farming with my whisper.  
---
  Mages are either nice and quiet or complete pieces of shit.
---
Try to use everything to your advantage: make parties, swap layers, do dungeons, etc. I still haven't had too much problems with Horde on Herod (level 35).
---
Maybe. I think in like 2 weeks I’ve had maybe one or two bad interactions with people in game. Just seemed like a shit show last night and this morning.
---
Hahahahaha I’m dying almost as much as you guys must have.
---
Does this remove the LFG/LFM posts from your wow chat, or does it simply double them up into this addon’s window?
---
If shamans could have better tank related talents, wear plate (or have a % increase like druids) with some mana/ability tweaking, they could easily out do warriors. They can already out threat them just as is in the game, they have no mitigation and can't maintain themselves in long af fights due to Mana.
---
This is seriously impressive, not only did you get lucky enough to get the quest item from major doom, but also from onyxia. AND on top of that kill all four of the demons within 2-3 weeks of release....it took me nearly 3 weeks in vanilla just to get the mats. The amount of griefing/despawning of the demons bc people wanted to “help” added another week or so. Grats man /golfclap
---
Ya that would work too, I downloaded sammyTotemTimers. Maybe that one is inferior, I'll try totem timers now. Thank you
---
At this point, I'm not even convinced things will "die down" much more than I'm sure they have since two weeks ago.  If the grind to 60 as going to break a new player/non Vanilla vet, it would have already broken their spirit.
---
I am not sure how often I have to mention that I am playing tank, not healer.
---
Druid is pretty fun to play in PvP, they're just not really able to kill much.  If your fun comes from being almost to impossible to kill, or from being cancerous, you'll have a good time.  If you want to get a gigantic multi crit and instagib people, you'll have a bad time.
---
I actually can't remember any classes that I could consistently kill in vanilla, but I still remember the only classes I actually feared was warlock/shadow priest, because fear mechanics are fundamentally broken in vanilla.  They are stuns that double as anti-gap closers for squishy classes.
---
Good one
---
1. Use "Change my mind" meme
---
2. Respond to every comment explaining that it's a meme and you don't want people to change your mind.
---
3. ???
---
Of course a Rogue posts this
---
I think 30ish will generally give you a great idea of what the class is like, though there are some exceptions to that rule.
---
Speaking directly on druids, I think you have just about all you need to make an informed decision. Ferocious bite is pretty neat, but you'll probably use the DoT finisher in 99% of dungeon encounters, and it's also pretty good in PvP, too. I have gotten four druids to 60, one in OG classic (that I eventually got to 80 in WotLK), and three on Pservers. They're an awesome class, but, like I said, by your level - you know most of what you need to know. The real benefit of druids is that they are truly a hybrid class. You can heal, you can dps (cat form is fairly op between 20-45ish), and you can tank (very well).
---
Is there a specific aspect of being a druid that bores you most? Anything that does intrigue you?
---
Personally, I've gotten my druid to 22 this go-around, and I'm calling it quits and rolling a shaman. I mainly want to heal at 60, and you cannot go wrong with shaman healers in Classic.
---
Nessingwary indeed. I can't turn a quest in that little spot without chronic ganking taking place.
---
Awesome, thank you very much
---
I probably spanked some of your buddies and got spanked by you up in that there monastery. Bloodbath is what it is. The whole grand vestibule is the new SM GY lol
---
WW axe is best when you get it at 30 up to mid 40's if you don't get ravager
---
As someone who is a proponent of people trying "memespecs" and looking for the right guild for them, you are doing the right thing. There's a clear line between fun raids and optimal raids.
---
Going to need a bigger boat...
---
Because vanilla has cross realm bgs.
---
As long as you're not on the floor it's fine. Step onto a balcony, the stairs (upstairs works fine) or even jump onto one of the hammocks (see it pays to habitually /sleep on a bed at the inn before logging). Just don't touch the floor. The floor is lava.
---
I don't think it's going to be health to start these us x them threads.

My grandma had a hemorrhage, definitely don't want that

Then you are confused because they already have.
---
Thank God at least Dumbledore's okay
---
I'd say focus on 60 pick up that rifle afterwards which will give you more time for it to go down in price.
---
Is that why they’re always such higher level?? I’ve been questing in Hillsbrad as Horde and not being able to fight anyone due to level difference. It’s either hide or run or stick with a group.
---
Unpopular opinion
---
No addons is the only way to play. 
---
Dont even have the twitch app on my computer.
---
nobody gives a shit karen and no I don't have a problem!
---
No. My friends are in the same queue. In 15 min they have gone down by 300 while I have gome up 20.
---
While it is really good to begin with I feel what makes it extra good is just how early you can get it when compared to other weapons.
---
I hate when I'm fully aware of the sunk cost fallacy yet still fall into it.
---
What level are you?
---
Neither, wows for losers
---
Lol go whine about ganks with the rest of the alliance :)
---
Remind yourself you'll gank the opposite faction relentlessly when you're max level for redemption
---
In the 40-50 range, you have most of the tools as a rogue that allow you total control over an opponent. If you have preparation and a healthy supply of blinding/flash powder you can effectively keep a warrior stunlocked indefinitely until you decide to kill him.
---
I used to try to trade Healthstones to everyone but it was such a crap shoot trying to give them to the other DPS that I only bother with them if asked.
---
I still go out of my way to hand them to the Tank and Healer, and any Warriors I encounter in the wild.
---
BIG FUCKING TRUE
---
Literally everything in the barrens.
---
That's exactly what this is encouraging lmao, just actual talk and not just spam
---
Okay.....but that still doesn't make combat a flavor of the month, but rather a decades old spec proven to be superior for a dps role....
---
I was a level 36 lock and he was a 22 rogue lol
---
He didn’t have a chance
---
Just form your own group. Ppl respond more when I say LFM over when I say LFG. It’s tough finding groups as a warlock sometimes so I just make my own. Once you have 3 dps, healers and tanks usually follow pretty quickly.
---
It's as good as they say.. at level 30. You'll be using ravager in dungeons and bonerbiter out in the world. But congrats, it's a big achievement and an iconic warrior piece.
---
Thanks man. Fun is the main factor for me. I love sub rogue the most but I wanted a fun alternative to mess around with.
---
I want to switch to alliance now

One time only.  There are a lot of quests to do and my do bar would fill too fast if I ran dungeons more than once.
---
Wow man, you're a sad sack
---
I use auctioneer for vendor prices and it has a neat bonus of telling you the AH prices as well if they're  scanned.
---
I mean, I get what you're saying but the UltraMax1337Boiz don't really matter compared to the 95% or more of the WoW population who are still sub-50.
---
Uhhh no you wont do more dps than any other dps. You think you do but you dont. AoE mage is desired for farming xp for that reason so dont get too full of yourself.
---
2H tanks do fine, especially pre 60. You obviously dont know what your talking about. GL
---
*back peddle away
---
You think you're clever.
---
"What can I do for you?"
---
I think it can be tough in life when you have free time but no fulfilling things to fill it with. Then you spend more time than you should mulling around looking for something to blow off some steam only to feel unsatisfied. In comes a game from 15 years ago that is for many the perfect antidote to this. You can put your time in and log off and feel like you escaped for a minute. Then you are refreshed to go about your real life. Of course some people don’t have an off switch and simply just keep playing nearly masochistically. Those people might not have an experience like this.
---
I play addon free personally, only use macros for things I want in game
---
got it. thx.
---
Just polymorph pet, cc the hunter, get in deadzone (hunters have a deadzone where they cannot melee or range, so just poly pet and deadzone, easy. Mages are op, only priests, druids and locks have a chance.
---
I never said I was mad.
---
Charge in, Berserker Stance, Berserker's Rage, Whirlwind, Defense Stance, spam Demo Shout until mobs are dead.  AoE tanking is a joke but I believe this is being nerfed fairly soon.
---
And yet you keep talking like you have any idea what goes on with healing.
---
WTF, that's insane! I honestly didn't think you could do that Classic...
---
I played near of the end of BC where Moon = Sheep.
---
Happened to me (shaman) in rfk on a pserver with corpsemaker. Except he won, then had to leave the dungeon before we finished because he was "too fucked up on ketamine to play". Sick.
---
/rude
---
*stealth sounds*
---
What is the advantage of Disenchanting vs selling the greens?
---
Yes..
---
And me and literally everybody else here understood that him saying "Basically Quel'Delarr, but Paladins can use it too" meant that only those two classes could use that item.
---
Good job trying to turn it around on me though.
---
Now who has cottage cheese for brains?
---
Also. Holy fuckballs you need to calm down lmao
---
Oh I totally get why it is the way it is. It’s just an odd situation where in typical game development if an ability is over/under powered they can buff or nerf it respectively. Here we want it to be the same as before, good or bad, but we (the players) don’t have a reference to how it originally was other than faulty memory. So rather than players saying “this isn’t right”; it’s more “oh, I guess that’s how it was.”
---
STV was overpopulated and being farmed hardcore that it was hard enough getting just the kills for the quest. I personally don't like having to fight the respawn boss/other players constantly while doing my grind.
---
But you don't even have a druid yet!
---
Or does it read any non-active chat windows you have? So could you create another window just for lfg/lfm and filter lfg channel out of your main window, and the addon still gather the info for you?
---
Well I have, and it's been called "retail" *long* before Blizzard used it in their folder hierarchy...
---
It was retail, because you bought it in a store.
---
First off it was as a joke not an argument. Second cross realm battlegrounds were a thing in late vanilla and will be part of classic. That’s already confirmed.
---
He literally gave one example of a singular person in a singular zone. He has no fucking clue what the actual faction balance is. He’s just salty horde are killing him.
---
If it's a blue sword with +8int +6spirit +4 str, it's for casters and hybrid like pallys, not warriors or rogues.
---
Just use your best judgement. If the person it makes the most sense for doesnt need it, other roles/,classes that can use it get first priority.
---
Nice insult. Really proving your point. 
---
You literally said “exhibit a of the gaming community”
---
Did you already forget? Remember when I said the things you are saying are contradicting?
---
There are far more pvp servers and of the servers that are full it's 8:1 in favor of pvp.
---
I dont really understand your argument at all to be honest.
---
I didnt say no one wants to play on a pve server. Just the vast majority want to be on a pvp server - which by the numbers is true.
---
This is on Thunderfury isn't it?
---
Were they named Faildozer? Human female war?
---
But it informs you about the weapon under discussion: only Warriors and Paladins can get it.  Doesn't matter who you are, if your class leader has it, then your class leader is either a Warrior or a Paladin.
---
It was supposed to be I guess but blizzard axed it because they were concerned that the room with all the corpses would've gotten them an M rating. I hope they do open it up.
---
As a third party following this thread, I get what you're saying.  Since computers can now handle big data, collecting mass amounts of consumer information is now actually viable and many companies are realizing it's worth putting out free/discounted, managed (eh, usually) services if they can get some of that information.
---
The question is how far are you willing to go to disconnect yourself.  Just using steam/twitch/youtube/amazon/reddit/any social media/search engines, etc. will accomplish most of the same things.
---
Weiner
---
Imagine if this dude just triple boxed but with 2 rogues with him at all times. Anyone who comes after him just gets sapped.
---
Only a couple of minutes
---
I have one that I use at the start of instances and large group PVP that yells "Come on you sons a bitches! Do you want to live FOREVER!"
---
Mate it's like that in real life, there is nice guys and dickheads. I wouldn't judge the community just yet until you escape the lower level areas.
---
You'll always remember that one arsehole over that one nice guy.
---
Or, if you want to play priest, it's dwarf or you're trolling.
---
I do this too! It’s more for when I’m bored of my main or need a sanity break. Always nice to log in and see a full level rested
---
Faerlina queues were way worse yesterday than they were the entire prior week
---
Tbh I didn’t read the post, too many wordz
---
You'll find that people tend to make rules in their head that typically lean in their favor when it suits them. I don't think you could use the stats the best seeing as how int is wasted on you. Ultimately it is not their call. You have just as much of a right to roll on an upgrade regardless of how slight, within reason of course.
---
Okay but when people are requesting 50 silver for two stacks it’s a little outrageous.
---
Anyone else noticed a difference b/t horde and ally? No one buffs me on my paladin but everyone buffs my shaman and he doesn't even give anything back in return.
---
This certainly isn’t the case for everyone. I’ve played a mage ever since tbc and am doing so in classic
---
I'd say ww axe for single target and Rav for air/ cleave. 
---
The str on we axe makes it very good
---
I do this to myself. "Oh no, my buff only has 19 minutes left. Better spend all my mana on that."
---
Beer with a burger and some fries.
---
That's a pretty sweet rp gimmick if they actually roll with 2 rogues.
---
ITT?
---
Is there a way to check the horde/alliance proportion on a server?
---
The XP from the graves is literally the reason people spam ZF. It’s like 3 pulls for fat xp
---
I haven't seen this in ages. Thank you!
---
All Blizz guaranteed is by the start of phase 2.
---
There are pet drops besides hunter pets?  (im new to Wow)
---
Yea pretty much every second mage I run into has no idea how to even play the class. So many nova the whole damn dungeon, blink into tank, the list goes on. Oh well all you mages enjoy trying to get geared. 
---
They have the "I only play it cause its OP according to streamers, reddit and the forums."
---
I think he's concerned about his local time and the realm's local time. 
---
7pm west coast raid time is 10PM for an east coast player.
---
I attacked a yeti that was dotted by a lock at the exact same time (coincidence) and being melee I got the tag. He got so pissed he feared every single mob I pulled for over an hour.
---
I've only ever gotten a big group of guildies together to retaliate for getting steamrolled by a group of alliance. This part is objectively what I most loved about pre-honor pvp in WoW. Best wow memory is the hours long battle for Hillsbrad I started when I dragged my guildies in to retaliate against the actions of a scum of the earth gnome mage that decided repeatedly sheeping me was funny as hell.
---
Dude it happens on both factions. I've been ganked and camped no matter what side I'm on, at the end of the day it's pretty sad corpse camping someone 10+ levels lower than you.
---
Pretty much all professions have methods for making gold. I believe they all have to get to a good point to start farming for whatever it is that can sell for a lot
---
Having positive interactions isn’t some new thing, I don’t get what games people been playing that they haven’t had positive interactions at all it seems. I mean hell my most played game before I got back in to wow was black ops 4 and you have the saltiest of salty play that and I have positive good will interactions with random individuals on that game all the time and literally the only objective in that game is to murder everything. It’s not going so wear off there are assholes in the world and there are kind hearted individuals. It’s more of a matter of real life RNG on which you run into.
---
and with their newest realm being low-pop and people over them already QQ'ing about dead realms... before the honeymoon phase is over for even half of the population...
---
Let me clarify. I am duo leveling with a healer so we often do red mobs... did the WW axe quest at 32....
---
hey its me ur random
---
It is precisely this side of the community that pushed me to a PvE server this play through...
---
You are so incredibly dense it's actually a bit ridiculous.
---
&gt;They know what they're doing, they wanna hit 60. Nothing wrong with that. Just like there's nothing wrong with you reading every single quest and spending 2 weeks in the Barrens.
---
That's a good way to put it, personally I agree with this now after a lot of consideration.
---
That said, the reason this particular discussion keeps being a thing is because you quite obviously have two types of players and how they approach the game. There's a cultural clash.
---
Inherently it doesn't matter, but it WOULD matter if blizzard would take that into consideration.(which they did with how the game was developed throughout its history).
---
I think the most common attribution of where it went wrong is that blizzard started appealing to the casual crowd, and going for the mass appeal. There's probably lots of truth there, but I'd also say the hardcore/endgame focused crowd is to blame as well.
---
At some point blizzard completely forgot that WoW's supposed to be an RPG, so many things were removed/changed in the pursuit of efficiency and min/max that the end result is a game focused solely on high level content and spending bigger numbers and nothing else.
---
The argument that "you can play the game whatever way you wish" doesn't really ALWAYS work, since the game is a MMO and the gameplay tends to be shaped by the players a lot. This is also then reflected in how the game works and what blizzard allows.
---
For example: addons like questie change the gameplay/experience a lot. Sure quest addons were a thing for a long time, even in vanilla--but not many people used them. Mankrik's wife meme, riddle/map quests, etc. are all nullified by using an addon like that.
---
Lol at Rogues...rip
---
Hit 30 last night and learned mind control. Was gonna hop on the booty bay boat today..
---
You probably played pretty casually then and not trying to clear savage/ultimate fights on release. You can get by in most content playing any class pretty terribly, but both the mechanics and class optimization of ff14 are leagues beyond classic.
---
Lol is it really that important? As you tag me in another comment because you want me to read some other strangers reply. Lol.
---
Thanks this is great
---
dumb question but can you teach a cat the charge ability?
---
And if so, do you have to learn charge 2 and then teach it charge 2 as well or does it auto level?
---
Keep a list goin gof these ppl so you dont party with them endgame,
---
Fuck me, years of vanilla wow and private servers and I've never once thought to listen to blueboy
---
I went through this married already. Quit after wrath because of her.
---
I'm divorced now. Have been for a minute. I just opened a new account this morning. I think I am going to be here for a few expansions. Having so much fun and zero guilt.
---
BFA is non canon. The opening of the dark portal split our timelines and on this time line we will prevent the dark portal from being opened.
---
That's not good.
---
I had one in august, idk what happened to her, she must still be somewhere in the house I guess.
---
I mean I'm not saying its an exploit or anything.
---
Also ferals are only good at threat gen in dungeons or if they are overgeared and also if the war doesn't have tf.
---
Once the warrior gets overgeared they can fury tank and feral falls behind again, not to mention warrior is massively higher damage mitigation.
---
&gt;Cat dps with power shifting is respectable, it's not too tier, but neither are other classes you probably wouldn't flinch at bringing along.
---
Cat dps with MCP and power shifting is absolutely top tier, but finding someone willing to put in the effort is rare and most other classes will do better with 1/10th as much effort.
---
As often as I can so long as the xp payout is still good. I'm 38 now and have been in SM since 29. I ran SFK for 2-3 levels. WC I ran probably 3-4 times, RFC about the same.
---
But what about when you’re not in a party and someone demands water?
---
Ive played for 500+ days on retail and at least another 150 on pservers.
---
Ive been logging into wow since 11/23/04. Ive played a lot.
---
I found a new quest I've never done before on the border of Dustwallow and Barrens yesterday.
---
You should be more worried about the priest who's just waiting for you to get on open water
---
in aoe runs, this tends to bug out the blizzard slow, similarly to frostbolt in my experience. For safety, we usually just blizzard them down as we don't run out of mana anyways.
---
Holy shit it actually works!
---
Okay yeah hmm...I’m not entirely sure I’ll look into it when I have time
---
How do you handle bosses? Just nuke and kite?
---
we are "casual hardcore" players. we play non stop but were not like, hardcore..uh yeah..
---
And being this kind of hunter would get you added to my friends list. Any group of people I party with for dungeons or even just a group quest if they show their worth while I go out of my way to not only put them in my Friends List but leave a note so I can remember who they are and that I need to party with them again.
---
Steve Blum is Rexxar in HotS though. (Also voices Dehaka and Abathur).
---
I don't believe you for one second, "every expansion to max level" the level of blatant lying here is just insane, you get off on it or something?
---
I have a mole?!
---
Disagree, you don't have flying when an expansion starts. I greatly enjoyed the atmosphere of the BfA zones, especially Drustvar.
---
If you made it to 39 without doing stranglethorn you can do the quests more quickly and it will be really great fast xp and gold
---
Probably some people did but there wasn't streamers.
---
The more water you give the priest, the more they can spam drinks between pulls.
---
You might think 20 is enough, but it's not.
---
Don't get me started on the whole "it takes a long time to make all that water" nonsense. Theres always going to be 10 minutes or so waiting for somebody.
---
The dungeons are really easy. On pservers you have to mark and CC bigger pulls because the mobs in dungeons literally do 3x the damage as Classic. People in beta were freaking out about it, until Blizzard confirmed "yes the dungeons are actually this easy".
---
Add Ons track trends. If an item is a "hot item," people get clued in and then start mass farming it. I'm not talking about natural crafting progression that happens over time. I'm talking about any item (including mats) spiking up in mere hours due to add ons that scan the AH and spot trends. The price on any hot item for any catagory will become deflated in a matter of hours. Natural progression takes longer than that. 
---
It has happened to all of my friends in varied professions since classic started back up. I was the only one farming certain herbs for money. I'm a priest and due to spec since my guild dungeons a ton I cannot really gold grind on mobs. I started listing herbs and certain potions (which you can make decent money with) and the price would deflate in hours. 
---
I'd go out to farming spots that were empty for weeks prior and find level 35s in places lower level places like the Barrens farming wool or Briarthorn. For example, I kept searching the AH for Kingsblood to level up alchemy and there was none over a course of 3-5 days I spotted a potential market need so I decided to farm it. My first 4 bushels of Kingsblood sold for for 1.5g pretty much instantly. Well, the add ons must have spotted a trend because within literally 2 hours there were 100 bushels in the AH for gradually decreasing amounts until the final price settled around 25g. Went to my farming spot and its swarming with people picking herbs. Same thing happened in a matter if hours with oily blackmouth, briarthorn, and elixirs of water breathing. 
---
It's annoying because add ons remove a lot of the skill of playing the AH. You don't need to be smart and predictive - just use AH addons to scan and have a lot of free time to farm to take advantage of the trend.
---
Worth using for someone like me who has a total of like 4 subbed months over 15 years at least to get started. 
---
I feel like once quests become longer in the later levels it becomes less relevant. Questie has made it really easy for me to start up a character and get it to level 10. After that it's been a bit spotty. 
---
That other user gives it a 60-70% but in my experience it's more like an 80% or higher. Sometimes you need to reload it to get proper quest markers and it gives you "!" markers for quests you've already accepted sometimes.
---
I tried watching this several times but your cast bar overlapping your frames makes me want to vomit.
---
“We told you so” -Blizz after botching the release and opening 70% of the servers AFTER launch thus sabotaging existing character names, experience, and splitting friend groups trying to roll together.
---
As long as I can keep sacrificing horde to the Blackrock Mountain lava pit, I’m good.
---
I think you mistook phase 2 for "2 weeks".
---
Grobb is pretty balanced, though the horde seems to be more aggressive
---
Mace spec rogue is really the only viable combat tree PvP spec there is.
---
Stalagg queue monitor?
---
&gt;and nearly die as a result
---
I know what I can heal specifically when my guild tank is tanking. He constantly says he almost dies. 
---
Major rule of healing. 
---
Your total health doesnt matter. If nobody dies then it literally doesnt matter. A win is still a win
---
Only 2 classes can get and use it. One of them, *not a warrior*, got it. Hmmm. Such riddle, much difficult.
---
Wow Sulfuras is full. Can’t wait to see what it is like tonight
---
Unless that Warrior is an Orc. Also, if this is including level 60 and CDs, that means the Warrior also has a trinket, which means at least 1, if not 2+ stuns the Orc Warrior can resist.
---
Yeah, they are little companion pets.  The don't do anything other than look neat.  The Dark Whelpling that is shown is one of 3 whelping pets that are all rare chance to drop.
---
Low quality water setting? A man who understands what "classic experience" means I see, right on!
---
Good mages do not own hunters lol....I'd say it's more 50/50 and who utilizes eng/trinkets and cooldown timings more properly. Same with rogue vs mage. 
---
The only class a mage owns with one hand on his tiny dick and the other scratching his neckbeard while smashing his forehead on the keyboard is a warrior.
---
Benediction had a 10 min queue last night. It's been 2 weeks with no queue (besides maybe 1 min). They even opened free servers off Benediction. Are they removing layers or are we growing?
---
I much prefer single server BGs. The only thing I could think that would be a compromise would be for Blizzard to only allow cross server BGs on smaller servers.
---
For the love of all that is sane.NO 😂.
---
Hm yeah thought so. Don't know if I'm so keen on play mage though but have to decide on something soon. Thanks for reply.
---
People ninjaing ore or mobs or quest items or chests when they can clearly see its yours, sucks.  
---
Life is rough as a rogue as you run towards a mob and the hunter behind you fires an arrow over your head and taunts the 20min spawn off of you.
---
I guess it's just people.  They probably pull the same sh%#t IRL.
---
But we're all on the same server.  I keep notes of these types of interactions, dates, events.  It will be a community of 60s soon where we all know each other and this behavior will come back and bite you.
---
&gt; under the water in the middle of Ashara.
---
That sounds really uncomfortable for her!
---
I don’t find much fun in melee DPS, and I know in terms of questing that’s primarily what it is for druids. I enjoy healing, and I know you can do that with druids late game, but it’s not too viable questing. I do love their healing spells though. I think their HoTs are some of the best in the game.
---
I'm thinking about going Druid just because of the bandwagon effect of Mages/Warriors... Hate doing the same thing as everyone else.
---
Sources please.
---
It's good for getting a vague idea about quest hubs being the correct level without looking it up outside the game.  It's been pretty good at leading me to the right area for grabbing quest items, or the mobs I need to kill.
---
Most of the errors I've seen have been post 30, or on some cases not an error, sort of.  IE: it was certain that there was a quest in darkshire, but I could never get the quest giver to give the quest.  In the future, while looking up cooking recipes, I found out that the quest won't show unless you had enough cooking skill.
---
chances are it doesn’t have an actual pattern in game then. if it’s taught by a trainer i don’t think it has a pattern since you don’t need to loot it to get it
---
All power to you to roll need on BoPs that u only need for gold. Just know what goes around comes around. Especially on classic. As a tank, I would give you one warning, then if you did it again i would kick you from group asap, no discussion. Then I would never inv u to group or group with you again. The list of tanks that wouldnt group with u will grow over time. Before you know it will take you hours to find a tank.
---
I dinged in gchat yesterday because I hit level 22 and that's when a rogue becomes a rogue. Had to advertise. :)
---
I get enjoyment killing the opposite faction, and that's enough for me.
---
I'm in Un'goro atm so every alliance I see dies, questing or not. You never know if any of those fuckers have skinning and will try to take MY devilsaur leather.
---
At some point you might be asked to sheep.  Instead of sheeping immediately, wait for the mob to get a little closer to the party.  That way, when it comes time to move to the next target, the group isn't potentially running into other mobs or pats.
---
Yeah i had my horse at 40. Its a pretty straight forward grind. Do as many darn rep quests as you can to save yourself runecloth. Then just turn in runecloth. Marrowgrain honestly rarely felt worth it. if you have herbalism its way better
---
grobb is pretty balanced right now
---
I don’t think a server has over 50k players.
---
Not everyone is cut out for a game that doesn't play itself for you. Shame, really.
---
What are you playing now?
---
There is no way that you played this game for that long and never saw or heard someone talking about the auction house.
---
Remind you of what?
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Kirtonos
---
Look at literally every PvP server and tell me you don't see a pattern.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Tanks should have to watch healer's mana because healers shouldn't have mana problems.
---
I'd be fine with the post if it was "Hey guys, I'm a new healer so sometimes I have mana troubles. Remember to keep your newbie healers in mind when pulling!"
---
But instead the OP decided to be an egotistical diva and blame other people for them being awful.
---
???
---
/u/Shu_WoW what class are your playing? Cool character
---
Yes, actually being in the world and having to pvp to survive versus sitting in the comfort of a dungeon for 60 levels will teach you about dead zones.
---
Sapped commenters can't say no..
---
Oops guess I misremembered phase 2 as 2 weeks, my bad, cheers
---
Besides the fact that I always loved warlocks in vanilla but never played one to the end game, one of the biggest attractions for me to the class besides everything about it, was the summoning 
---
I’m someone that is very vocal and not afraid to message people in game, so I’m usually the party leader throwing the group together, and doing so as a warlock is fucking cake in my experience so far 
---
LFM &lt;Dungeon&gt; - have summons 
---
Gets me instant replies constantly, and I think it’s because there are players watching the channel but aren’t nearby, but still want to go, and they see that have summons and think, fuck yeah, time to go
---
It’s also super nice when you join a group that’s been running for a minute and you can give everyone the chance to sell/repair
---
True
---
When people sign up for a pvp server I'm not sure what else they are expecting... Griefing is completely fine on a pvp server in my opinion. You are warring factions, why would you just let the others do anything that benefits them without hassling. Blocking the boat, instances, resources, world bosses...whatever. All fair game, you cannot pick and choose.
---
War Stomp is more of an emergency move, IMO.  Not something you'd work into your usual questing rotation.
---
Welcome to Oakland, bitch!
---
no not with great accuracy anyway
---
I do the same thing, but i make the chat box smaller. It helps to have a wide monitor too!
---
"elbow grease"
---
yeah... something like that
---
What would be a situation where someone being punished by this is good?
---
it's a fact the dungeons are easy af in retail
---
Seriously this is nothing compared to the wars that happened twice on Thalnos, last Sunday we were like 180 people counting allies/hordies
---
When is Questie not going to be garbage?
---
I did not expect a serious answer with a title like this 😆
---
Seriously who are the people just making shit up? Just because the warrior gets to overpower doesn’t mean rogues don’t just totally assblast them.
---
R/whoosh
---
Be quick to max level and connect to people. You may want to be one of the first priests to join the first raid group. You may have to respec, though. I don't know :))
---
The undead male dance works absolutely perfectly with the wand animation. The way the thrashing leads into the wand swing. Perfection.
---
god i love the return of quality griefing
---
Very challenging. I had to do it so many times to kill each demon. No pet sucks.
---
I actually respecced not long ago, and reallocated the point that gives you those skills.
---
My 2h axe skill remained and didn't reset. Idk if it saves it permanently or only for a bit after a respec, but it didn't reset on me.
---
His source is classicrealminfo.com but he musta looked at the wrong server. That screenshot doesn't match their data for rattlegore.
---
I find that I mostly prefer questing - so even if dungeon farming with a good group is better XP per hour, I'll go back to questing. The times where I run an instance multiple times is when there's certain items I'm after.
---
Or my more recent version...
---
Me: Mortal Strike!
---
*miss*
---
Me: Ok, Whirlwind!
---
Me: Ok, guess I'll stand here like an idiot with no rage
---
Yeah only one at a time drops.  Eye of Divinity also has a chance to drop which is for the Priest staff Benediction.  I don't know if there's ever been a leaf and an eye drop at the same time though.  
---
But it really sets you apart from other hunters.  It basically is a symbol that proves you know what you're doing.  I'm hoping it still stays somewhat rare.
---
nope.    
---
Opening multiples realms on launch was the good move to avoid dead realms.  
---
I played on Vanilla, avoiding dead realms is a must, and with this thing in the long run Classic will be healthy.
---
There is no greater death than suffocation by female tauren snuggles.
---
It's true, if you need the set crafted on Smolderweb we can craft them all. PM me if you need them. Or whisper Sublination. He got server first after like 5 days and then proceeded to devilsaur farm.
---
The only reason i'm not trasnfering to Judgement is because I'm sure I'd lose my name. How is the server?
---
Uldum feels like a case study of what most if not all of the zones remade in Cata became- meme infested happy fun times. 
---
I loved it and the Harrison Jones references totally amused me, but it also is a prime example of Blizzard's departure from serious zones and quests. I can definitely see how many Classic players wouldn't have enjoyed the revamped style.
---
Also check out the Twitch app, not for checking out streams but because it comes with a great mod manager.
---
You can search for an install mods through that app instead of having to find the correct versions online and move them to the add-ons folder.
---
Sure it's minor but made installing Add-Ons way simpler for me. Just look up some add-on guides to see what I want, search for it in the Twitch app, click install.
---
Actually chuckled out loud at work 🤣
---
As life ebbs, terrible vistas of emptiness reveal themselves
---
Aw come on man, gotta support the team in pvp...
---
Thats not totally true, you could skill weapons on grey mobs in vanilla, it may have changed at some point in vanilla but i know for a fact because I used the stockades to level the first bit of new weapon types at lvl 60
---
Kinda. There are some ranged mobs that you can fight as mage, and it's much easier if you exploit the dead zone. Rather than standing far away and casting fireball / frostbolt and getting hit.
---
I agree there's no problem here.  I write down your characters name, and never group with you.  Everyone wins.
---
I feel like I'm not 100% sure which professions I want to stay with long term.
---
I really like farming, so right now I'm skinning &amp; mining. I know mining will be great long term, but I might switch out skinning for herbalism. The only thing holding me back is the inability to have both active at the same time.
---
Does anyone have any success with mining &amp; herbalism at endgame? Any good macros or easy ways to track both?
---
That’s just an issue derived from people not wanting to leave their realm and stubbornly expecting others to do so instead. Problem is that the majority of people have that mindset so nobody is moving to the new realms.
---
It is vanilla, just later.
---
A lot was changed between release and 1.12.
---
Had a level 6 Night elf whisper me from Teldrassil, asking me to make a SW portal for him. I was questing in the Badlands (so early level 40s) and found this request so funny that I told him I'll do it if he pays me 3 Gold travel expanses. He's like "you are toxic and the reason this community goes to shit". I wanted to respond and explain that his request is a rather big one but I was on ignore already.
---
That being said... What's up with people adding you to ignore instantly? I can't remember people being so ignore trigger easy ever. I wanted to sell a level 19 BoE the other day to get the last 5 gold for my mount. I know it will be worth much, much more ones battle grounds hit so I know I'm already at a loss but I'm impatient. Someone whispers me a counter offer "1g", level 56 mage. I knew he was trying to screw me over so I'm like "counter offer: 4,99g", he was like fuck off and I went on ignore immediately. Some people man, some people.
---
does it work for you?
---
Nobody knows but I would assume not accurate at all based on what it says for some of the realms.
---
Wow I had completely lost that memory. Damn I definitely have memories hopping around there with my little frog.
---
Told my dad this and he said...”you can dance if you wand to”
---
Lol I do this to everyone and I love it
---
Retail noobs!
---
What's that now?
---
It’ll all be worth it brother
---
Keeping notes of this is pretty pathetic.
---
yes both ELV and TUK work perfectly fine
---
Twice now I've crit clapped a paladin for over 450 with chain lightning at level 33ish. No wonder they gave the alliance shaman in bc.
---
your melees are fine to use in vanilla if the mob reaches you. eventually you’ll get slowing shots and traps to help you, as well as a slowing melee strike
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
Yea those naga mobs are DEEP underwater
---
As a side note, it's amazing how one item can enable a certain otherwise dead specs in such... spectacular ways. Just imagine if proper itemization was more prevalent...
---
Of course not :-)
---
I did the hinterlands elite quests last night.  The group was mage warrior lock and two feral druids (I was one of the druids).  The other Druid didn’t have an int set so I pulled out the set I’ve been building in the case of just this eventuality.  The Druid tries to tank and does none of the little quality of life stuff I do and is way less geared for healing than I am since he was rocking about 800 less hp than me at just one level lower, I’m sure his Armor was also way lower.
---
The quality stuff being never pre-hotting himself to save some of my mana or that little extra threat from it, and he never hit my oft-oom ass with an innervate, he also never pulled anything out but just charged in but this also had to do with the warrior also charging in.  It was very frustrating and makes me all the more happy to paying attention to the little stuff that makes it a bit easier on a healer.  I felt like I spent a good half the time drinking.
---
As a tank I break your sheeps out of spite if I dont ask for it, or if the pull hasnt gone sideways.
---
Fuck you, I can manage 4 mobs--I like the rage and tab targeting is what makes the class fun.
---
A good mage is always ready to sheep mid pull to save the group (its key that they dont need express instruction here, they need to know when to sheep), but they are never over eager to poly shit on pull.
---
Need a Horde version!
---
The fire resistance/immunity of the early raid tiers is a huge ball buster.
---
On the other hand, PvP can get pretty silly with Frost.  Good frost mages are so frustrating to deal with.
---
Volley does decent damage, but with the mana pool, you'll get two off before you're OOM and need a drink
---
I mean, Age of Conan actually had bare breasts and nipples showing if you went topless (of either gender).  So this is kind of tame.
---
Need to learn kiting and weaving in autoshots. Best way to see how is YouTube.
---
I think people use Zygor. But I don't know if that is paid or not.
---
I've got a bird and a cat pet that I was thinking to sell down the line. I doubt either are very rare, but I've also been wondering what they could be worth or if they're even worth anything at all. I imagine farming the bird would be really easy
---
People are impatient dicks, though. Especially those elitist types. I already quit playing with my brother and his idiot work mates on alliance because all they do is yell at each other about healing or DPS numbers....
---
We were literally just to BFD. I said, "hey, you're letting me die -- stop being so judgmental" and suddenly I'm the piece of shit...I rerolled an undead warlock and I hope I get to kill them :) a lot. I get to kill my sister-in-law's hunter, too! This is truly a magnificent day.
---
level alchemy bro. Mail/Plate seem to be pretty abundant and i can't mention the amount of times a rejuvenation potion has helped me. Give you int/stam/def/agi buffs as well, and they're all 60min
---
Had a group whisper me in Badlands asking if I could help summon to Uldaman. I was near the flight point, but had just got my mount so I was all about running ovee! One of the players waited too long to take the summon and I had to run back and rejoin to summon again. I just wanted to put my mount to use but got tipped a couple of gold, dude even chased me asking me to stop to pay. Just having the feeling of being useful for my specific class talent was enough for me to say yes! I'm loving the community.
---
Quest line from a drop in MC.   Quest involves you killing 4 Demons that are hidden in the world which have a weakness to your Abilities.   
---
If I remember right Winterspring was Serpents Sting, Burning Steps  was Scropid Sting, Ungoro was Viper Sting, and Silithus was Wing Clip or Raptor Strike.    
---
Kicker was anyone trying to attack those mobs would force them to reset.  Respawn timer was 8 hours.  
---
You could also get a Purple Quiver from Farming the Elite Dragons in the Wintersping Cave.  The part would drop without having the quest, but you couldn't turn that portion in till after the you've gotten the quest from Molten Core.
---
Paladin is probably the strongest 1v1 class, back in vanilla with blue honor gear and unstoppable force i was a match vs many aq40 and r14 geared people.
---
I guess I know what bucket of people you fall into.  Awesome.
---
what are you talking about? whats the swing timer on your weapon?
---
The next auto attack will happen exactly the swing timer seconds after your war stomp goes off. and has a 0.5 second cast time so if I want to interrupt a heal with whirlwind axe (3.4 timer) I will auto attack 3.9 seconds after i click war stomp.
---
wowhead guide lmao.
---
&gt; Because you’re saying the servers are built by layers
---
I never said that.
---
Not saying horde don't have it bad.. but let's be honest here.  On most servers the majority of players are horde and world PvP is a damn nightmare for the alliance side.
---
My only recommendation would be to use the Questie addons. It shows all available quests and their levels and where to hunt the quest objectives, close to the modern day quest trackers.
---
Nit exactally an ingame guide but quite helpful none the less.
---
I disagreed with them then and they had a 6 month cooldown before transferring a character again
---
Ahh boo hoo people trade him gold and I have no friends and I don't get traded gold, wHaT aN aSsHoLe.
---
With Paladin.
---
In STV it seemed pretty balanced, and there was always some sort of fighting going on. 
---
Ally seems to have the numbers, but it didn’t seem like anything overwhelming.
---
That's a strange way to spell Alliance. It's Alliance Season, not Horde, Rabbit, or Duck season.
---
It had the opposite effect on me.  I quit back at the start of Cata, but resubbed at the start of August.  I played around with Retail a bit, revisiting my old characters.  I started doing some quests, and it felt more like watching a movie than having an adventure.  Follow this arrow... talk to this guy... follow this arrow to the glowing spot on your map...  I couldn't stick with it for very long.
---
Last night in Classic though, I was tanking for a particularly bad ZF group.  We kept wiping, but I didn't want to abandon them, and eventually we cleared the instance, and I felt proud.  Like I had accomplished something.
---
Maybe just dont be shit at wpvp
---
You kinda can actually. My unarmed is like 180 atm at lvl 47 from farming buzzards for mount (fuck their disarm) and I often crit 80-120 while disarmed and regular hit around 50. It's not great, but it's something.
---
Why is this an image though?
---
It depends what you want to do. If its only dps in raids you might be out of luck depending on what kind of guild you find. Some bring a spriest for the debuff but others will just have a healer that shadow weaves. I am rolling a spriest right now but plan on mostly pvp.
---
It's set that way by default to fade out of range players.
---
Ah yes because someone that doesn’t like something automatically makes them a BFA player.
---
Similar thing happened to my group a couple days ago.  So after we wipe, now there's this massive pile of mobs around the altar, and I'm healing, but the tank gets killed during my heal cast (it hadn't been a problem at all during the instance, and I'd been heal cancel-casting but he took a big spike of damage).  My fault on that one, should have cancelled the big heal and done a PW:S + Flash Heal.
---
The tank ended up having to repair, but we had a warlock, so we said just hearth to town (Orgrimmar for him) and we'll summon you back.  Unfortunately, we then found out you can't summon someone from outside the instance into the instance.  So the rest of us had to run back outside the entrance and summon from outside.  Luckily the rest of the run went without a hitch.  Sure did get sick of running to the entrance as a ghost and then back through the dungeon, but that is part of the charm and what makes these runs memorable.
---
&gt;I don't think ultra shredded men are a female fantasy. That's more male power fantasy
---
They're definitely a Male fantasy over female.  I would guess most women would prefer men who look like Jacob from Twilight or 90's Brad Pitt over some super buff body builder. To clarify, "gender fantasy" I meant gendered fantasies from the male perspective.
---
I have had one single person offering me a tip. I was kind of busy and throw in my last stack of water and he tipped me 70s and went away. I was like "... Almost one gold for one stack? Man I feel like shit now."
---
I have never been tipped again. I gave water and food for many many people asking for it while traveling and Noone ever bothered to tip me. Know I usually act afk until they go away.
---
Propaganda at it's best lol
---
What class gets the most out of leatherworking?
---
Well you just hit level 10 so now you just need to do your hunter quest and then your pet can tank for you so you can stay ranged
---
Take care of your marriage guys/ladies, the game ain't worth it, really
---
From my experience it's usually the horde who travel in packs. Otherwise they are cry babies and rage cause their bony undead ass gets ganked by superior gnomes and dwarves
---
Everyone's playing Alliance on my server, so quite the opposite...
---
So you want TBC features in Vanilla? This change would specifically gimp one class with a very unique spell that isnt matched by any others. That is extremely anti-classic.
---
Professions are my "relax and just screw off" thing. Always has been. Fishing, herb grinding, it's cathartic kind of like playing Minecraft. Not a lot of thought in it, you just relax and don't have to think about much. Especially because the launch coincided with some RL work I'm doing which involved hundreds of sexual assaults (work in criminal justice). So it was a good way to unwind and forget all the horrible shit I read all day.
---
And lets not forget that the rested XP requires an inn or major city. Nothing like being off for 2-3 days and logging in to you standing in a forest. Me and my brother have been grinding professions so much we cant even get reagents for my shit anymore or use most of the items.
---
Even people trying to be helpful is annoying. When I'm AoE grinding, I want all my mobs together, at the same HP and with the same speed debuffs. If a straggler gets stunned, Blizzard isn't going to hit him and he'll run at me at full speed, cancelling my cast and fucking up the whole pull.
---
Yeah I didn't realize how much I missed my sword skill racial until I upgraded my weapon and tried to fight +4 mobs. Damn convenient axes!
---
It's not busted at all. You have to hold it in your off hand , its the most obvious shit ever. The item is overrated as fuck.
---
&gt; Yeah, Thunderfury.
---
Pshhh....Hunter weapon.
---
Hell yeah it does man! :D
---
Leveling staves was easy.   Kite one of those mobs from Blasted Lands into Stormwind and afk on guards hitting it.
---
Not in the case of BOE. The group should have a quick chat and determine on the spot what people are going to do. At this stage in the game the gold brought in is as important as someone getting that item.
---
&gt; They will just kill you cause youre missing an off hand.
---
A large portion of the classes are able to do significant damage and healing without a proper offhand.
---
&gt; Its overrated as fuck and not required to pvp at all.
---
I agree with this statement.  However, knowing how elitist some of the private server folks are, they will squeeze as much performance out of the game that they can.  Which means using skulls, FAP, and other expensive consumables during PvP.
---
And where the high tier folks go, the masses will try to emulate.  See people bitching that they can't kill Rag in greens like APES.  You will get groups where they will require skulls to join.  And even if it isn't required to pvp, the masses trying to play as the 1% will be very hostile to anyone who doesn't tick the right check boxes.  Human priest?  Tauren warrior/hunter?  GTFO.
---
Regardless.  Classic is not perfect and I'd rather see balance changes based on how the meta game progresses instead of being frozen at 1.13 and watching the game warp around the most OP option.  This is why rock/paper/scissors works (in theory) for game balance.  If each class or role has a weakness, it will never dominate the game.  If rock was no longer weak to paper, paper has no place in the game.  Then scissors has no place because there is no paper anymore.
---
also on krom and this has been my experience. Desolate got annoying in the kodo GY because its right next to a horde post but that was it 
---
i avoided STV till 43 due to people complaining about it and its been fine since then
---
Paladins? Lol I find them the most boring and easy to dispose of class if they're solo no matter their spec or level. They are damageless autoattackers with buffs.
---
I always feel so bad when I'm just popping a frost nova so the newly spawned on top of me guy doesn't immediately kill me. Now I've tagged it and I don't want it!
---
Damn my fishing is exactly 0, I need to up my game.
---
I was fishing in Feralas, leveling from 225 to 300, and halfway through it started raining. It rained for a good 20/30 minutes. It was cool.
---
Funny you bring that up (tanks in every group) My best groups have no tank. They just slow you down, do zero damage, and usually have the attitude you are showing now. DO WHAT I SAY IM TANK HURKA DURK.
---
Been aoe grinding since level 25 in stockades to level 50 in ZF with ZERO TANKS. So you aren't in every group? So again, why does a worthless class playing a worthless role (pre 60) think he has the right to dictate pull speed? You are a detriment and should thank them for even taking you there in the first place.
---
zug zug
---
This was my goal as a hunter main back in Vanilla but I never was able to make it happen. Yet you have it 2 weeks into release? Madness. Grats homie!
---
Phrasing
---
My guess is you're one of those people that do exactly what I described, which is why you felt the need to start trolling.  It's ok man, hang in there.  You'll get away with it once, twice, maybe 100 times.  But there's that one time it's going to cost you big, and then remember what I said.  
---
100% guaranteed you pull this sh#%t IRL.  Please dont have kids.    Let's move the planet forward.
---
Except the whole “always outnumbered” thing.
---
Had the same issue with a runner keeping us in combat. He ended up running all the way to the locked door. At least it stopped my rage from decreasing.
---
I wish something could be done about this without opening the nochanges box
---
Reducing instance resets per hour would be the only somewhat realistic thing
---
It doesn't.
---
Doot doot reminder.
---
I was looking for something like this last night, thanks so much
---
Transferred to Heartseeker from Stalagg and very happy with it. Population is getting better by the day, AH is looking healthy, and they just opened transfers from a few more servers to Heartseeker.
---
I highly recommend the transfer, as it will save you on queue times now, and probably more in the future as Blizzard attempts to get rid of layering.
---
Say what you will, but thicc boi still got'em.
---
*OOM and annoyed healer has joined the chat.*
---
Hope you got an int buff to make it a little quicker.
---
Or don’t. To each their own!
---
he's being a dick because FAP's aren't usually helpful vs rogues because they don't remove current stuns...they have to be used preemptively...which obviously rogues can reset and wait out. 
---
You'll find more use via a living action potion which removes current stuns and makes you immune for ~5 secs after.
---
PS: this is under the assumption that we're talking about where the rogue is opening. If you catch a rogue 30 yards away with a DoT and he doesn't reset then...well gg what an idiot.
---
Name? Of the pet
---
Thank you. I’ve been following a a streamer called Mighty Teapot (old guild wars 2 streamer) and had a lot of fun watch but not all the abbreviations are with me :)
---
This is what wow is all about friend! lok'tar ogar
---
On the My Journey page of Questie, it will show the available quests that are even mob drop start quests? Even if I have to google the quest to find out what mob to kill, all I need to just a list of every quest possible.
---
Because  we are not trying to re-create Burning Crusade? The whole idea of a theoretical classic+  is to introduce new content, new ways of doing things. Why would we just do things the same way as in the past? Just because it didn’t require anything other than buying an expansion to open the portal in the past means what?   That the portal should just remain closed and never lead to anything, or they should just open it and put all the Burning Crusade content in there?
---
What happened to layering holy shit.
---
I'm glad I'm not so miserable
---
South Sithilus has a good one. I got 51-60 there in 5 hours.

---
This guy wins the server Epeen award!
---
The horde can theoretically hit the upper 40s without ever stepping in a contested zone.  Much dungeon grinding required (and some of the mobs will be grey in them, probably)
---
Why don't you just enjoy the version of the game that JUST DROPPED for a year before you start telling blizzard what you want to see next.
---
Y’all need to chill with ur 80 stack water requests. I’ll give you 40 for free in a dungeon. Any more and you better be giving me $$$. Open world? You also better be tipping or fk off and buy it from the vendor. 
---
To those who are super nice in a dungeon or open word? I give extra. 
---
But some of y’all need to chill.

---
Your there as a healer? Need healing gear. Others in the group need loot too. If nobody needs a dps piece of yours (the dps/tank greed) then you can take it. If the dps gear is more important stop healing and dps, there are other healers out there.
---
And always pass spirit gear to the priest.
---
I honestly got more cloth stuff than my first aid needed.
---
Does the addon read all the acronyms and different spellings people use for dungeons as well? Such as SM Lib, SM Cath, DM/VC, ZF, etc? I rarely see people using the full name of the dungeon.
---
It’s #1 on my server. Saw some census data about it. I was floored.
---
I always enjoy viewing things this way. It's like your toon is a larger than life representation of what's "really" going on. That kobold you killed? In the lore it was 2 guys who killed 4. That 30 minute run? That was a 4 day journey. These types of things are fun mental exercises to headcanon things.
---
Mindless grinding is fun to me. I think all day at work, I don't wanna come home and do anything involving effort or planning. It's the same reason I'm still playing Diablo.
---
I likes ya, and I wants ya. Now, we can do this the EASY way, or... the HARD way, Tom. Which it gonna be?
---
Same age and I always come crawling back to WoW.   
---
I will play pretty intensely for a few months on each release and eventually cancel my sub and come back in the latter part of the expac.  
---
But something about Vanilla WoW has been calling me lately.. I am highly interested in jumping into the rolled back world with the old mechanics, skill trees, jank.
---
Yah was surprised to see it at medium and actually see people in the cities chatting and sitting at the AH. First couple days it was completely dead but it’s been filling up nicely.
---
From what I've read it's decently balanced class-wise but some specs are virtually useless. And there is still definitely a tier-list.
---
If you’re evil, camp the turn in and cure everyone that comes near!
---
im cool with classic wow... 
---
IM not cool with classic bugs... 
---
they should have fixed this shit before they released classic.
---
nice
---
Tens of thousands of people paying 15 dollars a month does not equal crazy money? ;p
---
I believe the problem with that addon was that it actually automated the creating of groups and invite of players. Something that merely parses chat and makes it more readable might not be an issue.
---
To be fair, it wouldn't have taken them any effort to just not spoil it for OP who clearly didn't know. What was the point of so bluntly dropping that spoiler? Nobody asked.
---
Last night I was waiting for Lord Ror to spawn at his camp in felwood I look away for a minute and of course he spawns and a priest and a shaman tag him and laugh when I asked for an invite. They kill him and I'm stuck waiting again. I notice they are trying to do the kill x amount of A, B and C quest in the area that I had already done. I remember the Pathfinders are harder to find then the warriors and gardeners. So me being the over leveled for the area hunter I spend the next 5-10 minutes killing just pathfinders many times right in front of them.
---
I feel no remorse.
---
Yes, and then you get the 29.7 dps Vanquishers Sword from the RFD quest
---
Rumors of warriors being too hard to level have been exaggerated
---
It is a little bit tough, until you get a weapon upgrade. Then kinda sluggish after some levels.
---
Then you get a new weapon and its back to destroying again
---
Jesus this subreddit blows
---
&gt;Why blame the gaming community? Seems pretty stupid to blame an entire community for something that’s more of a human moral problem.
---
Well I mean you kind of perpetuated a more "holy than thou" attitude by just straight up stating "seems pretty stupid" could have rephrased it in a nicer "non" circle jerking fashion for Retail.
---
Anything the same or 1 higher lvl than you is gonna be like a boss fight.
---
Well I play a mage along with friends who play warrior and priest, so we do 'normal' dungeons for the most part - with AoE pulls whenever possible for efficiency.  My tank can hold aoe aggro well, you just need to give them time to grab threat (I'm usually drinking from the last pull so that lets him build sufficient threat).  Charging in with CoC &gt; FN &gt; Blizz as soon as he pulls is always gonna be a bad idea :D
---
Villainous Scum
---
&gt;That doesn’t work because **/who returns results from the entire realm**, not just from your layer, and if the result set is too large it truncates the results before sorting them. This means every player gets different results, but those differences in result set have nothing to do with which layer you’re on. This has led some people to claim that they’ve discovered dozens of layers per realm, but that claim is completely false.
---
Glad to see the Devilsaur mafias are alive and well.
---
Yes, don't do this. Just because you have the spare time doesn't make it a good idea. If you have to hide the game, it means you'll likely be fired if you get caught.
---
That being said, the hidden files property won't stop services with NT/Auth privileges from finding it. Not to mention the fact that hiding the files doesn't change the fact that wow.exe and battlenet.exe are going to be running. Really just depends on if your IT department cares enough to blacklist apps and search for them. But seriously, don't be that person, keep your job.

---
Hate to break it to you but if you have no target selected, spamming sap does the exact same thing.  If the area is filled with a lot of enemy players within 30 yards (your targetting range) you aren't really concerned about sapping the rogue or druid at that point.
---
he is the for gnomes !
---
The only bloodbath I was a part of was the “Battle for Yeti Cave/ The massacre at Tarren Mill”. I leave people alone when it comes to getting to SM it outside since they’re probably waiting for a group or trying to summon...non of my business.
---
It sounds like you're already looking at the right stats and thinking about it the "right" way.  As a general rule slower weapons are better for backstab.  
---
You might be seeing some kind of nuanced interaction between attack power modifying the damage range before it's calculated by the backstab percentage.
---
You (Alliance) say

Just put an accent on one of the letters! Omájai, Ómajai, Omajäe, etc. That’s what I did when one of my names was taken.
---
Wait until literally every rogue with a modicum of spare change starts carrying FAPs around specifically for mage ganks.
---
Most guilds will be super excited to even have 40 people to worry, unless you wanna do world first I don't see an issue
---
AoE farming is cancer since for some reason mages never get resisted
---
I only played shooters prior to classic. Hell I didn't get  a PC until about a year ago and this is my first MMORPG of any kind and holy shit I cannot stop. I love the leveling I love that there are so many ways to play this game. I don't fully understand everything and the learning process is paced out great.
---
i have been asked about 40 times if i have the ravager axe on my warrior and want to join a cleave group....
---
So min/max so easy ass lowbie dungeons i dont understand it. I have sweeping strikes / WW guys dont worry about my axe lol
---
I like to charge in with 2h, sweeping strikes, zerker stance, enrage, WW, then into D stance and swap to 1h/shield.
---
Just roll need for what you need. You are a Druid and are expected to be able to both tank or heal while doing dungeons during leveling, and everyone is aware you are leveling feral.
---
Better to do it this route than hit 60 specing resto but having 0 int gear. Obviously if some nice cloth piece with +spell damage drops let the mage/lock take it.
---
They would need a reason to check.
---
They aren't going to have alerts set up to catch people playing games.
---
Youll be fine so long as no one suspects anything.
---
If you're really paranoid put wow on a USB or just bring in your own device.
---
The warlock should only be using hellfire if he has a health stone ready to use, isn’t going to pull aggro and take more damage and have first aid/ cannabalism ready to heal up after using it. Really all you should need to do if a lock uses hellfire is toss him a lower rank shield or a renew in case he pulls aggro. If he’s hellfiring till death and expecting you to heal through it he’s bad (unless your in an aoe group).
---
Warriors are bandwagon? News to me, seems like every group is looking for a tank.
---
Most classes get their primary mechanics between 10 and 20.  Warriors don’t get theirs until 30-40.
---
I personally only use guides if I have completely gutted an area of quests and can't figure out how to stumble into the next zone proper.  
---
Other than that just have fun! There's a lot of charm in levelling up- for me anyways- it's actually some of my favorite content in the game.
---
I should have specified, I was talking about farming the bird that drops in Deadmines. I have no idea about the Macaw you looted, that thing might be way rarer. People pay for pets though so I'm still planning to hold onto what I get and see how it pans out in a month or two
---
Here's a LPT for warriors: buy a bow or gun super early to pull mobs individually. I have rolled dungeons with people who are lv 20 and 30 without owning a ranged weapon.
---
Warriors are about taking it methodical.
---
If you start raiding on your mage, you will get tired of people ASKING for drinks pretty soon - you WANT them to simply open trade :P Saves a lot of interaction in a 40 man group. I always filled one to two 16 slot bags with water and some food (give locks a stack of food and 1 or 2 stacks of water) This saves the raid soooo much hassle getting started.
---
nicE
---
Ah yes, can’t wait to play the twink game in 7-9 months.
---
\&gt; So those abilities are "sharing" their threat with other party members, instead of it all going on just the caster.
---
You got it wrong here too buddy. You acting all passive aggressive against aiwaldmeister, it's really gross and makes me think you're a trash human btw. But yeah anyway, they're talking about "... threat they \[healing spells/shout\] generate between enemies", which means blizzard are talking about the threat generated and how it was spread amongst enemies. It has nothing to do with the threat levels of your party members, they mention this only to say basically if i heal a warrior, how does that heal affect the threat of the enemies hitting the warrior. This has nothing to do with the warrior threat levels, only mine. Learn to read before you are a condescending fuckwit to people.
---
If you want to pvp, seems like looking up class guides/counter guides first would be far more efficient and sensible, but okay.
---
Which is all well and good until you're not one of the classes that is streamer certified to be allowed to have fun.
---
They are the most complete over all class IMO
---
Why? People are playing the game differently in many other aspects because of how long it's been and what people have tested on private servers. If if the abilities are the same, instance resets per hour are the same, the experience gain per mob is the same, it's the people that changed. Let's all get lobotomies to have the true #nochanges experience
---
I was in booty Bay earlier and started clearing this camp of pirates. They were slightly higher level than me but I can solo one. I noticed a cow working there.
---
I helped him backstab a bit and moved on to pull.
---
There were two left. I pointed at one and went to try to sap. Failed. He grabbed the other. We got our quest item and he thanked me.
---
I hope my guild doesn't find out I helped a  cow.
---
stop playing with pugs and find some friends to run dungeons with
---
Don't risk your career for a fifteen year old game bruv. If you finish your work ask for more like a good little corporate slave.

Ignorant, angry, and resulting to insults instead of arguments ;)
---
you could remote into your home computer using parsec and not install any game files on company computers...
---
Does it take +spell power or +healing and the coefficients of how much they actually use of the +bonus into account by chance?   Or is it just a basic "This spell does this without anything like talents and such" - which isn't a bad thing, just would like to know the full picture.
---
It should! You can give it a try! I only have time to play my mage!
---
There are some limitations. And My next step will be to handle all lua errors to prevent annoying pop up windows.

Dont spec holy for leveling.  You can comfortably heal all dungeons up until BRD as shadow without problems.

---
As new to being a lock (rolled warrior in vanilla) is there a reason you're oom? I typically dot up all the mobs and wand them to death while my imp kamehmehas them. The only time I oom to the point I feel I need to tap is when we accidentally pull too many mobs.  I find shadow bolt spam to be inefficient
---
had a guildie say he was going to make this. is that you?
---
Same here born fury staying fury
---
People underestimate how unstoppable a warrior can be in pvp with some cooldowns and good hit/crit%.
---
Why do you think they gave us the Recruit-A-Friend internet video game pyramid scheme?
---
That's the GPU I have and the recommended settings were in high. I had to manually swap everything to ultra
---
I like this better
---
Ok fair enough hahaha. Sword and board needs to come out if more than one pack is on the tank
---
Yeah you seem too picky bro. You’re level 15. Join a guild play the game. If the guild ends up being bad at pvp or dungeons or whatever, join a different one. Some insanely organized high level high skilled guild isn’t going to pick up a level 15 regardless. So just level up and have fun!
---
I never assumed anyone was an asshole, except maybe you for bitching about PvP on a PvP realm. But if you’re going to talk about players massed outside of instances, you’re obviously talking about one of the three I listed above, and if it’s one of those three instances you’re talking about, you’re obviously an Alliance player.
---
and if you’re having that problem with zoning out than maybe consider upgrading your potato or turning off some addons. I’m playing on a shit $600 laptop and my loading screens are near instant.
---
One run with all the quests is fine. Run it more if you are looking for specific gear that will last a long time. Otherwise probably best to get back on the grind. Unless you’re XP farming over and over but I don’t recommend that.
---
I'm not sure about other classes, but as a hunter I don't need your highest rank water.  I normally ask for "level 25 water" which I believe is a lot easier on the mage, and it still fills up my mana bar.
---
Again, I really do appreciate your point of view, but I’d strongly discourage you from viewing me as obtuse, you could argue I feel your being obtuse, but I understand that you’re seeing the game, and my questions through the eyes of a veteran that’s played countless hours for years! 
---
There is no right way to play the game, if you want to rush lvl 60 you do you! But this is my first wow experience ever, my first play through, part of that is wasting time, a big part of it is an adventure and hunting for my own gear, working towards what’s the next best tailoring thing I can make, those things make me happy, as I progress. 
---
That aside, by your own metric of efficiency, I’m not standing at the AH, I don’t use it! But there are so many quests! I can’t do all of them AND be efficient - so the ones I do do, I want to be impactful, even if it is just a cool necklace for a few levels, it’s still my gaming experience 
---
And finally! People have found a meta and you want to stick to it, but the meta in games changes by people exploring other options, at the end of the day, twinks didn’t come about because people didn’t give a shit about middle and low tier gear, someone took data and found a new meta! I don’t think wanting to do that is obtuse either. 
---
I accept some of your points, but I can’t say I agree with all of it, outside of the context that your a veteran and don’t care. As a new player, I’m enjoying looking for the next upgrade, if that’s obtuse! I’m sorry! 
---

---
Once.
---
he even made macconnel roll away his helm, asmon just suck lol
---
Why would he give it to a fury warrior?  
---
That's dumb.
---
It does though. If raids are being cleared with as suboptimal comps as are being ran right now, minmaxing is pretty irrelevant. I get your ideas, and I was a hardcore player through all of legion, putting in 40+ hours a week during Nighthold. I just don't think the bosses are hard enough to justify the type of spec exclusion you're talking about. In Legion or BFA, i'd be the first to jump down somebody's throat for not trying hard enough. In classic, it just doesn't matter. The game is designed for casuals, even through Naxx.
---
Do what you want to do, but even pushing speedclears or speedruns, I don't think the content is hard enough to justify any kind of spec filtering. If you genuinely do have over 40 players, sure, take your best, but the odds are, if you get a good ret or enh player, they're gonna be better than some of your worse rogues or warriors. That's just how classic raiding works. Even in higher end guilds, revolving door rosters are the biggest problem for progression. 
---
Bosses are dying to underleveled, undergeared pugs without consumes. I dont think the amount of effort you want to put into classic is very justified. If you wanted to push 40+ nerds to play 30+ hours a week, just raid retail, at least the bosses and progression will serve to be a challenge. 
---
I was on your page until I saw the conditions that the first Rag kill dropped to. By mythic standards, Rag looks like a LFR or normal mode boss. You don't need to minmax for LFR. 
---
I'm an officer in my guild, and I'm pushing for allowing a finite number of memespecs, and requiring additional consumables as part of requirement for raiding. As long as the players aren't sandbagging the raid, which they don't, it's fine. The content just isn't hard.
---
I use stealth, ambush, vanish, ambush, backstab 2-3x and then eviscerate as my rotate in dungeons. I only use SS if I'm being targeted (which, unfortunately, is always due to tanks being underleveled and rogues doing a butt ton of dmg)
---
I watch Asmon. Yes, he does this, but hes self aware. He then goes and reads you guys' salt about it because it's hilarious for the stream.
---
You on alliance or horde?
---
What a douchebag, he later tried to justify his behavior in so many ways. He later won the roll on the onyxia head and celebrated like it was no tomorow. Never watching him again.
---
that syntax sends you an automatic reminder of this post to your reddit inbox in the time specified.

Context: the gnome tank warrior won the roll for the helm and Asmongold still took it

I have tried **Hunter, Mage, Warlock** in mind, I want to try all 3 of them up to a certain minimum level and see which playstyle suits me. At what minimum level can I see the differences in pros/cons for each?
---
Agreed.
---
You could make it so you can select multiple Spells with keybind and calculate overall. And add clear button to clear selected.
---
Can someone explain why the moderators removes this and then refused to answer my questions about why it was removed?  
---
 they said.  
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3b5xl/-/) has been removed for Rule 7, because it was considered to be a low effort meme.
---
&gt;Low effort memes are defined as memes that would not clearly be related to Classic World of Warcraft if text overlay or overlaid game logos/game elements were removed from the image. Most advice animal memes and label memes are considered to be low effort memes.  
---
But...  
---
 I actually clearly photoshopped the classic logo into this, photoshopped the bear, azerothO's, ice cold milk... layering skewing editing cutting masking. Took like 45 min. A decent amount of that was popping into bear form in front of the sky so that I could chroma key out the sky to get an easy bear for the cereal box cover. Is that too "low effort"?
---
If you're using the blacksmith key though, I think it's fair that the roll's winner reimburse it.
---
But can he see why kids love the experience of Barrens chat?!
---
I did this in vanilla as my first 60. It gave me AIDS.

Daggers are cool and all, but they're the worst spec unless you want to ambush-cold blood-eviscerate a clothy.

You can have four active skills on a pet at once and those can be limited by the pet family they belong to.

Or when Overpower doesn't crit for the sixth time in a row..

Sure that 50% crit talent, 2x5% crit talents + 10% crit from stats seemingly means nothing.
---
whats the macro
---
I'm leveling in the 23-24 range and what I have seen is that after the 3 DoTs I either shadowbolt only once or wand a couple of times before VW loses aggro. By that point the mob is in like 25% health or lower, I level in the zones with a lot of Gnolls and by that point they start running away so is not so bad.
---
Unless they resist Torment (which can happen often)
---
You misinterpret me. I do not gank. However, I do enjoy nonconsentual PvP above all else. See, as a sub, getting chased is 90% of the fun. And if I can't get Horde to chase me then why live?
---
Why because you can't grasp the concept of reputation? They didn't mean a single act of you not helping someone who fucked up. It takes time to build a reputation, whether it's good or bad. But once it is built it sticks with you since there aren't things like dungeon or raid finder to just throw you into a party.
---
If a warrior get lucky the rogue just dissapears in that lvl range. They've got no health to deal with the massive crits.
---
it's wonderful though
---
I'm using a 2070 super with everything fully maxed at 4k 75" and the game just looks great. They really improved things over the years
---
i love Asmon, he deserved this helm
---
It is worth noting that as far as world pvp goes, Warriors are bottom of the list without a healer, but basically god mode with one.
---
A rogue can have 7 professions, poison, lp, fishing, cooking, first aid and then 2 majors. I'm actually awesome to play with, I put the groups I'm with first. We wipe I run back to res everybody, I try to make the dungeon groups as fluid and fast as possible. I get whispers every day to heal dungeons, and expect them to come in more around lvl 60. I bring extra ammo, food, health pots and hand them out. The only thing I expect in return is you put the group first, with no toxicity. It's literally rare I have a bad group, and I have a huge friends list.
---
As a 40 paladin I can easily handle 3 mobs at a time.. Use Seal of Command and always have the best 2h weapon available to you.
---
The duels outside org say otherwise my friend
---
So a high level party corpse camping someone several levels below them until they are forced to spirit res only to get ganked by the 5th member of their party is totally fine? No. That is griefing, and is actually against the t.o.s. even on a pvp server if I am not mistaken. It has been a rampant problem on herod, and will mostly go away once phase 2 hits I hope. Fight for resources and world mobs is perfectly fine and fits the intention of pvp servers. Being a bunch assholes is not.
---
You'll likely lose a chunk of DPS, you have to very regularly take advantage of ambush/backstab damage to be competitive
---
Energy regen is a flat rate (aside from Thistle Tea and some rare gear) so swords give you more bang for buck generally
---
There's fast swords (1.9 AS) that will easily suffice for applying your OH poisons
---
It's certainly more boring to play swords but daggers seem to really require very very good daggers to put out the same numbers
---
I played daggers all the way to 42 this launch because I've played Combat Rogue since Vanilla only ever taking a break in WoD to try Hunter (not my thing).
---
Running SM Cathedral, I jumped from 3-5k damage dealt per pack to 5-7k damage dealt per pack. I can provide more detailed numbers once home and I can sift through Details! but I've been pretty impressed with the improvement from respeccing so far
---
I was able to get swords caught up from 70-200 in a single dungeon run and then I was able to start topping the damage charts consistently (aside from juicy ravager AOE pulls)
---
I wouldn't recommend it unless you got a dedicated group to play with
---
So without the boats in SW harbor what's the best way this lvl 28 human mage can get to Ashenvale for some questing?
---
Not really, lol. He has to have the bwst shit, because he thinks he's the best.
---
I'm just gonna buff and not be Petty about. Fort for everyone
---
how do I level/quest then? monsters destroy me in that healer gear
---
just started pm arcarnite reaper alliance so ill see you soon once i level up for pvp :P
---
Oh it was YOU! Last night he whispered me telling me he got a G because of this post lol
---
Nah that just means the mages are shit. I'm farming BRD atm &amp; with double trap I can do like 400 dps on ~4 mobs pulls &amp; 600 dps on ~10mobs pulls, meanwhile mages do 800+ on 4 mobs and 1,5k+ on 10 mobs.
---
Just as you get worried that human quality is improving, there’s proof that it was just a chance in mechanics.
---
Uh... do you know about /w?
---
Hard to watch live, expected. Wouldn't be in my guild.
---
On mobile there's a giant ad in the middle of that page so I can't read it.
---
It should work! Currently, I only have time to play my mage. 
---
You can give it a test run!
---
My next step is to handle any lua errors to prevent popup dialogs from my addon.
---
And I also want to do a check to see if the "High Damage" value is outside of a range, then, only consider the low value as a base value.
---
THIS. This was my hope for classic, and my biggest fear as well. SO many of my fond memories of vanilla include people actually being decent human beings, doing things for others out of sheer kindness and comradery. My worst fear was having all those memories shat on.   
---
Thankfully the community doesn't disappoint. Much love to all of you
---
To add it later. Some people are at work and don't have access to their macro menu, but will in a few hours, so they set a reminder
---
Assassination using sinister strike is just gads.

Dude paladins are so good and they are underrepresented. You'll have the easiest time finding groups as holy at 60x even more so than priests because the priest population is huge.
---
Dont become an altoholic, because everything looks greener from the outside looking in
---
This was painful to watch. So cringey how dishonorable that whole situation was. Neither of them deserve the loot or viewers they are getting. Sad thing is his lackeys will keep playing with him even knowing this. They should have all /gquit on the spot.
---
Implying MC and Onyxia are even remotely endgame is.... amusing.
---
Paladin is second worst or even worst class to level with only warrior being comparable. So any other class will be faster. For priest specifically you just make sure you have a good wand at all times and spec into shadow.
---
Get dodged while disarmed -&gt; overpower when disarm ends

You're intentionally cherry picking the profanity part. Try insulting someone by calling their actions fucking dumb and childish in any environment and see where it gets you. Good luck being respected.
---
And again, it's up to the healer. He wants to drink till full and save costs on water? The tank waits. If he's told to and continues to not, he's in the wrong, period.
---
You can get the sinew before the leaf, so he probably already had it. I know in classic I got the sinew far before I ever got a leaf, for one reason or another.
---
/who all faydark
---
This, and the fact they don't realize the increased server limit + the removal of layering is going to make playing on their overly populated realm even WORSE.

Window fullscreen mode does have instant alt tab

I just used the demolition hammer until corpse maker since speed isn't as much a concern until you get MS/WW. Avoided having to use the crescent staff like some pansy mage.
---
So is polymorph and interrupts and cone of cold and frost nova and blizzard and flame strike and Arcane Intellect and food and water and portals
---
This is fantastic, thank you. I had forgotten the foothills are that low level, I’m 27 and just finished up Red Ridge and some of wetlands but I’m gonna hit the foothills up now, love that zone.

u/mostlyneck If you were on Daggerspine there is a 99% chance that was me.  I spent hours killing people in the air on my rogue.  Best use of a parachute cloak ever.
---
I've started putting the water in a trade window and then not accepting until there's a tip or a buff.  Water takes a lot of mana to make and I'm not running around with 10 stacks of it for every Tom, Dick and Harry that run by.
---
Which completely fine and arguably better for PvP. That being said, leveling as Combat is just faster and more efficient.
---
Nelf Druid in caster form. No wotf active.

He also got pissed when Asmon made him roll for judgement legs rather than just giving them to him.

Haha take a look at Prat, it's not even broken. Just everyone has common words as their name so someone can type an innocuous sentence and it'll color code everything and put shit everywhere thinking those words are a player.

---
I had retaliate on CD too. I had one or two WC items but that’s 99% cloth and leather and once I did the quests I never wanted to step foot in there!
---
Yeah bud. You're a Pally. Big benefit of that class is you don't have to shill out for your 40 mount. Spend that gold on some 14 slot bags instead.
---
The fact you can't recognize griefing and know the difference between it and "pvp" says much here. Some dude tagging your mobs for your quest? Wreck his face, go about your day. PVP right there. Standing outside a dungeon entrance killing people before they can completely load in? Being a dick. Fighting as you run to Scarlet Monestary? PVP and can be fun when not alone. Standing inside the chapel when you are 10-20 levels above everyone there, camping them, forcing a corpse run? Griefing.
---
As for my computer, probably faster than your laptop, but not important. Even fast computers are still going to take a couple seconds to load in, during that time your character is already spawned on the server and will be dead before you can see it because 10 people are standing there ready to nuke it. People know this and it is why they do it. Don't act like you aren't smart enough to know this.
---
Tell the healer to not bother wasting their mana on them?
---
Reroll to enroll.
---
I believe if you are leveling Arms, the 5% additional crit from Axe Spec outweighs the sword skill.
---
Yeah I feel like a lot of classes now are just rogues with combo points except different colors and themed spell names to make it seem different. Like every single class is now, build up points and then spend them.
---
Yeah, I know the whole no mana problem...especially at 49 (that water sucks lol). I level with my sister who plays a lock and always has aggro no matter what. 
---
I guess what I'm getting at is: I want to burst and single target and not get shoehorned into an archetype of the aoe mage.
---
You chose a PvP server.
---
Yeah, clean curses, 2 ice blocks for extra clean, while I'm doing instant dmg, but hey allies never fight alone so maybe u guys have a chance lol
---
All I know is it makes your healer hate you and the upside to using 2h isnt worth the grief. 1h&amp;B is fine. Unless you are super geared and can dual wield and board but that’s laaaage game.
---
Jebaited PepeLaugh
---
If you roll Horde, you should know within the first day or two if you want to stick with it. The Barrens is a trial by fire if you don't pick Undead as your race.
---
Don't say anything about what you are rolling on.  Just roll on what you need.  Everyone will be running most of these dungeons a couple times, if what you need drops, roll need. 
---
Sometimes, you may be asked to not roll on an item up front, then it is up to you if you want to join the group or not.
---
AH or vendor greens?
---
That's exactly how my first death went. I made it all the way to level 14 before it happened. That elevator is evil.

Rofl, you’re the dick from these pathetic comments of yours that show off your piss poor reading comprehension.

Incase you miss the meaning of my message, you read dumb. It was in the comments above and explaining several times before you start insulting people trying to explain things to you, lmao.

Gg, blocked, rage some and dig yourself another hole.

You on alliance or hode? Looking for people to play with and a guild thats not dead.

Yeah that's what I'm doing already. Tons of people complaining about aggro when ppl start DPS before I've even touched mobs, so annoying..

I. MUST. DO. THIS.

I’ll try that. Can the scan be done more quickly? Could i just scan for enchanting mats for instance?

Thanks for the mage description?
---
Okay so this may be obvious but attack power increases ranged attack power as well?
---
 https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#attack-power

I was going by this which just states it increases melee dps
---
How the hell is my troll supposed to know that &gt;: \[
---
The sword is complete trash and you are doing yourself a severe disservice if you choose it.
---
For newbies, Mage and Hunter are easier to level up.
---
I learned today that voidwalker is a bad choice for pet. It can't hold aggro anyway, so why not just use a different minion instead, like the imp or later the succubus? It can't hold aggro either, but at least itdeals some damage.
---
Thank you dude, seriously, tried multiple mana tickers and couldn't get any to work and it's incredible useful to me as a mage to know when it is about to tick without having to keep my eyes glued to the mana bar!
---
Your rotation sounds fine.  You might need to be using a 2h weapon for more rage generation and aggro. 
---
Just need to trust your healer to keep you alive.
---
I'm of the opinion that need = upgrade period. However, that is a topic to discuss with the group before things start to make sure everyone is on the same page and there is no hard feelings from Ninja-ing when the "ninja" didn't think they were ninja-ing. So, pretty much figure it out on a group by group basis.
---
The game just came out. Nowhere near bored yet lmao
---
Once, just to experience it. I don't care about gear until max level.
---
I abandon any quests I don't finish the first time running.

Unless I like the dungeon

Yes you’re right but I was just shortening it. Which I get mixes up with the player created channel. So my bad

I hope that someone gets my...
---
Has anyone seen a break down on the average time it takes to complete the different dungeons? I know it could be quicker or slower depending on the group, but not as free time as I used to have and was curious
---
Levelling a warrior is in fact painful. But once you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind it becomes more efficient to pull two mobs at once than one at a time. I rarely if ever intentionally pull 3 without a pocket healer or retaliation.
---
Hey, I posted that original screenshot. :)
---
That was like.. in MoP, I think. Before the WoD model updates!
---
Why do people care so much about this? It doesn't affect your gameplay - jebait or not.
---
Ah, yeah, I didn’t think about that. I never really whisper anyone like that so it didn’t occur to me. Good luck!
---
there is no chance retail even has half as many people classic has right now. No chance

Warriors are going to push your rogue shit in every time for fair fights. Just don't engage unless they're low or occupied, you know, like a rogue. ;)
---
That’s fine if it’s news to you. Nothing I’m doing has anything to do with previous knowledge, I personally thought it was entirely a warrior weapon. 
---
You’re the one being a dickhead acting like someone didn’t illustrate their point properly. Just admit you read it incorrectly.
---
Everyone is not 60 and enjoying end game content despite what you may see on reddit/YouTube/twitch. The majority of players are still leveling and will be for quite some time. Enjoy the journey
---
The whales probably stayed in BFA any way lol
---
So the main tank got the helm like literally any other guild? Pretty sure yesterday Ozzy won like 2-3 bits of loot over Asmon
---
 unfortunately the windows 10 recording system only captures the last 30 seconds
---
Yeah I somewhat felt that on the EX fights and sometimes on the scape raids so I guess I could imagine theres more stress on savage raids even . It’s def good they have places where you have to use your head some more since the rotations themselves aren’t that thought heavy
---
Sounds tedious. But that sweet, sweet gold!
---
Right. And if you do...then I’m jealous you have the enough headspace to give any real thought to what a streamer does. Who has time to worry about that shit lol
---
He took the t2 tanking warrior helm instead of giving the tanking helm to the dps warrior who passed on it.
---
He doesn't care just like the rest of this sub doesn't care lmao.
---
Classic's itemisation issues means a lot of healers rock cloth gear. It's pretty expected that a healer will want some regardless of their class.
---
Have you tried using f1-6 I find that easier in combat.
---
Iv never has a healer complain 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Ya I got the axe and I always level with people. Still no chance when there is a 10 - 2 horde - alliance ratio.
---
Show me that it isn’t because you haven’t done that yet either, all you’re giving me is hypocritical jabs.
---
Who beats mushroom tho
---
OG post has Silent Jerkin of the Monkey which is way better.

You make your own! They can be on a Word document, an Excel sheet, or my personal way, good ol' pencil and paper along with a description of who they are and how I met them to remind myself why I like or hate them.
---
Edit: As for the Ignore list, that's actually in the game. It's in your Social Tab (Default key is "O") to pull up your friends and ignore list. Ignore is the block messages from coming through to you.
---
Hopefully queue goes down on Firemaw.
---
This is for both alliance and horde.  Read the key at the bottom of the page.
---
Lol warriors are the most rolled class in classic
---
Warrior you tard
---
Thanks so you’re not a tank lol
---
Fine, he's an ugly balding non funny version who lives in a dirty house
---
Cleaving through dungeons with a dps tank was very common if not standard in the latter part of vanilla. A big part of what is driving the current min/max aoe meta is that the world is too populated making questing slower than it should be, this was never an issue in actual vanilla because we never had a world wide 2 million day one player launch. It was a controlled release through boxed copies and it’s popularity spread and grew over a 3 year period, not everyone day one with a slow drop off.
---
classic+
---
A bit too late for that now... should’ve known
---
Aw34 1.5k$ CAD  (so like 200USD LUL)

There have been 2 threads this hour
---
Pvp servers are what make it exciting.
---
Dear diary I chose pvp server knowing what would happen but still complain that it does happen
---
It's anxiety causing! 40 silver... ARE THEY MAD?!
---
Switch at any time. Unless you're on a pvp server and are worried about the ganks then Fury is just fine. You can keep using a 2H until you get enough +hit gear to make the switch to DW.
---
&gt;Your horde aren’t you lol.
---
Flairs check out... Shammys need Salvation by nature.
---
Maybe you shouldn’t judge yourself that you HAVE to pick ONE MAIN and drop the entire societally-placed idea that you MUST LEVEL AT MAX SPEED TO 60, but instead, enjoy each one, keep playing each one, keep being undecided, and see what happens. I only say that because I’ve struggled with the same things. 
---
My brother is a one-trick pony mindset. He’s been 2nd in the world for kills with a gun in Battlefield 4, because he literally never changes. 
---
I am the complete opposite, I want to try everything ever. But I often judge myself for never becoming a top-tier expert at anything, and I never “finish any dishes” as I try them all. 
---
But I’ve grown to appreciate that about me, I just eat the dish I feel like eating (figuratively speaking... I do actually finish my plate at irl meals xD)
---
So yeah don’t force yourself to pick one. It’s okay, you don’t need just one. Let the journey be fun. Not just level 60 alone.
---
also curious
---
You sound like a whiney asshole.
---
Who gives a damn what some streamer did.
---
Repping Fairbanks I see!! Grats dude
---
Never played WoW Classic before. Had no idea what I was getting into.
---
Yea I thought I would be healing more but everyone already has a healer friend I guess 
---
It's ok I went hunter
---
I have levelled dozens of Horde toons since the faction swap ages ago. More reason that I might just treat Classic as a pure nostalgia bomb and visit ye old sentinel hill lol
---
If blood elf I'd be into it. Undead, that's just wrong.
---
Kek, literally no one bases their race choice off of whats cool or interesting huh?
---
Its*
---
Jesus you're smart!
---
I keep thinking how they could do classic+ without fudging the game up.  A horizontal approach to raids instead of vertical, you don’t want the power levels getting to out of hand.
---
One really good way that would have little to no impact on the current game would be to create new content (dungeons and raids) and the gear that drops would be on the same level as naxx.  All the new tier sets would be the same as t3/2.5 stat wise, but just have new appearances.  So at this stage your doing the new content for cosmetic reasons similar to how gw2 approaches gear. 
---
This wouldn’t be as good imo but another option is to create a mythic style mc, bwl, etc that is much harder and makes the gear similar on stats to naxx.  
---
Once again the hard part is how do you add new content that doesn’t make the power level increase by much if at all.
---
I wish people would point out which faction they play at the beginning of these long story posts
---
You know who doesn't "roll to bait drama"? People not in streamer guilds. Uhg.
---
Ironic that that op thinks Asmon sucks yet is basically advertising his stream to people who aren't watching
---
I want TBC released, then new content after that.
---
Dunno, just thought we were talking about vanilla experiences
---
Whoa dude get over yourself.
---
Spam tab, easy fix.
---
common courtesy is to admit the mistake and then roll for the item. 
---
Sure dude was being a bitch about it, but instead of running to general chat to go bitch about it, you came here...
---
This and the one in eastern Feralas.  Can't remember the name.
---
They can hold aggro, if you do shit all for 5-7 seconds while they waddle in and you wait until the second round of taunt is going to be ready to peel the aggro to even start casting your first spell.  I guess if you can make progress walking somewhere, or do a 2 mob dot strat they can be useful.  They are also very good vs non caster classes in pvp areas.  For me I will summon them when I fight a hunter, then I run into a shadow priest and feel completely worthless.  Then I pull out my felhunter and the hunter comes back in with a warrior counter part.
---
That's exactly what I said and meant
---
10/10 you're good at understanding people's points
---
*^(This is sarcasm I think you're probably not very smart)*
---
MissKyliee - Very interactive with all in chat. Acknowledges all who sub, send chips, etc. Not a seasoned wow player and HATED retail WoW. She's tagged as family friendly but don't that tag deter you. She's a casual streamer who quests and tries to PvP with her friends on open world, but as i said she's not seasoned so if you're after "pro" pvp players go watch Swifty or something.
---
Wait til he gives himself Windfury Bindings. People are going to lose their shit lol I'm the guild leader of my guild and you can bet your ass I am getting the guilds first Sulfuras.
---
It's rather amusing seeing half the people in this thread point to this one screenshot as evidence of, on one side, Classic's overwhelming success and, on the other, the first sign of population contraction.
---
Classic+
---
Yes!!  A lot of chest ninja in instances.  open world is borderline expected as it's a free for all with thousands of players..
---
Great suggestion! Will definitely do this.

---
Sad and true, hard as it is to do so, gotta ignore them, literally if they won't chill.
---
I bubble tanks when I fuck up, to buy time for a heal to get through. I was never a healer or tank in Vanilla but it make sense, warriors need to get hit as part of their rage/aggro generation cycle. 
---
Druid don't like bubble either because thorns is a big check of aggro generation for them right?
---
Can use them to grab aggro from mobs by healing you(or use a taunt if they have one - bandage healing can be used by every class though) and then facetank while you whittle the mobs down.
---
Other than that, twink out, use enchants and level engi.
---
They have a target population and that's what the player cap is based on and that's what causes the queue: when more players than their set population cap try to play. They launched the game with the caps set to a number they guessed would easily allow them to turn layering off. But more players than they anticipated wanted to play, and a lot of those players all wanted to play on the same server. So rather than lose subscribers due to players being frustrated with queues, they increased the cap by a lot. This means more players can play without a queue, but it also means they can't turn off layering because then there would be far more players on the server than their desired cap. 
---
So to get to my point: turning off layering would affect queues because they would also be putting the population caps back to their launch levels at the same time they turned off layering.
---
"They actually are, no exaggeration, grown EU men with no jobs and welfare out the ass."

Why are you talking out of your ass mate :P

Honestly the underrated comic genius in Athene's videos was Furious.

He even bailed on Athene's bullshit just about when I did. He's a cool dude.
---
It's long and large, and definitely makes the barrens more draining, but it isn't a difficult zone, exactly, it's calm and there are plenty of quests. I think I was level 13 before I even made it to the barrens. It's a mixed bag, but it's definitely too big
---
I mean, I plan to if I can find one. But it doesn't change the fact that even guilds will want to run 'meta' groups.
---
Honestly that Is a very good point!
---
Nope! Not when I have a pally hahaha
---
Yes, they have to be in your group.
---
You suck it out, eh.
---
i think some guy timed it, can't remember tho
---
Ah okay. Thanks.
---
EASY AGREE! I hate the NE starting zone too
---
I'm new to tanking and like to run a dungeon as DPS the first time through.
---
Dude, my life
---
That...seems perfectly reasonable.
---
IDGAF I'm rolling need no matter what class I am if this drops.
---
You can't enter a mage portal unless you are in a group with the mage that created it.

Your guild must be pretty dogshit

---
Ah okay. Thanks
---
I was doing a quest in Feralas killing low spawn rate ogres. I invited a priest who was doing the same quest but he denied my invite because he was in an instance group. Whatever. 
---
About a minute later he tags an ogre right before me but a Horde warrior charges him while he is fighting it. I see this happen and let things play out. The warrior kills the priest and the ogre is still alive. I kill the warrior and claim the ogre kill as my own. 
---
The priest sends me a message calling me a wuss for not participating in PvP on a PvP server. I told him I killed the warrior, but only after he died so I could have the tag. He put me on ignore.
---
There are only 2 SM quests in total afaik, Never played WoW Classic before. Had no idea what I was getting into.
---
That's not how math works
---
I've noticed this too, playing ally atm and I've made a KOS rule to myself since that one night I got gang banged by the same 5 guys for an hour, it boiled a hatred in me I didn't know I had. No matter if they are on their own or in a group I'll try my best to just kill even if I only get 1 of them, being a rogue helps since i can sap at least one player, but sometimes you do pull off the 1v2 etc, if they are a level ?? I just do a stun and run tho because I know I wont win. Other than that no matter what I will attack.
---
Thanks! 
---
If I roll on something (e.g. I heal and roll on int, then on next boss I roll agi blue bop), and someone starts to complain/wants to kick me, what do I do?
---
You can bring 30 hunters and do everything up to Naxx pretty much. 
---
Because that's what my guild back in Vanilla did for a couple weeks as a joke.
---
I was here. And it was for this reason I fought every Horde I saw for the rest of the day.
---
People are so fucking touchy like omfg!
---
I've encountered this so much.  I am a paladin and I needed and one Ravager Against a warrior ( with WW axe ) and they got butt hurt against me because I won it. like wtf people
---
I mean you would still have that feeling even if you balanced the specs. Tanks and healers are always going to be desired more than DPS, and if you still limit people to one spec at a time you're not getting so much versatility that anyone can do anything at any time like in retail, and it would make things more interesting seeing some paladin and druid tanks, and not just rogues/mages topping the dps charts.
---
Addons existed in vanilla and were available a mere week or two after the initial launch. Not only that, but addons were never the issue people had with the direction retail went. Delete this post, it makes you seem stupid.
---
It is, thats why these post are hilarious.
---
Ah thanks! Sorry, just my lazy ass didn’t notice it
---
If 90% of the userbase would hate it so much we would not see posts like classic+ or this one on the frontpage. Its that simple. They would be downvoted. But they are recieved kind of well. Well enough that there was a frontpage post that told people to stop posting about classic+ or the future updates of classic in generell.
---
Ofc there is a part that is "classic only". But its not nearly as big as you make it out to be.
---
Wait - fuck i was just there! Some horde guild called &lt;Langt fra Loch Modan&gt; took over one of the boats in Menethil Harbor on Firemaw. And lol they kept this guy captive? Long live CC i guess...
---
A troll mage took an escort quest I had cleared up to in thousand needles. As I waited for it to respawn I saw him show back up having failed it. He then tries to run past me pulling all the mobs around her. I just stood there and watched as he died, laughed at him and went about my day completing the escort.
---
Pvp wise: Mage
---
BUT If you have healer company you can also think Warrior
---
Pve wise:
---
Mage or Warrior looks decent
---
Leveling, grinding, aoe capacity, utility, mobility, career, future, happiness wow warcraft starcraft wise:
---
Mage
---
Special Note; Miss dodge wise:
---
Warrior
---
Gl :D
---
Not everyone wants to tank just cause they’re a warrior.. that’s like saying all the priest druids and shamans can only heal because their class can heal.
---
I really want Classic+
---
Add new content without changing any of the existing content.
---
Offer new dungeons, zones, quests, etc -- but all inside the original game.  Don't do any of the expansions, just make the vanilla experience have even more depth.

maybe rob should write the god damn login page himself

You'll also get to accumulate rest if you're playing multiple characters, so make sure you're logging off in inns or cities!

I farmed every single whelp drop on my Mage back in the day. It was worth it and awesome.
---
I see the truth in a lot of this, but I question the comment about polish. A lack of polish does not always distinguish a AAA from an indie title. A lack of polish, from my limited understanding, is usually the result of scope issues. There are plenty of AAA games that lack polish because even with their large budgets, they bite off more than they can chew or are forced by publication companies to ship early for hit quarter reports. If an indie developer we’re to acknowledge that their scope must remain proportionate to their team’s financial and staffing limitations, their product could be just as polished as the aforementioned AAA title. 
---
My original point was more about development methodology than the capabilities of the teams.
---
I really just want one to say For Chestnutz
---
Is there any rogue class weapons like this at 60?
---
I run out of Mana too often on my spriest from giving out fort buffs, even when I'm in combat.   It's fun though.
---
you can turn it off and keep the spell damage stats and other useful info
---
The community hasn't proven shit since the only people who had a near accurate archive was and always has been Blizzard, this is just how bad the game was. Private servers are simply an emulation nothing more and almost no software emulation, especially done by hobbyists, is 100% accurate.
---
The debate rages on!
---
I’ve found Bartender really easy to use
---
C'mon, don't be thick. When 90% of the dungeon groups in general/trade/LFG are spamming LF3M MAGES FOR AOE FARM it makes it harder for other classes to find groups. It's not impossible, but it makes it harder and it brings a different attitude into the game. Plenty of tanks/healers will lean that way too since it's the path of least resistance and, time and again over the years, it has been proven that the easy thing is what people will gravitate to.
---
Again, it's really not hard to understand why people aren't happy about it. You can be happy about it/not care about it, but you'd have to be purposefully obtuse to not understand why many people don't like it.

You can use [this](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell) for parity checking. It'll help you correct +HP/SP coefficients and take crit into account. If you don't need all that, you can just set the crit and bonus values to zero then (although the math for that should be straightforward in the first place).
---
I Feel you but this is the most balanced wow patch that blizzard is running classic from it was worse before  making other classes truly useless, but wow classic is a permanent thing so who knows what blizzard has in store for us

\+1 for classic+

How is druid in classic? Will I get to live out my beast boy fantasy or will I be disappointed. Seems cool to be able to switch to bear tank at a moments notice if I need to then back to cat when the heat has died down. Are druids normally relieved to healing roles in group content? How are druids in pvp?

God damn y'all are trippin like what Asmongold does affects me haha. Can't someone shed light on streamers and their bullshit? Good or Bad? I could give two fucks what he did, does, has done, will do. Just trying to use a public forum to generate discussion.

I see this all the time... tank lfg, heals lfg, dps lfg... they just need someone to push them together most of the time

"Why dont people understand such a simple concept"
---
Really go fuck yourself for that pretentious ass sentence. You are not anybody's favorite person lmao
---
This and you’re slowing the group down when the healer is oom every pull because they’re spamming to keep you alive.
---
Maybe a 150% mount then? I would be down for that.
---
Fuuuck, I should know that it's has there. Looks horrible now that you've pointed it out. I blame the tiredness I was experiencing 😅
---
Thanks for the explanation!

Yeah you are right, but I think I just hate being poor, and as you get to higher levels, making money is so much easier.

I’d like Classic Expansions, but only as far as WotLK. No Cataclysm.

\*SHOULD BE NO LFG TOOL IN THE GAME, REEE.\*: Proceeds to use his stream to get them to do everything for him and uses it as a LFG tool.

Also takes free gold when whining about layering gold farming.

silithus?

I disagree. I also don't like him, but the amount of salt I get to read from posters here is the main entertainment each time a thread about him is posted.

No shit, Sherlock.

Hey! Let me pretend he is being decent.

its not only qeues, also very busy quest hubs and lots of competion on the ah
---
Because most combat rogues/fury warriors won't easily find better swords than these til phase 4+ hunters/prot warrior/pallys should really not need on these unless the rogue/furry warrior doesn't need them, I do recognize that these CAN be very good for hunters/tank main hand. but because hunters have the option to use 2h weapons and 1h axes and there melee are used mostly as Stat sticks and there are lots of decent options for tank mh's they should 100% given to combat/furry if you have them in your group. I also agree with this for rogues/warriors passing on bows/guns if they are upgrades for their hunter in their group as it is their main source of damage while they are mainly used as Stat sticks.

Are you trolling with the spelling or like having a stroke?  Do you need me to call someone?

desolace seems like a great place to be mid 30s

&gt; If you plan to spam and heal dungeons, you’re fine

if anything just keep the +intel/spirit whatever caster crap in the bank and when u go dungeon u swap that on
---
and then 2 weeks later you got Tier 2 Mage robes of Nefarian....
---
Ah, that would make sense.
---
Sulfuras?
---
Hey man nice Zealot mouse I’ve had mine going on eight years and still works awesome!
---
Grind, do any atunement quests you might need, start farming pre raid bis.
---
Also nothing wrong with green quests
---
It's solid advice. I just took a few days off after burning out and I feel recharged today. Hopefully it will work for you.
---
Time to grinnndddd
---
It is idiotic to teach tanks to be more careful? Okay.
---
What build do you use hybrid feral dps tank or pure feral tank?
---
Reduced mana cost all the way. I don't even really use conc much unless I'm sending pet to the next mob while the first one isn't quite dead yet. Sting, conc, an auto or two, then target the new mob and down the last one with multi shot
---
They are scary good farmers if they have gear.
---
Low quality attempt.
---
You can still do the tauren starting zone quests, they just aren't going to give as much honor.

Says who?

This is a question for endgame PvP as a healer. What do you guys think between these two talent builds?

Yup

how did you get 100gold at 40? im nearing 40 (37) and need about 70g more for my first mount..

i have days where i paly an hour. or I play 6. or i play an hour and come back hours later and play another hour. i play as long as i feel and im liking it!

Really wish it looked like Live tho, at least in artstyle and model quality. That with some balance changes and it would be 100/10
---
Literally first dungeon run I did the hunter opened the chest.  I was like yup this is classic.
---
My auctioneer/enchantrix tells me almost everything is illusion dust.
---
Destruction is amazing if you enjoy drinking. You spend so much time sitting and drinking, you look like a wino passed out on the side of the road. Sort of like a mage ... except that you have to buy all your water.
---
Seriously ... Destruction is the spec to use for PVP or for raiding with your guild where you can't dot things up. Otherwise, stick to the other two trees for leveling.
---
Somewhere on an old laptop hard drive I have a 2006 screenshot showing a female human in Stormwind wearing essentially a chain bikini next to my male night elf hunter. I used the preview function to see what all her gear looked like on me. Sure enough, it's just regular chain mail that covers my entire body.
---
currently level 49 and have mostly blues that are level relevant and am spec'd fury and have no problem "tanking" by just doing the majority of damage in dungeons (and subsequently keeping aggro on most/all mobs), and rarely have to use taunt to keep mobs off other party members.  the only real tanking that happens is for bosses.  i just roll my eyes hard when i see people expecting a 1h/shield tank for leveling dungeons.
---
man i haven't see that in years thanks it like watching it new again 
---
they don't make machinima like that anymore
---
Alterac Valley also provides good rep for turning in things like metal scraps. I did this on my priest in vanilla to max out IF rep. That will be in phase 3, two phases before AQ is released.
---
I've tanked for more mage cleave grps than I can count, its your damage dude.  Nova is relied on heavily for cleave, but that's because there's no way to keep threat off mages due to their great AOE dmg.
---
Nobody in a farm grp cares about poly, or any other mage utility; even if mages didn't have the int buff, poly, or food/water they'd still be brought over every other class.
---
If I can pay attention to the HP bars of 4 players + myself, you can pay attention to a single mana bar.
---
Great thing about classic is that you dont really "fall behind". Go your own pace, have fun exploring game mechanics and trying things out. Theres no rush to 60.
---
If you're doing the dungeon in 3-4 pulls it doesn't matter if he needs to drink after every pull.
---
Thank ya so much man
---
Classic good retail bad 💯💯
---
only because at this point it's not worth anyone investing time to figure that out. Right now, you have the option to quest for 1x, AoE farm for 3x or spend time trying to figure out another way to grind exp for ???x. Why would anyone spend time on ???x when AoE farming works? Now if AoE farm goes away, of course it's worth trying to solve the "how do I get 2x" problem.
---
Not really doing anything wrong being slow, just need to learn. YouTube is a great way to see what you're missing.
---
Make sure you're keeping up on training skills and such too.
---
I'm not sure what lvl you are, but my opener is generally charge &gt; rend &gt; sunder &gt; MS &gt; sunder to 4-5 while banking rage for MS when it comes off CD.  I stance dance to fury for zerk rage for increased rage, but rarely use WW because MS and sunder eat up all of my rage.
---
From what I've tested in high level zones, mobs that are my lvl (55) its time wasted to tank 2 at once, and faster overall to just go 1 at a time even with sweeping strikes.
---
edited it to be clearer. Rotataions was a bad word to use. The "junk" spells and bloat has been removed from retail, your actionbar has a lot less on it in retail is all I meant retail LOOKS less complex. 
---
In classic you have every action bar filled up, even though you're only using 1 or 2 for combat, Where as on retail you've only got maybe 10 abilities out on the action bar, but they all get their use regularily.
---
I hope that makes sense.
---
Growing by the day. There's a handful of alliance raid guilds starting to get some raids together while most of the population is still leveling. It's truly not a ghost town.
---
Oh thanks, I didn't know that.
---
Can hardly see what car hes pointing to
---
yah well that's just your opinion
---
I remember my parents getting ready when wow first came out with a list of names they wanted. They ended up with a rogue banker named Henry and a mage banker named Merlin. The one that got Henry leveled a mage and the one that got merlin leveled a rogue (both as alts later). Point is I'm sure tons of people have alts that will never let their names be used for good.
---
As a priest, I’ve honestly not had a single time I’ve rezzed someone and they haven’t freaked out, thanking me just crazy amounts! I must be lucky~ I hope people are better to you soon.
---
Karthur, Kitchicus, Nunsense
---
You should be sundering anyways, wait for the crit and MS/execute. The kill time is not much different and there’s hardly any downtime between mobs.
---
Im lvl 31 and still look like that.. No corpsemaker or WW axe for me yet, so unlucky with drops :(
---
Too bad Grom died before he could hear Thrall's words lul.
---
My friend actually did this.  Consecration would be better for threat retention in dungeon groups but as long as your healer isn't asleep the improved ret aura is nice.
---
At least Juliet found a good place for her dagger
---
What effort? Stealth farming gnomer for your consumable or power shifting? Both take almost 0 effort.
---
Congo rat relations. I like it. Reminds me of Dalaran. Lol
---
I phrased it poorly, I knew there was an auction house in Org. I didn't know there was one in thunder bluff and undercity
---
Apparently not hard enough to resize it in a way where it's clear to viewers what's going on.
---
* Maintank viable in endgame with the exception of a few bosses that primarily fear you or hit really fast and hard with enrages as you have no blockable way of dealing with them.
---
* Feral is a viable dps spec if you put effort into it and grind your gnomeregans for it
---
* Moonkin is the worst spec of classic bar elemental shaman who is considerably worse
---
* Few gimmicky annoying things like you have to shift out of form to talk to people to craft stuff, etc. You have to macro a shitton of abilities with cancelauras and cast catform or bearform etc
---
* Primarily a healer but will get outhealed easily by priests / paladins / shamans and your raidspot is limited by max 3 resto's because of rejuv / regrowth removing other druids hots
---
* feral is dope in pvp if you're good at it in 1v1. And a good flag runner. Group pvp you resort to boomie / healing as you get stomped on in seconds if you try to kitty against more people
---
seriously, that looks rough....
---
To be fair, Census was showing 700 alliance last night during the medium pop time. So it was a good choice to abandon my character on there and reroll else where. My whole guild did.
---
I think you are underestimating how drastically TBC and WotLK changed the classes &amp; specs themselves, outside of better gear itemization.  There's no amount of itemization that would make Protection Paladins good, for example.  They already have all the itemization, after all, since they share it with warriors.  It's purely their spells, abilities, and talents that make them bad at tanking.  They struggle with threat due to mana issues, and lack defensive cooldowns to reduce incoming damage.  
---
Without diving into excruciating detail now, I believe a similar case can be made for several other specs.  
---
I genuinely feel that the vanilla classes were objectively poorly balanced, and that if the devs could go back in time and redo some things based on lessons learned, they would have.  You may say, "well, isn't this their chance?"  But the answer is no, because they weren't tasked with recreating their ideal, better version of vanilla WoW; they were tasked with recreating vanilla WoW exactly as it was.  Making many significant changes to the initial product would have caused an absolute uproar.  
---
As for why the classes weren't balanced better at the time, I believe the answer is simply that an MMO was a brand new venture for them, and it was a relatively new genre in general.  There were lots of mistakes that were always going to be made.  I think they instead took some of those lessons learned and applied them in TBC and WotLK.

Idk, it's common knowledge. Feel free to Google it, won't be hard to find I imagine.

Right. I actually dont see as many Warriors as i thought i would honestly.
---
On the other side of this. I was helping people in 1000 needles do that quest on top of the mountains where you summon that drake thing and light the fire. I would let people tag first and then help them kill it (was already in a party).

Fuck you gondarin from sulfuras. Thing gets summoned on top of me and he stands there spamming "invite me invite me invite me"

It doesn't have to be a wipe. If you're not in combat and the tank is about to pull, why are you not already drinking?? Supposing that you haven't been paying attention and he pulls and you're not currently in combat, START DRINKING NOW.
---
you shouldn't need to heal him for a while so you should be able to drink enough to get the party through a pull. 
---
So no. you shouldn't enter combat knowing it'll be a wipe because you should be good enough to prevent it being a wipe. unless you suck. do you suck? then again if you didn't suck you'd have already been drinking, so...

Dear diary,

Do you have a list/link of all the darnasus rep quests by chance?
---
Because it's a bad joke with a terrible delivery.
---
It's also because their skin is very thin, and any sort of response would typically crush their fragile feelings, so they ignore as a combo of a power trip and ego protection.
---
I loved how the Blood Elves in TBC had one of those things essentially chained up in their basement and syphoned power from it as an explanation for how they could be Paladins.
---
Nah man not 7 layovers but a 7 hour layover. I was supposed to arrive at around 3pm and catch the next flight at 6pm but they rescheduled it to 10pm, which gave me a nice unplanned day spent in the transit area of Madrid airport.
---
Yea that's a no for me dawg
---
Again an engi needs the bar, only obtainable by miners, the ore is not yours if they were mining bars maybe you could argue it but that's not how it works
---
It's really best to just have a friend that is only 4 - 5 levels higher and group up. You still kill things a lot faster and dont get a huge xp drop.
---
so, the LFR-dude who don't care. got it
---
&gt; Profanity isn’t a sign of childishness when used for emphasis.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
It'll take months to get to level 60 but there's plenty to do along the way as well.  Getting grouped up for dungeons though will be an issue.  Even though the actual dungeon run may take less than 1 hr, factoring in time to find a group and travel to the dungeon, it is probably not feasible for &lt;1hr play sessions.
---
Ironically, this whole attitude of "just don't do it" is the response retail players give all the time when people discuss how changes to the modern game have had unintended consequences. There is a decent argument that this new trend of AoE farming could have unintended consequences. Invoking retail here doesn't seem like a great argument.
---
All that being said, I never advocated breaking it in some way. I literally just pointed out that it's being dishonest to pretend that you can't understand why someone wouldn't like the direction things are going. My entire point is people are allowed to like it, not like it, or not care about it. But pretending any of those stances is unreasonable, or that you just couldn't possibly fathom how someone could hold it, is ridiculous.
---
Might have accessibility options enabled.
---
Yea that’s what I’m afraid of lol. Very ready for this grind to be over, but I don’t want to miss out on mc this weekend.
---
It's probably called Shop because they are going to put some more stuff in there. This is just a way to have people get use to seeing it.
---
So does every other warrior. Get in line
---
My only problem with this is that it separates players too much, because then you'd have an RP, RPPvP, PvP and PvE server for every expansion. Then the Cata server might be dead, but then MoP and WotLK are booming.
---
Ah yeah the alternative to bundling charge and intercept is separating them and bundling the stance switch! I do stance dance manually personally!
---
Great so far. It is not a ghost town by any sense of the word, it's growing every day especially now that 5 servers are feeding into it. You see plenty of people out in the world, but it's not overcrowded and will probably never have a queue.
---
Ah okay, wasn't sure if they leaned more on thorns damage to generate aggro but of course bears need rage too. Duh.
---
No, not really. If it's a building, it prolly blocks los. If it's a tree or rock, probably not.
---
Thank you. There’s that nice classic community I been hearing about.
---
As a tank, be consistent, attentive (no frequent afks) and do decent single target dps and I'll take you. If you're friendly and make the experience fun, I'll add you to my friends list.
---
A jack ass mage doesn't automatically get into all groups just because they're a mage. Build your brand, it's the real end game aside from raiding / PvP.
---
What's the best way to fight a mage as a hunter? I've been getting good at kiting melee but haven't really fought many mages.
---
I don't like him either, but he plays Classic. And this is a sub for Classic.

Imagine caring this much.
---
You mad?
---
Hey, only a quick question regarding stealth and druid feral tree "Feral Instinct"-talent. The talent says it lowers the chance you are detected while prowling, and it has five ranks. I haven't been able to find an conclusive answer, but apparently it should give you +3 subtlety per rank, meaning maxing it gives you 15 points translating to three stealth levels, so the enemies of the same level would try to detect you as if you were 3 levels higher than you are. Combined with the nelf racial that gives one stealth level, is this talent worth it for the stealth aspect? The application I was thinking here was overleveling a dungeon slightly and stealthing to solo kill a boss for a drop that I want
---
Ya the one class with three perfectly viable specs needs some help :/
---
You can’t even change your hair in Classic.
---
Yeah, but most of the goblin created stuff are the usables that are actually used for both pvp/pve, right? And always buying it will add up
---
I feel you. I just have skinning atm. After some work I’ll have epic mount and level herb/alchemy. Then after I’ve made a reasonable amount past my epic mount I’ll buy engineering.
---
Moon is always first  sheep.

Square is trap.

Well by this article it was added in patch 1.5 and the next amendment was patch 3.3.3 which was Wrath. I remember needing exalted for it in early Wrath so this seems right.
---
Don’t gamble anything you aren’t willing to lose
---
Retail wow would be a better fit for you for a casual gamer. Classic was made as a nostalgic feel for present gamers that started back in the day, which includes hours and hours of grinding. To give you an example, one streamer is lvl 59 getting roughly 15,000 exp an hour, and it will still take him 20 hours at least to hit lvl 60.
---
I did. If you went through 60  juices in a single run it is your fault. 100%. Tell the tank to slow the fuck down and stop over healing. Boom, problem solved.
---
The idea of Classic+ is intriguing, though I don't think we would truly get something like that. Outland, for example, was designed very explicitly with flying mounts in mind, so they'd have to tweak that somewhat if they wanted to go in that direction.
---
And also just from a pure design philosophy, "branching" Classic out would almost seem like a throwing-in-the-towel kind of move and the Blizzard team might have too much pride for something like that.
---
i just reached level 49 and have mostly blues and am spec'd fury with dual 1h's, both level appropriate.  i went back and farmed low-mid lvl 40 mobs for cloth, drops (actually got a world epic last night, the tank mace which is junk but neat to see purple again!), and specific drops to play the AH.  i never had to stop and heal because i'm killing the mobs so quickly with the level &amp; gear difference.  when procs proc procs and most hits are critical mobs just explode.  being able to fly from one mob to another (charge &amp; intercept), and literally just delete mobs and never have to stop makes me feel like a killing machine.  this is what it feels like to be 60 &amp; have gear, basically.  this is why people level warriors (okay, tanking is fun too but an entirely different feeling).
---
I watch ed d maybe 30 seconds of his stream when he was lvl 20..he said "chat someone give me gold and you can join my guild" not even 30 seconds later someone gives him 5g on 2nd day of release and what does he do? He spammed the button to train his skills and ran out then asked for more lmao..btw he just added that guy to friends he couldnt even invite him to the guild
---
All groups I've been in we've done this as if second nature.
---
They also ruined team fortress 2 with micro transactions 😫
---
That's what I was wondering. Threat wont be an issue if im just aoe grinding and messing around, so if the dps is closeish, I think ret might be better. But I'm not experienced at all.
---
Classic+ with balanced classes and talent trees
---
My friends are assholes and don’t care about threat and blame me when they pull other mobs and I can’t tank all the smug for them

Hello fellow Hunter.

Classic pets and pet skill training is one of my favorite little mini-games in  WoW.  Here's a detailed guide to pet training:   [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php)
---
Let me know if you have any other questions!
---
Never said it wasn't weird, but he wasn't the only tank like he said. He's a selfish shit lord, lol.
---
I found it depends on the layering and where you are put. In either case when the horde start ganking I've found it very refreshing to see all Alliance players nearby quickly band together and put'em down.
---
This isn't always reliable at the moment. It requires people to upload data from a census add-on. As more people use it it'll hopefully get more accurate.
---
in fact they will give 0 honor :D
---
It's not even powerleveling.  I am leveling just as fast as these people doing normal quests and running dungeons normally.  It's just laziness.
---
I didn't get mine until like 30+ lol
---
Earthshrine discord is for bfa shamans and they have a section for classic wow as well
---
Way to know half the story.  The other Warrior is a DPS warrior and didn't even want the helm.  But keep on tossing half of it out there.  
---
Not sure why so many people obsess over Asmon - he acts like an ass, everyone knows he is an ass - it can't be surprising at this point.  In this case however he should have gotten the Helm.
---
So far you have gotten a mixed bag of responses, none of which is complete or even good information in my opinion:
---
Level as Arms, even if you plan on tanking dungeons, because having Tactical Mastery and Anger Management allows you to change stances without losing your rage, and allows you to maintain rage pool between pulls. Use a sword and board or 2 hander at your current level, (whichever has the highest DPS at this point is fine).  If you want to be fancy, look into Warrior macros, including charge and mouseover taunt macros.  You will be staying in defensive stance and spamming sunders, using Revenge when is procs, and keeping demo and battle shout up.
---
Once you get 30, you will get your quest for WW weapon, do this as soon as possible (hopefully with the help of a guildie/friend that is lvl 40+).  Getting the tusks is the most time consuming part, and if you don't have help, you should hold off doing that part until level 34 or 35.  You can also buy the emblems that drop from the elementals, but I have heard those emblems have gone up considerably recently since the layers are being trimmed down.
---
You will actually perform better in dungeons up to about ZF with a 2h weapon in defensive stance rather than sword and board, particularly in SM. Yes you will take more damage using a 2h than you would with your shield, but in almost every instance, you taking a little more damage is going to be more efficient on the healer's mana than your DPS pulling mobs off you, causing aggro to be split among you and other party members,
---
Once you get to the mid to upper 40s, it becomes more practical to do dungeons as sword and board.
---
The absolute earliest I would recommend respecing into full Prot is level 51, but level 53 - 55 is probably.
---
Fury/Hyrbid specs only outperform full prot specs at Phase 3+ gear levels.
---
I think the general accepted practice is everyone rolls need for BoEs
---
Nah, not a problem, did that swim at lvl 20ish to go to wailing caverns, only problem was a pack of lvl 45 mrggrlrlgl
---
Uther got killed like a lil bitch by level 3 Arthas lul.
---
I agree, it's terrible. I never have any bag space.
---
Thanks man I’ll look into it. I always thought that it only applies is the flight is late but apparently also when flights get rescheduled. They basically informed me at the web check in that the flight will leave 4 hours later than originally scheduled.
---
Still not a great reason, it should bring up their info and what server they're on. I dunno how they haven't fixed that feature yet
---
Respect. Back in the days of wotlk I was determined to have a white bear as my pet. I ran my happy tauren ass all the way from TB in my mid 10-s to dun morough. Good times, lots of death, ended up breaking every piece of equip I had.
---
No because I don’t read quest text.
---
What are preferable stats to look for?
---
thanks man :)
---
I wonder whether the Ebon Blade considered resurrecting Grom for the Four Horsemen.
---
Maybe they were saving him for a special occasion.
---
Every site I've seen has vastly different census numbers, I'm not sure how accurate any of them are.
---
Horde side, honestly it seems like a group of people with a ton of burner characters across numerous accounts... Probably paid for via retail tokens... I assume it should be popping up everywhere given enough time, seems like a cash cow
---
Can confirm. I was a rogue on vanilla live and nobody wanted me. I'm a warrior now and get whispers from strangers asking me to join their dungeon group.
---
I would really appreciate it man, getting that quest done at 30 is such a power spike for me
---
Well, yeah i had some issues with the sizes, that was the part i worked on but c'mon dude tho i know what you mean you must know the format by now.
---
Im only trying to pull 1 mob at a time, but I was a bit forced to fight mobs 1 or 2 levels above me.
---
Thank you :)
---
What is this mana problem I don't have
---
\-signed a feral druid.
---
I hear there’s monsters that drop resources that every mage and priest will want to use with their professions. There’s runecloth that’s going to be worth a good bit if your still ahead of your servers average level. I mean I’m not gonna give away the farm here but there’s gold to be made while grinding even if it’s just killing and skinning for 10h you’ll make money.
---
Not ever.  Especially since I'm never looking for a healer.  See flair.
---
It can clear their tag without going out of combat and running back to it's original location?
---
Yeah save dungeons for weekends, or if you get close enough with a guild, try to schedule runs so you can all login/meet up at the same time and run it quickly.
---
Well played sir
---
I mean, it's rated "Teen"

Subtle nods to something similar to cocaine in roleplay text isn't exactly edgy adult material, even today.

---
I recently did the one in southern barrens when you have to kill the 3 mobs in the towers - took over an hour waiting for spawns and getting first hits!
---
Would it be possible to add a threat as well? The reason i ask is because this addon would be immensely helpful to me for managing threat when trying to fight with my voidwalker.
---
I'm imagining something like "threat generated per spell"
---
I walked in there at lvl 18/19. Was already a little scared of the mobs that I saw. It felt like a bad idea. Then a pair of alliance rouges popped in and killed me. 
---
I got back to my body and ran back to the previous zone. Noped right out of there. Decided to grind a few more levels before returning.
---
Every WoW expansion has had the unfortunate effect of the end game being the "real" game, which heavily influences how it feels to level up. Makes it feel more like a chore you need to rush through. In vanilla, leveling up is a huge part of the experience.
---
The issue is that I sometimes have to log out pretty much instantly due to various reasons and I don‘t want to leave a group behind.
---
I pretended to be a hobo to get a rogue named slip to guide me across Arathi for my Succubus.  Slip died fighting the first Raptor we aggroed.  Slip was level 31...

Slip was loyal though.  Slip came back and finisher his job.  Slip was greatly rewarded.  I brewed my most powerful potion for Slip.  The almighty Minor Mana Potion.
---
Everyone on Bigglesworth, give your respect to Slip.
---
What if a hunter tags and kills two mobs you were struggling with as a warrior? I was trying to drag the mob with 15% health away from the 2nd which was accidentally aggroed  but both started to reset so I dashed back after the one I almost had finished off but I noticed a hunter tagging both as they were in route to resetting. They declined my invite before killing/looting both mobs. I thought it was rude but he said it was fair since they reset. Am I in the wrong for being upset?
---
They level the quickest. It will be disproportionately mages for a short time as the rest of the classes catch up.
---
I'm scared FOR you
---
Source was a great game for custom game modes! but yes 1.6 is better when it comes to the vanilla gameplay.
---
I didn’t forget, but I wasn’t under the impression that’s how the layers worked in relation to server capacity.
---
I was under the assumption (example here) that if a server could hold 10k players, there could be 4 layers housing 2500 players each. 100% capacity would be the 10k players, 120% capacity would be the 10k players plus a 2k player queue. 
---
The layers don’t affect the total server capacity, but just shield  the population from all being in the same zone at once. For example 500 players in the valley of trials (per layer) at launch instead of 2k players with no layers.
---
There  are thousands of people starting new toons/starting the game for the  first time each and every day lol. It's never too late to reroll and  you're not going to be left behind by starting a new character. If that  were the case nobody would ever make alt characters.
---
I think I've seen this exact comment at least three times.
---
Yeah terrible design
---
when you dont get auto grouped in seconds you develop a lot more patience
---
This couldn’t be further from the truth. Phase three rolls around and this guy is getting two shot in battlegrounds by people in BWL gear when he just hit 60. Isn’t that exactly what falling behind is?
---
This is so true. Meta (op) things were fun well kept secrets in vanilla. It's part of how swifty was actually good. In classic it's all about who can monetize the next meta thing. It's all good though, just different.
---
That's  not a very Paladin thing of him to do.
---
Yeah it only gets worse. Pretty much if you don't cast a spell, you compete for all of the same gear outside of set pieces in every single raid. Everyone wants the same rings, trinkets, necks and even weapons.
---
That said, it sucks that you lost it to a hunter. Unfortunately in PUGS people don't think about anyone else. I too thought due to the guides this was our pre-raid BIS but tbh it's not. I did some digging because it was fishy that we take this only for the +20 att power, the proc does nothing for us.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain)
---
This would have been much better for him and opens up better gear options for hunters.
---
You wouldn't.
---
By that logic the alliance would actually help each other in pvp... which I don't see happening alot
---
What happened?
---
He needs to spend his early points in holy down to Consecration.
---
You are right Im a gnome :D
---
Well, some mushrooms taste good? So there's that.
---
dude if I had gold... you'd have gold.
---
You should. Vanilla WoW for the majority of leveling you're going to need to go to different areas.
---
Worst part is there's a variety of weapon options for hunters at 60 yet they see these and roll on it when rogues have very limited amounts of 1h swords and these ones have such a low drop rate and they are vastly better than the next closest pre raid bis. A lot of people walk into Mc with a 45 Mara quest sword because sword upgrades are so few
---
Blizzcon is soon. I think they'd win a lot of players back by simply owning up to the fact that retail is fucked and promising to fix it, and making it clear that they want to bring elements from Classic into the live game. That last part is even something Ion himself has said more or less. I think it could be a marketing-win for them to boast about Classic numbers and also make it very clear at their press-event that they are going to make sure the live-game appeals to the same crowd that enjoys Classic.
---
Or finishing all the unfinished things
---
Thanks I was going to ask if it was worth it to even pop evade.
---
Make sure you have the right skill ranks on your bar.  By level 12 you've probably purchased Rank 2/3 of a few skills, but after you purchase the upgraded rank you still need to add it to your bar overtop of the lower rank.  All ranks of your skills will appear in your skills log.
---
You can see what rank you're using by hovering over the skill and looking in the top-right of the tooltip.
---
Release the expansions up to WotLK but create all new expansions after. Like an alternate timeline.
---
Fair enough. Rogues don't go oom though.
---
“Heal me while I quest pls”
---
Classic + with horizontal content meaning new content added with similar gear strength to nax
---
Doggy dog lmaoooo
---
I don't care, all 3 of these options would be great. The only thing I truly care in this whole experience is that the Dungeon Finder remains absent forever. Dungeon Finder ever goes in, I go out. Same day. (I feel the same way about cross-server battlegrounds, but to a lesser extent.)
---
While I think Classic+ would be the most interesting and safe option for them, I think they would be really challenged to keep the community happy with it. I think (and I could totally be wrong) that the community would not be happy with more raid tiers, and that's sort of their fallback for content. (I would just die for more 10-mans though.)
---
My dream would be for them to release certain aspects of BC into Classic, to create Classic+. Stay out of the Outlands, but introduce a level 60-tuned version of Karazhan and Zul'Aman, maybe even Magister's Terrace and Sunwell. (I'd personally be ok bringing in the Draenei/Belfs, though I know that's certainly controversial, especially considering Shaman/Paladin faction exclusivity). Basically, just bring in more "Azeroth". Maybe even things like Archaeology way down the line.
---
I think it'd be a hard sell for them to go to BC and not end up following that with WotLK...and I worry the Dungeon Finder isn't far behind at that point...Say they get to WotLK... then at that point do they do WotLK+? The community really needs to come to a consensus on what the "Golden Age" of WoW is, so the devs can stick with it. This is why I think Classic+ would be the safest of these options.
---
Mages have always been predominantly frost while leveling
---
They also are one of the fastest levelers, it's been 2.5 weeks where it generally takes people a couple months to reach 60. So I guess there would be a lot. I'm supposing the point I'm trying to make is that it's a non issue. Even if there are a bit more mages, who cares? But I still think it will level out given enough time for everyone else series about getting to 60.
---
Classic+ is more what the expansions should have been anyway
---
Thanks. Good analysis.
---
the point is warriors just die.
---
Okay so I should not only quest. Thank you :)
---
I usually run instant in main hand and cripple on off hand, should I switch that up? I just got mind numbing, but with casters it’s usually the slows and stuns that get me
---
There will be a ton of other people just hitting 60 too. He will be fine
---
Whispers "I'll be your adoring fan forever."
---
(Drops mic)... brb logging in.
---
Its distract. Forces people to change direction and if they don't correct fast enough they can fall of a bridge, a cliff, or, in this instance, a gang plank.
---
Deposit is like 60s, so not a biggie.
---
I figured when I engage I'll try to do it at a good opportunity. Lol
---
The Alliance doesn't have filthy liars. Just switch factions.
---
Oh the ironing
---
That exact scenario has happened to me at least 3 times now.
---
The last hunter even tried to claim that they "didn't know how to roll".
---
Apparently if you don't know how to roll, you can just steal all the loot instead of asking questions.  Who knew!
---
Can you give a list of the addons you use?
---
Look up leveling guides that show you where to go for quests and to get better gear. I YouTubed AOE farming for mages and it helped. Also google talent point allocations. It just takes practice. Whisper higher level mages and ask them, or watch them in groups when you start doing dungeons. Once you get deeper into a spec you’ll get better at questing.
---
Thing is a lot of the stat sticks sort themselves out as you start to progress into Molten core and beyond. ZG for example the hakkar warblade set is great for hunters and not many other classes really want. 
---
Dal rends are just this one point in time where it really sucks to see a hunter take an item they need to have two off to even stat sticks.  In pservers you could atleast say the hunter was chasing perfect pre-raid BiS, but with peacemaker in the game there is no reason for hunters to roll on them unless nobody needs.  Once we get +15 agility enchant in the game mabye we can have an argument about hunters and dal rends but i would argue Bone slicer x2 will be the way to go anyways.
---
What realm is this?!?! Is this my ysondre people?!
---
Theres a tailor...in TB. You can also get a leatherworking pattern for a 4 or 6 slot bag in TB
---
Keep in mind that the value of gold is always increasing. Those items could increase in value so if you really want those items, I would buy them. However I believe there are alternatives that aren’t as good but will do the trick
---
the problem is that even strat, scholo etc (the dungeons you need for BiS gear) can need 1-2 hours.
---
yea I would quit on the spot if my char and progress gets deleted.
---
I've felt this lol
---
Nah I’m just a lock noob when it comes to classic. I was wrong, I’ll own it! But now I know... so lock powers - increasing!!!
---
Tbh for level 12 and up Darkshore is a great place for questing.
---
[You'll need to get the boat from Menethil Harbour in the Wetlands which requires you to do a "skip" from Dun Morogh but it's simple enough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK4mnh4benM) Also gives you the opportunity to get the wetlands flightpath early saving time later :^)

Hunter:  "I have a chest slot.  This is for me."

Can't you create a mouse over, overpower macro?

I had ditched classic codex for question because codex would constantly Lua error in dungeons and frequently broke my map entirely. I also was unsure why the menu for the addon was just a black screen with no insight on what to do with it?
---
I'm not certain if there has been any updates but so far questie has been a lot more reliable for me.

This is very true there hasn’t been any new content added to OSRS /s

Opening trade will prevent same faction from opening chest, not surer about gathering.
---
If you get 30 hours of enjoyment a month, is 15 dollars worth it, is basically what you are asking. I'd say yes. Besides, you don't have to do end game content to enjoy wow classic.

Onyxia. He didn’t use a parachute.
---
Go warlock cause its unique
---
Nope, it was a while back with a 43 hunter!
---
I did a /who for 60 the other night on my server, it returned 34 players, 18 of which were mages. Absolutely insane to have over 50% of players being from the same class when there are so many to choose from. LFG is constant spam for mages and aoe runs. Its a real shame, feels like a lot of people will be missing out on legitimate dungeon runs due to this trend :(
---
Those and helmets, don't get a good set until around level 20. By spending to the first week without, it feels like a big boost to armor.
---
Edit: and they're visible, unlike the rings and trinkets
---
Classic+ please.
---
Oh my fucking God I forgot about that video
---
That's a dumb assumption since it wasn't added until BC.
---
ah yea i remeber that one too, i did it on launch day so it was just a mosh pit
---
Fort costs a a hell of a lot of mana.  If you want me to fort the entire party that means waiting for me to drink.  Also do not ask me to fort in the middle of a pull.
---
Problem number 1: picked alliance.
---
Hahahahaha good one 😂
---
Play one in Classic and retail. Was a priest healer and warrior tank from vanilla through Cata. I know both ends of the spectrum.
---
Classic plus.
---
Why not just use google remote and connect to your home computer via browser?
---
They were level 10
---
Yeah, no holy shit please don't let them make any content. Blizzard/Activision has shown me, at least 3 times now (WoW post-Wrath, Diablo 3, and "you think you do..") that they have absolutely, no idea whatsoever they are doing anymore.
---
Fire them all, rehire a motivated team trying to create something new, and maybe it'll be okay. Same people responsible for BFA? Good god no, just color inside the lines you fools.
---
Good. LokTar O'Gar!
---
As a shaman I can walk on water and breath underwater without a quest, just reagents. I've got ghost wolf for movement and wind fury totems for cleave groups, and I get hilarious windfury KOs. I also get a consistent res in a group without reagents and a CD. Ive also got a 15 min CD hearth stone. Although you guys can be trees I think in TBC though.
---
You learn the skills from other animals by using the skill, so go train a higher level scorpion with a higher level poison spell and just have it use poison over and over until you get a notification that you learned a new pet spell
---
You are a glorified garbage man. If you need to be told you are a hero to go kill pigs and take out their livers, ok.
---
Plenty of things still make money but aren't at the same quality as they used to be. Classic WoWs massive success should tell you that more people disagree with the current direction of WoW than agree with it.
---
So WoW isn't "dead" by strict definition but its definitely not the same.
---
Fuck, you got to it while I was at work. Kudos to you.
---
&gt;[Battlegrounds](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegrounds) are shared between multiple servers where their players can engage in [PvP](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/PvP) against other realms. Each group of realms is called a **Battlegroup**. Battlegroups were introduced in [Patch 1.12](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12_(Release_Notes)).
---
Huh, I wasn't aware that 1.12 wasn't Vanilla
---
Ok I will suffer :D
---
You should be finding a guild that gives you a spot as enh. There are many of them, no playing offspec required. It was incredibly easy to find these guilds at release, as their roster fills up it gets more and more competitive and they will just stop accepting players no matter the spec.
---
[Maybe that's why everything tastes like chicken.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1EcrD5IyxM)
---
&gt; my experience in contested so far has pretty much been questing -&gt; enemy shows up while I'm mid fight with a mob -&gt; running back to my corpse
---
Yep! 90% of the time it's either this, or opposing faction members who ignore you until they can 2v1 you.
---
Always loved organized/battleground PvP but found the experience you described adds nothing to the gameplay for me. The only friends I have wanting to roll on PvP servers are playing stealth classes.
---
hey man i’m sorry if i came off arrogant or snarky. i wasn’t trying to clown you for asking this or wanting to know more about it. Wowhead has been used for over a decade now so I promise you it’s reliable. you shouldn’t worry about BiS until near end game if you’re not there already. Most items will be easily replaced man. Just don’t stress about it too much
---
They are :)
---
You're joking around, but this is actually the fastest way to do ZF. With a good group you can get from 44-52 in a day or two.
---
Братан, а чем наши серверы не угодили?😂
---
Bro, welcome to our servers! Why u don’t like it tho?
---
[Bartender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4) is your easiest option. You can then use [Masque and its plugins](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/search?search=masque) to style them differently if you'd like.
---
Classic servers for the first 3 expansions separate from one another would be ideal, I don’t think anything past wrath would draw players
---
On Pservers I had DS LW. I got a lot of commission work on Black Dragonscale sets for MC and BWL, and some commission work on the Green Dragonscale set for AQ40.
---
It's not as AH lucrative as Tribal, but you can charge quite a bit for dragonscales and the purple boots especially. Fury Warriors and hunters often get the Black Dragonscale set, although I don't know if the set bonuses are in this patch or not. I would hope they are, they weren't power creep. .just more of an adjustment for pieces that weren't very strong but a lot of work.
---
Classic+  
---
The best roadmap to the future.
---
Probably it being such an easy class to solo with, and a large percentage of the class's damage being tied to the pet.  It's not necessarily that a high percentage of hunters are facerollers, but IMO a high percentage of facerollers pick Hunter.  No offense to the skilled Hunters out there.
---
that is a good combo for leveling while having to defend yourself occasionally. For general PVP against all classes use Crip main and mind numb off. Thistle Tea will help. Rogues have a tough time competing right now in pvp. You aernt alone. Combat is not great for pvp but great for leveling/dungeons. Get imp sprint. That can help as well.
---
You seem to not understand how long it takes to gear up in 40 man raids.
---
It isn't like "Lol i did MC two weeks and im geared :)" it's more like "I did MC as a warrior for 2 months and finally its my turn to get geared"
---
Pre-raid BIS will last MONTHS for raiders
---
I'd love to know what he made on launch day. His twitch dashboard died because his chat was so full of subs and donations. He had what, 310k people in his stream? It was crazy
---
pot, meet kettle. 
---
Not that I expect you to understand what that means.
---
I wrote about this on another thread today. Here is what I wrote:
---
 The build I have on the calculator is 13/5/33. I'm prioritizing crit, stealth and combo point generation. So, at level 22, I'm at Opportunity 5/5, Camouflage 5/5, Improved Ambush 2/3 and Malice (ass tree) 1/5. I'm going to complete Malice, then fill Initiative (back in sub), then Setup. I'm taking Sub all the way to Premeditation. I did this with my Rogue in Vanilla and I was able to use Premed, Ambush, then Eviscerate and "one-shot" mobs due to combo point generation. I'd have 4-5 combo points after Ambush (2 for premed, 1 for Ambush, 1 for Initiative, and possibly 1 for Setup if I dodged the first attack by the mob), then hit a full strength eviscerate on my second attack. If I crit on both Ambush and Eviscerate, very few mobs stand a chance. It's fun to play. Even at level 22, I crit for 300+ damage on Ambush and can one-shot a level 19-20 mob.
---
Whenever I party up with those kinds of people I hand them over lower ranked food/water.
---
How do you find groups as DPS?
---
   
---
I'm a rogue and have only ever gotten dungeon groups if either I was invited by a tank in the guild, or if I'm overleveled for the dungeon. 
---
I'm looking and advertising in general,trade, and LookingForGroup and nobody ever invites me as DPS. Am I missing something? Am I secretly blacklisted? How do you find groups as DPS? My most recent attempt at finding a group myself that I was appropriately leveled for required me to promise to pass all item drops, and even then we couldn't find a healer within an hour and disbanded. I don't get it.
---
You can! If it is the same as retail, right click the dual pages in your chat window. It will pull up a list of things you can do, one of which is language! Hover over it and you can select what language you speak
---
thank you very much
---
What are you doing with a rogue weapon BiS? /s
---
Unfortunately, the best way to do this came out with Mists of Pandaria with the **Silent Jerkin of the Monkey**.
---
You need a nap.
---
Heheheh
---
AV rep was pretty easy to get by that point. Literally anyone grinding for a welfare pvp set in TBC/Wrath most likely hit exalted before getting the full set.
---
For who?
---
Soooo when you said it was changed you're assuming they intentionally changed it without anything to go off of other than its currently not working.
---
Almost sounds like a bug then being there is no conformation that they wanted it to be like this.
---
I picked a lock specifically to be a shithead so I'm rooting for this to be a bug. Besides theres not much difference from an infernal tearing up a town and two level 60s tearing up a town.
---
So spirit gives you Mana regeneration in combat. But that Regen only kicks in 5 seconds after you last spent Mana.
---
So it's best to heal in bursts, basically topping everyone off then letting them go to like 50%ish, then topping them off again. Rather than just continuously casting spells trying to keep them at 100%.
---
That way you get your spirit Regen more often, and have more Mana in general to work with. This let's you drink less as well as heal through worse pulls because you'll just simply have more Mana.
---
However you can't let people die, so it's a bit of a balance between trying to cast as little as possible to get spirit Regen, and keeping people alive.
---
They were level 10 so def wasn't Bestial Wrath
---
How do you make the background of the text box black? I actually never thought of that haha.
---
Pretty sure it's a repost. I am sure the original has more than that, but I just linked the first one that came up.
---
Indeed
---
Classic+. Buff the talent trees and add new sidegrade content. Give every zone above level 10 their own instance, more raids and improve crafted gear so its pretty much as good as dungeon gear.
---
You have been helpful. Thanks :)
---
This is why I always give Fort buff last on warrior tank because they do not look at mana bars and could give a shit about healer's mana drink time.  But if they hear buffs going out they will patiently wait for theirs.
---
Came here to say this - how are people not noticing? It’s hilarious lol
---
Or /join lookingforgroup
---
&gt;For all the '#NoChanges' talk, I'm surprised there hasn't been more opposition to a massive change to how BGs worked in Vanilla.
---
Huh, I wasn't aware that 1.12 wasn't Vanilla. Thanks for the ranting clarification.
---
Ah yeah I’ve played every expac and saw they removed recuperate but “don’t worry you get this sweet new heal ability that doesn’t need combo points and is static!” Blegh no thanks
---
Can mages please give the impaitent ones lvl 1 conjure food/water.
---
I think the reasoning for this is the community but also the fact there is no LFG like in BfA. In BfA if you are "good" and someone messes up, you can kick them and find a replacement almost instantly and can summon them or just leave the group and instantly join another. In classic, if you want to kick someone you might be sitting around for a while looking for a replacement and getting them to the instance, it is most likely just easier to stick with the group you have and finish the instance.
---
It’s ketamine
---
Why are there so many people that cry about the opposite faction outnumbering the other as if it’s exclusive to one side?
---
Perhaps a 15 year old youtube video considered a classic and a favorite by the entire WoW community?
---
Having played Horde in retail, I'm excited to play things from the alliance perspective. Seeing young Anduin and Katrana there is pretty great.
---
no bleeds against warrior is asking to lose
---
Its not even close, activision and king's other products rake in an insane amount of cash.
---
How is it that at all? I just don't understand why people comment without actually reading the damn post.
---
Same.
---
I like to do the drive by viper sting if its an opposing faction mage.
---
My problem is speccing. Like aoe farming is over rated as hell in the open world so I go with a single target frostbite build. But now that I’m level 30 my spec basically prohibits me from joining these aoe groups as the spec is counter productive towards aoe farming. Why would I respec for 5g just to be a part of this garbage xp/hr fad.
---
Holy shit, up until the last sentence I honestly thought that Warrior was me. I ran BFD yesterday and did the same thing. We wiped.
---
Our Mage didn't leave tho
---
....no...there are actual numbers that show this. Don't ask me to link them, this is extremely common knowledge you can google for yourself.
---
Yes either that or the new bosses are niche in a way so a new set of gear is required to optimally do them but isn't better as such (i.e. arcane resistance content etc...)
---
You can leave your friends bear hide
---
I mean, there IS a lot to like about Mages too, I wouldn't say people pick it just for the efficiency and aoe farm. 
---
It really feels like a well designed class, with crazy tools and opportunities for "flexing" / skill expression, a good class fantasy, and a simple but visually satisfying rotation.   
---
Mages are pretty much always popular -- Blizzard IMO GENERALLY - not always but generally - nails Mage class design. Exceptions are there, yes, but the Mage even in 2004 was a masterclass in game design / class design.
---
Bro I know you want to get help but you know you can literally just google Stonescale Eels and look at wowhead/classicdb/twinstar for the locations right? (Not meant to be condescending, just trying to enable you to find information on your own should you need to).
---
*Stealth noise intensifies*

BGs *were* cross-server in Vanilla as of 1.12, when they added Battlegroups.

Post listings for dungeons. You can do that in retail

Sign up for the listing. You can do that in retail.

Give your self notes so the group your applying to knows what’s good. You can do that in retail.

The only real difference between your idea and retails LFG window is that there isn’t a button at the bottom of the screen.

At some point in your development as a human self awareness is applauded, not discouraged.
---
I have done this as a warrior, but I lit 3 before reading the screams in chat telling me to "stop you idiot!"
---
Str gives 2 attack power per 1 Str, Agi gives 1 attack power only in cat form.
---
So you correct, stack Str&gt; Stam &gt; Agi for tanking
---
Str&gt; Agi &gt; stam for dps
---
I'm a noob. Did you stay at level 19 for some reason?
---
Well, to be fair , warriors wear some leather too most likely. We just don't have the luxury of being able to reset the fight that often.
---
Just wait until all those meta mages start competing for raid gear. Good luck getting that gear you want when you're bidding against 25 other mages
---
I dont either, but that doesnt stop me picking up on things like spotting the Blood Elf in Ratchet.
---
They should do TBC and then create new content.
---
1. TBC fixes many of the big problems that were present in vanilla.
---
2. Big chunks of the content planned for TBC, were originally intended to already be part of vanilla so.
---
A case could be made to continue to wotlk as well however i think the most mandatory changes came in TBC.
---
As a healer, this was the running joke between me and my warrior tank during repeated dungeon runs.   We eventually just had to stop inviting hunters so we'd have a chance at the chests.
---
Consecration isn't mandatory to solo farm big pulls of normal mobs. My favorite niche aoe farming tactic was to respec at 40-42, go badlands into the dwarf fortress and mass pull it. Adding all those reflecting damage instances would eventually lead into killing all the mobs like you say. Also you want to get plate armor asap when you ding 40 to get enough phys reduction.
---
For dungeons this isn't viable method because elites will tear you a new one faster than your reflection damage does threat before you need heavy healing, which makes this hard to achieve in dungeons of your own level. However you can do it in lower level dungeons because mobs doesn't hit hard enough before you generate enough threat, but i would always suggest using consecration in dungeon farming.
---
You can argue all you want. I, nor anyone else, need be "offput by a profanity" to call you childish for using one.
---
&gt;Oh for the lov- Now I need to get my rage back up again. 
---
&gt;miss, miss, parry, miss
---
&gt;Ugh, at least taking damage gives *some* rage. 
---
&gt;Mocking miss
---
Repeat.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
I wasn't aiming to do this, but I thought it was a unique way to level up so I thought I would share.

---
Typical rogue. So full of yourself.
---
&gt;Rogue beats warrior in 1v1 almost every time
---
Warriors in general, are the toughest match up for rogues. It's always been this way. 
---
Can a rogue beat a warrior? Of course. No shit. But if two equally skilled players went against eachother with those separate classes, warrior will most likely win.
---
But sure... let's pretend as if WoW hasn't been around for 15 years and just make things up in 2019.
---
Haha our GMotD has us assigning "guild first" items like Sulfuras, Thunderfury, Rhok'delar, and Benediction. They're all going to classes that don't need them or can't use them LOL.
---
You bastard!
---
I love it.
---
This so much, 2h tanking.  Once I got to 36 with SS\WW.  With whirlwind axe...easy facerolling.
---
There's only a single bad patch, right before you reach the tomb.
---
You'd probably only die 2 or 3 times there, and like you said, the GY is near.
---
Nothing challenging to grasp there, all basic stuff. 
---
The issue is that there are much better ways to create difficulty without making it standard practice to rage and disband the second there is a wipe.
---
Blizzard doesn't need to do that in raids, and they don't need to do it in instances either
---
Do I look like a vending machine?
---
Old School Runescape is a great example  started with the 06/7 version and has since diverged. Updates and changes get polled and have the desire to keep it feeling old school rather than following rs3
---
Yeah, they're hard to judge. Need more people with addon to upload data. \*cough\*
---
Hahaha that’s a funny way to cap
---
Yup, people that say it is not have not had loot like this ninjad from them. They will change their tune when that happens a couple times. Maybe a few if they are especially dense.
---
Play the way you want.  I am leveling a fire mage.  She is my fifth mage.  Frost is pretty durable and those experts are right.  AoE farming to level is pretty efficient.  I find it dull.  I, like you, prefer a firm set of big fiery crits.  You have to be more selective in your battles and careful not to over aggro or pull threat if you're in a group but the amount of damage you can do can be very satisfying.
---
Your question reminds me of this poem by Robert Frost:  
---
Some say the world will end in fire,
---
Some say in ice.
---
From what I’ve tasted of desire
---
I hold with those who favor fire.
---
But if it had to perish twice,
---
I think I know enough of hate

To say that for destruction ice

Is also great

And would suffice.

Latest version of elv is broken if you do instances (loot rolling is bugged) so I had to roll back.

It's just easier when pugging, because there's a very healthy chance someone is going to see 4 people roll greed...and then roll need and bounce.
---
You are just flat out wrong lol
---
Warrior is the easiest matchup for rogues
---
If you want to be pedantic. It's FFXIV you moron. 
---
So no source hey? Just an idiots opinion? Like I said. Stop talking out of your arse.
---
just /join lookingforgroup and do quest while waiting for a group

I disagree with rogues having a tough time pvping. IMO rogues are kings of PvP and I’ve been slaughtering ally all over Azeroth
---
Haha IK sorry.
---
Why is benediction full now? I was having a good time not having a shitty queue
---
If you press alt + print screen it only captures your active window.
---
You make your own group
---
If you cant make your own group because you don't have time or don't have friends then do something else.
---
There's more to the game than spamming dungeons.
---
&gt;an Orc Rogue
---
&gt;No one /points at me and lives to tell the tale 
---
If only he rolled undead. . .
---
I'm guessing human mage with horde background.
---
Never played wow, what is easiest class in classic?
---
&gt;So what? As a rogue you just pop evasion
---
Lmao! Seriously, dumb people are coming out of the woodworks. 
---
Rogue pops evasion and warriors laugh in Overpower.
---
Just curious, around what is your /played? I am a similar level (35 warlock) with around 70g having done dm and stocks once each (so no dungeon spam) and primarily having quested. My playtime is around 3 days. My gold comes from quests and gathering skills mostly. I know I have a fair amount of time spent on my professions.
---
I am asking because I am curious if it is more effective to get better exp and then purely farm gold or if it is better to do a mix of the two with worse exp but probably better normal g/h.
---
Frostbite procs off CoC which would leave stragglers. It’s doable just not ideal and makes the whole thing seem less attractive
---
If you’re serious bombs, rocket boots, spell reflect trinkets are good places to start.
---
You are clearly not in touch with EU immigration politics
---
Maybe it's there BFA background?
---
Seems to be a better place for alliance to transfer over to. I think the ratio is more even.
---
Best feeling is knowing you're about to be travelling for quests or about to get off, so you give the first friendly you see ss, especially in a pvp area. They usually don't realize or notice right away, but they will later.
---
Hehe. Absolutely. I have to come up with something unique and laughter inducing.
---
This is brutal I love it
---
The sound I make when I get into work is more similar to the Voidwalker death sound.
---
Grim Batol, Dragon Isles, Karazhan. There are many options for Classic+ and frankly, not all need to be a complete "tier". One or two could be like AQ gear in that it fills several niche needs.
---
Also, I don't see why MC gear needs to be relevant if there is a t4..t5...t6, yada yada. As long as at least 3 tiers worth of items have some relevancy at any given time, I think that would be fine (BWL through t4 for example). If the power creep is consistent, then it's surmountable by regular raiders over-time.

What do you do when your party member says invite deadshot with the fucked up letters? I think its dumb too.

So pulled from your ass, got it.
---
&gt; I can kill 2-3 mobs 3 levels higher than me at the same time.
---
No, you can't
---
Yes! I finally had the opportunity last night to go help my lower level buddies with some stuff and some others just questing in the zone with an elite quest and it's the best. You forget how much it means to people until you have someone get you through something that's taking you absolutely forever lol.
---
Yeah, it's fun to see how we can now realize what we did wrong in vanilla because we were younger and more naive. I know about teleport now and got it immediately instead of finding out about it at 24 like I did in Vanilla. 
---
I personally find SFK to be my favorite instance. Retail ruined it for me. How can you remove Arugal? Blasphemy.

Retail isn't even comparable. In retail, mana is irrelevant.

What people need to realize is that the act asmon puts on is just that, an act. He's created a personality, and once you realize that it's an act, it becomes actually pretty fucking funny.

Btw, you're the type of person he's mocking with this persona
---
Expansions, but the classic server isn't updated, they just allow "clones" to the TBC server (for example).    I'd love to experience TBC, since I quit when it originally released, so I never got to do that content, I'm sure there are others with a similar story.
---
What does that have to do with me saying that warrior is one of the most played classes?
---
You can just make an alt
---
They are still right
---
Except when fun is subjective, you can't define for someone else in your terms.
---
It's a lot of fun, but a lot of work.   
---
In end game you're mostly relegated to Resto healing. It's quite effective, but it's not a class anyone is going to be stacking due to how HoTs interact (they don't!). The gear is a bit of a shock if you're used to retail. While Druids can wear Leather, there are quite a few good pieces that we want that are Cloth. So you may need to do a little research to know what to be on the lookout for!   
---
Feral Bear tanking is the next most viable option. Tanking on a Bear, though, takes quite a bit more work than Warrior. You can do any dungeon content without a ton of investment as long as you took the right talents and go for tanking gear. However, for Raids you will need to invest more in specific items made by specific professions. Even then there are a few fights that at best you'd be an off-tank for due to the way some mechanics work.   
---
Cat DPS can work, but it takes even more work than Tanking. This is really just for Raids, though, and you can work fine in dungeons.         
---
Finally, Boomkins definitely exist, but it's one of the lowest performing specs in the game, unfortunately. I've been maining Boomkin ever since MoP and even i gave up on the Boomkin dream in classic, lol.   
---
Leveling, however, is different. You're mainly going to be questing as Cat. As long as you have the gear, you can also perform any role in Dungeons. One of the MOST fun things is that often times you end up doing a bit of everything. I may join a dungeon as a DPS... but i'll Tank if extra adds are pulled, or i may throw some heals to take the mana pressure off of our dedicated healer. It's a lot of fun and really makes you feel like a hero in some cases since you can single-handedly save a wipe!
---
Sign me the fuck up
---
Easiest for what? Leveling? Probably hunter or warlock.

Never change.

Yeah and spam in General Chat that you're looking for a Senpai.
---
Map flash of light there.
---
Yes, the token gets you a sub, a sub is all classic needs
---
So you want to trade gold from a game 15 years old in comparison to classic that have 2 weeks? Also you can have 1 gold playing classic generally at level 10 and I doubt a lot that you will have 1000g by the same /played in retail.
---
Also on BFA they reduced a lot of the gold income to players, and I also have some millions and am not interested in playing retail now.
---
Good to know.
---
I need to make this macro, and the wand dancing too ASAP.

I’m sure it’ll be the best one yet.

I haven't seen any asmongold threads either, not sure what the problem is.

I got bored of rogue around level 40 but pushed through to 60 now ponder uninstalling. Questing is bad, MC is boring, dungeon spamis all about metas, and PvP has no purpose. I see no positives right now.

Depends on the enemy. Each enemy has a specific aggro range around them. If that aggro range overlaps with one of their allies (or other creature hostile to you), then they will most likely be aggroed when you attack that mob. 
---
It's different for each mob. I've successfully pulled a mob away from a group of others just a few feet away, then for different mobs, it seemed like I pulled aggro from mobs yards away from the target. I think intelligent humans are more likely to join their friends in combat than unintelligent beasts or other monsters. I know Blizz has rules and all. I'm sure the concept has been studied and there is a guide out there for aggro radius. Vanilla had theorycrafters galore back in the day when mechanics meant something.
---
I am a warrior. I will almost always start my own groups. I try and make balanced groups. I am pulling. I pick the targets. It is my run. You want an AoE farm, go somewhere else.
---
I am having a blast!
---
its worth noting that OSRS started with 2007 version of the game, as it was hailed as the best starting point to branch off from.
---
Would be cool if we could vote as a community on what our starting point would be. I'd personally love to see the game advance with BC as its starting point

&gt;You (Alliance) say À 2 À and Horde will read k e k

So does holding left click and right click at the same time.

So you’re saying they should’ve made 1 server on name reservation day. That’s even safer!
---
Gnome.
---
As much as I would want classic+, I don’t think they’re capable of delivering us what we want. We’d end up with some retail nonsense and it would just kill the whole vibe. Roll out classic expansions in a timely fashion then worry about new content after Wotlk because everything went downhill after that anyway.
---
The retailers are checking classic up, it's super obvious. They use one word, usually abbreviated, don't talk at all about other things, and try to go super fast in dungeons. I detest them and I can't wait until they go back to their single player casino game.
---
I do this with my friend when we pug. They respond with " you're not in common" I just respond stupid human. I imagine it in a French accent all stuck up. Gives me a giggle.
---
It's been a while but I remember testing it on people on my own server and it gave the same behavior.
---
you underestimate how many people spend $500-$1000 on HS packs each expansion or OW loot boxes
---
I picked dwarf, just like the lore of them and calling all other dorfs bruddah's. Their voices are also the best immo. I've always leaned to dwarf in anygame I played.
---
When pickpocketing you also get alot of gems, which fits nicely because they delve deep for riches in alot of universes. Sometimes to deep and awaken balrogs but who cares. 
---
And you said racials don't matter but find treasure is really handy for leveling pickpocketing or navigating through dungeons for some side chests.

Gold in almost every aspect in WoW is more important in the majority of dungeons while leveling than any soulbound item you can get off a boss that you can run to and kill again. A rare BOE epic can sell for enough goal to save you HOURS of time farming and what not for the equivalent amount.
---
Epic BOE should be rolled need on unless as others have stated there is an agreement beforehand with the group... which is highly unlikely.

Alliance has a natural advantage in Hillsbrad since Horde reaches Hillsbrad late teens - early 20s, meanwhile allys get there late 20s - early thirties.
---
Could anyone see you playing? Would it be any worse if you just bring your own laptop?
---
I just want TBC servers since it's the best version of WoW to ever exist.
---
Classic is merely a stepping stones towards TBC.
---
Not as a result of classic, though.
---
Sometimes when I bandage I still auto attack as a warrior. Game is weird. Deff not vanilla.
---
you want to make sure it starts
---
Other aspects are the game definitely are, but the end-game combat rotations are not.
---
Waiting till 10 lets you get the two RFC quests from Thunderbluff before meeting up so it is a good idea to wait  till you have those.
---
Being rude/polite got nothing to do with a game. You will find both nice people and rude assholes in every multiplayer game. Every. Single. One.
---
I think I've heard that drain tanking with Succubus for dps is pretty viable. I think you get Succubus at level 20 so maybe try that and see how it works?
---
Wait a little. Doesn’t really pick up until you get the talents to stop pushback
---
Classic+ or just redoing classic.  I have zero interest in the expansions.
---
1. For Example Shift.  Without the second Modifier there it will not work.  will only cast rank 1 when no mouseover or no target.  but highest rank with mouseoever.  Not sure exactly why, just know i got it to work as stated with that.
---
2. For some reason it will not i have auto-self cast on and it will not recognize a target without the @player, wonder if it has to do with being a macro.
---
Your skill in Maces has increased to 132
---
What server?
---
casual.
---
In vanilla back in the day i hit 38 and then rerolled, so no I dont think it is, you also know where quests are located now and know the lay of the land so you can level more efficiently.
---
thanks haha i was 60 5 days ago but your misplaced condescension is adorable
---
I think I technically tanked it at around 36, but the rogue probably took more hits than I did.

Hey now I can think of a couple times where mage outclassed warlock.
---
Fire mage did pretty well in WoD and beat our lock every time. I think blizz was punishing locks for how OP they were in MoP.
---
Oh god, the opposite (sorta) happened lastnight. Three of us in our early to mid 30s were getting tossed around like soccer balls by the elemental, and along comes a red little gnome lock, who starts throwing dots on the ele. A 4th guildie enters and immediately starts attacking and killing the lock. Us three are typing nooo and explain to them. He's like "I DIDN'T KNOW!" and all of us emote sorry to the dead gnome corpse still watching us.
---
I call them dorps.
---
unless you are the raid leader ... doubtful lol
---
WotLK would be incredible - if they didn’t add the dungeon finder and the QoL changes of 3.2.
---
You can’t really drain tank effectively until you get dark pact from the afflic tree
---
Sure, if you're a war criminal
---
In what way? How are they more fleshed out? Can you provide an example?
---
I'm used to Grid in retail, so mine is set up with vertical health bars. Not sure if you'd want that. When I get off work in a bit, I can look into how to export a profile. 
---
You'd probably be better off learning from scratch though. That mod has a million configurations. Still daunting for me, but you'll learn as you go. Google search for specific tweaks you want to make it find a config guide. I'm sure they exist.
---
you handicapped yourself by taming the slowest pet in the game
---
I feel like something is being lost in terminology or there is too much miss understanding going on.
---
With layering being removed, i assumed the total amount of players that are actively logged in and able to play on their character is going to be reduced. Is this not the case?
---
I got it off a 32 turtle in Shimmering Flats. 
---
As a 32 druid it would make my Rejuv ticks hit for 68-69 compared to 61 without Holy Shroud. Similar increase for Regrowth. Overall it feels like a 50-75hp increase per heal which likely over time adds up- I still use it for healing dungeons rn at 37.
---
&gt;imagine the smell
---
/v is leaking
---
Leave it alone. Especially no class “balance” possible ruin the magic of classic itself
---
I'm okay with all three options tbh
---
If you're a skinner you can make good money farming for it, especially to try and save for your mount.
---
Yes it uses two factor authentication, listens for LFG keywords or similar before searching and listing dungeon tags in to a list, sorted by level range &amp; dungeon.
---
Great addon, recommend.
---
Unless you're a priest.
---
Lv47, and both weapons require 44 to equip.
---
I didn't get a headpiece till 38 ( had white bandit mask crafted), and the first neck I got was from a SM Lib quest.
---
Looking up guides is how you get above other people that haven't been pvping.
---
For example, guides tell you there is a deadzone, they don't actually help build your intuition for it or get a feel for staying in it.  It's like looking up a video about boxing/mma and then thinking you can do well in an amateur league.
---
If you do competitive games then you should recognize the learning curve that every game has, even between similar genres - a pro LoL or DotA2 player isn't automatically pro in the other for example, and on the occasions a player *does* crossover to the other there is significant training time against players, they don't just do Coop vs AI/bots/training mode.
---
ding ding ding. the correct answer.
---
They don't have to say anything for people to know BFA is bad.
---
Everyone thought warriors were going to be one of the least played and most needed class, so a ton of people rolled warrior and now as a clothie I keep getting dungeons with a pally and 3x warrior. It's great.
---
You can buy it on the character select screen if you dont have an active sub as long as you have 1 character with enough money.
---
I can’t get this to work, I see the loot window for a split second but nothing is looted. Auto loot is on. 
---
I do however have my spells set to activate on press rather than release would that break this macro?
---
Pack it in everyone. Someone hit lvl 60. Might as well not even play.
---
Between Tanaris and Shimmering Flats night time was was awesome grinding time.
---
Pretty solid overall build here. Everything looks solid and I don't see any garbage talents in your list. I'd say the only thing I might change would be to remove 5 points from Improved Seal of Righteousness and add it to Divine Strength as Strength not only adds to damage, but blocking too.
---
Honestly, give me majority of the QoL fixes that were done and the upgraded graphics, then call it a day
---
Are we fucking 12? This is /r/cringe or /r/ComedyCemetery material.
---
As a matter of fact, the exact opposite of that happened.
---
I did the rank13 grind (druid flagrunner). Made some frienemies, would talk to them on IRC. I still remember their nicks and wonder which servers they are on so I can reroll there and gank them.
---
[Further reason to avoid PvP servers. Players like this.](https://puu.sh/EgsKK/a14f4404d1.png)
---
Left side! Handle them!
---
Does anyone play retail anymore?
---
I like classic+ but I will say I would like a BC classic, raids were setup as 10 and 25 man raids but kept them as separate raids and 40 people is overkill, difficulty was fair. Only thing I didn't like about BC was resilience but other than that was a perfect expansion. Wotlk started the fall of WOW for me personally.
---
Yeah i remember this i did it before...but that does mean i have to have it downloaded right? Damn the game is like 60gb cba doing all that lol. Theres no other way to do it online im guessing?
---
Pretty stupid question.  I hear people talk about batching all the time, and I'm not entirely sure what it means.  Is it when a group of enemies all have their swing/ability timers line up, to do a bunch of dps at the same time?
---
This so definitely great. Only downside for me is when you have more than 1 mob pull at a time. Daggers get a little rough. I'm planning to go hemo and keep using sword with the sub benefits to stealth.
---
It's a conspiracy. Those damn Chinese Queue farmers
---
In Diablo it was "assin", like "Kickassin" or "Trapassin"
---
I like how it's called "True Classic"
---
I don't remember my characters getting deleted in vanilla lol

I just want preBC patch skills/talents and dual spec.  Give water elemental, earth shield, mutilate, that Shaman spell taunt totem, Titan grip, etc. I don't want the super inflated numbers that any BC gear or levels gave though.

Can someone explain to me like I am 5 the appeal of Twinking.  Why not do level 60 PVP? Is it a balance issue?
---
yes, i understand that. that is because the server infrastructure allows for more concurrent players on a given server. but where are you getting the information that each individual layer contains the server population cap, instead of each server having a single population cap distributed throughout each layer?
---
Welcome to classic snowflake
---
I say that with all the love in the world because you were me 15 years ago lol

Ok boomer
---
Present in retail.  Can't wait for this circle jerk nightmare to enddddddddd
---
That is only true if you compare inefficient dungeons with efficient questing which is not really a fair comparison.
---
0 agility smh
---
Holy power came in cata
---
Yeah I wouldn't give a shit how people are leveling if the AoE farmers would invite people for 1 or 2 pulls so they can get their quest kills and get out of their way quicker
---
Imagine being so lonely that you have to watch other people play a game
---
Play what you enjoy the most. Although keep that toon you play with your friend JUST when you play with him so that you level together. This assuming you actually enjoy playing that toon. It doesn't take long to get to 11 if you want to switch. Just as long as you keep pace with him.
---
Outside that, go with what you want. I have massive altitis myself and have been juggling different characters. In the end, I stuck with two: Druid for the awesome versatility and solo leveling, and Shaman for the raw group support.
---
P.S: Druid is the ultimate jack of all trades, master of none. If anything, I'd recommend using that as the toon you play with your friends since you can fit the role. Plus if your friend is the rogue, it means both of you can stealth around wherever you want. And if he's the Priest, you can stick to kitty form for dps and let him heal you from time to time.
---
Right out of his ass
---
There should be a stealth decapitation skill for swords. LOL
---
As the populations start to drop eventually will we be able to transfer characters to the busier servers?
---
I'm leveling a Rogue, and I've seen different choices when it comes to Riposte in leveling guides--some beeline for it, some take it after +hit chance, some ignore it entirely.
---
I know it's really just up to me to try it out when I get there, but I'm curious, do you recommend putting the 6 points in for Riposte? Why or why not?
---
Why print this..?
---
Subscriptions will always be king. Especially from an investor prespective. If Blizz had sub numbers to boast about, they absolutely would.
---
MTX is great, and it adds a lot of revenue but ultamitley each transaction is one time revenue.. But subscriptions are reoccurring revenue that can be foretasted and represents a stream of revenues coming in. Look at the tech world and how nearly every company has or is in the process of moving to subscription based models. Software as a service with huge enterprise software like MS office, salesforce, etc. Platform and Infrastructure as a service with AWS and Azure.
---
Subscriptions are great for investors, and still very important for predicting future financial performance.
---
Quests are the fastest way to level, so as soon as you don't have anymore in an area. You move onto the next.
---
Usually WoW helps you by giving you quests to report to someone in the next area
---
Overwatch was Blizzard's first original IP in decades. There was a ton of hype at the time and it still does well, but I guarantee you that it's being eclipsed by Warcraft and it will be for a long time.
---
rofl sure buddy, VERY difficult raids btw, i have to walk where my DBM tells me to stand, watch out for the ability my dungeon journal tells me the exact damage and mechanics of, and even do my rotation of 3 possible abilities that my entire spec has, one of which is a resource generator and one a spender.
---
Demoralizing Shout is really good aggro, or was, since I heard its patched
---
Horde = Red
---
This dungeon is really cool, the spider bong thing, when se comes... damm she is big
---
Why the profession switch? Seems like a lot of wasted mats.
---
This was me too. Good news, though; starting a new job on Monday! \\o/
---
Oh no they got me.
---
hey i'm clearly sleepy leave me alone
---
a player of the opposing faction on a PVP server will have a red name meaning they can be attacked and can attack you. People say that meaning they kill anyone else they see.
---
Don’t you guys have phones?
---
I play on a 2013 MacBook Air with a cheap Logitech wireless mouse with no issues.
---
Pretty sure that "seal" needs $3.50....
---
No it can't.
---
saved
---
i did the same thing. definitely never takes long to get a group for a dungeon lmao. i was told rogues are better pve dps, but warriors are strong af in pvp. I have no idea tho i never played wow before and am only lvl 24 lmao
---
As someone who played BC but never made it far enough to get a flying mount, why is it so unpopular now? I remember it being well received back then but again it was a long time ago.
---
I was referring to the story "Omg I didn't know" after killing the gnome. Situations when you think you will help and you end up doing it worse.
---
A good point, but I think it is MUCH easier getting 2 people to efficiently quest than 5 peopel to efficiently dungeon. Most dungeon groups i've seen have a ton of afk time, or messing up pulls, or not correct cleave comps, etc.
---
This is technically true, but they said “before p2” could mean literally the day before p2 starts.
---
&gt;Honestly as long as they don't fucking ruin it I'm a happy camper.
---
This is where the problem lies. Do you trust modern Blizzard to create content that appeals to classic players? Blizzard could make an alternative universe where we dont kill Illidan and KT, Garrosh isnt made to be a villain, and Sylvanis gets what's coming to her. Idk, not sure if Blizzard is up to the task.
---
why? where did blizzard say that each layer contains the server's population cap as opposed to the server's population cap being distributed evenly to each layer?
---
all i've been asking for is a link that states this and no one is able to provide.
---
Even made BfA half price lol
---
Change your right click to something anywhere on the hotbar and put  your wand shoot there
---
Free loot is the easiest, but they can get their items off mobs in group loot provided someone else has looted the corpse. 
---
Basically the way it works in group loot for quest items is that if you have the quest, when it's your turn to loot a corpse, you'll be able to see the quest item and any other items (Greys, cloth, etc) and loot them. 
---
If someone who isn't on the corpse loots a body (and there's a quest item on it), they'll loot everything but the quest item. The corpse will then be freely lootable to any player with the quest, and the only item on the corpse will be the quest item (Assuming the other player hasn't left something there).
---
Questie wants me to kill a bunch of stupid people using the addon.
---
If the player’s name is red they are the opposite faction and you need to kill them.
---
Yes it is doesn't matter the level range, specially late at night
---
F's for Chestnutz,  *“Because he's the* ***hero*** *Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our* ***hero****. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A Warrior Knight."*
---
Opposing factions have a red name tag, indicating they’re a threat. Kill all of the opposing faction.
---
Red = dead.
---
Could not disagree more. And I say that as someone who is genuinely perplexed by the concept of wanting to play the same game forever and ever, no changes.
---
If they do not retail classic servers, untouched, they'll lose those players only interested in the "pure" classic experience. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the solution there.
---
It's not about splitting the playerbase. Majority of players (read: Players, not redditors who play classic) will likely be excited about the prospect of either + or TBC, and so either are probably fine choices. But there are some who will just flat out quit if they cannot play standard classic.
---
For the cost of 2-3 servers, maybe more, Blizzard would be beyond stupid not to give that to them.
---
Yeah I know. I figured I'd ask where he/she specifically fishes to make that much money.
---
I have zero faith in Blizzard as a company making choices for player enjoyment at the risk of expense. I have got a degree of faith in the community throwing an utter bitch fit and threatening revenues if they try to turn classic plus into retail.... A relatively slim degree of faith, but it's worth a try
---
I'm a hunter and my brother is a priest, we're leveling together and it works out crazy well. If he knows how to control his pet properly and taunt things well, you can take out groups of mobs of 3 or 4 that are 1 to 3 levels above you and survive no sweat. Pally is a decent option as well, since you'll have heals and will have different gear to shoot for. I'd recommend priest personally though, go shadow and spot heal your hunter and his pet and you'll be a force to reckon with in world pvp
---
I have completed that quest once in all the 20+ night elves I've made in 15 years.
---
I think a big part of it is that you're a rogue.  Finding groups as dps isn't all created equal.  Everyone wants mages and warlocks for their runs, which is making it a lot harder for rogues and hunters to find groups I think.  Plus, eventually there is gear competition between rogues and warriors which makes it harder.
---
Best advice is to just be persistent and be around the zone.  Make sure you're the ideal level, not just the start of the rec level (dont try to do Deadmines or Wailing Caverns at 15, wait until 18).
---
Removing the layering will however affect gameplay experience for the players on the server. Removing all the layers will definitely annoy quite a few people when we are all waiting on that one quest boss. So it might psychologically pressure people to take the free realms switch
---
“Everyone is almost level 60.”
---
Yeah ok dude.
---
Sup guys! Help me please. I want to create the orc shaman, I have no problem with face and hair color, but skin color drives me crazy. It's really difficult to decide because there is no appearance change.
---
So here is the deal - I want the skin colour which fits Thrall's model. I guess there is no such colour available for players, but which one fits the best? Here is the pic. https://i.imgur.com/LKQl6ac.jpg I can't decide between 2 and 3. Which colour is close to Thrall's model? Which of them is more "true and orcish"?
---
Thanks for your help and sorry for my English!
---
I was lvl 16 and couldn't get a macro to work. A guy in my group kept saying "First time playing wow, lol". When I didn't respond to that he just said it again and again, as if it was some ungodly sin to be playing wow as a first timer and he was the grand detective who exposed me for not being a pro gamer. He was promptly kicked by nicer people

Which class would be best for soloing SFK and at what minimum level would it be possible to do it quickly and easily?

Any opposition has a red name. Alliance is red.

Valve is a private company though.
---
At 60 it’s more fair game, at 19 with twink items even people who normally have no idea what they’re doing in pvp can win.
---
You'll all be 60 eventually.
---
Skeram has Camp Concentration on Ally
---
No, you’re right.  Tukui is all configured behind the scenes, right?  I was thinking of ElvUI with the integrated menu system and configuration.  Not really sure what you can do to fix the issue, my go-to when something messes up is backing up and deleting WTF, but it sounds like you’ve already gone thru that.
---
Frost mage says bring on all the Warriors in the world. Also stop charging me out in the world warriors you are so boring to kill I'll let you live if you shoo.
---
Judging by the amount of people who upvote, get triggered, talk about and give free exposure to Asmongold (who absolutely loves it btw), I'd say yes
---
Beautiful shot! :) I love that zone!
---
Some people (myself included) enjoy the appeal of absolutely facerolling people at a much higher level than you in world pvp, and low level BG’s take a lot more tactic in my opinion, since you have a lot less mobility (no Mount)
---
&gt;most players won’t return for fresh servers.
---
Haven't private servers proved this to be false?  
---
People seems to love the F R E S H server race to 60, no economy, build the culture of the server from the ground up times.  If that's what's popular, why not seasonal vanilla on a 2.5 year season or something?  At the end, you transfer all the characters to some storage megaserver that remains forever at post naxx patch and then launch some new ones.
---
How's your connection from 100 miles away? Are you playing on wifi or phone network?
---
My job is only 3.2 miles away and no wifi but my connection is Slow so game freezes for 2-5 seconds about every 20 seconds or so. Debating on bringing my tablet and using my free hotspot data lol.
---
Would probably not make the queue in that time xd
---
50s
---
Gnome ftw!
---
It's a rogue spell called distract which makes enemies turn the way you want them to (towards the middle of the green spell circle), but it doesn't stop people from running it just turns them around and they keep running. And since it will take people at least a second or 2 to realize what happened they will have run over the edge. 
---
Mind control is a priest spell that you use while the ship is sailing which allows you to control an enemy, you then have them up from the ship.
---
True classic would die down to a small community after a few years.  
---
classic expansions are just repeats and quite quickly goes away from the classic philosophy quite quickly.  
---
Classic + have some serious potential. Look at old school runescape, they went down that path and it's amazing.
---
What's sad is that you're more likely to miss in general than most mobs are to dodge.
---
No you're just using it wrong. It's to hold mobs, chain kill/multi pull in dense areas, and to take on tougher enemies. Also Sacrifice is insanely good.
---
I've barely had issue with VW, and the only times it sucks is when its first taunt is resisted, or if you should just be using a DPS pet.
---
I use Imp/VW pretty 50/50 and they are for completely different scenarios. Different mob types, density, and terrain all make each pet better or worse by significant margins.
---

Thank fuck. As a spanish speaker, can't wait until the usual troublemakers who think they own the place isolate themselves and stop ruining our image.
---
Lol, I love this idea
---
That would be just plain stupid, it's pretty well established in WC3 that the BE are with the Horde and the Dranei with the Alliance
---
Those are rookie numbers gotta pump those numbers up
---
Yes indeed!
---
Also what I say when I came
---
Where did you download classic codex from? I havent had any of the issues you've described
---
i would but if you are dead set on playing swords and not paying to respec at 60 i wouldnt worry about it
---
I don't see how they could do BC without flying mounts. The entire landscape of Outland seemed designed around you eventually having a flying mount. They would have to do some heavy lifting on the layout to exclude those.
---
I'm not a huge fan of giving paladin/shammy to both factions.  The factions should actually feel/play differently.
---
And yes, paladins have a tanking tree, so they should be viable tanks.
---
Classic+, definately, like really definately.. 15 yrs back i always thought classic+ would be the route they'll take for expansions. like adding gilneas and stuff. god was i wrong and got dissapointed big time.
---
From blizzard codes of conducts : 
---
### Communication
---
When participating in communication of any kind (chat, voice communication, group finder), you are responsible for how you express yourself. You may not use language that could be offensive or vulgar to others.
---
Hate speech and discriminatory language is inappropriate, as is any obscene or disruptive language. Threatening or harassing another player is always unacceptable, regardless of language used. Violating any of these expectations will result in account restrictions. More serious and repeated violations will result in greater restrictions.
---
### Naming
---
Names are subject to the same rules established above. Any name the player has the ability to customize—such as player names, BattleTags, and guild names—must be appropriate and inoffensive. Any name that violates our standards or disrupts the community will be changed, and additional limitations may be placed on the offending account per our discretion.
---
**Take note that acceptable names are determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and role-playing servers may have distinct standards for using game-appropriate names.**
---
Love it when assholes like this get hit with the instant karma. 
---
I (shaman) grouped up with some ppl (war / hunt / priest) to kill a named Centaur, but another druid group sniped the spawn first bc I stood at a bad angle. The druid "REEEEEEed" at me thinking I would rage or something /shurg. The hunter called me literal trash and dropped group to go kill other quest mobs while waiting for the respawn.
---
I just sat there and peacefully ate my dinner while enjoying some football on the other screen. 5 min later hunter comes back but I refused to reinvite him to the group. I enjoyed watching him rage and have to wait for yet ANOTHER spawn  ^_^
---
Maybe he wants to play with his friends and enjoy the journey with them.
---
This is one reason having some fist weapons along the way would have been helpful blizz...
---
People complain that it removes the authentic experience of an MMO because it makes the world feel much smaller, and that it lowers the number of chance encounters with other players because more people are just flying over things.
---
Personally, I think that's all true, but I still think that transit periods are the least interesting part of the game, and if we're going by the same argument, dont flight masters make the world seem "smaller", aren't ground mounts likely to stifle player interaction, since people are less likely to get off their mount to interact with other people when they're riding by at high speeds? Should we all just be forced to walk at base movespeed for the rest of eternity? TBC and Wrath still had great player interaction despite flying mounts, and I think that the anti-flying mount sentiment in this sub us largely a result of curmudgeonly pserver attitudes which falsely equate the way things were in classic with good game design
---
Single player games already have a ton of replayability, so Classic only isn't out of the question.
---
I think branching could get strange, but it's the logical route to go
---
I mean, you're making zero effort to embrace the spirit of the post and seem to be deliberately inflaming opinion against you. You're going out of your way to act like a jerk.
---
That’s bad fucking ass. I love dwarves. Also OP remember you are a human in real life.... might as well roll Dwarf!
---
You can do all dungeons in the world and then reset all dungeons and you do all of them again. 
---
You can go cathedral, then armory, then reset and you can against go another 4 times both armory and cathedral. 
---
Only the resetting is locked to 5 times, not zoning into five different dungeons.

It's a nice boost yes but just like night elf and dwarf racial buffs for hunters they don't force a spec. A night elf Hunter can use a gun and a dwarf Hunter can use a bow.

---
why does resilience ruin pvp? It evens the playing field. Do you really want the best pve geared players dominating arena's and bgs simply because they have raid gear? Resilience meant you had to be skilled to do well in pvp, not simply have the highest ilvl gear.
---
Take it with a grain of salt:
---
Questie, the classic-ONLY addon that was released just Aug 7 of 2019, already has over 4.5m downloads.
---
I found a 2h green sword in Mulgore on my druid, and while I was on my way back to Blood-Hoof Village I saw a level 5 warrior fighting and dying to the various beasts that roam the area. So instead of selling it for 6s to a vendor, I waited for him to respawn and traded it to him, along with some herb-baked eggs. 
---
I hope it helped in some way.

it may be a stupid joke, but it's one that is related to politics and it's not a surprise it was changed.

You don't know how making a pun derived from a phrase synonymous with racism is bad? That's the outrageous part.

As someone who played vanilla and TBC extensively the hate for flying mounts baffles me. Getting my flying mount was so satisfying and I would spend large amounts of time just flying around and checking out the work from above.
---
Pally and Shaman pops will always look low because only available to one faction
---
Skeram has ques last night.
---
I had to do this last night!  Unfortunately you have to travel from Menethil Harbor by boat.  It’s a decent little run past ironforge, through loch Modan and then through the wetlands.
---
To be fair, there weren't originally Auction Houses in all the major cities. Orgrimmar was the only Horde city with an AH in the beginning. You're just super oldschool.
---
How's the whole being an angry tween working out for ya?
---
People forgot their favorite QoL things were added in TBC.
---
Well, I'm not anymore, but on a full pop server with an edge to Horde I had to find some more out-of-the-way grinding spots to farm my gold. There's a couple decent routes you can take in Desolace or Swamp of Sorrows, but I mainly stuck to Desolace Basilisks/Buzzards/Hyaenas as their grey trash vendors pretty well and adds up quick, especially with skinning. It's just those buzzards like to spam their damned disarm.
---
BFA actually reduced weather affects. I cant remember the exact line in the ini config file, but the intensity on retail is set to 1, but on classic it was always 3.
---
Also, OP must have not gotten the context from the stream at all. He didn't ninja anything. A tank helm dropped, he was the only warrior tank. Was about as straightforward a looting as you will ever see.
---
I can hear Michael Jackson singing Billie Jean and make quick "ahh" noise every time he shoots when I watch this
---
The fact the mods removed this is a joke. Mods or 1 mod has been on a power craze lately.
---
There's a guild on Stalagg that has the worst (best) guild name: &lt;Fruit Vendor&gt;. Been fooled by people in that guild standing in strategic locations looking like NPCs.
---
Wow I'm really torn between the second and the third options. On one hand, they really brought back the spirit of the game which is now very much evidenced by the success of classic. On the other hand, I reaaaaally loved BC and WOTLK so much the way that they were. Maybe there is an answer in the middle. I really don't think BC needs to be changed at all, but WOTLK could use less LFG.
---
Bringing real world politics into wow is kinda shitty imo
---
It will be my honor to slay you upon the ramparts of Frostwolf Keep, horde scum. &lt;3
---
Yeah. I haven't done spellcleave, so I don't know how hard it is, but this is really super easy as a warrior. 
---
I started doing it in RFK, really, and then moved to gnomer before SM (not as a spellcleave, just running dungeons as a tank with more than 100 dps) And as the only warrior in the group, in RFK... I was just doing about double the damage as everyone else without yolo pulls and still being the "Tank". 
---
I didn't even recruit for a melee cleave. I just ended up in SM and my group disssolved, so I whispered a paladin, then the first guy who wanted in to lib/arm was another good arms warrior, and a rogue, and then without any real decisions I ended up in a 3 warrior, 1 rogue, 1 paladin group from about level 36-38.   Then when one of the warriors dropped we picked up another level 35 warrior, for armory, and when they showed up they were dual wielding, and it still worked. 2 arms warriors, a rogue, and a fury warrior doing like half the dps of either arms warrior. Didn't matter, still really easy. 
---
No one even actually described it as melee cleave. There was no explicit coordination. It's just so close to what you are NORMALLY doing (pull the smallest number of mobs you can, kill them, repeat), that it just happens as soon as you have 2+ arms warriors in the same place. Hell, I have done it as the only warrior in RFK. It still works fine. You hold aggro on everything, you take minimal damage (for a tank in a dungeon), you do incredible damage, and the other dps just does whatever they like.
---
Flying mounts were pretty cool, but holy shit epic flight form as a Druid was amazing.
---
I feel like I'm definitely in the minority here, based on the responses, but I want some expacs. Just not all.
---
WoW changed as time went on. Everyone will acknowledge that. It went from a vast, difficult game that didn't hand you anything on a platter to something geared toward efficiency, directing you toward a few goals, and a streamlined experience. For many like me, "new" WoW wasn't to my taste, and I quit playing. 
---
And for me, that evolution culminated with Wrath. I think Wrath was the ultimate marriage of better storytelling, awesome events, incredible raids, while retaining much of WoW's original "flavor." Wrath was my favorite WoW experience by far.
---
I think it would be incredible if they left in the release structure that the game had through Wrath, and then go to something like Wrath+, or, depending on popularity, end things there.
---
I forgot about this. "I could of sworn Druids could use 2H Maces" after going to SW weapon trainer and not seeing it there.

Two hours isn't a dead thread.
---
I got the gloves and sword from sfk, and im banking them till battlegrounds come out. I recommend you do the same. By then, people will be making twinks, and will have more money to spend

Almost like unhidden polls are inherently biased and have a significant "snowball" effect with results.
---
You can’t be a tryhard unless you have full mooncloth bags dude. Sorry, thems the rules. I plan on selling a ton too. I love farming myself and the bag slots end up being worth it in the long run. Hope you’re enjoying your break from BFA!

I went to r/osrs with some popcorn last time a new skill lost with like 60% majority. Good times.

Become a powerleveler lol. Do what you love - leveling 1-60 and get paid for it.

Didnt used to get experience for doing battlegrounds. So you could stay the cap of the bracket as long as you didnt level
---
Lol I've seen some scrub frost mages get killed by warriors, shit i never even rolled a mage until now and it's so lol killing warriors.
---
He needs to bite the bullet and respec (find a guide that he can level with). If he wants to try and tank, he needs to get Consecration asap. He is better off going healing though, as it's difficult to tank with a Pally.  
---
It's possible, but he should look at some more experienced players doing it first and see exactly how they are speccing for it.
---
You could definitely do that too! But I prefer using a macro for this, because I lay out my action bars to mirror my keyboard's layout. So, if I were to just key bind a spot on my pet bar, it wouldn't be in the same place on the screen as it is on my keyboard.
---
/e too
---
Yeah can be as efficient as you want... the key thing that is always going to seperate an average player from a hardcore is the amount of time put in.

Don't believe me? Compare /played

Well. Better than quitting here because of wrath, i guess. ;)
---
That's right.  They didn't become viable tanks until TBC.   But once they had consecration and various mutli-target attacks, they became pretty good -- esp. for AoE tanking.
---
It's also a fun hobby for people that don't have time to raid or grind r14 that want to have the best gear possible in a given bracket.
---
TBC minus flying and making the old world entirely obsolete and empty would be neat-o. The former is easy enough so long as they modified the FEW areas that need flying to access to be accessible on the ground. The latter is more difficult unless they didn't raise the level cap or something?
---
Why would you have to play on a private server?  This WAS the game back then.  Also, why are you playing it?  Why the fuck is anybody playing it who hasn't played it before?
---
Isn't this bannable? It's been forever since I read this but I thought I remember cross faction communication was a big no no
---
A rogue can use Sap on a target taking themselves out of stealth to incapacitate their target for a pretty long time (I think around 40+ seconds idk)
---
For sure. One of the things that make Classic unique is the exclusivity to some things.
---
I try to give food to warriors when I see them leveling. I'm not saying it's everyone's responsibility to do anything in particular, but what I *can* feel confident in saying is that, if all of us made these sorts of gestures, fewer warriors would quit before 60. When all of us dps are sitting around at 60 asking where the fuck the tanks are, well...we could have done something sooner.
---
My thoughts exactly. This streamer stuff is obnoxious.
---
I’m on a low pop realm where we have literally maybe 3 60s right now: one travelers backpack by the time they are common will be expensive enough to where it’s not worth spending gold on to me. Taking 20 days to craft 5 bags will easily save around 700 g or so in purchasing bags at a higher cost due to supply and demand. 
---
If I focus on getting 5 bags first it’ll put me at a higher net of gold farming and less gold sunk into paying people for bags that don’t even exist on our AH
---
The staff.
---
Bruh you want BC without arena? Thats like saying classic without an honor system can “piss off.” 
---
Thats pretty much the single thing i wish classic actually added.
---
In horde it doesnt matter. Dwarf is far superior on alliance. I used to get kitted really hard with blackout and shadowguard as a rogue. It was infuriating.
---
Classic + would be cool I think
---
And this is why I don't play on PvP realms LOL
---
I want the expansions.  Most of my nostalgia is more for Burning Crusade than classic itself.  Same with Wrath.
---
😂 so it was you causing the feud between us. Iq 200
---
I want to play wotlk, and stop there. I think I managed two 80s before cata. So much I would love to do that I missed out on.
---
&gt;when I can see they will be full up.
---
A healer needs max 40% mana to continue.
---
You can pull as long as the healer is above ~20% and you'll be fine.
---
!remindme 2 years
---
Not sure if I'll be going for anything higher than r11 this time around. I think I had only 6dhk in my entire r14 PvP grind before TBC
---
And you overcome adversary by gameplay knowledge, not by dumbing down the game.
---
Let the MT go blacksmith so he can collect thousands of gold in lionheart helm and titanic leggings crafting fees.
---
Or pick the best guild healer and advertise reserve runs in strat: live that many are happy to come along in as you  rush the place in 15mins with a TF equipped MT.
---
Or go mining + herbalism and collect both arcane crystals and black lotus.
---
You don't really need a farm spec, you just need game knowledge.
---
I'd like to see Classic+ with step #1 being to up-level the non-viable specs into viability.
---
In vanilla I wanted to be an elemental shaman but lacking any mana recovery and no wand meant I couldn't compete with the other casters and then AQ introduced nature resistant monsters so I was completely locked out. With some elemental focused shaman gear with mp5 and a set bonus to change nature spells to another type Elemental Shaman could have been great.
---
Right. This whole cult of personality bullshit is fucking cancerous.
---
Gaming as reality show. Fucking disgusting.
---
Cross-server battlegrounds are coming (Phase 3 I think)
---
I agree though that the Dungeon Finder is a terrible system masquerading as a good one. You think you want it, you think it'll make the game better, but it does just the opposite. Cross-realm servers (i.e. cross-realm functionality in the open world, not just BGs) are the same in my book. Defeats the feeling of a community.
---
How would people feel about Dungeon Finder if it didn't automatically teleport people to the dungeons? Like you could find the people (maybe only in the city you're in, as an extra exception), but it doesn't pool everyone together, they still have to do that on their own.
---
Is there even any point for me playing then? If I can't really raid.
---
I don’t think too many layers even exist in higher level zones.
---
No worries :)
---
&gt; I don't know what game you are playing, because this is a laughably inaccurate representation of the game I am playing.
---
You do understand what "hyperbole" is as a rhetorical device?
---
Yep, I'm now Gnomeansno
---
Came here to post the same thing
---
Late to the thread but I am 44 rogue and just got a Ginn-Su Blade drop from ULDA. 
---
I’m on a highly populated server but since the drop I haven’t seen any on A.H. and I remember this being a popular twink item pre-bc. 
---
So question is do you guys think this is worth sitting on til phase 2?
---
It's actually shockingly easy these days. My computer is a bajillion times more powerful too. I was expecting some serious fan whirring but I'm getting nothing running 5 wow clients, twitch, a dozen browsers windows, and the boxing software at the same time. My machine was built 4 years ago.
---
Been playing 15 years and you just blew my mind. Take your upvote LOL
---
It’s not THAT funny jeez
---
My vote is for classic+. If they could find a way to integrate horizontal progression of gear so old content doesn't become obsolete that would be great. Maybe some new legendaries that require running old raids to build really motivate people to run the older stuff. Kinda in same vein as the TF bindings, the new raids could drop rare orange items the start a quest chain that takes you through a bunch of older content to complete.
---
And my favourite thing would be new teir sets that have set bonuses that either buff other classes (like priests renew allows players next holy damage done to increase melee attack speed by 30%, for pallys), or set bonuses for off specs(like a shaman elemental set). But all base stats stay on par with current great sets.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I have whispers and guild each in separate chat tabs. Maybe OP does, too!
---
Classic+ would be so lame. Anyone who wants it hasn't put much thought into it. Because, it's a great idea at first, but an easy deathtrap and slippery slope that could easily ruin the Classic experience.
---
I usually open with cheap shot, then ss then from there I’m still figuring out what’s optimal against different classes, I feel like if I continue stunlocking though, I never have enough damage to kill, no matter the class
---
There is only one loser here... My butt.
---
Run the traceroutes and let's see what they say. You might be experience some packet loss along the way, or other issues locally.
---
Patience has its limits. If you have been instructed on what to do or what not to do but ignore that instruction then you deserve what comes next
---
warriors are only strong with a pocket healer, otherwise they are the worst class in pvp lol
---
&gt; Consecration for Paladins? Talent .
---
yes, this iconic ability that was a TALENT in Vanilla wow (not a baseline ability), and is now a BASELINE ABILITY in 2/3 of the Paladin specs, and STILL a talent in the 3rd.
---
really?
---
It's the brevity of the encounter that makes people so genial
---
I run Classic on docked rMPB 13" (late-2013). 
---
I've got it docked to twin 27" ips panels. Runs great.
---
In BC at least, the number of places that require mounts to access are very finite.  TK dungeons, Netherwing Ledge, Elemental Plateau, Ogri'la, the other place next to Ogri'la, the place in southwest Nagrand, and the Skettis place.  All of those can just have flight paths or tunnels.
---
Or give flying a cooldown when you land, so if you want to fly somewhere, you have to stay in that area for 5 minutes or whatever.
---
More like:  Chromie reset the timeline, and now we get a chance to play the WoW that we always wanted.  =)
---
Classic expabsions would be amazing, TBC and WOTLK are the best expos imo. How I would do it is keep classic servers and people that want to continue achieving what they want in classic can and then enable players to port their character to the new game so they can carry on from 60 to 70 and then to 80 on new servers.
---
Fake it til you make it.
---
Classic plus. TBC ruined wow
---
I started playing at legion so this take could be a bit off. What if they totally changed the WoW story when there was a pivotal point in the wow story during BC or Wotlk and went a totally other direction keeping with the same classic stuff. Talents, no flying, that sort of stuff. So it's new content but basically undoing all the crap they added and taking another path.
---
&gt;  Why the fuck is anybody playing it who hasn't played it before?
---
Because it's a really good game...
---
So the thing is: I loved Burning Crusade. It's been in a much better state regarding class balance and raid quality. The downside of this expansion, however, is that the heroic instances lose value fairly fast. Progression in TBC is just so much faster than in Classic which would make the xpac - ultimately - feel less rewarding.
---
That being said, Classic+ is something that probably many people would enjoy, however, I doubt that we'd get anything along those lines. The community would be so split about this debate that it would be so much simpler for them to just throw TBC into the game (via character copy or transfer) rather than creating classic+
---
Mages dont really need the mage set so that is fine.
---
Selena Gomez is curvy? Lul
---
TBC is objectively the best version of WoW.
---
No problem, glad someone came with the solution. Best of luck out there!
---
WotLK saw Blizzard their highest subscription count for WoW, ever. It is assured to exist at some point.
---
It is for me. 😂
---
While his little brother was playing on that unpluged controller
---
3) Disagree ... but still take the time to tell the group ahead of time. I could be healing as a Shaman, but I sure as hell need those hard hitting weapons for soloing and questing. If you're not sure what the reaction will be, talk to your group. Personally, when I'm playing Shaman, I'm actively looking for either two handed weapon upgrades ... or very fast 1.3 or 1.4 daggers.
---
You don’t need a snide comment to rain on someone’s wholesome post.
---
Sheep = moon dammit! :D
---
Classic+ is the way.
---
If I am running past a hunter and I only have time to give fort to a hunter or their pet, I usually buff their pet. Thoughts?
---
If they did classic plus they would have to rebalance the classes. There are to many meme builds or classes which are plain worthless. In the current #nochanges game I understand, but if they are going to start development on new raids they have to do something about class balance.
---
Recently in classic?
---
Im a warlock. Does my firestone increase my fire wand damage?
---
Yep.  There was a patch in WoTLK that broke the interaction between Unrelenting Assualt and Revenge.  Long story short, you could do a hybrid Fury/Prot build, and you would be able to tank Heroic Dungeons by spamming Revenge which would cleave and hit up to 5 targets and you would do more DPS than any of the DPSers would.  I distinctly remember doing 13,000 sustained DPS in Temple of Storms and accounting for over 50% of the party's total damage as a tank.
---
I also distinctly remembering that Blizzard had no idea what they were doing.
---
Thanks for the tip, i'll try the version on Twitch Mod.
---
Why you in this sub tho?
---
My raid guild back in vanilla had a Druid off-tank. And he was there every single run, and if he wasn't tanking he was in cat form. Just have to find people that are less about speed clears and more about having fun while being successful. It's 40 people, back then at least 10 were doing the least amount of effort they could. In Molten Core at least.

---
Why are people so concerned that the game will get stagnant less than a month after release? Are people not still replaying old Nintendo games? Or Squeenix games? Or even Blizzard's old titles like Diablo 2? And most of those don't even have the advantage of multiplayer to keep things fresh. Good games are good forever.
---
I can see the appeal of BC/Wrath for some audiences, if they didn't replace classic, but to hell with Classic+. Good games are art that should be preserved, not revised by well meaning, but completely different people, pretending that games are created in a vacuum and that they won't be effected by 15 additional years of design philosophy.
---
Yeah but with this drop. People will run away in fear instead trying to fight
---
Damn straight brother!
---
My old laptop from 2009 that I used to play Wrath on at around 50fps on max settings now only gets about 20ish fps while playing Classic on the lowest possible settings.  I don't really get it, but I bought a new computer so I guess it isn't a big deal.
---
Only thing immortal about that game is the meme.
---
I do sell stuff on the AH. I have an auction add-on that gives me price estimates so things that have a significant price margin over vendor I would sell. The majority of my gold has likely come from the AH through selling skins and bars (mining/skinning). I have very little afk time, almost none, as my play sessions are usually only an hour or less (largely why I have done almost no dungeons). I do spend a fair amount buying greens from the AH, but most of it is as close to vendor price as possible. I won't buy gear that is more than 25s or so from vendor price.
---
Yeah the harpy cave in thousand needles was almost impossible to solo, 5-10 mobs would spawn on top of me in the blink of an eye.
---
Do you spend all your time AFK?
---
Unnecessary dickhead comment
---
You have to change your computers native refresh rate to 144 within graphics settings. Just because you have a 144hz monitor does not mean your computer will automatically run at that rate.
---
2005 was a strange time.
---
Is this a case of "boss makes a dollar, i make a dime, thats why i poop on company time"?
---
&gt; The idea of a dungeon is to bring a group that all has different strengths and make your way through it methodically.
---
Exactly.  Cleaving a dungeon is like eating a Kit Kat like [this](https://i.imgur.com/RsUA6XF.jpg). 
---
Yeah you're getting through it quickly but holy shit, you're not savoring each bite.  You gotta get the chocolate off each side, then the front and back.  Then you can snap off the very top layer of wafer if you're skilled, but try not to break the rest of.. AHH SHIT ya fucked it up!  No problem, start again on the next one.  Maybe try the top first THEN the sides.    The fun part is HOW you eat it, not getting the contents into your body as fast as possible. 
---
That's how I see it, anyway.
---
imagine being this mad
---
Ok the shift bars does not work, tried shift, alt, control, 1-5 doesnt seem to be doing anything.
---
Yeah you can cast any instant spells on the target while mc is running since the usage of any spell will break MC. Instant spells, however, will still be applied accordingly, since the spell ticks before mc breaks. Buffs, Renew and Shield come to mind.
---
I recommend it. Reduces damage taken through parries and that extra damage and disarm through Riposte is real nice.
---
I was hoping that this was the case.
---
Yes and he addressed that. There is a quest for leatherworkers that gives a bag recipe.
---
Classic++
---
Basically concept of Classic Plus combined with re-worked expansions.
---
Congrats!
---
All I want out of Ass is Improved Sap, but you have to go really deep in there through all that other shit to get it.
---
My glory days.
---
Feels good to be on top again, with a fairly equal rotation complexity 🙃
---
Issue with that logic is.... people are going to come back for phase 2.
---
Humam Warrior is as anti-rogue as it gets tbh. The class is enough of a counter, bit then you even get to *charge* them.
---
Dual wielding Merc Glad Maces in Arena Season 2 or 3was memorable. Stun lock was just nonsense. druid/lock/rogue team did well enough to get titles and mounts.
---
Id say around 30 really or even 40  some classes start out slower than others.
---
Completely agree. Classic+ is a HORRIBLE idea. Blizzard will fuck up everything.
---
And it's all garbage memes and nonsense.
---
Oh they knew what they were doing.  They made it a fucking head ache to do good damage with like tons of weak auras to make sure you were doing the right thing.  Then came out in a Q&amp;A and said, yeah we are nerfing demo because we specifically don't want warlocks to play demo.  They knew the spec was too hard to play and tried to encourage people to not play it by making them bottom of the totem pole.  Then told everyone that it was happening.
---
Where is that? It reminds me of an area where we used to farm rep eggs for netherwind dragon grind.
---
BfA makes BfA look bad, they don't need to do anything.
---
Focus on truth, and freedom of information will *always* be better than alternatives, in the long run. If you can't admit what's really going on to yourself or to others, then you'll never learn and improve.
---
Emerald whelplings.  They are mobs around lvl 35 I believe in the swamp of sorrows.
---
Minimize your time out of combat.
---
On your way to somewhere? See a green mob? Instead of ignoring it, take it down really quick. Boom the xp starts to trickle in. Doesn't have to be yellow. Doesn't have to be for a quest. Some xp is better than NO xp. Aside from that, don't focus too much on your level. Just have a good time and send everything you see to the graveyard. The level ups will come naturally.
---
I personally think, if implemented correctly, and with community involvement; that Classic+ would be the greatest game of all time
---
OF ALL TIME
---
&gt;Classic is a time capsule, there's no way to adequately create Classic + because the community and developers aren't in 2007 anymore. A great deal of what makes Classic feellike Classic is what could be called poor design and imbalance. Devs learning as they worked on new stuff and players discovering an unknown world.
---
Kind of weird to assume the devs *can't* make content in that style even if they wanted to.
---
I'd prefer Expansion Progression servers atleast up to wotlk.
---
Doing some sort of resetting Ladder for classic would also be fun.
---
Ideally we could have a set of servers that resets, a set that is true vanilla, and one that progresses up to, say WOTLK( and then possibly WOTLK+ instead?)
---
Relax guy. It's a joke. Let's just leave this here. This whole argument feels pointless.
---
I will be super blunt with you on why the refuse to respond. Classic is something which Activision wants as little "overhead" for as possible, as it produces a static level of income. They initially announced at Blizzcon that they would be releasing the game with the 2 hour trade window available after something is looted in a dungeon, but after the community response, decided to only to implement that system in raids, distinction being instances greater than 10 players for this system. That post stated that all loot drops are final, and blizzard will not intervene. I'll see if I can dig it up.
---
Nope, still running at 144hz according to my settings. Weird.
---
Let's get something straight here. We asked for Classic WoW. And while we waited for it to launch, everyone screamed for TBC servers and Classic+.   
---
You kids need to chill the fuck out and wait until all 6 phases get some play into them. The lot of you aren't even 60.  
---
You all won't get this classic + or TBC servers. It's a dumb idea and it will not surface. Classic works because it's the original take on WoW.
---
The way layering works is that it's automatically turned off if the population is too small. If your server doesn't have 3k pop, then there will only be 1 layer by default.
---
*some* people love it. 
---
If there’s enough people that love it and love it enough to pay for it, that’s a different question that we won’t really know until they try it.
---
NugEnergy. :)
---
Who cares? Big personalities are good for the game. They don't all need to be heroes, we need some villains as well.
---
Looks like I'll have to try that.
---
OMG! My wife used to say, "doggie doggie world." She legitimately thought that was the saying. I now say it whenever I get the chance just to pick on her.

Hipster confirmed

---
I'd like to see them flesh out all of the existing land-masses, without adding any random islands, etc.  Just a personal preference.
---
34 inch ultrawide here, i get motion sickness really bad if i play full screen on it so i have it in windowed and run something beside it, currently grinding for my mount and watching "The Boys" bloody great show btw
---
Don't worry. That mage still have many frostbolts (the only thing they do other than summon food) to throw around and many people questing to antagonize.
---
You can be sure that he hasn't quit.
---
If you are warlock priest or warrior you can fear the mobs someone is attacking so they can aggro more mobs.
---
The official statement on where they started osrs was that was their oldest backup.
---
Most modern bows have scopes.
---
But you only do BGs with other level 19s right?
---
So instead of attempt to navigate the minefield of future features and having to argue which of them have merit and which ones don't, why not just adhere to the rules that Classic laid down and nip it in the bud. No flying mounts, no daily quests, no LFD/LFR... just imagine I kept listing things that are frequently mentioned in this type of discussion thread.
---
lmao financial health is completely different than the actual health of the game.   
---
a game that has 10,000 people paying a dollar per month is probably a healthier game in the long run compared to a game that has 10 people paying 1,000 dollars per month because the former actually has people playing it.   
---
we really shouldn't be treating how much money a game makes as a signal to if the game is doing well or not. subscriber numbers at least show you how many people are interested in your game instead of how much a dozen whales are spending
---
Yeah I know, i said i was leaving because i didnt want To burden them anymore lol. And no, not just twice, thrice.
---
Would be great to see this.
---
One ganker is not the same as being outnumbered in every zone. I'm glad I have a group of guildies to quest with. If I didn't, I would have basically no chance of getting anything done.
---
Nice breasts. Are they real? 
---
Of course they are real! They're not mine, but they're real!
---
How is he trolling? That is literally the most efficient way to grind dungeons - no tank.
---
Not to mention you can get a group of non-aoe'ers and go pack by back and having a tank there will just slow you down.
---
If the run takes more than 12 minutes the cap is functionally nonexistent
---

Only odd thing I notice. Based on google translate this means the request is timing out right? This might be the server you are connecting to.  
---
My advice, make a character on other EU servers, log in, and see what the Ping is like. If it's good on other EU servers, it could be a problem with one of the jumps your connection makes when going to your server. Make a support ticket to blizzard with the information you gave above as well. It's possible this is a known issue with the datacenter or something.
---
is it worth getting brokentooth?
---
already got humar and really like him
---
Behold your "friendly classic experience" that everyone talks about. You got a weapon you wanted, your happy, and you had a simple question.
---
And all of that is met with nothing but downvotes.
---
More like blessing of high five.
---
I always remembered being able to enslave them.

&gt; Anyone who wants it is naive and shortsighted.

\*psyche
---
Don’t take life so seriously.
---
How do you turn on guild names? I can only see my own
---
I agree but haven't they already done that in retail?
---
I'm just asking if you'd like to see the same zones or entirely new ones.
---
Wish I could get a group for rfd tbh. Really tough when everyone wants to do cath
---
Yesterday a guy was running past me on his mount, jumping as he went about his business. As he passed me I hit that distract button and he jumped right off the cliff I was standing at.
---
TBC is a must
---
I like the classic expansions idea, but keeping the core classic systems (talent trees, no group finder, etc) in place. Basically add the content, but don't make the changes to gameplay systems.
---
I did this quest, and then stopped doing quests and dungeons and started fishing for a living.
---
Its hard work, but its honest work.
---
They atvi killed my favorite developer so I can’t in good conscience support them. Paying $15 a month for classic  is a real moral dilemma.
---
Currently playing horde on a server that is roughly 23k alliance and only 10k horde. If that ratio maintains....
---
Does that pretty much guarantee we won't have a healthy BG community once phase 3 rolls out? Has there been any word on if BGs will release as cross-realm or if they might do anything else to address major pop imbalances?
---
Are there other concerns over having a pop imbalance on a PvE server? Would it impact raiding or something?
---
Why on earth are you using details and recount? Also, that cage is only for an alliance quest chain. Have fun when they come to let you out!
---
i may be the first person you have encountered, but i'm absolutely not the only person who believes this to be the case.
---
and everyone keeps saying that blizzard stated this somewhere, but no one has yet to provide any concrete evidence that supports the claim that the max server population will be adjusted at all once layering is removed.
---
blizzard's assumption with layering is that after some weeks/months after the game's launch, all of the tourists and other players who don't intend to stick around for the long haul will be gone, and the remaining players will be spread out enough that removing layering will not effect the user experience like it would have when the game first launched.
---
Wait, so what do you mean fault?
---
Like what negative is happening because of these streamers showing efficient dungeon leveling?
---
I see all these people getting rare weapons with proc chances on them etc but I never played classic so i have no idea where to get any of that good gear ? I’m nearing level 30 and so far all I have is the drops from mobs. Seems like every time I inspect someone my level their weapons and gear leave mine for dead
---
If only there was a 3rd button "fire new content devs and just re-release old games".
---
I played with a guy and every now and then he had to go afk for around 10 minutes. Finally asked him what he did and he said "I'm a bridge lift operator, I sit in this little hut all day and when a ship comes I have to lift and lower the bridge, rest of the time i just play WoW".
---
I thought that was the coolest thing ever, slightly dangerous, but cool lol.
---
I vote for Classic +
---
id rather have Classic+ see the  cut content and the class changes they wanted to do for classic. it honestly felt after AQ40 they realized how bad some of the specs/classes were and were trying to make them better (at least the itemization for them)
---
Last couple nigths I have seen some really low level horde in booty bay (levels 15 &amp; 17). Not sure why they were there but they kept going into same building maybe for fishing? Well.... no guards in there and would just blow them up and laugh at their dead bodies. Then spawn camp them on respawn. 
---
Not going to lie.... Part of me feels bad, the other feels great about it.
---
Every time I try to pub
---
In the screenshot I have titan panel, Elvui, atlas loot, questie, details. 
---
My wife was amazed that I was doing programming during my leisure time, but I just have to know what spell in my arsenal is best!
---
Classic is just that. They arent redeveloping a 15y old game and the hype will fade away.
---
Classic+ without a doubt. As long as there's no power creep and the new content slows in amongst the old, perfect.
---
No flying, no class rebalancing, just give us *more stuff to do* with the current game.
---
Does Blizzard actually care if Classic makes BFA look bad, when the same subscription applies to both anyway? It's all just "World of Warcraft Player Numbers" at the end of the day.
---
You're behind on news, then. Bungie split from Activision a while ago and are independent. Destiny doesn't belong to Activision anymore.
---
Compound bows don't really have scopes. They have sights.
---
Yeah but you can park them up in the other factions area
---
What's stopping you from doing that in classic? With 40 player raids, you can easily have some deadweight.
---
I think the best solution would be to release the expansions with a classic mindset, i.e. no flying and no lfg maybe scale up to 40 man raids, which would essentially be classic+ with more nostalgia and less work for blizzard.
---
I honestly don't think that classic+ will be a thing since just releasing tbc and wrath would be much easier and cheaper and would basically accomplish the same thing. Besides, with new content comes new gear that will scale the classes even further into their imbalanced states that they are in now, which would require balancing. By releasing tbc they make all specs viable which solves the problem.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of classic+, I just don't think it's realistic.
---
&gt;To me there is no fun
---
Are you actually so dense that you don't realize your fun isn't everyone else's fun?
---
“Nope”
---
First, I am that person. But also I think I can live with this.
---
If you want to form a group, you still need to post the information in a public channel so addon users and non-users aren't going to be segregated.
---
You also don't have the addon tattling on users reporting on gearscore or achievements as a requirement to join the group either.
---
All it does is collate the messages spammed every ten seconds into a readable format and all other interaction is manual by the user, so overall still a classic experience.
---
Classic+ Is literally what jagex did with Old School Runescape. And look at that game, flourishing,
---
No. It's called World of Warcraft Classic, not World of Warcraft Retail Take Two.
---
priest here, i needed this. ive been wondering whats my best rotation and everybody online recommend different stuff.
---
would be cool if it could support healing spells too, thanks for the addon anyhow im gonna try it out
---
Exactly! Balls deep into ass!
---
D) None of the above -- I want a remade WoW 2 with modern graphics, which then goes along the lines of the "Classic +" suggestion :)
---
Stronk at the end
---
Not even a little lol.
---
Mortal Strike makes it somewhat manageable...but everyone other class is 1000x better at leveling.
---
This is still me. Went to lvl23 with a warlock and am now playing a lvl13 priest. Also new to the game, so I like to take it slow.
---
Did you know you can &gt;!mask text to not reveal spoilers...!&lt;
---
how do you see player hp?
---
Pro tip: if you used to be a paid subscriber you could email a GM for a week of game time just to try how it feels to play the game again after a busy schedule. I did it once and got a week. Haha. 
---
My answer would be that you can still play, just join PUGS when they LFM or LFG.
---
Thats what i do back in the days of BC. Whenever im free since i only play at weekends before(student).
---
I thought everyone knew that? I've died loads of times and just woken up in the local graveyard.
---
so no link then?
---
The whole point of classic was so we could play classic. Not addons onto classic. People are going to want to feel that nostalgia again with the older expansions.
---
It's runs on my friend like 12 year old mac book, a potato could run wow so don't break the bank for it
---
Well...
---
&gt;If they did classic plus they would have to rebalance the classes. There are to many meme builds or classes which are plain worthless.
---
I'd love to hear what classes are worthless.
---
You are 100% misguided, my friend. It’s going to be a AP/PoM/Pyro deep dick graveyard farming fuckfest. Best of luck!
---
I just feel TBC and TLK as core in WoW. Can't see Draeneis and Belf out.
---
Would go for Classic Expansions.
---
horde scum
---
On use effects have a cooldown when initially equipped, so not likely.
---
Except his comment was “when it released” and those ports didn’t exist.
---
I want to say it was a while before E3, but I know I'm probably off. I know it was definitely before the Shadowkeep announcement. D2 players are actually really excited right now, seems like D2 is moving forward in a very positive way with Shadowkeep, Armor 2.0, and a bunch of other announcements they've made since the split.
---
Look through the options menus for the different action bars you can display.
---
Or alternatively, research some UI addons and customize one you like.
---
2nd comment

There was a brief period of time in the 30s when my shaman had leather hot pants and a crop top on. Channeling my inter Kylie Minogue (Aussie pop star who was famous for leather hot pants).
---
Hard pass for me.
---
Ha wow I never knew this either.
---
Still doesnt get it lol. I dunno seems to me you are more likely to choke on your own water...
---
classic + with some 100% never fucking ever rules
---
1. no dungeon finder
---
2. no cross realms
---
3. and so on
---
I agree. I tend to find the chill moments between factions the most rewarding. I'll always jump in and help someone getting ganked, but I never start the fight for no reason.
---
Custom player generated content has always been one of the biggest draws to any game. Ironically, developers have been doing away with it, imagining it as lost revenue rather than free advertising. Now we have plenty of newer versions of games, like Starcraft 2, which are a pale shadow of the previous version largely because they neutered the options for custom gameplay.
---
How often do you goto the park to watch a bunch of amateurs play a game? 0
---
Xanax in a chimp’s morning tea actually
---
I remember a thread just like this a few days ago. Seems to have been removed though. 
---
Weird, huh?
---
Hey man! This is probably my favorite logo. Really like how it turned out. Tried to blend in everything, but I stayed with the Herod and the smoking part for the simplicity. Hope it's okay!

---
Classic+ just doesnt work, naxx gear was crazy, so adding extra tiers just breaks the game even more, and if you add no gear then people just wont care as much.
---
Seasonal servers and expansion servers are the way to go, and i mean both at the same time.
---
Is it just me or does overpower not work if you switch targets? Like, even if I switch back it seems to break. Revenge doesn't work like that.
---
I felt this could be the time where they rewrite history of the game and have it different of what it is now. I don’t think there story was what they wanted it to be when they first released this game .
---
Oh I know I’m just looking at it now and it’s like jeez this got 1.5k upvotes and I really am just like everywhere with this camera 😂
---
What UI is that? Looks really clean

You: "Hey dad, i'm playing WoW and just hit lvl 20, i'm enjoying exploring the map like you used to :)"
---
Dad: "lul eat shit noob i'm lvl 55 get on my level"
---
I would only expect healer sand tanks to ever need for off-spec, because, well, who wants to level like that?
---
but really, as a warrior I did RFK yesterday and let corpsemaker slide by me, since there was a DPS warrior and a shaman who both wanted it
---
Mages are the most boring class imo
---
I've played wow off and on since WOTLK (most recently in Legion) but always on PVE servers.  With the death of world PVP in retail, I figured the negatives (ganking, corpse camping) would always outweigh the positives (fun world pvp) if I was to join an pvp server.  But seeing all these posts on this subreddit about how fun world pvp has become in classic, I'm thinking of making an alt on a pvp server to try it out.  I also have wanted to try an RP server for some time, but never got around to it.  I figured I would join an rp/pvp server to kill two birds with one stone.
---
Looking at the available servers, in the US there are two rp/pvp servers, grobbulus and deviate delight.  Living in flordia, deviate delight looks better as an east coast server. but from what I've seen grobbulus has like three times the population and looks to have a better community.
---
My questions are:  is it okay to play on a pacific server like grobbulus even if I'm on the other side of the country?  My PC is fairly recent and decent if that's an issue.  Also, are RP servers strict about staying to "canon compliant" roleplay?  Because my idea for a character was an orc warlock (name pending) with a personality inspired by 80s cartoon villans like megatron and cobra commander, who concocts diabolical (and incompetent) plans to send in his minions (his demons) to do the dirty work while he cowardly stays back and flings attacks from a distance (being an rdps) and runs at the first sign of trouble swearing vengeance at his foolish enemies (my eternal suckyness at pvp).
---
Happened yesterday.
---
How would you travel in Icecrown or the Storm Peaks without flying?
---
Well on other services there isn't any delay using PayPal.
---
Don't forget to reduce your lag by deleting system32.
---
They won't be, it'd be like Diablo seasons where your characters are separate
---
There is a cool down for items that have activations.
---
So you would have to wait for that cool down first if you plan on making a weapon swap macro.
---
They did it for me, yeah. Also one time I forgot to cancel and didn't notice for 2 months, and, while they couldn't refund me, they saw that I hadn't logged in and gave me that time back as frozen time (which I'm using now actually).
---
This decision was already made when they decided on patch 1.12. From there, everything can be a pick-and-choose approach. Classic+ doesn't have to avoid touching everything that eventually happened in retail. We could vote (or the classic team could decide, however it ends up working) on incorporating TBC class balance decisions but vote against raising the cap to 70, etc.
---
Il ask him when i get on.
---
Every server is different I suppose. And thanks!
---
Classic expansions here.  Resetting characters would be infuriating after the work that went into it.  Classic+ means I'd have to sift through 1000 posts on how it ruined Classic.
---
"Friendly"
---
I want them, when they release hero classes like the Death Knight, to sacrifice a toon to create thats character. I've done it for both Death Knight and Demon Hunter and honestly, my Death Knight became my favorite class after the sacrifice of my old warlock. It gives life to the character.
---
Xelanth needs to come back to classic wow it seems. Nerfed infernal and enslave. :&lt;
---
Amen, brother.
---
Migrate, fuck that noise.
---
Wow I appreciate the information haha, thank you
---
They're used to be a progessive naming designation most companies used, with budget &amp; flagship designation variants. But these days They just mash the keyboard and try to one-up whatever the newest release a competitor has.
---
Considering the amount of guides out there, I feel like this post was made just for the ass jokes.
---
Can I have that macro please!?
---
You could reccomend a good mmo mouse for me.
---
I lag A LOT during peak hours. Is this normal? I don't have lag for any other game I've ever played online, except WoW classic. It's almost everyday during peak, lots of random disconnects and high ping. I've made sure drivers are up to date, I have a wired connection....just not sure.
---
I had a job/school during Vanilla so didn't have the time to do the pvp grind, now I just have a job and won't. I am rooting for you.
---
Holy mother of relics batman!
---
I am a crazy guy, I ran to Barrens west end as a level 32 , hordes chasing me.
---
I don't want to have a weak back
---
I've had a post deleted as well. Rule enforcement is not ubiquitous, and makes posting things that fit inline with "allowed content" exceptionally difficult, and has honestly dissuaded me from participating in the sub as a poster.
---
Has a bonus of warriors and enhancements getting free kills in later phases if they get the first hit. Hype.
---
Apparently you did because you specifically looked for asmongold reddit posts...
---
Bhaldi's Bhasics in Education and Ganking
---
Of what? The post from OP is because he is happy and also asking a question.
---
The point of my comment was when I commented it was at 18% upvoted with 0 points.
---
But either way, your comment only further proves my point that a lot of people here are toxic.
---
I can ask the same to you. What was the point of YOUR Comment. As it did nothing but put you in bad light no matter how you look at it.
---
Lol let me know how that works out for ya in 3 months ;)
---
Well, yea. Because of the effort required and more specifically the self-reflection which would be needed from blizzard to actually do a classic +, I think it's least likely
---
I really appreciate the tips, thank you!
---
Is tailoring worth sticking with after you have created your BIS?
---
I just think all they need is adding a new zone here and there with a couple of 5 mans that drop gear comparable to naxx but require you to have gear from the 5 mans/early raids from classic to make it through. Would help gear people to actually get through naxx and would then gear them for new introduced raids beyond naxx. They just need to avoid going stupid with stats and making people too powerful vs making it a slow increase in difficulty.
---
New bags/balance issues can be fixed by items, if a class spec is weak and blizz was to address that drop an item/set for that class that only they can use that helps buff them rather than releasing patches that change the class whole sale imo.
---
Want a way to make quests in new zones worth doing without raising the cap? Make rep needed to enter the 5 mans/raids or make those not unlock until you finish certain quest chains which would allow them to be very deep in story and long chains through the zone.
---
Yes I am
---
I think they should aim for TBC to give them time to develop TBC+ or something. Wrath was alright but it started to fall apart around that time. If they release up through TBC that gives them enoght time to not rush something new that sucks.
---
Anything that isn't a card takes longer to process by Blizzard.
---
Did each dungeon once to do quests, most of 50-60 was just min grinding at roughly 5-6 hours per level
---
I'd love classic+. Just completely new content in classic style. So many things they could do. Keep the spirit of classic wow, but develop new zones, dungeons ect. for it.
---
I'm a mage. Level 22, how do I get into aoe farming? Just frost nova and blizzard kite low level stuff? Rinse repeat? Or is there more to it
---
Dude I had a few of those "Zelotes" chinese gaming mice.  They are the tits, and like 12$.
---
Classic + please. Keeps the community aspect which exists in Classic by still having situations which require groups. Keep talent trees. Keep ground mounts. But open new expansions with new content that tell new stories in ways that were not told in retail. Then, since Classic is ground mount only, they can go back to allowing flight more easily in retail and get that complaint resolved as well.
---
Thank God! Someone in the same boat as me! Everyone keeps saying omg omg bl3, buy buy buy! I just don't get it...Not even 2 months ago everyone was in uproar about epic exclusive but here we are with everyone just buying without thinking, like don't people understand if you buy it now you support this kind if anti-consumer crap with exclusivity deals on a launcher that is very crappy, at best you will have a bad time with it or worst have your card details stolen.
---
square is for frost trap...
---
Yep right after the libs find a way to flip the supreme Court, the Senate, the white house, the majority of governorships, the majority of held state legislative branches and then find a way to hold on the house for more than one term.  They are right on track to outlaw being conservative.

The soonest we will see any re-release of sub numbers is after Shadowlands releases.

My penis needs a bacalum?

Didn't he get married recently?
---
Yeah IMO Paladins in classic really just have a bunch of assumptions that do not pan out -- like players make these fair assumptions based on fantasy tropes and RPGs and WC lore, and then it turns out it reality, those assumptions are wholly false. 
---
To me, being a Paladin, I would expect the baseline assumption is, as any class, I'm in melee beating shit and the majority of my time is up-close. Even as holy, I'm still a holy warrior / crusader / [support.](https://support.My) My spells and healing and utility is still an expression of me being a weapon / shield bearing class. 
---
 As a protection paladin, I'd expect to be able to tank and be the primary focus of enemies, thus protecting and sparing my brethren and sort of fulfilling the heroic class fantasy that, say, Uther fulfilled.
---
And as Ret, I'd expect my damage to be reasonable. I'd expect to be maybe around 75%-80% of primary DPSers, because I supplement with good utility. 
---
I never got my pally toon to high gear levels in vanilla before I gave up, but yeah that's a bummer that they didn't scale up to being able to fulfil their class fantasy.
---
I ran the same outfit for a while on my warrior in Vanilla. My guild affectionately referred to her as "Skank Tank"
---
As long as your server is decently populated there will probably be MC pugs you can join. Would still say it's worth playing even if you don't raid.
---
Is it also 144? Did you also have maybe a video or something on that second monitor?
---
Yeah I'm using a 1070 iirc and have it on effectively high with extra clutter and it's never dropped FPS to where I can notice.
---
Looking forward to see how high I can set stuff for raiding before going under like 36fps
---
I love this i did a good chunk of the whirlwind quest with a tauren and we were both severely underleveled but took turns tagging and killing mobs.
---
No. Flying. Mounts.
---
Mine said "for the love of game" on it.
---
So what is watching tv? Sports?
---
At least I’m not mentally 12 years old
---
nice name.
---
This is truly a sad thing, was just a funny name, I am fairly certain someone made the same guild on my server and I won't say Wich one as to avoid them getting reported. When are we going to stop pandering to these crybaby's.
---
And where are you pulling this assumption from? His stream?
---
Are you horde or alliance?
---
Make it so you only get on your flying mount at a flight path. Once you land you are stuck on the ground.
---
i mean no adding it in the future just because people asked for it
---
World PVP isn't the only aspect of the game though. Plenty of world pvp happened during TBC, idk why the trend is to say it kills it or doesn't exist. Not sure what server you played on back then but it was still rampant in the game.
---
No flying too!
---
Most Warr's will keep this axe in to their Mid 40's. Some Warr's, like me, who never get decent DPS drops or pass to the 2H dps as I mainly tank in Dungeons won't get any drops. In cases like that if you wanted to do a small enchant go for it. If the mats aren't to crazy the most I'd do is Fiery enchant if someone on your sever already has that Enchant.
---
My example is this: I'm Fury/Arm 2h leveling and I went w/the WWS (Whirlwind Sword) as it's faster AS helps my Fury more than the slow AS of the WWA, I decided to throw a cheap 1g Iron counterweight on it and sped up the AS by 3%.
---
Absolutely. I've been against flying mounts from the moment they were first announced. It'll shrink the world, I said. It'll mean you skip everything between points A and B and turn quests from adventures into chores, I said. It'll cause gatherers to farm gold far faster than people who don't gather as much, widening the economic imbalance, I said. There won't be as many chance encounters providing opportunities for chance interactions and world PVP, I said.
---
Weeee, they said, flying past on epic flying mounts.
---
Bah.
---
Screw flying. No flying, ever.
---
What addon is that for the black action bars?
---
a part of me wants to downvote for the treachery you've caused
---
Twink v twink bg’s used to be my favorite. Everyone had BIS gear and it came down to skill and tactics
---
A +0? Dude those are brainless, it's almost impossible to die. Not sure why you're even comparing them.
---
Honestly don’t see a lot of alliance questing in Desolace
---
The rotation is essentially that. You need improved blizzard x3 and frost nova CD reduction.
---
makes it more immersive in my opinion, you don't know how to effectively use the weapon since you've never used it before
---
not counting the old shaman bug/feature, of course
---
you pick what ever works best for you and your group
---
You're not alone, dude. I love Dungeon Finding. One of the best things they ever added to the game. Unfortunately, it came with cross server.
---
Arma does or did.. I dunno about Dayz..
---
In assuming a lot of them have moved over to GTA
---
Retail isn't dead lol. I know it can seem that way due to the hype and this particular subreddit, but lots of people play retail, and they have no intention on giving up things like LFG.
---
How busy is your server because I'm Whitemane horde and I've seen tons in my brief foray into hillsbrad (still v low level)
---
Like this
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=6;1;0
---
Who would’ve known fighting a move significantly higher than your level would lead to a lot of Parrys and Misses. 🙄
---
I see plenty of Fury warriors shredding mobs. You’re doing something wrong.
---
Wow, dead servers.
---
My first raiding toon back in the day was a pally. Leveled as ret, hitting the occasion big dungeons along the way (dm, gnomer, sm, ulda, zf). I reccomend leveling as ret.
---
It’s not.  
---
They just have no logical argument or platform against it... so they grasp at straws and point to things less easily proven in an attempt to validate their views as superior. 
---
Things like “You’re racist”... especially since they started to realize calling him a Nazi was completely absurd since his daughter and son in law are Jewish...
---
This idiots don't know what a tank and dps armor is. just let them be
---
Back when I was lower level and getting my alchemy up I kept dumping my excess potions to random people, especially for warriors and the reactions really made my day.
---
Man i hate that you don't even get 4 rep from anything.
---
Sure,  it still could happen but at a much, much lower percentage then vanilla where we have to get to dungeons while staying on ground in world.  I believe insta transport LFR systems, sum stones and fly mounts took a big bite away from Wpvp.    Why would anyone want to avoid pvp on a pvp server?
---
nyeeeeh... i kinda want to see what it was like to be a level 68 druid...
---
Are you in this sub just to reee about it?
---
Alliance roll over like a submissive dog when alone, but always act like top shit with a group
---
Yeah this is what I was going for.
---
I shouldn't have to sit in a city clogging up trade chat, but no one uses channel 4 so...
---
True Classic option would be awful considering the amount of time being put into the game only to make it feel like it was wasted. I would like this game to be its own thing where it's a classic rpg experience, whether it continues the path of re-released expansions, while maintaining the classic feel, or creating a new journey. I don't want to re-experience just to end up where we are today which is why we're playing classic. I don't see classic as an re-living experience, I see it as a second chance.
---
From my experience on french pvp servers horde where constantly spamming "L O L G O G O L" wich basically translate to "Lol retard" in french slang and i don't think i've ever seen an ally do the same. Nor blizz really care about it either.
---
Something like Party Finder from FFXIV would be ok as long as it's restricted to current server.
---
It's the cross-realm stuff I hate that takes me out of the experience. I only want to group with people in my own realm. It's the building of relationships and friendships that makes a MMO worth playing to me, whether that's on the field or in a dungeon. Nothing turns me off more than just 5 people randomly charging through a dungeon without a word anywhere, whether it be in the formation, during, or ending the party.
---
thats the reason you play nelf. Feign death to drop combat into shadowmeld to wait out feign death cd.
---
Fast forward to september 13th this is likely what has happened. At certain points in the day the horde suddenly outnumbers the alliance on Dreadmist PVP EU where as it normally is quite balanced, maybe slightly more alliance.   
---
Definitely looking forward to the next phase when layering is gone.
---
When all the kids get their wow sub for xmas.
---
Because when you fuck up as a hunter it’s way more noticeable. Turning off growl, long range instant attacks makes accidental pulls easier, pets drawing aggro when pathing fucks up, etc. Other classes making mistakes just isn’t at noticeable. As for stuff like ninja looting, it’s entirely coincidental. Hunters have a bad rep therefore any time one ninja loots it’s more memorable than other classes doing it, aside from rogues.
---
Never said it wasn't packed with people, but I have 7 mil gold so I know the AH mate it's dead.
---
Ridiculous.  There's a guild simply called TRUMP on a server I have a character on.  Wonder when that'll get flagged.
---
Agreed.  Superior animations and you dont look like forest gump running in his leg braces.
---
Also, perception.
---
Just ignore the people who are dicks. Eventually, their nasty behavior is going to catch up to them when nobody wants to group with them or associate with them. WoW is made better when it's a social experience, and if they choose to ruin that by that being assholes then that's on them.
---
Please don't let them get you down :) Anyone who expects you to be perfect at the game and gets angry when you're not are just being idiots. We were all new once, and we all had to learn. No, it's not anyone's obligation to teach anyone, but at least don't be a jerk to those that are still learning.
---
What about when blood elves and void elves speak to each other? They can both speak their elvish language even on opposite factions.
---
Reset characters and server?  How is that "true classic"?

If they can make cloth, you ain't skinning them.

---
I think that traveling should be an integral part of an MMO.  Rather than letting people skip traveling because it is dull, make it interesting!
---
For an example of what I mean, a quest asks you to travel across the zone.  On the way there, you find a town being raided by another faction.  You stop to help form a group to defend the town.
---
This type of content is harder to design, but much more rewarding.  It makes the world feel more immersive, like you are on a journey in a massive world that doesn’t care about your goals, instead of just walking to the yellow dot like retail questing is these days.
---
butt!
---
are you comparing college football to kids playing at a park lol
---
I’m hoping they do in-game special events and tweaks to keep things interesting for max-level players who’ve been farming content for a while. 
---
Imagine them bringing in the 2.0.1 patch for a month, letting people play around with new specs or re-experience that fun time we had preBC.
---
Imagine if they just gave everyone 10 extra talent points for a few weeks? What kind of broken, fun, crazy builds could people come up with? How does 2H fury DPS compare to DW when you get all those extra points in Arms? How dominant would an Adrenaline Rush/Hemo rogue be in PvP? All the fun of talent calculators and character planning can be blown wide open for everyone, instead of being stagnant in a “solved” meta.
---
Imagine if they re-tuned raids for “Mythic” difficulty for a month. Who gets the bragging rights for server first clears?
---
Imagine if they brought back old AV for a week?
---
What if they added new secret quests into the game like they did in Legion?
---
What if they added Timewalking dungeons via the Caverns of Time?
---
Imagine if they added a leaderboard for fastest instance clear time that reset every week.
---
Having impermanence means there’s a lot more leeway in trying out new things, since people can wait out the changes they dislike. And there are a lot of ways to add content that don’t involve adding gear.
---
Doesn’t everyone store 4 slices in the toaster and throw the rest away?
---
In classic they need to place the Dung/raid LFG app in the game. They need to make it so in the next expansions you need to bet the hole raid before you lvl and go to the next expansion Dung/raids and ill be happy.
---
After every single parry, miss and dodge you start sinking more and more into your chair
---
She's curvy in the way a toothpick is thiccc.
---
I think this needs to happen, this is the route OSRS took and it worked out well for them. I don't think the other two options would have very much longevity
---
Although worgen are totally skinable in classic : )
---
Smart!! Thanks so much
---
Oof, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm on Rattlegore in the US and other than maybe 2 or 3 times, I haven't really had a problem fighting over mobs. At least, not since leaving Tirisfal Glades lol. 
---
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I have layer hopped to jump to an empty layer lol.
---
Good idea.
---
Healers and tanks are always in short supply. They have the most responsibility and they take most of the blame when things go wrong. You will be in demand regardless of the race you choose. Those guides were written based on min-max theory crafting based on terrible players and low game knowledge.
---
All the current content has been cleared by under-levelled, green geared players. Whatever class, race, spec you choose is irrelevant to your success.

Brb farming 30 maces from gnomer real quick

I dont get why you are roling for the chest and not the loot inside what if he rogue gets a mage item or plate he has full right to keep it?
---
It's so good. Try /moon too.
---
Moo
---
That’s a legit data point if true
---
I’m at 100fps all ultra on a 960..
---
It’s Reddit, being on a power trip is the only reason somebody becomes a mid here.
---
&gt;Ultimately though I think Classic is a lesson in how important subscribers still are versus just tracking engagement.
---
Eh, I don't think thats the case. Its hard to say because WoW was such an anomoly. Most MMOs fluctuate with subscribers depending on the patch cycle and expansion pack. 
---
Thats why no other company reports sub numbers. It'd look bad for most MMOs how fluctual it is. Also when you report sub numbers are down, even if it was completely normal, people scream that the sky is falling and might unsub.
---
&gt;They need to get back to focusing on their subscriber numbers.
---
Eh, I think there are a few reasons why this is bad. Just because something is popular, doesnt mean its good. Also, I think that just encourages them cater the game to the lowest common denominator.
---
/reported for reporting.
---
I want a TBC expansion with a character copy that allows Classic to stay in place.  TBC is my all time favorite period in WoW.
---
-
---
I would also love to see Classic+, as long as they maintain the design philosophy and don't implement all of the QoL crap that feel severely degraded the community.  I wasn't a fan of flying being added in TBC, but I don't see how they could change it at this point.
---
imho it's still a game, if you want to play perfect join or create a guild where you can talk about it and find like-minded people to do runs as you wish, but don't expect random people to follow your rules and ideas when you arrange a quick group... It's a game and it's suppose to be fun with the ups &amp;downs/ wins &amp;losses
---
My post is simple to understand. If you enjoy watching people have fun playing a video game. You  probably have fun watching people goto town on your wife.
---
It’s one of the harder to obtain pets so it will increase once people have the excess to spend.
---
Rare spoony reference in the wild
---
It's people that watch streamers and think they have to emulate what they do... despite the fact they don't have the gear/group/skill the streamer group does.
---
It's like that in mobas where people want to use the friggen international championship strats in pugs... its like uh yeah thats not going to work even a little without 5 people playing that strat to perfection...sorry 3 people on the team aren't going to be concentrating on getting that one big D carry their farm.
---
Thanks for this.  I just want to play the race and class I prefer and have fun, it's good to hear I can.
---
Damn rogues, they ruined Ravenholdt Manor.
---
Hey thanks,  Yeah my plan is to just use this character to do dungeons. Won't do any solo leveling. i'm level 13 now. So plan is to just do dungeons. Do you still think I should use the picture you sent? And which of those in the holy tree do I pick first?
---
Because of the stats?
---
Armor does mean a whole lot while leveling.
---
Heck , even prepaid bis items for fury are 50% leather.
---
Damn, already got the tidal charm, thats hardcore. Did you have to camp with an alt or did you find it first look?
---
&gt; I think there's an interesting opportunity here. One of the unfortunate aspects of WoW's original design (and, subsequently, the design of most theme park MMOs) is that each expansion renders the previous content almost entirely obsolete. BWL &amp; AQ are meaningless once TBC is released. The same goes for countless dungeons and zones...
---
That is a thing that I have been saying for years. I just hate how Blizzard diminishes completely the work themselves make. 
---
Unfortunately blizzard loves to dictate the pace of how the players should play the game, leading on homogenization of classes and skills. That's the same aspect that butchered what D3 could have been.
---
About the classes, it is saddening to consider that so many specs would remain inviable for eternity like Survival and Enhancement. I hate druids though so I'm fine with that. :)
---
Wheres the best place to farm gold for a level 40 moint im at 50g hut im about 2 bars from dinging.

Overwatch will live on forever from just all the porn made from it
---
Never got the appeal of that, but it's Def true to my experience if 10+ years ago lol. That's r when you call in backup and raise the stakes.
---
I misread enrage; I thought it was when YOU crit. I haven't played warrior in a long time. I was thinking flurry, which synergizes with unbridled wrath much better when using DW.
---
Bloodthirst is 45% AP, whereas MS is weapon damage + extra. The whole point of bloodthirst is to decouple from weapon damage since you're DW instead, whereas MS capitalizes on slow 2h damage.
---
Armor means quite a bit especially if you're taking the occasional dungeon. I'm level 31 and I have mail only. But my weapon sucks so the universe remains balanced.
---
It is great for stealth of any sort.  You're often going to be stealth-running green dungeons so not so much there, but for getting around 60s in the world to grab chests or nodes, or for pvp, it's an all around handy talent, I never went without it unless I was full healer.
---
Things get banned when people report it, that's why.
---
Because its funny that its 1 rep away? 5999/6000?
---
Yeah those ones
---
thats what OSRS did
---
Knew this would be the top comment
---
Fuck off with the classic+ nonsense. You guys screamed for classic as it was then, and now you want classic+ ftfy. Next will be unchanged tbc. If you want classic+ go back to retail.
---
Amen brother

LFG came out in the last patch of wrath
---
Wow calm down Satan
---
Why? Fist weapons is a different skill than unarmed.
---
mosh Pit Jump Shot new band name I call it.
---
as a person who has not played modern WoW it seems inscrutable to me. my experience trying to get dungeon parties is spamming my LFG copypasta over and over and over, getting no response, then giving up and grinding gorillas for several hours instead.
---
He's not being ridiculous. There absolutely are people who spend that much on a microtransactions, though they, of course, are not banking on everyone doing so. If a single (of hundreds of thousands) player spends $250 in a given month, that's roughly equivalent to the monthly revenue from **seventeen** WoW subs (assuming they renew monthly).
---
Bag space is the biggest premium in the game, though.
---
Honestly?
---
Just give us the expansions again.
---
I don't trust blizzard enough to not fuck up Classic+. In an ideal world, I'd want Classic+, but I don't have any faith in Blizzard to not ruin it.
---
While some mage spell spellcleaving and getting 70k xp/hour
---
The tough reality is this that Blizzard will never be able to turn off layering.
---
Hamstring kiting isn't really a thing in Classic due to melee leeway.
---
Yep , people in silver pine get influenced to go there early 20s. Never a good idea. Go to barrens and do the kalimdor circuit of southern barrens , stonetalon, ashenvale, then half of 1k needles... then hillsbrad when you’re 29ish
---
For anyone still searching for something similar,
---
Download ccc addon. It's almost exactly like the one in the screenshot without having to go through all the trouble of setting up weakauras or tellmewhen
---
'Seasons' aren't True Classic. The expansions are true classic.
---
I think I'm partial to Classic+ but would love BC again too. If they do expansions I'd like them to combine it with seasons (BC launches, new classic servers open up).
---
What? Nah, never!
---
Who fucking cares what other people think?
---
That's what downvotes are for.
---
As a Lv 35 warrior, your efforts are appreciated.
---
As someone who started in legion, i would love classic expansions cuz i cant always go back to normal classic
---
Retail makes itself look bad and you just took this random users opinion as gospel.
---
D3 has had lower numbers than d2 for years. D3 is a dead game just like retail.
---
What, are you trying to kill him 3 times?
---
It can’t be dodged or parried, but it can miss
---
Signed, but with a caveat to also ban petitions.
---
Classic+ 1000%. It works so well for OSRS and that's really the best comparison we've got. I don't mind them doing stuff we got in the end any way, like Northrend, but it'd be so interesting if they never raised the level cap and just added in more options for levelling (Northrend in Classic could be like a 30-60 level continent. The Lich King comes after the Horde and Alliance after we get rid of old KTZ. etc)
---
I've been posting this in barrens chat for days!
---
I have never been able to read it another way.
---
Look, who's the federal wildlife Marshall here, you or me?
---
I am a TBC fan, it would be nice to see SomeChanges to it but I would be fine with a Classic TBC treatment just like this one.
---
Classic+ has its appeal as well but IMO it has a lot of hurdles to overcome:
---
1. Naxx gear was highly focused and purpose built. You can't really have lateral progression from Naxx without the gear being worthless basically, which means a tier beyond it. Itemization without combat ratings is a real scaling problem.
---
2. We know where consumable spam philosophy went, how do we want them to tune raid content knowing what a clusterfuck the first tier of TBC was until they changed it? World buffs etc short circuit everything, do we dispel them in the new raid? Vanilla philosophy certainly says a higher tier should be more challenging.
---
3. Off specs are dogshit and without TBC design, fixing that takes MAJOR changes that others will find unacceptable. This is the sticking point for me.
---
4. Content development. How do we prove to Blizzard that parallel development would be worthwhile when they didn't even believe people wanted Classic? When we've stuck around in record numbers through late Naxx it'll be pretty late to start developing this stuff, but better late than never.
---
5. There is a very limited set of content that was cut, never used later, never would be used in retail, and would still be good to implement. They would eventually have to be willing to include divergent versions of the same content.
---
That's really not impressive though i mean 2 49 twink rogues can kill a paladin in full mc gear that's way more impressive.
---
After this one agreed
---
Because I didnt do anything special that I need to be thanked for. It never occured to me that I should say thanks to each dps individualy for doing damage for me. If everyone says *thanks for the run* in the party chat thats really enough politeness.
---
OK Debbie downer. 
---
PLease provide sources for these claims. 
---
A blue has already posted on this matter and the economy is not "completely screwed"
---
Peaple are walking around with 3000 Arcane crystals in their bank LOL. 
---
The Blue Already put a silence to this fake news.
---
10/10 on the ending. Would read again!
---
terrible joke. 
---
Downvoted lol
---
Me and the 4 other friends I exclusively dungeon with honestly tried our best to play it the way we remembered. Leading up to the release we were all really looking forward to the pace shift in Classic 5-mans as all of us had quit during BfA only a few months into it and were completely over Retail.
---
At around level 30 though it just started becoming apparent we aren't the same players we used to be. After 13 years of playing, we are simply better at the game than our younger selves. We kept up the CC and marking kill orders for as long as we could but it just kept feeling more and more unnecessary. It would often go something like mark targets, sap pulls one into sheep on a second then blow up the 3rd in 3 - 5 seconds effectively saving the tank from taking 2 - 3 auto attacks that our healer could have easily handled.
---
We are still having a blast in Classic but dungeons are much more enjoyable and engaging now that we are a bit more honest with our ability. Despite what many say on here we actually find it more challenging to clear dungeons with massive AOE pulls, we just focus on different mechanics like LoSing, co-ordinating pally bubbles mage slow rotations etc.
---
Druid ganking isn't exactly easy mode.
---
That's the thing though. You didnt misunderstand me. That's what I meant.  The majority of dungeon farmers, much like in retail, are people who think they are try hards. They are method fan boys, twitch chat spammers ect. True, there were real try hards doing it, they have been lvl 60 for 2 weeks now. I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about the bagillions of people still doing it, after the exp was gutted in a hot fix, and are still only lvl 30 or 40. Now sure some of those people are not bad, or wont be bad cause they will figure it out, but most will be terrible. Most players are terrible, it's a vide game, that's how it is lol. 
---
I'm not saying fuck them. I dont care if they are bad. Everyone is bad at wow at first.  Just saying its going to be easy pickens when they roll out phase 2.
---
It's a pretty standard practice to consolidate servers when you have multiple low pop ones. You probably won't get a free transfer until it's bad enough that they actually shut your server down or merge it. In the latter case though you'll not get a choice of where you end up.
---
That's exactly it. I absolutely love DF because I dont have to sit in trade chat for 15-30 minutes spamming "LF TANK". 
---
I hate that it was cross realm. 
---
I was on Coilfang and I swear every time I got hooked up with someone from Illidan they were good players but awful human beings
---
Chill bruh.
---
Check out that Bandit jerkin that monkey....
---
PSA: Ban I/akfortyevan. He provides nothing constructive and posts cringe petitions on Reddit.
---
First off: Feral druids don't *run* Gnomeregan. They stealth to the pummelers, rinse / repeat.
---
Secondly: Only level 60 Ferals run it for niche purposes who won't wait for levelers to join a group and contribute 0 DPS and hold them back. 
---
The ability to find groups for leveling dungeons simply doesn't scale when 90% of the population is level 60. This is why LFD was implemented to begin with. Stacking expansions on top of each other is the problem. That's how you solve the LFD problem. Don't add expansions on top of previous content. 
---
Replace previous content entirely and make everyone level all over again. No other solution you could propose would give leveling dungeons the critical mass necessary to be available without LFD in two years.

You'd be surprised on #4, dps definitely bitch about going too slow and will aggro intentionally to "speed things up".

Ahhh fuck that is a really great terrible band name :/ lol
---
Are you always this toxic? What’s your deal, exactly?
---
To be faaaaiiiirrrrrrrrrr
---
Oh... I got a logitech g600 and the extra buttons are a game changer. I would never go back to playing without it except... it is buggy and doesn't work half the time so I'm looking for an alternative.
---
coming from a healer, I wouldn't be opposed to the DPS tanking that aggro and dying while I replenish my mana, then letting the tank take over. They gotta learn somehow and I'll happily pop a potion to keep my tank alive after he let them learn the hard way.
---
The new servers have all been steadily growing and are all above a full vanilla server I believe. By comparison of a server that had like 50k people on at once I’m sure it feels barren
---
Don't do it it's the price they must pay to big the biggest murder machines at 60
---
This is the revenge he speaks of.
---
I'm PvE, but my one and only "PvP" kill from TBC was when I played flying form chicken with a Horde druid and won. I will cherish that memory forever
---
how much gold should you have accumulated at lvl 30?
---
Nope I’m on faerlina.
---
Not only will the raids still be there, the casual guilds will still be struggling with MC.
---
You ok*y?
---
People roll need on BoP's even if they can't use it, just so they can vendor for extra coin. There is a 100% chance people would do it for a BoE that's worth that much gold.
---
Just like I thought.
---
Progression servers. Let the servers naturally progress over the life cycle of an expansion, and release new progression servers every year or so so that there's always somewhere to play.
---
? you didn't answer my question
---
Blizzard made it like this on purpose. Makes you have to work for it lol
---
Yes, with your name I'm not sure if calling homeboy edgy was meant as an attempt at ironic trolling or not. Are you sure YOU know?
---
You ok*y there buddy?
---
You do you bud, more monkey pussy for me.
---
Priests are awesome. Very decent questing, above average dungeoneering and fantastic pvp
---
jebaited
---
General Reposti!
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
Play another class and see how much easier it is. Warriors can't really pull an extra mob unless you are fighting stuff waaay longer than you. Also, you can't slack on your weapon or its way harder.
---
I like how that axe is just a razor edge.
---
I can’t afford to get addicted to WoW, I’m 1 semester away from graduating college. The end is in sight and I can’t flub it now.
---
That being said, it’s hard not to waste hours in Classic...I’ve missed this game for so long...
---
&gt; Spies, turn coats and even triple agents emerged.
---
This is starting to sound like EVE Online.
---
If only you had something I could sign!
---
Hello fellow warrior!
---
I just started tanking in classic as well.  I rolled as dps filthy casual all my life but wanted to try something new and challenging.  I'm by no means an expert but here is what has been working for me:
---
1) Mark your mobs so the DPS know what to kill and you won't get as many runners.  Skull = 1st, X = 2nd.
---
2) Charge if you can, if not pull and start with Demo shout once you get enough rage.
---
3) Sunder armor, sunder armor, sunder armor.  Tab target and apply it to the pack.  I'd sunder the skull twice if you can.
---
4) If you get a runner that is &lt; 50% health, let the dps take care of it.  If they are &gt; 50% health use Taunt.  Do your best to chase it down without turning your back to the pack.  If the DPS is an idiot and is running away from you (they should be running towards you) use hamstring if you can to buy some time.  Or let them die because they're an idiot that attacked an unmarked mob.
---
I don't know if any of this applies to those "spell cleave" groups I've seen mentioned.  I tend to go at my own pace.   I've only had 1 complaint so far in the 8 or so dungeon runs I've done and I told them I was going as fast as I was comfortable going.  Most people are actually pretty cool and understanding.  Don't let the vocal minority of assholes change your play-style.
---
GL and zug zug.
---
The burning crusade would really be the only expansion I’d wanna play..
---
This this this
---
Warriors killing mages? Lol
---
I (horde) was killing yetis in Hillsbrad last night.  A same level alli druid comes in.  We /wave and continue questing.  He pulls 1 too many mobs and I jump in.  Minutes later he does the same for me.  Solid 30 mins of just questing around each other.  I put a frost trap at the mouth of the cave, when he triggers it I /laugh till its done.  He laughs, my pet laughs, I abandon pet.  Good times were had.
---
The wife started to get mad I was playing too often without taking time to spend with her. Just didn't want to get too far behind the curve. But I realised I'm still well ahead of the curve most people are in their 30s and I'm 45. So I'll just take it easier and I will get to 60 before the month is over I'm sure. But yeah totally addicted again.
---
Yep it's why I'm making an alt for every class
---
All non cloth wearers that can be a healer I'll use to join a mage cleave as an emergency backup
---
Holy paladins have decent aoe, too, so I can be utility plus damage with free loot
---
Classic+ would be amazing.
---
I think it would be more fun if they did get the damage wrong and enemies could be threatening in smaller numbers.
---
One thing that helped me a lot is that your shouts generate a lot of agro, Esp on mobs you aren't actively attacking but that might get pulled off you from healing. Battle shout generates threat based on how many allies you buff, demoralizing shout based on how many enemies you debuff. I usually start pulls by using battle and then dormoralizing a cpl times.
---
This made me lol on a plane smh
---
What's the best way to go about leveling a new weapon type? I'm L35 and have only used bows, currently have Raptors End (12.1 DPS). I picked up Shrapnel Blaster which is 17.4 DPS so a big upgrade.
---
There are a few bows coming up that will be even better upgrades like Master Hunter Bow, but I'm interested in building up another weapon skill anyway.
---
stop having a life outside wow
---
For the horde!
---
I posted when it was announced they just made a billion dollars.  It might be more than that.
---
The servers will grow quickly once people realise that the servers which currently have 70/80/90k players are going to end up back with 8-9hr queues when layering goes away.
---
And for all those who keep saying "layering has nothing to do with a server capacity" that's BS. Gehennas tonight at peak had over 10k alliance online at the same time. Horde outnumber alliance 60:40, so there were about 20-25k players online at the same time. That is simply not going to be possible when Layering is off, so expect 15-20k of those to join you in the queue.
---
Can’t confirm. On the other hand, I had earplugs in so I didn’t hear shit except the galloping of my dreadstead.
---
Classic+ would be for the best. I have no interest in reliving blizzard ruining a good game with the same xpacs.
---
An Overwatch player dropping 250$ in a single day is ridiculous. It would be EXTREMELY rare.
---
Weird, I didn't know companies that are doing well have to lay off so many people
---
You know nothing of vanilla economy, or an economy in general so how would you possibly know? What drives an economy? Supply and demand. What happens to prices when demand stays the same but supply keeps going up due to layering? You can see this for all types of cloth as an example, normally cloth is priced higher because you don't get that much surplus cloth from leveling, you use some for first aid, some for tailoring or if you don't use it at all you have a few stacks you can sell on the AH. With Classic being the shit show it is and everyone running dungeons people are drowning in cloth, the result as such is that you can buy cloth for pretty much vendor prices on the auction house. 
---
The same goes for any other commodity in the game. Be it arcane crystals, black lotuses, devilsaur leather, elemental earth or anything else really. There are a few items that roughly stay the same, like elemental fire due to the nature of supply/demand for that particular commodity, but most other things have ridiculously low prices due to the massive surplus of said commodities thanks to layering. Layering was predicted to be a negative thing in many ways, one of those being the negative impact on the economy and it has proven to be just that, and more.
---
Wont all new raid content be finished same day?
---
I chortled
---
There already have that it’s the dungeon they added and 20 man raids. Problem is so many people won’t do all the end game never mind more raids.
---
This is a dude binding dance and shoot so he dances between shots
---
Taming is a much more boring animation
---
I don't watch a lot of amateurs who stream. You used a pretty wide net to denounce all people who watch streamers. It's a pretty indefensible position.
---
tell me when to track buffs and spell cds
---
I feel like flight mounts take away from world PvP.
---
I was looking all over my screen to find your nameplates in my group! I don't know what happened!
---
And unless sub prices go up, the worth of each individual subscriber goes down. A subscription is worth 20% less now, than when the game launched. Despite the price never changing. Even if Blizzard had just as many subscribers, they'd bring in 20% less subscriber revenue.
---
Did you get help throughout the quest chain? I just hit 30 not sure if I can tackle it alone.
---
The first line in that video says, "for the **updated** recruit a friend program"
---
I guess you sort of tried tho
---
While I'm loving Classic, the main thing I want personally is Wrath servers, even if it doesn't go beyond that.
---
Lmao imagine wanting to use an upgrade what a FRIKIN RETARD.
---
Gotta love these retail babies that think they are going tag steal at low health. End up dying but do half the work for you. Where as might have been just easier to inv me to help you , this way only I got credit. Thanks though.
---
My ThinkPad x220 upgraded to 16gb ram and a ssd runs quite well, cost me maybe $300 total on ebay a couple of years ago. Not sure about raiding, but it does handle addons with no issues.
---
Don't be embarrassed. Even experienced players make mistakes and pull too many mobs. It's a learning process. Just make sure you're clear on what you did wrong so you can learn from it.
---
I hate fighting mobs who are waaay longer than me, it's so emasculating :(
---
Be sure to carry an int set with you for these trying times!
---
You have not addressed the fact that as gold value goes up, it somehow converts from greed to need. Dungeons are for gear upgrades, I pass on boes other players need because I want my boes if they drop. I'd like to see warriors saying they deserve caster boes just as much as a mage keeping that resolve when edgemasters drops. You want to take away someone's upgrade because you think you deserve gold more than they deserve an upgrade. That is greedy behavior.
---
Ayyy shout out Fairbanks!! We out here
---
Not classic - booooo
---
I can give you tips but it really depends on your class. Each class has different ways they can farm.
---
You couldn't even resist changing the name.  
---
Power word: CRINGE!
---
Grinding paladin is one the most boring things in wow
---
OSRS Model, listen to the community and let us choose what content comes next, or a different level cap for the newer xpacs (bc 65, wrath 70 etc)
---
My steam profile shows nearly 6000 hours on dota 2.  That's almost 250 straight days.
---
I looked far and wide. This addon works great for sorting your bags and works great with one bag and bagnon.
---
&gt; there was plenty of world PVP in the Outlands. 
---
I agree with you on that.  
---
I always read "world pvp was dead in outlands because flying mounts", during TBC i remember doing a shit ton of World PVP, so much fun tbh.
---
Can I have TBC+?
---
Cause thats pretty much what I want. I wasnt that happy with some parts of TBC lore, but overall, it was my favorite time. Not fan of killing Zul'Jin btw.
---
I'd need a timer for how much time I've spent healing/buffing/rezzing lone warriors.
---
I try to do it to everyone, but Warriors get special treatment.
---
I'm guessing it's 1/8th of my total play time.
---
Ive distracted so many people at the great lift in southern barrens. I love distract so much, such a fun spell
---
Things were going well in BFD last night, no problems. Our healer says it has "been boring." We need to backtrack to kill some naga for someone's quest items. As we're doing that our mage aggros a set of twilight cultists and kites them through half the instance so we have to fight them as the same time as the Naga to in his words, "make it exciting." I admit I had a good laugh.
---
the amount of alliance talking about a balanced population herod blows my mind tbh
---
Honestly I’d fucking love something like this in a few years time
---
I'd love to see the expansions progress, possibly with the removal of flying mounts and dungeon finder.
---
I liked wrath, it was a point at which you could really be any spec and be competitive, but it didn't make everything all the same like it is now.
---
They're better than the cancerous 'lol ass' post straight from r/wow
---
What would be some more generic terms? Power is used for mana, energy, etc.
---
But for Damage... hmmm, spellpower would be too redundant.
---
Classic plus would be the way to go. Its possible to keep us at 60 and give us new content while keeping it at the same difficulty of classic.
---
My only issue is that BC and Wrath fixed a lot of things that were fundamentally wrong with the game and i fully believe those QoL changes and such should be added. Like the Tier Tokens allowing people to play their class truly how they wanted to.
---

That's impossible, I'm sorry. I love this game but you have to be realistic. Every game peaks shortly after release, then the numbers slowly settle in. Some settle in closer to the peak than others, but to pretend classic WoW will maintain what it has is just not possible. In fact, I can piratically guarantee you they've already dropped compared to week 1

The game doesn’t present a lot of “power leveling” opportunities but, based on your user flair, I’m assuming you’re a horde drood. So as a level 30 drood you could help your 18 friend by helping finish some dungeon quests as they are leveling normally. Run through RFC / WC / RFC quests quickly. You can also heal to prevent downtown in between pulls and scope out new pulls. Grouping will result in exp loss until they are closer level, 25+. If you can spare it you can also outfit them in the best gear as they level. That will help a lot in kill speed.
---
Classic+ no question.
---
This is what I want. Do a alternate timeline type thing
---
Classic Plus all the way.
---
The reason for this implementation is that players were afraid of getting into a group as the lone pug, had having all drops they needed reduced to 20% chance, as groups could game the roll %'s by being able to redistribute bop loot rolls after the fact to fuck over the pug.

Thanks man. I just thought it was funny and wanted to share :D

As a tank, I value good Rogues that know to pool their energy for clutch Kidneys, Kicks, and Blinds. Especially value them when they level their lockpicking.

Nice argument well spoken mate. Triggered Trumpers at it again.

You don't have to do all quests in a zone at once - you're supposed to jump between zones when you level.

That's the tanks job not yours.

You're the healer equivalent of DPS that don't turn off aggro abilities. Sure, they do more damage. But they cause more problems for everyone.

None of the above.  Classic with sprinkles... keep it classic, but add QoL stuff like cheevos, collection books, guild banks and barbershop!

Also make sure you guys go to files and download the wow classic version.
---
If it didn't feel terrible to play the classes on retail, I'd probably be there.
---
Something that I don't think a lot of /r/classicwow realizes is that classic is currently the catchall of those who like wow but don't currently like retail... and that description covers a lot of people that aren't necessarily in the "classic is best #nochanges" etc camp.
---
I've hated for years that I can't pick 2h enhance, or 2h frost anymore... but I was still playing retail up and during BFA... but the way the classes feel to play in BFA is so terrible I gave up.
---
A lot of the complaints about retail are valid, but can be ignored...  but if the core gameplay of how your character works is terrible, nothing else really matters.
---
I'm referring to them running around and pulling more mobs than the group can handle, or the group (esp. the healer) just isn't ready because of mana or whatever. I'm not talking about waiting around for no reason.
---
Probably, but who's gonna be first? It will be a much more even playing field since everyone is already 60.

It's just like gladius tracking Cooldowns and marking healers, etc. Besides once you know the deadzone exists it's not very hard to intuit where it is on a hunter
---
I would consider myself a fairly involved gamer, easily pumping 40 hours a week into games. I have a very client focused career that requires a great deal of engagement and social skills. That being said, I dont like people very much. I fake it at work because that's what fuels my salary and bonuses, but fuck people dude. People are a drag.
---
So yes.
---
I use alt+(1-5) for marks. Can't reach up into f-keys easily and it sounds like an alt+f4 waiting to happen.
---
For the Horde!
---
Well, according to wowhead, it should drop from BOTH.  which still something new for me, i thought it can only drop from last boss.
---
Well then i guess we kill General then Lava run from now on :D
---
That's what makes it so hilarious! They violate their own terms
---
Gonna go against the grain but they should just have phased servers 
---
Start a server group off with classic after a year and a half it upgrades to BC and then a new server group for classic spins up and starts the whole process over 
---
Keep this process going till the servers reach retail them have a reset or free migrations to retail
---
Im 41 and i dont spend 5 hours a day. I even took an entire weekend off. I think really it comes down to knowing where to quest and when to maximize your time. Example - Staying in Barrens until 21. A lot of people hit 18-20 and head to another zone. You can however milk the barrens for 2-3 more levels. This makes it to where when you do change zones you are eligible for more quests there and helps to add up to nice exp gains for the same amount of time/effort. 
---
But yes, it is not easy to level in classic. Every xpac after classic made it easier and easier.
---
That's actually amazing! I love the subtlety to them.
---
Missed the part where the person you're taunting off gives you shit for not taunting off them, as if them pulling aggro wasn't their fault to begin with

Yeah I don't blame Grom for that, I blame him for being one of the main reasons so many Orcs drank Mannaroth's blood.

---
Most of Blizzard's lore is outside of the game, though you can find in-game books, dialogues, doodads, etc... to tell the story.
---
Much of WoW is set up by WarCraft 3, which was set up by the previous two games and expanded upon in their respective novels.
---
when D2 bombed because Activision got greedy
---
I just kept questing and I got it pretty fast
---
I had something similar happen to me in Desolace last night. I was doing the quests in the cultist area, and as I’m escorting the npc out, I turn a corner and charged an Orc Warlock, who at first glance looked like one of the cultists that I thought had respawned. I backed up and /sorryed once I realized he wasn’t a mob, and he /thanked me and let me go on with the escort quest.
---
Short answer, Classic + all the way. 
---
Long answer, all 3 options have their flaws and we need to decide as a community which one has the least. 
---
The first option offers a continual classic experience which we are getting right now but also will continually get in the future. I can see it being fun seeing what guilds are able to progress the fastest but in the end a big draw of classic is getting attached to your toon and the items and stories that come with that, if you only build something to get torn down it could be very demoralizing for a majority of players, imo.
---
The 2nd option we will expand on later.
---
The 3rd option is a tried and true method that many people will enjoy because not everyone enjoys the same version of the game, this makes the problem of having too many servers with not enough players. Yes there will be dedicated guilds and players for each version but they will compete and play amongst themselves and would make it hard to decide where to stop with these servers, what if someone likes Cata or MOP or any of the other expansions more? Shouldn’t they be able to have a server for that too? You can see the problem and is a big reason I’d push against this.
---
Now for the 2nd option, Classic +. Like many people have stated with OSRS taking this route I believe would be a great idea, with OSRS they not only expanded on the mechanics and feel of the original game but fleshed out parts of the game previously ignored, i.e end game content and mid-high level content, WoW could similarly do this with adding more content in the bare levels, some more dungeons for low to mid levels/expansions to dungeons already in the game. They could also add end game content with raids and rated arenas/bgs. The biggest thing I believe they need to avoid if they do this is catch up mechanics, as long as they don’t devalue previous content then players will have an even bigger mountain to climb than what we’re scheduled to get and can easily last a long time. Only problem with this is lore and well if you’re going to bend the lore or create an alternate lore for this then I have no problem if I can continue to advance and play this game.
---
&gt;That only seems appealing now when you're leveling through a densely populated world.
---
Sorry but no.  It seems appealing because its appealing to me. Full stop.  And is to lots of people that I talk to who have played the game for 15 years continuously. And the industry which produced it in the first place, in that design. So do many of the comments here on reddit. 
---
Literally all the points you made are total bogus. We did just fine before LFG, we did not have megaservers, and people who joined late enjoyed the game just fine. 
---
You're just saying what you personally enjoy, which is not the same as the facts of what everyone enjoys. Its fine if you enjoy those things but I think you'll find Classic is not about that design.
---
This is stupid and so are you
---
Exactly.
---
engaged
---
Good joke ya bish. There isn't anyway to track that so nobody is going to believe you. You also just sound like a twat btw
---
Is this ever fixed in a patch? Or is that just how it was in Vanilla
---
Caring that much about politics is a mental illness. It's just two groups of ridiculously rich people tricking mindless sheep into becoming fanatics so they can stay in power. That's why half of every presidency is reversing the last person's policies and the other half is enacting stuff that's about to get reversed so that it's always just a zero sum. Getting in so deep that you get triggered by a joke is an even worse mental illness that only can exist when you have literally nothing of greater value in your life than what some political party tells you what to believe.
---
I remember in wotlk having a gear score that was just a few points below the desired level and being denied entry into a group. The only real way to increase my gear score was to get a single gear upgrade from the very raid I was trying to do. Meanwhile there were people that were let in because their gear score was high enough, but it was useless pvp gear which actually meant they weren't as well geared as I was. Basing a player on some arbitrary number is a joke, but it was the only thing anyone cared about. And since there was no cross server, I was stuck trying to get in a group with the same handful of people basically running the raids on a heavily alliance dominated server. It was brutal.
---
They good, but will only top meters fights where they can abuse bladeflurry or fights with where aggro is an issue. So you can expect to be generally mid pack except for 2-3 fights a tier.
---
We could have Classic and all the Expansions contents and many more on the current classic system, available on every realm:
---
* don't change classic, add parallel content, don't add incremental content
---
* do not use a form of layers or phasing where we as players/characters have no control of
---
* make each expansion a true independent progression section starting at 0 for everything in that new part!
---
* add complexity and diversity of choice, but carefully do not power creep anyway whatsoever! A character with endgame gear for each expansion should be equally good equipped as a character with any other expansions endgame gear. add diversity and complexity, not power.
---
* do not simplify the game mechanics, enhance them with diversity and complexity. retail had many good ideas that enhanced quests and storytelling in a very positive way. it all came with unnecessary simplifications and quality of life changes that broke immersion/social interaction. do not add these.
---
* enable twinks and new players to choose which expansion they start on (to play the content with their friends). they will always be able to go back or onto another expansion, to catch up with or restart on the other content (starting from 0 for that particular expansion).
---
* my character and class/role I want to play will be determined by the diversity of items available throughout all extensions.
---
* keep adding expansions in the same independent fashion for centuries
---
* make actual expansion-sized phasing a thing, where the world changes depending on the expansion you are doing.
---
* realize that our character is NOT the single most important protagonist and hero of the story. We are one of many and can only achieve big things in a group, as peons of a lore character. The story is a linear experience, not an adventure of roleplay choices.
---
If you catch my drift, you maybe get the idea of multiple parallel versions for each extension, that add choices and different endings. Let's make our own story and actually be the champion or an antagonist. That could be an in-game necessity to experience different story arcs in other expansions, giving you reasons to make a twink and do it all again differently. But that's a whole another layer of the basic idea of DONT CHANGE, ENHANCE.
---
BRD is considered one of the best dungeons in WoW almost universally. 
---
My favorite personally is UBRS cause I played warrior in classic and know that dungeon best.
---
Thats funny because whenever I see an Undead Warlock while levelling they give me Curse of Agony, Corruption and Immolate.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND
---
That is a good question! It is listed in the terms of use on their website. I was surprised when I read that and did a triple take.
---
Hey, thanks for the advice.  will do.    
---
at present, because I am unsure what I am doing, I wasn't sure where to improve, or to throw out a suggestion if things go awry.  
---
also I am unaccustomed to being the instigator and almost the control of the fight.
---
No dungeon finder and no getting rid of talent trees, please.
---
Does anyone know what the addon is where you can see what your target is targeting under their portrait? Thanks
---
Yeah but Icy Veins also put Warlocks as a top tier dps. So what do they really know.
---
They dont have to make items better they just need to make them different.
---
Reading comprehension.
---
As much as I love Classic as is, and as much as I wish it could stay exactly as it is forever, I know realistically it can't. If they never add anything new and just offer fresh servers or resets every few years, the game will slowly die. Yeah, there are people who will play it until they turn the servers off, but the game will certainly dwindle.
---
Of the two options for progressing and adding new content to Classic, I'd much prefer the Classic+ approach rather than the "Retail, but 15 years behind" route. There's TONS of content that was originally planned for Vanilla that never made it into the game. So much content could be added to Classic without completely changing the core of the game like the expansions did. It would make the game distinctly its own version of WoW and separate it from retail even further. It also allows them to (hopefully) avoid a lot of the things people don't like about retail.
---
Realistically though, assuming the demand and the money are there, there's no reason they couldn't do both. Open Classic TBC and Classic WotLK servers for people who want that while still adding content to Classic+. People have shown they're interested and Blizz is making a TON of money right now off Classic, it's definitely an option that would let people play whatever version of WoW they prefer while still handing over their $$ to Actiblizz.
---
Off with yeh!
---
Nope. I did too. Priest only
---
It's the vanilla way.
---
Casters should still try to persuade everyone into passing... and swiftly put it on the AH. Because it's the vanilla way.
---
I want BC, so I'd be more than happy to have a BC server and stop there. Only problem with that is they will end up having to do other expansion servers and the player base will get spread thin.
---
My ideal Classic route would be a combination of Classic+ and Expansions.  
---
They don't have to add new content that creates plot holes or an alternate timeline, they could just finish stuff that was nearly done like Silithus, Hyjal, Azshara, Deadwind Pass and Kharazan Crypts, maybe even stuff like that inaccessible zone above Western Plaguelands (Quel'Thalas?) or Uldum, etc. 
---
As for expansions, up to WotLK is the gold standard for me, as it's the first version of WoW i ever played, but i didn't progress that much and never really got to end game content.  
---
No flying mounts nor Dungeon Finder are a must, although i could see some sort of fatigue system being introduced for flying mounts instead of removing them completely, even if that's what most people want. Absolutely no LFG tho. 
---
And this is just my opinion, but i always disliked how expansions made previous raids useless. Why would you want to go through all the troubles of getting a huge group for a vanilla raid when you can get better loot through normal progression on Outland? Or why even bother doing the TBC raids when quests on Northrend give better gear? 
---
IMO a good solution that doesn't involve heavily modifying item level progression would be locking the next expansion's content behind quests that require you to complete the past expansion's raids. For example, to go to Outland you would need to complete a quest or quest chain that requires you to complete all the vanilla raids; to go to Northrend you would need to complete all the TBC raids. It doesn't have to be all of them either, maybe instead you would only need to complete the past expansion's major raids (AQ and Naxx to go to Outlands, Black Temple and Sunwell to go to Northrend, etc.). Or just leave it to the player to decide which raids they want to complete, something like "Complete at least 2/3 raids to progress further", and the player  could choose any given 2/3 vanilla raids to progress into Outland and any given 2/3 TBC raids to go to Northrend, and so on.  
---
It just seemed weird to me how you as a player could just ignore these huge raids that are supposedly some of the biggest threats to the world and just go on to Outland or Northrend, leaving Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms behind.  
---
And while i get that having the choice of deciding whether to complete them or not is something a lot of people appreaciate, my main reasoning for this suggestion is that once the next expasion comes (TBC, WotLK), the past expansion's raids become obsolete and it's impossible to get together a huge raid group to help you complete these raids just because you want to experience them, i mean, what's the point really if you don't HAVE to do them and can just get better loot easier and faster by going to the next leveling zone?
---
I have seen it drop twice from General and never from Emp. And looking at this link, it was added to Emps loot table on 1.10, so it wouldn't be until a later phase.

 You can melee cleave with a warrior.

I cant classic+ on the unreal engine.
---
I dont want my Character reset id rather fresh servers to those that want that
---
TFW you link to a page that proves yourself wrong
---
You don't think the rest of the dungeon group would care that I'm gimping their xp?
---
I use mind control cap from engineering to mind control an ally from the raid and they all just killed their own raid member.
---
It really sucks to tank for chaotic groups that won't let you get aggro. I didn't say you were always causing wipes.
---
Just a note, regardless of having to wait a couple minutes or 2 clearing 5 instances an hour is still better xp then only clearing 4 an hour, it's an entire extra instance an hour even if you have to wait a couple mins to clear again
---
Very much so
---
To shreds you say
---
The problem with that way of thinking is that if you're too low leveled and geared to tank, you're almost certainly too low leveled and geared to do good dps as a warrior
---
Well I meant you and him only, and just solo carry him

This is world first unless proven otherwise. Grats!

I think adding flying to the game was one of the worst decisions they've made for WoW.
---
No, you’re the one sounding like a twat here.
---
Gear score NEVER EVER EVER needs to be put into classic.
---
Wanna ruin the whole community classic is boasting about right now over night? Add gear score.
---
I had an idea about how to recycle/reintroduce Outland into Classic+.
---
Since WoW Classic is already sort of brought on by Chromie in a meta/tongue-in-cheek sense, our Outland experience could be a sort of "Caverns of Time" adventure.
---
Let people explore some modified version of Outland on a limited basis to perform specific tasks, quests or boss kills, but only for a few hours at a time. Maybe you're only allowed 4 hours in Outland each week, for instance. Flying mounts would exist only here, similar to the underwater mounts in Vashj'ir.
---
This idea is inspired by how FFXI does certain huge, open-world raids in instanced parallel dimensions.
---
I think it depends entirely on the server. Some servers are focused entirely on speed runs, with a group stacking mages or warriors instead of all DPS classes. It's a shame, but I think it will die down after try-hards cap. On Kromcrush (Horde), the spell cleave and melee cleave frenzies seem to have passed us over.
---
Stonetalon iirc
---
Rofl.  This one I love because they probably thought it was bugged and had no idea
---
Classic unchanged,  but I would like to see achievements in retail, like reach lvl 60 in classic.
---
Light be with you, friend.
---
‘Twas a joke, lad.
---
Are you sure
---
Questing is top tier choice even when farming for epic mount
---
Both
---
With a restriction that it be 75% of accounts that are level 40+ on classic I agree.
---
They were all at medium when I logged out last night.
---
classic+, while i loved a lot of TBC, and wrath, it destroyed so many things.
---
I want Classic+ 
---
1) Polished Client
---
2) New Level 60 content in breadth
---
3) Events like opening of AQ
---
4) New themed/gimmick battlegrounds
---
5) More class-themed questlines for all levels
---
6) Dustwallow to be fleshed out with mudsprocket.
---
7) Dual spec
---
I'd also love to see some sort of "reset-esque" new content, where it doesn't hard reset the server, but maybe certain items wear out and are lost and have to be regained?
---
Yeah a tool that helps you build a dungeon group organically rather than just toss you in with some randoms is my ideal solution as well. Taking the social aspect out of grouping really harmed the community.
---
The answer is always yes. Will you be a part of server 1sts with that play time? Absolutely not. Will you have fun? I am willing to bet you will.
---
I'd love the option to copy my char over to BC without the entire server being converted to BC. That's what I hated about some of the expansions. After WOTLK, the game I loved stopped existing.
---
ahahahahah
---
I would not want them to reset the servers and wipe all characters periodically.  That sounds like a great way to kill the game if everyone's progress gets periodically wiped out.
---
I would also not want the BC and WoLK expansions forced onto my server.  If it were optional, or they allowed people to transfer to a server that will remain Vanilla, then that's OK.
---
So, that leaves the Classic+ idea.  I could warm up to this if they did it very carefully.  If they integrated any new content into the existing game world and didn't completely invalidate all the existing content.  For example, if they added another 40-man raid after Nax, it would be tier4 and you would still need to work your way through the previous raids.  Same with additional 5-man content.  As long as it had appropriate difficulty and rewards I think that would be fine.  It might finally be nice to see a dungeon in Uldum or make Hyjal a playable zone...
---
Lol I didn't even vote. Nice try though.
---
I want all of these TBH.
---
lol, do they still make those? Looks like its processed now. I wasnt expecting that long a wait, but I guess I should have known by how popular Classic is now.
---
We don't like your kind in these parts
---
That's really not how vanilla works. This isn't retail where they roll the dice and make 1 spec good and the other two 10% worse each patch. There's no stage where sub tree does good pve dps in vanilla.
---
Even if wow was making wrath level numbers, it’s still a much smaller part of atvi’s income than back in wrath. Back in wrath it was probably 25-50 percent of their income. 
---
Blizzard as a whole is making more money than back in wrath. If they had wrath numbers, it’d be way less of a big deal because they have so many revenue streams . They had absolutely no new products for like six years when wow was growing .
---
Yeah, why would people not voluntarily install malware?

take a break for a day or two is always an option, or play an alt while you wait

What does this prove to you exactly? Anyone with half a brain knows layering destroys the economy.
---
What if it goes Classic to Classic+ to BC to BC+
---
Just use classiccodex, it shows you node spawns on the map for anything.
---
I dont think you should even learn rend from the trainer. The damage is tiny. The only time its helpful is to keep rogues from stealthinf
---
I'd be happy if I found any of these whelps. They've been my go-to babies for years.
---
So I don’t know if you played Warcraft 3, but that isn’t well established at all
---
BC+ over Classic+. The class balance is just better/more complete. You can make flying an Outland only thing and keep making content in Azeroth (BC does this anyway with multiple raids being on Azeroth and not in Outland.)
---
I think the final death was the PUG raiding tool. Raids should still be primarily guild-run, with some randoms.
---
Yes! I didn’t do the cookie cutter priest route, so the picture for pve holy priest doesn’t apply to me.
---
That shit was cancer, the true start of the death if wow.
---
Thanks for the reply man do you know which one is the most popular?
---
You mean I won't have to get into a dungeon group, have someone pull half the dungeon, wipe us, type put "jajajajajaj" and just leave group? Shit, whatever shall I do
---
I'm not in agreement that we need to change the game for anything. But what we really need is to create/join groups with the same expectations. When we can't and people end up in "wrong" groups, that's where the unhappiness comes from.
---
Berserker rage does none of this.
---
no offense but classic wow is more like retail classic. everything is nerfed with patch 1.12 and it’s showing hard. 
---
blizzard should honestly release new fresh servers pre nerf (i’m talking about dungeons, raids, and items) 
---
this current edition of vanilla is awful imo
---
I came to wow classic from OSRS and I think classic+ is the way to go. Yes, we all have fond memories of BC and WotLK but they still led us to retail. If we want to avoid making the same mistakes as before, classic + is imo the best way to go, especially if blizzard implements a polling system.
---
we dont need faith, just implement a voting system, just copy OSRS, it worked, cant see why it cant work here. Let the players decide
---
It’s almost like part of running a creative enterprise is parsing what’s good for your product vs. what your product users request....
---
Something something faster horses
---
Yeah, moreover tanking pre level 51 with arms talents is better than prot talents. And for most levels using a 2h weapon is more effective than sword and board.
---
&gt; Literally all the points you made are total bogus. We did just fine before LFG, we did not have megaservers, and people who joined late enjoyed the game just fine. 
---
Even back in BC, they made the XP requirements lower for 1-60 and made the questing content easier.
---
This mythical MMO that expands the world continuously without any catchup mechanics doesn't exist, and has never existed.
---
Nope, this is suboptimal.
---
Kills me when I am AOE farming and have the jackass who pulls extra enemies into my blizz just to get me killed. I’ve had times where I literally left mobs behind so others could have their quests and people still hate on me.
---
It’s a lot of money. Its just that blizzards business expenses are a lot higher then they used to be 10 years ago. And in the modern video game industry, the hight of these expenses is largely based on the revenue generated by micro(or macro) transactions. 1 million monthly transactions of $15 is a lot less money then 50k transactions of 20-60$ every day (DISCLAIMER: numbers are ment methaphorically) 
---
I also read a blue post once about blizzard largely depending on these extra transactions.
---
Ok now mail them all to me please. 
---
I need to.... inspect these to make sure they are in fact the real deal.
---
You can send mail cross server yea?
---
Have Chromie show up and take us to BFA.
---
If I understand the spell cleave style correctly, its pulling heaps of mobs for mage aoe spam?  
---
I might have been in something like that last night.  the first time I did RFC it was really good, strategic, only a couple of mobs pulled at a time, even just one at atime if able.  
---
the second group, I was requested to pull more.. first it was 2 then 3 then by the end it was 7.
---
I’d tip for ports, those cost reagents for mages.
---
I don’t see it as avoidance really. The contentious parts of the game (killing mobs for motes, doing dailies, dungeons etc) were still filled with lots of PVP. 
---
Plus arena gave a way to pvp on demand and it was fun and engaging.
---
Classic +
---
obviously wow classic is the best  starting point
---
^^^^:(
---
Yeah, in fact that is how this all started. I've been growing a collection of specs submitted by people in the community.
---
Honestly couldn’t say. I use all of them in various ways on different toons. Try them out and see what works for you
---
Hey, congratz on your mount!
---
Quick question: I am now two bars away from level 40 and I completed all the Darnassus quests in Teldrassil, Darkshore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon and Desolace but I'm only about 3/4 through honored :( Was it the same for you or did I do something wrong?
---
I've had the opposite problem with mage. For example when I invited two warriors while killing pirates in Tanaris they both declined. When I pulled 10 or so mobs and started blizzarding them both came to ask for inv. Of course I declined cause I'm a petty person. Just take the damn invite, you'll get your pirate hats faster with two or three people anyway.
---
True story man. I slam em with any buffs I got between my 3 chars. That shit is a hard knock life.
---
I tried Retail while waiting for Classic and it felt so familiar and foreign at the same time. I didn’t even do a dungeon 1-60 because of what I read here and I didn’t really feel like I needed to. Rares and sometimes Epics from quests just made the dungeons seem like unneeded frustration.
---
I use rend on the pack of mobs I'm tanking if I have excess rage.
---
Also, if you are sheeping mobs that the tank is actively tanking, that sounds like a waste of time and mana because it's just going to get broken.
---
Telling you the economy is going to be nothing like people expect because the highest value items are being farmed at tremendous amounts is contribution.
---
If you’re too simple minded to understand, sounds like a personal problem.
---
Everyone doing it is obeying the rules Blizzard put in place. Where does it say what we’re doing is against the rules? Are we not allowed to move to another layer to farm again? They put a delay timer in, and we’re all obeying that timer. So, again, where is it stated this isn’t allowed?
---
Show me where it is breaking the rules and worth a ban.
---
It's been 15 years, it's fine
---
Level with Imp always make sure you get the aggro not the Imp
---
Well, to be fair, it's cheaper than HS (your only other direct-damage ability for a while) and is off the GCD. So it's got that going for it, if not much else.
---
You could also be a gay fish 🤔
---
There’s an eazy solution make elites more like pservers let them require cc and a tank. But this will never happen.
---
Pull a JK Rowling on the lore.
---
Whats the addon? I get confused between frame add ons and nameplates.
---
This must be a nameplate one, right? What are your guys favorite nameplate add ons, and which do you recommend for healers?
---
Damn i forgot about twin Peaks, i played so Much pvp back then, 
---
Warlock and hunter were super cool to Play
---
idk Hoes look mad
---
Daddy didn’t hug you enough?
---
&gt; I personally liked 10-man raids
---
Multi difficulty raids are a 100% no go for me.  My ideal version of WotLK would be that Naxx and ToC are 10 man only and Ulduar, Sarth, Maly and LK are 25 man only, so that like TBC you have content for both groups.
---
TBC had very close to the ideal raiding model, it never should have been changed.  I say close because making a 10 man required to attune to 25 man raids was stupid, and was a chore for a lot of guilds to break a 25 man roster into 10 man groups.
---
To be fair there's a constant barrage of screw retail morons on classic servers and these classic idiots are just fooling themselves on retail servers. Some people love to hate and when they have nothing to rightfully hate they randomly pick whatever is in their sights. A guy pulling 70k-100k viewers makes for a very large, very easy target.
---
Don't do this. All you're doing is rage starving the tank. We already have rage problems with over enthusiastic DPS. Let the tank do the pulls.
---
Also, the tank may be new and trying to get a handle on things. Or the dungeon is new to them.
---
WoW Classic Season 2 incoming
---
As soon as I got to 33 trying to find groups for instances became a pain. Most people on my server want to cleave SM and dont have the patience for running it with newer players. I experienced basically what you have. People helping each other and being more friendly in the 1 through 30 bracket. 
---
I group with people now and people barely respond in chat.
---
Yeah, the problem was the summoning stones.  Watered down a class mechanic and killed a cause of pvp.
---
It is fun to have to wade through hordes of player enemies to arrive at a fortress your storming.
---
Okay.
---
I dig it
---
I’m playing on a Dell my grandma was getting rid of, no joke. Classic runs better on it than the browser.
---
I, as a completely new player who has never played WoW before, really want to experience Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King. I’ve been a fan of the lore for a while, and it’s always been an awkward spot between being a part of the community and not, and classic has been such a great time for me to get into WoW without being bogged down. For myself and other like me, I think BC and WotLK should be Re-released.
---
create a macro and put in your bar

Come back to HOTS.  Town hall heroes was the best.
---
We have the best community, minus that whole ally vs horde thing and all.
---
Hey bro do you know a way to disable an addon on one character and not the other
---
Players on lower pop servers desperately needed it...and for a long time, Blizz refused to merge very low pop servers together and continued to open up new servers. 
---
Players just wanted an easier way to form groups. I never recall the mentioning of having it instantly teleport you into the dungeon, making said dungeon easier, turning dungeons into a race to the end loot hallway.
---
I'm 44 and I have yet to be ganked by just 1 alliance. Every time it's been at least 2, most of the time they have been 7+ levels over the zone itself
---
Combuctor has a UI themed skin and tabs for different item types and you can customize it, so if that's the only reason you like half of your screen enveloped in different bags then maybe you should give that one a shot.
---
It took me 30 minutes of corpse running to the alter and several gold in repairs to get mine haha.
---
50g can be earned while doing other things though. farming whelps doesn't get you much else
---
Just get further out in front and pull faster for those groups. They will break before you do.
---
Omg how dare you think of doing something legal before the simpleminded folks think about it! BAN! BAN!
---
&gt;I'd like to see warriors saying they deserve caster boes just as much as a mage keeping that resolve when edgemasters drops. 
---
I mean, they better keep that resolve.
---
&gt;You want to take away someone's upgrade because you think you deserve gold more than they deserve an upgrade. That is greedy behavior.
---
The drop is worth the same amount of gold to everyone in the group. It's not "my upgrade versus your 500g", it's "my 500g versus your 500g". The BoE and BoP systems are there by design. There's no reason to fudge the distinction between the two.
---
Fuuuuuck no wonder lol I would do like 40 dmg and then miss or parry every other attack. Oh well, got to lvl 30 like this haha
---
I use this :

---
Runecloth was going between 1g and 2g on Sulfuron, french server. I tried to instantly buy and stock all Runecloth stacks between 90s and 1g20s for a time.
---
Yes, the price of stacks are gonna hit an all-time low when most people reach level 60 and farm dungeons all day.
---
I  still worry not about the rarity of my situation, as you still need to have dedicated your levelling around troll quests beforehand, to not have wasted thousands of Darkspear points and thus, runecloth turn-ins gold.
---
Defiantly classic+ which would eventually transition into the following expansions. Ideally, the expansions would be altered to better align with what the fanbase wants...limited or no flying mounts in BC for example.
---
LOL you private server scrubs need to stop doing drugs. The first two are off the table completely. You have to be dumb to even think the majority of players and blizzard will get behind those ideas. The last one might happen but I don't see this expanding past vanilla. If it does I would want to skip bc and cata. Just go straight into wrath and mop. What I would really love is to give classic the updated graphics and animations along with the improvements to combat. 
---
All of that aside though if you think classic is going to get unique content you are daydreaming. There are still more active players on retail. QQ down below but more people prefer retail and who cares. Why do you even care enough to argue about it? Blizz is going to focus on expanding retail. We got classic and it's great but we aren't getting unique content. We're getting 15 year old content for a second time and that's it.
---
I am trying to do the server migration from Fairbanks to Benediction, but it is only letting me select Arcanite reaper which is low pop. My friends are on Benediction. Am I screwed?
---
Nokay?
---
Every single player in WoW above level 40 becomes an unbearable monster the second they hit 40, obviously.
---
In seriousness, you are probably just remembering the negative experiences you had more than the positive, as humans are prone to do.
---
Run around not grouped and finish off mobs they tag initially. Then, when they are killing mobs that give you xp, group up.
---
Because the way you act is so much better than that guild name.  How virtuous of you!
---
Hunter item if I ever saw one it’s right in the tooltip
---
That's exactly it lol, today there has only been a single layer on my realm which is classified as high/full. The rate at which they're dropping layers is indicative of the high rate of player drop-off but naturally this sub gets to the opposite conclusion.
---
No flying, I agree.
---
Beautiful solution I always thought that relics/ankhs just did not add enough to the classes and its such a great area to expand on class design
---
STVietnam patrol goes awry.
---
If you drop 50g on a whelpling before your lvl 40 mount, you'll be farming gold specifically. Just the gold you get while doing other things won't be enough.
---
can we pool our money and get a guy on fiver to read this like a dwarven warrior
---
That's a huge tip for your level.
---
I was aoe farming while doing a quest, someone came for the quest so I invite him, he declined then started /split on me while cursing me out for aoe farming quest mobs, I was like ???
---
I assume he meant will you restart to pvp deaths?  Because it's going to happen.
---
Now a dutch server. I played with many languages over the years and while the scandinavians seem to tend to themself, the dutch spam channels everywhere. And 90% of the time its about weed or drugs lol. In time all servers will be G E K O L O N I S E E R D.
---
Alliance on my server just send their 60s to gank and spam lol noon rekt you mad at us lol that's pvp rp I guess
---
I'm not serious, I have some alts on one.
---
Honestly I wouldn't want a tip from a level 11 speaking as someone who has been leveling tailoring. Cloth is cheap, thread is cheap, and I'd get levels. Maybe 1s but no more
---
From the character selection screen hit the “add ons” button in the bottom left corner. From the add ons menu that pops up there is a drop down menu on the top left that you can select add ons for all toons or individual toons, just remember to save the profile and you’re good to go.
---
I would like classic to advance the same way retail did. But no lfg, no crz, no lfr. Those are what kill the sever community and the game for me.
---
They don't have 12 yards in classic either.
---
Leveling:
---
I'd like quests to be added for both alliance and horde.  There are a few gaps, especially between 40-45 and then again in the 50's.  
---
New content to be added.  Having challenging raids even without the gear being better then say AQ40/Naxx.  I personally have never cared to much about ilvl or needing better gear then the previous tier.   I think there is a healthy way to keep all content relevant without also making it absurd for new-comers to catch up later on.   
---
Basically, I just want a smoother leveling experience, and new raids without making current content obsolete.  
---
For the leveling, I'm a dad with school + work.  I get maybe 1-5 hours a week to play.  I'm only level 15, but I know once I get into the 30's, 40's and 50's.  It might take me 1-2 weeks per level due to my limited time.  I can't spam dungeons like a lot of my buddies do.
---
Seeing as nobody else is saying it, I just want to comment that your name is A+ and gave me a chuckle.
---
Acutally, Naxx did.  Light Hope's Chapel.
---
Yea if only there was some sort of word for when people were doing something for profit.
---
Maybe we could come up with a loot system where people selected when they wanted something for gold and when they wanted to equip something and the equipping gained precedence.
---
Didn't die for a long time between 42-44. Then I try my luck with the Assasins in tanaris, learned the hard way they have an execute that deals 400-500 non-crit.
---
When you start realizing what dungeon finder took away then you see why it was bad. One of the big things is setting up traveling to the dungeon you are investing time to just get there. So if a group wipes you don’t get the instant leave because they know they can just re queue. 
---
So while dungeon finder fixed some problems it created new ones that were never addressed.
---
Not correct. It was only in IF and Org at the beginning which is why everyone hanged out in these cities.
---
Old School Runescape has a tried and true, tested and proven popular method of resurrecting old stuff. Allow certain members of the community (maybe those with more than X months of subscription) to vote on the way the game goes.
---
It is.
---
This is not accurate. Have personally had skins ninjad from me. And if they beat you to start skinning it'll say "Target is tapped"
---
&gt;”NPC lookalike races”
---
Horde NPCs are also Horde races.
---
Conversations don't work as well when you just copy your previous comment. Maybe expand on what makes druids awful in almost every in light of my experience that I just shared.
---
How much of an edge will dwarf priests have over my own capabilities?
---
What's wrong with the UI?
---
not if the new content only rewards sideways progression and doesnt power creep
---
That would be useful! I'll have to check if there is an API call or something for the threat though.
---
Classic+ for sure.
---
You're not missing out! You sre still part of the community and enjoy the world! Sure it's not as often as you'd like but you are at least able enjoy it :) 
---
(Plus you aren't wasting a lot of time on it like I am)
---
It's usually a last-ditch effort because the tank is in over his head. Of course, it's also usually a lost cause because a tank who does massive pulls isn't paying attention to whether a mob is sheeped.
---
When you open ElvUI settings, there is whole section on the left just for tooltips, click there and edit away.
---
I agree that ElvUI with all of its options can be overwhelming/frustrating but take your time. You can do what i did, i have been using it for 5+ years and i started off with preset option i found on forums and have been tweaking it a little every few months.
---
P.S. If you are using realmobhp addon along with ElvUI tooltips can get a bit glitchy due to font size i think, go to ElvUI settings&gt;tooltips&gt;somewhere (don't recall exact tab) and change font size from 4 (default value i think) to 10 or something.

Flying mounts
---
Can you imagine if they didn’t have layering.  I might still be there trying to tag that damn princess pig.

25-30ish assuming you dont want to grind or do a lot of dungeons

I read that as “dwarvinism” at first and thought it was hilarious. Fucking Dwarves (they’re my favourite but I’m playing horde this time round).
---
When you taunt but she keeps pullin
---
Agreed. Everyone needs gold.
---
They added a dungeon finder to keep up with industry competitors like Rift and Guild Wars 2 and a perceived need to speed up gameplay to keep people playing.
---
Fear ward
---
Hunters have a bad rap due to the "hunter weapon" stereotype etc and the higher your level this early on the more likely it is that you're with the hardcore crowd.
---
Not sure what level you are, but those uninterested in magecleaving to 60 should steadily begin reaching your level range, should be fine then.
---
What's up with all these, "Listen here Reddit, I'm going to teach you really obvious things about the game." posts. Everyday there's a new 'list of things you should know about this 15 year old game' post.
---
It isn’t an entirely bad idea.  I made a paladin when TBC dropped and never looked back.  I did Gnomerb and Deadmines and basically every instance because there were enough new characters; a lot of blood elves, and I think I almost always had a Pali healer, but it worked out really well to help populate the leveling.
---
I think there is a fear that we’re all enjoying this wave to 60 together right now, and that the leveling community will dry up.
---
Add a few new races, maybe expand the classes allowed just a little (gnomes need a healing class!), and you’ll see people on the march for new characters.
---
Honestly anything really. Druids are so versatile that any class can duo level. Just play what you want.
---
If you’re 100% duo level it’s always good to consider a class that’s painful to solo level (warrior or priest) if you desire to have one.
---
They should poll class changes such as giving paladins taunt, if it passes the poll, implement it as part of a class quest etc
---
Grats on your epic kitty! Any advice for a 51 Warrior with Herb/Skinning? I’m finding that most herbs and leathers are selling really low on my server :(

---
There was a ICC tank trinket that was absolutely awful (worse than several greens for threat/ mitigation iirc) and people would use it to trick the GS users. Gear score was only useful as a broad measure, ie. You didnt want the guy in leveling greens coming to your TOC/ICC raid
---
I don't remember it ever not stopping people. Since at least BC you've had to release and re-press movement keys to start moving again. Was it different in classic?
---
Am I the only one who wants, and thinks it is most illogical, classic to just be classic? So it stops at level 60 and we never get burning Crusade, because burning Crusade is not classic wow. I love it just like we all do but it is the official end of classic wow. If they do expansions then this is no longer classic wow it is just wow all over again. And even if they do that, how is it determined which expansion to stop at? Is it just that you unanimous that we all want burning Crusade and wrath and nothing more? Even if that were the plan, I always hated that once burning Crusade dropped all my accomplishments at level 60 no longer mattered, so I would always prefer they give us the option to stay at level 60, even if I have to transfer Realms or something, the day they introduced expansions (if they do).
---
Morrowgrain sells pretty well on the ah though
---
Do LFM, not LFG. Join guild. Get friends.
---
[classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) it's a lifesaver, it's pretty much a guide to get you leveled at a fast pace. I read it like the bible.
---
Some people play MMOs not because they enjoy playing with others, but instead because they can't make friends.
---
I want Classic Burning Crusade, or Classic with BC quality of life improvements and class balance.
---
Gearscore and spec are both largely irrelevant in classic except for raids.  Should just list roles.
---
Omg you need to chill. Earthfurry had like 300 horde on peak hours last week on Thursday. Now its almost 1.5k and keeps growing. Just give it time ffs.
---
useless after 44. Tanking spell cleave with fury (after nerf go fury not prot) is still faster
---
Well theres that one but there was one even before that that was around in BC.
---
I used to be the biggest altoholic until I started playing Path of Exile. Now for some reason I can only stick to one.
---
Have fun! Do what you want! I never rolled dwarf or gnome as I didn't like the way the gear looked on them. If you're wanting to be the best PvP Priest...you may be at a disadvantage. Otherwise...go heal and be merry!
---
I'd choose the third option. I want AV40 pvp and AQ20 raid.
---
No, old friend. You’ve freed us all
---
If that's butthurt then what is this post?
---
Not sure if this helps but I was wondering the same thing as well when I hit 50 and didn't see this, but I found out that there's another quest that leads to the same follow-up quests to get you some insane items. So instead of doing An Imp's request, instead go to Impsy and do the following quests I have linked. 
---
[Hot and Itchy](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8420)

---
Why not all 3? 
---
Seasons like D3/PoE for resetting realms. 
---
Burning crusade / wrath servers for those who nostalgia starts there. 
---
Live wow for the current story and progression there. New expansions continue untouched and costly. 
---
Classic+ with new 60 content on the servers that already exist. Merge a few together and offer free transfers for people that want to stay on perm classic realms.
---
Literally 2 weeks into the game and I have yet to sit in a queue, is this an echo chamber?
---
There's still an Eight Inches Unbuffed running around Atiesh. I think it makes even less sense that the bans are hit-and-miss for the same thing.
---
as long as they put the class changes to a vote or a poll, im fine with it, for example giving paladins taunt or buffing innervate for balance druids
---
Why not just leave the servers? I don't get too much time to play so I would actually like to be able to do MC/naxx before the next xpac drops or server is reset.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I vote for classic+. 
---
One thing they implemented in TBC was world pvp objectives, remember? You'd have to capture a node and hold them for a daily pvp quest? (It was like AB but in world pvp.
---
It was awesome, but flying mounts made it really broken. Almost no one did it because you would always have some 70 on a netherdrake drop in after you left and would take the point as soon as you capped it. 
---
I would LOVE to see a similar world pvp thing made for classic, but everyone is still level 60, and there are NO FLYING MOUNTS. 
---
You'd make a new mini zone for level 60s (add a new zeplin route) and that zone would be a constant running world pvp zone with specific objectives and repeatable world pvp quests. 
---
If they did something like that, I would never leave.
---
Uhhhh, this isnt just for Alliance. Undead warrior here and all I have to do it press shift+8 and those furry fuckers get a big ol moo from me. Haven't missed a Tauren yet!
---
regarding DPM, you clearly don't know what you're talking about because drain life is the single most mana-efficient damaging spell in the game by a large margin. you're a warlock, you have life tap. with improved life tap each point of health is 1.2 points of mana. with affliction talents, you gain 20% more healing from drain life, which already recovers its total mana cost over the course of the channel.
---
as far as your numbered points:
---
1. What's to stop you from wanding when interrupted, and still doing more dps than a voidwalker user because you have the succubus?
---
2. You can easily tank 2 mobs with drain life, and kill them both much faster than you would with a voidwalker. Meanwhile, the voidwalker user is either facetanking one anyway or his void is getting beat on by two targets (one of which is taking zero damage because vw threat is single target).
---
3. Seduction is not "a minor redeeming quality". It's as good or better against humanoids, and does not cost you a shard +10 seconds every time you use it. With healthstone, soulstone, and the extra dps/minor offtank capabilities of the succubus, what more do you actually need?
---
4. Fear + dots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voidwalker tanking elites. Letting your void tank an elite will run him out of either health or mana, or you'll pull aggro. At *very* least, you're taking significantly more time to kill them and probably health funneling as well. I don't know what difficulty there is fearing if you cast fear when they come back into range.
---
Classic + mixed with true classic IMO. I would love to see BC return (but changed perhaps) and some original expansions as well.
---
Most of the Lore can be learned ingame through books lying around for history and quest text for the present.
---
It's just amusing to me, especially considering that Blizzrd eventually did away with the ability to "ninja" BOE's altogether.
---
And then there's just the cognitive dissonance of selecting Need of ***greed*** because "well its a lot of money"
---
Just going off of what people who have raided with them have said mate :P
---
The cereal makes it!
---
Tell the mage to wait until you have threat or let them get run down by mobs. Save your taunt for when you don't have aggro, as it sets your threat to equal the highest member when you use it then forces them to aggro you for the duration.
---
I'm stealth too.  Mind sharing your talent tree? I'm a weird hybrid that isn't working well
---
I have to get that Mount bro lol nice!
---
Yes you are. Why would anyone equip a staff of Jordan on a non twink??
---
Moo?
---
i have always played with minimum add-ons typically i have a damage meter , dbm, titan panel and that is pretty much it. i never had any issue with the base UI
---
It's empty, everyone is in dungeons
---
I.. I should travel more..
---
How??? Did you spend all your money on the ah or something? Did you buy every skill regardless of if you needed it for leveling?
---
I honestly don’t understand how people ding 40 with less than 90g (yeah it’s 90, not 100).  You must have spent your money on something stupid while leveling surely.
---
Ehhhhh well. There's a dude on my realm who is undercutting *his own auctions* by *several gold* and listing several dozen runecloth bags for the maximum duration. That's a pretty wrong way to use the AH :p
---
When I hit 50 shaman I noticed the quest chain wasn't available for the Sunken Temple class quest.  Specifically, for my class, the first quest is called Elemental Mastery.  I saw some speculation that the start level may have changed and may be 52.  I'm 52 now, and still don't see it.
---
So, most important question: Do these quest chains exist in this patch?  And if they do, any idea what flag I missed?  I've completed all my other class quests, and haven't seen any feeder quest or anything that would lead me to the one I need.  
---
They offer some pretty nice rewards, and I'm at an appropriate level to jump in Sunken Temple anyway, so I would like to get started working on it.

YES! Classic+

Hands down

Yes, I like the M+ finder on BfA. I would be completely fine with that because it does exactly what you are describing.

Thank you so much man! I appreciate it

*Inner voice: "THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!"*

I didn't say it did. I'm currently playing with daggers as a Human Rogue because I prefer the playstyle. Combat Daggers for life.

I’m so glad we can share this because for some time I’ve felt very alone thinking this. It’s kind of sad to complain about having free time but I’m a huge fan of spending it wisely otherwise I’d rather be at working making extra bread.

Yes but it was made into what it is now in cata

Don't you people have phones?
---
It doesn't matter. They're gonna fuck it up regardless.

Fear ward is better but horde priests are fine without it. As long as you're not min maxing you're fine with rolling NE.

If you had any flight paths connected to Theramore it would make sense. 
---
I think the flight master doesn't want to send a flight over so juch uncharted territory for it would be too unsafe.
---
Oh stop complaining, I'm not AFK. There's just an intense part of my show going down right now and I don't want to miss it. I'll spam a couple frostbolts right at the end
